<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister will have noticed, I

reference  to  a  Bill intituled "An  Ordinance  to

authorise  a sum of one hundred million dollars  to

be  raised  in  Singapore  by  way  of  loan".  The

Certificate  has  not  added  the  words  "for  the

purposes  of the Development Fund". Therefore,  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

every human society in any country, there are  good

as  well  as  bad elements. Similarly, among  trade

unions,  Sir, we also believe that there  are  good

and bad unions. Therefore, we in the Opposition are

of the same mind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



as   the  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  in   the

desirability  of  eliminating  trade  unions  which

confuse  the minds of the workers and give rise  to

unnecessary trouble. But, Sir, in trying to  uproot

the bad unions, it may happen inadvertently that  a

few  good ones are also uprooted and therefore,  in

the interest of justice, it is desirable that these

aggrieved  trade unions, if they so desire,  should

have  a chance to appeal against decisions made  by

the  Minister - I stress again, inadvertently perhaps

or without the full knowledge of the circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the Minister himself will be

the  first  to  admit that being human  he  is  not

infallible, and therefore the request is that there

be a means provided so that instead of the decision

being final, the aggrieved trade union, which still

believes that it should be allowed to exist, should

be  allowed to make its appeal to a court  of  law.

Sir, I do not believe that this is the view of  the

Government:  but  one  of  the  Members   did   say

yesterday  that,  by  means of this  Bill,  certain

trade  unions  which  support an  opposition  party

might   have   their  registrations  cancelled   or

withdrawn.  I  hope,  Sir, this  is  not  the  real

intention of Government, because if that is so then

I  think the main purpose is lost and people  would

be  thinking  along lines of politics  rather  than

along lines of what is just for the different trade

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like at least to read out from the

booklet  issued  by  the  People's  Action   Party,

entitled  "The  Tasks  Ahead",  Part  2,  page  25,

paragraph 3, the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But at the same time we must all remember that

if  we  seek  industrial justice with a  vengeance,

there  will be no industrial peace. And  a  chronic

state  of  industrial  unrest  means  wrecking  the

economy. We must take into account the interests of

the workers and of the whole population. For if our

economy  is  damaged,  the  whole  population  will

suffer."



<br><br>Sir,  I  am glad that the "Chief" Minister speaking

here  could  see  the whole problem from  different

angles, and he could see that, in the interests  of

Singapore and the economy of Singapore, there  must

be  a  balance  somewhere. And I  believe  that  in

strengthening-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not seem to recollect

that a Chief Minister is now in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it happened

that   this   was   a  speech  delivered   by   the

Chief - sorry - Prime Minister. Sir, there is sometimes

the tendency, in a capitalist regime, for employers

to  have  their way all the time. But the  pendulum

has  swung  away from that; there is the danger  of

the    pendulum    swinging   to    the    opposite

extreme - where, the trade unionists feel  that  they

are the bosses, and the employers are the employed.

Therefore,  the strengthening of the  trade  unions

must  not  be to gain the just rights of the  trade

unionists  and  also to be the new  boss  over  the

employers.  Now, that, Sir, would be  bad  for  our

economy.  As  we  know, many of the employers  have

already  transferred part of their capital  to  the

Federation, and we read in the papers recently that

the  Federation  is having a boom  because  of  the

confidence  that the economy and the  stability  of

the  Federation  have inspired in  some  investors.

Sir,  we  desire  that part of that capital  should

come  back,  and  we can only see  that  happen  by

giving investors the assurance that whereas  it  is

the  intention  of the Government  to  protect  the

rights of the workers, it is not their intention to

intimidate  the bosses. I feel, Sir, that  in  that

light, we may be able then to produce conditions in

Singapore  to enable the prosperity of the  country

to  be  shared  all round among the  workers.  Sir,

subject  to  these qualifications, we  support  the

Bill.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  fully support the  Trade  Unions

(Amendment)  Bill.  I believe  that  everyone  will

agree with me on this. Society is always improving,

especially  now  that we have come to  this  stage.

Therefore, the things that were done before are not

suitable  for the present society. The  Member  for

Cairnhill  has pointed out that in 1941  the  Trade

Unions Ordinance was introduced. This is just  like

a  car  of  more  than ten years  old.  It  is  not

suitable for present use at all. Therefore, we have

to improve it. In these few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



years, the old Ordinance has produced many

tragedies, and we hope that these tragedies will

not recur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About capital, we have to make amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, some Members mentioned a secret

ballot.  That is not the basic remedy. Principally,

the object of amending this Ordinance is to improve

the situation. This Ordinance is of old age, and  I

wonder  why the previous Government had not altered

or  amended  it. They had allowed the formation  of

splinter and yellow trade unions for the purpose of

looking   after  their  colleagues.  The   previous

Government had not properly amended this Ordinance.

But today we are supported by the people and we are

responsible  to  them to amend the  errors  of  the

Ordinance.  Yesterday, the Member for  Farrer  Park

pointed out that the Ordinance should be in  accord

with the British Trade Union Act. I would point out

that  in  any  country  when  they  are  going   to

introduce  a  Bill,  they  have  to  consider   the

circumstances  prevailing in the  society  in  that

country.  For  this  reason,  we  must  amend  this

Ordinance in the proper way. And then it will  suit

the  people.  If the Members opposite were  not  so

obstinate, they would not be so lonely as they  are

now. This is a lesson to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Cairnhill pointed out

that he agreed in principle with the amending Bill,

but he did not agree with clause 5. I feel that  is

not right. At present what we want to look after is

our  nation. For this reason we must work  for  the

future  of  our country and do everything properly.

Our  friends opposite us have continually said they

are not opposing us, but actually they are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said are facts. We have to do things

in  a  very practical way, for the welfare  of  our

country and for the future. Only in this way can we

achieve a merger with the Federation of Malaya, and

also maintain good relations between the people  of

Singapore and the people of Malaya. This is my  own

opinion, and I fully support this amending Bill.

<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  Bill which is before the House  now  is

long overdue, and the sooner it is implemented, the

happier it would be for the workers and trade union

leaders  in Singapore. The existence of yellow  and

splinter  unions  is  not only detrimental  to  the

interests of workers, but it is also detrimental to

the interests of the country. This Bill is designed

to   correct  past  mistakes  and  to  assist   and

strengthen  the  trade  union  movement   in   this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has progressed politically, and it is

only  proper  that the trade union movement  should

also  progress  with it. In the past,  trade  union

leaders  have always been warned to keep away  from

politics.  But  genuine trade union  leaders,  from

their  own experience, know that sometime or  other

they  have  to  seek the support of politicians  to

achieve  results. Those leaders who do not  believe

that  politics  is  part of trade unionism  usually

perish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the role of the union leaders was

confined to protecting and improving the welfare of

its  members.  But  with the  attainment  of  self-government in Singapore, union leaders have a  more

important role to play. They not only have to  look

after  the interests of its members, but they  also

have to look after the interests of the country  as

a whole. It has been said and feared that this Bill

may  be used to close rival organisations which  do

not   share  the  same  political  beliefs  as  the

Government.  These fears are completely  groundless

because the members can still join existing unions,

and if their leaders can muster sufficient support,

they  will  eventually take over the leadership  of

the  unions. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I can say that

the  sooner  this Bill is implemented, the  quicker

can   the  workers  and  trade  union  leaders   in

Singapore  look  forward to a period  of  hope  and

promises.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we have already heard my  colleagues

discuss the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill. All of us know  that

in  a  country, the most important people  are  the

labourers  and  workers. We have many  workers  and

labourers  to develop the country. Therefore,  they

can form strong and powerful trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I heard the Member for Cairnhill say

that  when the Ordinance was introduced in 1941  in

Singapore, it was under a colonial regime and under

a   colonial  Government.  They  were  not   paying

attention   to   democracy.  But   we   must   have

consolidation and have a strong Government. We  can

see  that if only a few people form a trade  union - like  a  shop  with  only  ten  or  more  than  ten

people - how  can they represent the welfare  of  the

workers?  In  this case, that union  cannot  really

represent  the  welfare of the workers.  Therefore,

these  few  people  can have connections  with  the

employers and achieve their own ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are before us. Under the Rendel

Constitution, the old Government formed many yellow

unions.  Yesterday our Minister for Labour and  Law

said  that  strikes had occurred in the past.  They

formed  many  unions during that period,  and  many

opportunists  and  politicians made  use  of  these

unions to further their own interest. They used  to

suppress  and weaken the strength of the employees.

You  can see an example of the Hock Lee bus strike.

This shows that they had close connections with the

colonial Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before the P.A.P. Government came into power, our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,

had  said  that  when we came into power  we  would

amend  this Ordinance. For the welfare and interest

of  our workers, we have to do it. Under the Rendel

Constitution, the former Government had connections

with  the colonial Government. Therefore,  I  fully

support the amendment.



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, if we follow the developments

of  the trade union movement in Singapore, we will,

without  hesitation,  come  to  the  conclusion  of

unanimous support for this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are debating this Bill for the second day. In

principle,  I  see  that although  some  Opposition

Members have expressed support for the Bill,  there

are  others whose support is conditional.  I  think

they  are  fully conscious that they are forced  to

support  this  Bill for the reason  that  they  are

fully  aware  that, if they choose  to  ignore  the

interest  of  the labour movement, then  after  the

next  five years they will find that they will have

to  vacate this Assembly. This neglect on the  part

of  the  past Government in not looking  after  the

interest and welfare of the labour movement can  be

seen  in  the fact that they now represent  only  a

minority in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say this to the Member for Farrer Park

who  has  stated that he is not an  expert  on  the

labour movement, although he has shown that  he  is

quite  an  expert on the labour law in  England.  I

wish  to  point  out to him that Singapore  is  not

England. The way the workers in Singapore  live  is

not  the  same as that of the workers  in  England.

Therefore,   there  is  no  necessity  to   compare

Singapore with England. What is good in England may

not  be  necessarily be good in  Singapore.  It  is

possible that what is good in Singapore may not  be

good   in  England.  This  fact  should  have   the

attention  of  Members. We  are  heading  for  full

independence,  and  we  must  be  ready   to   take

responsibilities and stand on our own feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands has advised

the Minister for Labour and Law to exercise care so

that  the  labour movement will not be involved  in

politics.  I  wonder, because, if one  follows  the

labour  movement or political developments closely,

I think the one cannot be separated from the other.

I think the labour movement must be closely related

to political developments because, if any action by

the  labour movement fails, then they will have  no

alternative   but   to  fight   through   political

channels. On top of that, we should realise that 90

per  cent of the people of Singapore today comprise

the  working  class  who  are  fighting  for  their

destiny and for a common aim and interest; that is,

for the establishment of social justice based



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



on common interest. The working class must struggle

together. If their struggle fails, then it is clear

that    they    must   fight   through    political

organisations because the labour movement which has

been  suppressed  by  the employers  will  have  to

depend  on a democratic Government who can  protect

and  safeguard  their rights. This  is  the  labour

movement's  connection with politics.  But  if  the

Government is represented by the capitalist  class,

then  they  cannot  look  after  or  maintain   the

interest of the working class as a whole.  This  is

proved   by  what  has  happened  to  the  previous

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remember the instance quoted by the Member for

the  Southern Islands, that the Minister for Labour

and  Law  should  be  careful in implementing  this

Bill.    The   Member   has   advised   that    the

implementation   of  this  Bill   should   not   be

influenced  by political motives. But I think  this

will  not happen because we have received a mandate

from the people, and we will uphold that mandate as

a basis for the struggle of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the Malay union in the Harbour Board

which  was mentioned by the Member for the Southern

Islands,  I  wish to explain that if  in  a  labour

movement there exist a Malay trade union, an Indian

trade  union and a Chinese trade union, and so  on,

then  Singapore will be faced with a split  in  the

labour  movement,  and  it  is  obvious  that   the

employers  will  exploit the  situation  to  create

dissension amongst the various races. For instance,

if the Chinese workers are on strike, the employers

will  make  use of the Malays, and vice versa.  The

Malay trade union in the Harbour Board, I know,  is

not representative of the Malay workers there. That

union can be said to represent only tens of workers

out of hundreds of Malay workers who are members of

the Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association. From

the  point  of  view  of the labour  movement,  the

establishment  of splinter or yellow  unions  which

are  nurtured by employers will consequently result

in  the labour struggle in Singapore facing a  dark

future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I very much regret the fears expressed by the

Opposition   Members  in  this  Assembly   at   the

possibility that this Ministry will in future  wipe

out  the small or yellow trade unions. It seems  as

though  such unions have connections with those  in

this  House who have expressed fears. As the  Malay

proverb, literally translated, says, if it  is  not

because  of the padi that is ripening, the  weaver-bird  will not bother to build its nest on  a  low-hanging  branch.  I am not accusing  directly,  but

possibly  the  sentiments expressed could  be  said

clearly to show that there is a connection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is just to look after the development of a

healthy  trade  union movement,  then  we  have  no

hesitation in passing this Bill and moving  towards

a  more  just  society  on this  island.  With  the

passing of this Bill, we hope that the trade unions

and  the  labour  movement on  the  whole  will  be

heading towards a healthy state of affairs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, yesterday my colleagues took quite a long time

to  elaborate  with facts and figures how  splinter

and yellow unions were formed, how they are used to

frustrate  the  workers'  movement,  and  how  this

affects  the workers' interests. We know that  this

should  have happened under the previous Government

because  it  was  a  government  representing   the

colonial and vested interests. It did not  like  to

see  a  strong trade union movement in the country.

In  order to protect the colonial vested interests,

the  Government  not  only had  to  preserve  those

oppressive  rules and laws, but also indirectly  to

participate in activities detrimental to the  trade

union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that era has passed and we have now come into a new one. To achieve the object which we

enunciated during our election campaign - to maintain

industrial peace with justice - we must see that  the

workers  must  be in a strong bargaining  position,

otherwise   they  will  always  be  oppressed   and

exploited by the employers. Therefore, Mr Speaker,

since the previous Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



had  infected  the  trade union movement  with  the

cancer  of  yellow unionism, it is up to  this  new

Government to wipe out the disease, otherwise,  the

trade union movement will be killed by it. In order

to  achieve that object, the Government has decided

to amend the present Trade Unions Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Opposition knows very well that

there  is  no ground for opposing us, and the  more

they talk against this movement, the more will they

expose  themselves. They agree in principle to  the

amending of the Ordinance but object to one  clause

which says that appeals shall be dealt with by  the

Minister.  Mr  Speaker,  when  the  Minister   for

Finance  introduced the Finance Bill or  the  Audit

Bill,  the  Opposition  immediately  jumped  up  to

oppose  the powers sought to be given to an elected

Minister. We know that the Members opposite were in

the  past used to bestowing powers on colonial  and

expatriate  officers but now they  hate  to  bestow

powers on an elected government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than on the powers for the Minister, the

Opposition  cannot criticise us - it  has  no  valid

criticism to make on the amending Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have - listened to

the  representations against clause 5 of  the  Bill

and  I  must  say,  Mr Speaker,  I  am  completely

unmoved. This clause provides that the decision  of

the  Minister  on an appeal under  section  16  the

Ordinance is to be final and not to be called  into

question  in  any  court. I have already  told  the

House  that it will be the object of this  Bill  to

reduce  the  number  of unions to  more  reasonable

proportions,  bearing in mind that at  the  present

time there are less than 30 per cent of the working

population  organised in unions and  there  are  as

many  as  226 unions to cater for this  very  small

proportion of the total working population. It will

be  necessary,  therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  for  the

Registrar to use his discretion extensively if some

order is to be brought out of the present chaos. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



have  already said that the new power of cancelling

the  registration of yellow or splinter  unions  is

one  that  can  only be properly  exercised  by  an

executive body. And I repeat the statement which  I

made earlier - that the machinery of the court is, in

the opinion of the Government, quite unsuitable  to

deal  with  such matters, which hinge  so  much  on

questions of policy and executive discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if order is to come out of the

present chaos, it is necessary, I would say  vital,

that  we  should have the means to deal  adequately

with  the present situation. It is, therefore,  our

purpose in proposing the amendments to clause 17 of

the  Ordinance to shut out appeals which are  bound

to be of a "wanton and niggardly" character, to use

the words of the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to point out here that the

Government  has  not  proposed  any  amendment   to

subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of section 15  of

the  Ordinance  which lay down the procedure  which

the  Registrar is to follow when deciding to cancel

or  withdraw the registration of a union.  We  have

left  these  provisions  of  section  15  untouched

because   we   want   the  procedure   of   notice,

opportunity to show cause and adequate inquiry,  to

be  followed before the Registrar makes up his mind

one way or the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stated - in his speech at Geylang Serai - that the cancellation of registration

of  yellow unions and splinter unions will only  be

made  after  due  investigation  to  establish  the

truth,  or after secret ballot has shown  that  the

majority of workers support or oppose, as the  case

may  be, a union in their sector of employment. And

this  assurance  has  also been  written  into  the

chapter  on  trade  unions in the  P.A.P.'s  policy

statement  entitled, "The Tasks Ahead",  which  has

become the bible for the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park

expressed  great  surprise that the  Government  is

attempting  to shut out appeals to the  High  Court

when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



trade  union enactment in the United Kingdom, which

forms   the  model  for  our  local  Trade   Unions

Ordinance, provided for such appeals. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to remind the Member for Farrer

Park, and I think he needs constant reminding about

this, that conditions in the United Kingdom are not

the  conditions we find here. There is a very  much

larger   proportion   of  the  working   population

organised in trade unions in the United Kingdom and

there is not to be found there the multiplicity  of

tiny  unions  that  we find in Singapore,  so  that

precedents   in   the  United   Kingdom   are   not

necessarily good precedents for local conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already pointed out that

I  have  been advised that the form of words  which

are used in our proposed amendment to section 17 of

the  Ordinance  does not preclude recourse  to  the

High  Court in certiorari proceedings. Quite  apart

from  the  right of appeal which may be  denied  by

statute  or by an Ordinance, I am advised that  the

High Court has, in its prerogative jurisdiction, an

inherent right to supervise and review the acts  of

persons  and  of subordinate bodies which  exercise

quasi  judicial functions. Where it  can  be  shown

that  a person or subordinate authority has refused

to  exercise  or  has  improperly  exercised  these

functions  under circumstances which  amount  to  a

denial  of natural justice, recourse can always  be

had to the High Court in certiorari proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have already pointed out just now, it is not the intention of the Government to

interfere  with the existing procedural  provisions

of  the  Ordinance  leading to  the  withdrawal  or

cancellation  of  the registration  of  unions,  as

these   provisions  clearly  provide  for  adequate

notice,  for an opportunity to show cause  and  for

the  holding of art inquiry before an order can  be

made  by the Registrar. To shut out the prerogative

jurisdiction of the High Court in such matters,  it

must  be shown, I am advised, that the acts of  the

Registrar  or  that of the Minister on  appeal  are

purely ministerial in character.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the present

procedural  provisions  of section  15,  which  the

Government   has  left  untouched,  it   would   be

difficult  to  argue such a case  before  the  High

Court.  I  hope, Sir, that this clarification  will

set at rest the disquiet, whether real or not, I am

not sure, which the Government's proposed amendment

to  clause 17 of the Bill has caused to the Members

for Cairnhill and Farrer Park.

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

seek clarification from the Minister. In clause  2,

the  proposed  section 10 (b) of the  Trade  Unions

Ordinance reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the objects, rules and constitution of the

union   do  not  conflict  with  any   of   such

provisions and are not unlawful;".



<br><br>It  is  only when the objects of a trade union  are

not  unlawful  that the Registrar may register  the

trade  union  in the prescribed form.  I  therefore

seek  clarification  as  to  the  meaning  of   the

proviso.  If the objects are unlawful,  surely  the

Registrar  is not going to register the union,  and

then   later  on,  just  because  he  has   wrongly

registered a trade union, the proviso is put in  to

say  that  if  the  union's objects  are  unlawful,

therefore the registration shall be void.  Does  it

mean  that  the Registrar may commit a  mistake  in

registering  a  trade union when  its  objects  are

unlawful, or has he the power to register  a  trade

union  when  the  objects are apparent  to  him  as

unlawful?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the words used in

the proposed section 10 (b) read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the objects, rules and constitution of the

union   do  not  conflict  with  any   of   such

provisions and are not unlawful;".



<br><br>The  proviso  in  section 10 of  the  Trade  Unions

Ordinance reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that if any one of the objects of such

trade  union is unlawful, the registration  of  the

trade union shall be void."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one case, there is a conflict with the

provisions of the Ordinance and, in the other case,

with the objects of the union itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -

the principle of the clause?

proviso.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I still cannot understand.

If  its  objects are unlawful, a trade union cannot

therefore  be  registered. The Registrar  does  not

register  a trade union whose objects are  unlawful

and   then,   in  order  to  protect   that   wrong

registration,  the proviso is inserted.  Surely  if

the  objects  are  found at a later  stage  by  the

Registrar  to  be unlawful, the Registrar  has  the

power  to cancel the registration. That proviso  is

very confusing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

for   Cairnhill   has   not   directed   his   mind

sufficiently  to the words of the proposed  section

10 (b) which read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Registrar, if he is satisfied -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the objects, rules and constitution of

the union do not conflict with any of such

provisions and are not unlawful;".



<br><br>"such provisions" relate to the provisions of  this

Ordinance  and of the regulations made  thereunder.

[Interruption.] Oh, yes, it is so and the Registrar

has got to be satisfied when he registers the trade

union in the prescribed manner:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that if any one of the objects of such

trade  union is unlawful, the registration  of  the

trade union shall be void."



<br><br>A  trade  union  may  have objects  which  are  not

unlawful although they may be in conflict with  the

provisions of this Ordinance and of the regulations

made thereunder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Still on clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would appear

from  the draft of the new section 10, Mr Speaker,

that the proviso to the existing section 10 of  the

Ordinance is in conflict with the proposed  section

10  (b). If it is in conflict, there seems to be no

purpose in having the proviso there, and it  should

be  deleted.  Now  the proviso, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that if any one of the objects `of such

trade union is unlawful...".



<br><br>The  proviso  merely deals with  unlawful  objects.

Now, the proposed section 10 (b) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Registrar, if he is satisfied -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the object... are not unlawful;".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



The proviso also talks of unlawful objects. Section

10  (b) also says that if the objects of the  trade

union proposed to be registered are unlawful,  then

the Registrar shall deny registration. How then, if

the  Registrar  has complied with section  10  (b),

does the need for the proviso arise?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we cannot proceed

any  further on these lines. If hon. Members on the

given, the question would have been proposed on the

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency's  recommendation to  proceed  with  the

Bill, and I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to enable the

Government to raise in Singapore by way of a loan a

sum  not exceeding $100 million to finance in  part

the   cost   of   projects  under  the  Development

Estimates.  On  1st  October  this  year,  the  $25

million  Straits Settlements 1940 3% War Loan  will

be  due for redemption. There is ample provision in

the  Sinking Fund for this loan to repay the  whole

of it. But it is thought advantageous to be able to

make an offer to owners of the stock for conversion

to a loan which will be floated at about this time.

The  terms of such a loan are being worked out, and

if  this Bill is approved, it will be announced  in

the course of the next few weeks. The amount of the

loan intended to be floated will, however, only  be

part of the $100 million. The sanction given by the

Bill,  however, will enable the Treasury from  time

to  time to take account of the financial resources

likely to be available for loan floatation, and  to

raise  loans  whenever local market conditions  are

favourable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of the Bill follows closely legislation

which  is  in force in the Federation,  with  minor

modifications to suit the conditions in  Singapore.

The  substance of the Bill is in Part  II  thereof.

Clause  3  enables  loans to be  raised  which,  by

clause  4,  will  be charged upon the  Consolidated

Fund.  The  proceeds  realised  will  be  used  for

development  purposes only, and will be  paid  into

the  Development  Fund which  will  be  constituted

under the new Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Parts III and IV of the Bill

are  purely  procedural  and,  I  think,  need   no

explanation from me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V contains a provision which is new and will

enable  moneys  looking  for  sources  from   local

investment  to  be  absorbed by the  Government  in

deposits made in anticipation of the next  loan  to

be issued by the Government.

appoint a Commission, to be presided over by a High

Court  Judge, with powers to call upon any Minister

and the Members of the staff of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  to  give  evidence,  or  to  cause  such  a

Commission  to  be appointed, for  the  purpose  of

ascertaining the circumstances in which the  appeal

of  U.M.N.O. for  the release of Muslim  prisoners

sentenced in connection with the riots of  December

1950  was  rejected, and to report  as  to  whether

there has been unconstitutional conduct on the part

of any and, if so, which Minister of Government and

whether  any  Minister  has made  any  misleading

statement  to  the  Press in  connection  with  the

rejection, and to make recommendations accordingly,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before I go into the reasons in detail as to why I and my colleagues are moving

this  motion, it is imperative for me to warn  this

Assembly  that this motion is moved not because  of

sentiment  or with the object of inciting  communal

feelings,  but because U.M.N.O. is of  the  opinion

that the Constitution of the State of Singapore  at

the moment is in danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Singapore Constitution was promulgated by

U.M.N.O. together  with other  political  parties,

including  the People's Action Party. Mr  Speaker,

because we promulgated this Constitution, it is our

responsibility,  therefore, to protect  and  uphold

it.   If  we  from  U.M.N.O. do  not  defend  this

Constitution  which  we ourselves  promulgated,  it

means that we have gone against it and also against

the people of Singapore. Likewise, Mr Speaker, the

People's Action Party. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



the   P.A.P. refuses  to  uphold  or  defend   the

Constitution  which  the P.A.P. itself  helped  to

promulgate  with  us, it means  that  it  has  gone

against   the   Constitution,  and,   consequently,

against the interest of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem before us today concerns the position

of  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara as contained in  the

Constitution  of  Singapore. As  we  know,  in  the

Constitution,  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  must  be

nominated by the Queen from among persons  born  in

Singapore  or in the Federation of Malaya,  and  he

must  be above politics. The Yang di-Pertuan Negara

can be said to exercise no function other than that

of  clemency,  as contained in the Constitution  of

Singapore, Part II, Article No. 9 (i) and (ii). The

functions  given to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  are

mentioned in Government Gazette Supplement  No.  32

dated  10th April, 1959, Chapter 2, subsection  (a)

(ii),  which  also stated that the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  has  full  powers  for  clemency  and   the

granting  of  appeals.  This  clearly  shows,   Mr

Speaker, that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara can take a

decision   himself  on  the  question  of  granting

pardons to people who have been sentenced, and that

he  can seek advice from anybody else he wishes to.

But  the most important thing is that the Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara  himself  can  take  a   decision.

Therefore  that decision should be the decision  of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara himself  and  not  the

decision  of  the  Cabinet or the decision  of  any

other Minister. The Cabinet cannot put presure upon

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  to  take  a  decision

concerning the question of granting a pardon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.M.N.O. of Singapore, Mr Speaker, is not

satisfied  with  what  has  occurred  because   the

Government has, in our opinion, gone out of its way

and  acted  beyond  the powers of the  Constitution

which will result in unfair government. Any conduct

outside the scope of the Constitution is dangerous.

The  danger is not only to the Government but  also

to all the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is a

foreigner, and his mistake



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



can  be  an  example to the future Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  one who will be appointed from  among  the

people of this country. U.M.N.O. does not want this

mistake  to  be repeated again in future.  In  this

matter  we do not know whether or not the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara deliberately collaborated with  the

Government in power.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member knows

Standing Order 31 (8) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The conduct of Her Majesty, Members of the Royal

Family  or the Yang di-Pertuan Negara shall not  be

referred to in any circumstances,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think the hon. Member is treading on

very  thin ice when he queries the conduct  of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara in this matter. I think  he

should   confine   himself  to  the  constitutional

position and nothing more.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

actually  I  only  wish to draw  attention  to  the

position  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I  am  not

accusing or making any allegation against him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, U.M.N.O. wishes to point out to this House where and how the inadvertency has arisen. In

1950,  a  riot  occurred. This was  the  result  of

dissatisfaction   with  the  judgment   which   was

considered by the people of Singapore to be not  in

the  spirit  of justice and fair play. Five  people

were sentenced to death. U.M.N.O. at that time came

forward  to  defend  these five persons,  with  the

result  that  the death sentences were commuted  to

life   sentences.  In  1956,  U.M.N.O. again  came

forward  and  appealed to the  then  Governor,  Sir

Robert  Black,  to reduce the sentences.  This  was

successful. In this connection, I am pleased to say

that at that time, as head of U.M.N.O., I played  a

leading  role  in the whole affair. Therefore,  Mr

Speaker,  up  to today the five people referred  to

just  now  have served their sentences  for  almost

nine  years. Therefore, with the birth of  the  new

nation  of  Singapore, with a new  outlook,  a  new

atmosphere  and with promise and hopes - all  new  to

the  people  of  Singapore - U.M.N.O. has  taken  the

opportunity to appeal to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

for  the  balance  of  the sentence  period  to  be

abolished.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 5th of June, 1959, U.M.N.O. wrote a letter

to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I would like to read

it  so  that this House will know what it is about.

It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To His Excellency, Sir William Goode, Yang di-Pertuan Negara, Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Excellency,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been directed by members of the Emergency

Committee of U.M.N.O., Singapore, to appeal to  you

to grant a pardon to the five Muslim prisoners, who

are  still serving sentences of death in connection

with the Nadra riots in December, 1950. Members  of

this   committee  are  of  the  opinion   that   to

commemorate  the  birth  of  the  new   nation   of

Singapore, this will be a blessing to the people of

Singapore who are the followers of Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanking you,

<br><br><div align="right">

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sgd.) Abdul Hamid Allwie,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman of the Emergency

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee, U.M.N.O.,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore."</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 6th, following upon the letter, U.M.N.O.,

Singapore,  received  a  letter  from  the   Acting

Private  Secretary  of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,

addressed  to  the  Chairman,  Inche  Abdul   Hamid

Allwie, of the Emergency Committee, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am directed by His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to bring to your attention your

letter,  ref.  P.E.N./1/59, dated 5th  June,  1959,

appealing to His Excellency for the release of  the

five  Muslim  prisoners, who  are  at  the  present

moment still serving in Changi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your information, the matter is still under

consideration  and a reply will be  made  known  to

you."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we, the Committee and members of U.M.N.O.-were full of hopes that our appeal would

be    considered    justly   and    given    proper

consideration. But, unfortunately, suddenly on  the

8th  of  July this year, U.M.N.O. received a letter

from the Ministry of Labour and Law, signed by  the

State Advocate-General and addressed to Inche Abdul

Hamid Allwie. It reads:



"Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am directed by the Minister for Labour and Law

to  refer  to your letter Ref. P.E.N./ 1/59,  dated

the  5th  June,  1959, addressed to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, and to state that the Minister  has

given  full  consideration  to  your  request,  but

regrets  that he is unable to advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to grant any further clemency to the

Muslim prisoners referred to in your letter."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is no necessity for me to explain how dejected members of U.M.N.O. and people

of the Muslim faith in Singapore felt on receipt of

this  letter.  It  appears that  the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law  had  arrogated  to  himself   the

functions and powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

Therefore,  it would appear that the  Minister  had

committed an act which was in contravention of  and

against   the   spirit  of  the   Constitution   of

Singapore.   U.M.N.O.'s  letter   of   appeal   was

addressed  to  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for  his

consideration  and decision; but according  to  the

letter from the State Advocate-General (or from the

Minister  himself), it shows that the Minister  for

Labour and Law had considered U.M.N.O.'s appeal and

that  he  himself had taken the decision to  reject

U.M.N.O.'s  appeal. As explained in his letter,  he

was unable to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to

grant  a pardon to the five prisoners mentioned  in

the  letter.  So  the conduct of the  Minister  for

Labour  and Law is one example of an act  which  is

outside  the  scope  of the Constitution.  We  from

U.M.N.O.,  Mr Speaker, oppose it strongly  because

U.M.N.O. does not want to collaborate with  and  be

an   accomplice   in  such  conduct   towards   the

Constitution  of  Singapore  and  the   people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on the 30th July, there was a statement

issued  in  the Straits Times made in English.  The

statement came from the Ministry of Labour and Law.

The  Minister for Labour and Law said that  he  did

not  make  any kind of decision, that the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara himself had taken the decision,  and

that   the  decision  was  relayed  to  the  person

concerned   through  his  Ministry.  The   Minister

further  stated that the letter of appeal was  sent

to  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara; that the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  had asked for the  advice  of  the

Cabinet; the Cabinet had advised him in the matter;

and the Yang di-Pertuan Negara had decided that the

grant  of  appeal  could  not  be  considered.  The

decision of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara was  relayed

through  the  Ministry of Labour and  Law,  because

this   Ministry  is  responsible  in  matters  that

concern laws, and is under the instructions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Labour and Law. Therefore, the  State

Advocate-General had communicated the  decision  to

the person concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the statement from the Minister for

Labour  and  Law. In his statement there  were  two

points which are misleading. One, that the Minister

stated  that he had not taken the decision himself.

The decision was made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

and this decision was conveyed through the Minister

for  Labour  and  Law. Now, Mr Speaker,  which  is

true? Is it the letter from the Minister for Labour

and  Law,  or  is it the statement  issued  in  the

Press?  This  we  do  not know.  According  to  the

letter,  it  is clear here that it is the  Ministry

which  considered the appeal and that the  Ministry

itself  was  unable to advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the Press it is stated that the decision

was  taken by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Secondly,

the   newspapers  quoted  the  statement  from  the

Ministry  of Labour and Law to the effect that  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara had asked for  advice  from

the Cabinet and the Cabinet had advised the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara. But in the letter of the  Minister

for Labour and Law, it states that the Minister for

Labour himself considered U.M.N.O.'s appeal and the

Minister  himself had advised the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.  But  in the newspapers, the  Minister  for

Labour  stated  that the person who considered  the

matter  and who advised the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

was the Cabinet. Therefore, which is correct? Is it

the  letter  or is it the statement issued  by  the

Minister  for  Labour and Law? This is  a  question

that  needs  to be answered. It further shows  that

the  statement of the Minister quoted in the  Press

and the letter from the Minister for Labour and Law

contradicted  each other. If the statement  in  the

Straits  Times  is  correct,  then  the  letter  is

incorrect. If the letter is correct, then  it  means

that  the  Minister for Labour and Law  has  proved

that he had arrogated to himself the powers of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara. And  if  this  letter  is

correct and the statement is therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



wrong,  then it means that the Minister for  Labour

and   Law   had  issued  a  statement   which   was

irresponsible and false.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, on this matter there are

many questions which we and U.M.N.O. would like  to

ask  the Government. Did the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

ask  for  the  advice of the Cabinet? That  is  the

first  question. The second question  is:  Did  the

Cabinet  convey their advice to the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara?  The  third question is: Did the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara convey his decision to the Minister

for  Labour  and  Law in reply to the  letter  from

U.M.N.O.? The fourth question is, and this is  most

important:  Why did the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  not

reply direct to U.M.N.O., as he had done so on  the

5th of June, 1959? The fifth question is: Why is it

that the Minister for Labour and Law, in his letter

addressed  to U.M.N.O., failed to mention  that  he

had  received instructions from the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara?  On  the  other hand,  it  was  the  State

Advocate-General  who  conveyed  to  U.M.N.O. the

decision  of the Ministry of Labour and Law,  as  I

explained just now. The sixth question is: Was  the

advice  of  the  Minister for Labour  and  Law,  as

contained  in  the  letter  to  U.M.N.O.,  in  fact

conveyed   to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara?   And

finally,  question number seven: Did the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  himself  make  the  decision,   as

contained  in  the  statement of the  Minister  for

Labour  in the Straits Times? Was it the result  of

the advice of the Cabinet, or from the Minister for

Labour and Law himself?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.M.N.O. is of the opinion that this question of

appeal  had  failed  to  receive  proper  and  just

consideration  from the Government  in  power,  and

that in this matter the powers and responsibilities

of  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara had been polluted by

the political party in power in Singapore. The Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara of the Government  of  Singapore

has created a precedent which is against the spirit

and principle of the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I appeal to all the Members of the Assembly, in the interest of the Constitution of

the  State  of  Singapore  and  of  the  people  of

Singapore, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



see  that  the people's ambition of fair  play  and

justice  is achieved. As Members of this House  and

representatives of the people of Singapore,  it  is

our  responsibility to accept U.M.N.O.'s  challenge

to  appoint a Commission of Inquiry to consider the

merits and demerits, the wrongs and the rights,  of

this case so that if we had gone astray at the  end

of  the road, we should go back to the beginning of

the  road  in  order  that we  may  not  go  astray

altogether.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the  motion moved by my colleague just now, because

this is the responsibility given by U.M.N.O. to its

representatives in this Assembly - to  bring  to  the

notice  of  this  House matters which  have  caused

dissatisfaction   particularly  to   U.M.N.O. and

generally to those people in Singapore who  embrace

Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, if we turn back to the incidents

in  1950,  we will naturally come to the conclusion

that  these  incidents  will  not  occur  again  in

Singapore.  For that reason, U.M.N.O. has  thought

over this matter and appealed to the Government  in

power to rectify the mistakes which have been  made

by  a  certain group and the confusion  which  they

have  caused.  I  said  earlier  that  this  matter

concerns  the  release of the  prisoners  on  whose

behalf  U.M.N.O. made an appeal to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara to grant a pardon in the hope  that

the  wound which was caused in 1950 will be  healed

now that Singapore is a self-governing State with a

Constitution  which  has the  support  of  all  the

people.  But  as  the  Malay saying  goes:  if  the

prisoners are suffering, it does not mean that  the

wounds have been healed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I hate interrupting this debate, but

I must keep the debate in the proper channel, and I

must  ask the hon. Member not to go into the merits

of  the  petition for the release of the prisoners.

The    debate   is   merely   concerned   with    a

constitutional point and I have to inform the  hon.

Member and all other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



hon.  Members of this House that I will  insist  on

that line alone being taken, and that is, debate on

the constitutional point only.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

merely wish to bring to the attention of this House

how  great  is  the responsibility on the  question

which we must consider, but because of your ruling,

Mr  Speaker, I will refrain from commenting on the

incidents which had occurred. I will speak directly

on  the motion brought by U.M.N.O. for a Commission

of  Inquiry  to  be appointed for  the  purpose  of

ascertaining the circumstances of the case  and  to

give  its  opinion as to which side  is  right  and

which is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been explained earlier by my colleague,

the  exchange  of  correspondence  originated  with

U.M.N.O.'s  letter dated 5th June, 1959,  addressed

to   the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.  On  6th  June,

U.M.N.O. received a letter from the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  stating that the matter of appeal addressed

to  him  was under consideration. On the 8th  July,

U.M.N.O. received a letter from the State Advocate-General  stating that he had been directed  by  the

Minister  for Labour and Law to reply to U.M.N.O.'s

letter dated 5th June, 1959, addressed to the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara,  and  was  to  state  that  the

Minister   for  Labour  and  Law  had  given   full

consideration  to  it  but regretted  that  he  was

unable  to  advise  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to

grant any further clemency to the Muslim prisoners.

With  regard to the letter from the State Advocate-General, it is most confusing as explained just now

whether the Yang di-Pertuan Negara himself  or  the

Minister  for Labour and Law gave the  decision  to

reject U.M.N.O.'s appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore. Mr Speaker, as I emphasised at the

beginning of my speech, the Government should  take

a  serious view of this matter so as to allay fears

and misunderstanding and the loss of confidence  of

the public in the Government today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

President  of  the  Emergency  Committee   of   the

English - it  is  not their official language - to  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara asking for clemency and  for

the  immediate release of certain Muslim  prisoners

now  in Changi Gaol who were sentenced to death and

reprieved  in  connection with the Nadra  riots  in

December, 1950. I will read the letter - it  was  not

that  repeated comment about the national  language

is  in  fact  relevant. Perhaps the Minister  could

contain himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, with due respect, I think

the letter was read out to the Assembly just now in

Malay but it is very important that-

speak  in  Malay and therefore he was  entitled  to

interpret  any  English letter into  Malay.  If  he

interpreted wrongly, the Minister can indicate  how

wrong he was.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the same day, His

Excellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  passed  the

petition  to  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  for

consideration, and it was acknowledged by the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's Secretariat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th of June, Mr Speaker, the Secretary of

the  Malay Seamen's Union of Singapore addressed  a

petition  in  Malay  to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

which   stated   that  the  Malay  Seamen's   Union

supported the U.M.N.O. in appealing for the release

of   certain  Muslim  prisoners  who  were  serving

sentences  in  connection with the Nadra  riots  of

1950. This petition went on to say:



"The   eight  P.A.P. leaders  who  were   recently

released  on  the  orders of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara had been detained because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



of political activities and therefore those Serving

sentences because of their part in the Nadra  riots

should  also  be  released because  they  too  were

political detainees."



<br><br>The  petition was forwarded by the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara   to  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs   for

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on 15th June, one of the Muslim prisoners concerned dissociated himself from what

the Singapore U.M.N.O. was doing, in a letter which

he  wrote from Changi Prison to the Tunku in  Kuala

Lumpur.   This  letter  was  routed   through   the

Superintendent of Changi Prison and a copy was sent

to  the  Minister for Home Affairs and  reached  me

later. I shall read this letter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate to interrupt, but I

would  ask the Minister to observe what  I  said  a

moment  ago, and that is to try to keep this debate

to  the  constitutional point only, and not on  the

merits  of the petition itself, because the  motion

itself merely raises a constitutional issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If that is so, Mr Speaker, I can only

say  that the third letter did, in fact, dissociate

one of the prisoners from the action that was being

taken by the Singapore U.M.N.O. with regard to this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, it will be noted that the

petitions  were for the remission of the  whole  of

the  sentences which these Muslim prisoners are now

serving.   Under   section  9  of   the   Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, the power to

remit any sentence is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara.  I  would refer to section 9, Mr  Speaker,

which states:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Yang di-Pertuan Negara, as occasion shall

arise,  may,  in  Her Majesty's  name  and  on  Her

Majesty's behalf



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) remit the whole or any part of any such

sentence  or  of  any penalty  or  forfeiture

otherwise due to Her Majesty:".



<br><br>That    is    provided   for   in   the   Singapore

(Constitution)  Order  in  Council.  That  is   the

provision of the Order in Council which the  Member

for Geylang Serai referred to just now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the exercise of the powers

conferred  on  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  by  the

Order   in  Council  is  regulated  by  the   Royal

Instructions.  The  Member for  Geylang  Serai  has

never  known this. I will now enlighten  him  about

these  Instructions. Mr Speaker, clause 2  (a)  of

these  Instructions  provides  that  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara shall consult with the Cabinet (or a

Minister acting under the general authority of  the

Cabinet) in the exercise of all powers, authorities

and  functions  conferred on him by  or  under  the

Order  or  by or under any other law for  the  time

being  in force in Singapore other than any  power,

authority  or  function  which  is  expressed   (in

whatever  terms) to be exercisable by  him  in  his

discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Royal Instructions, Mr Speaker, go on

to say, in clause 2, sub-clause (d), that even in a

case where the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has any power

to  be exercised by him in his discretion, he  must

act   in   accordance   with   any   constitutional

convention  applicable  to  the  exercise  of   any

similar  power, authority or function by the  Queen

in the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of these provisions

of  the Royal Instructions is that the exercise  of

the powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in respect

of  the  remission of sentences under the Singapore

(Constitution)   Order   in   Council,   even    if

exercisable at his discretion, must be exercised in

accordance   with  the  constitutional   convention

applicable  to the exercise of a similar  power  by

the  Queen  in  the United Kingdom. In  the  United

Kingdom, the convention is that a pardon leading to

the  remission of sentence is granted by the  Queen

only  when such a remission is approved by the Home

Secretary. My authority for so saying, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  the book on "The Home Office" in the  new

Whitehall  series which was written  by  Sir  Frank

Newton, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for  the

Home Department. I refer, Mr Speaker, Sir, to page

114  of  this  book. In Chapter 11,  entitled  "The

Royal Prerogative of Mercy", it is stated that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



the  prerogative of mercy is exercised  in  England

and Wales on the advice of the Home Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly defined, it is the prerogative of

relieving  an  offender  of  all  or  some  of  the

consequences of the conviction in, or a sentence or

penalty  imposed  by,  the  Criminal  Courts.   The

prerogative may be exercised by the grant  of  free

pardons,  conditional pardons and  remissions.  The

note  on remissions states that a remission reduces

the   amount  of  a  sentence  or  penalty  without

changing  its  character, as  when  a  sentence  of

imprisonment is reduced from twelve months to eight

months or a fine of �6 is reduced by half.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of the petition of

U.M.N.O., the question of the remission of sentence

was referred by H.E. the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to

the  Ministry of Home Affairs, which in turn passed

the matter on for consideration to the Ministry  of

Labour  and  Law  which  is  concerned  with  legal

matters relating to petitions for the remission  of

sentences. The petition was then submitted  by  the

Minister for Labour and Law to the Cabinet, and the

Cabinet  was  asked to consider  the  petition  and

advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara whether or not to

accede  to  the  appeal for clemency.  The  Cabinet

decided  to advise H.E. the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

that no clemency should be shown to the prisoners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the authority of the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara to disclose that, on the 6th

of July, I officially informed him that the Cabinet

had  considered the petitions of the  President  of

the Emergency Committee of U.M.N.O., Singapore, and

the  Secretary of the Malay Seamen's Union, and had

decided to advise him that there was no reason  for

showing clemency to these Muslim prisoners as  they

were  convicted on criminal charges and their cases

were  unlike  those of the political detainees  who

were recently released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also attached draft letters which were to be

sent by His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

secretary   to  the  President  of  the   Emergency

Committee of U.M.N.O. and the Secretary of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



Malay Seamen's Union, informing them of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's decision - that the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  had decided to act in accordance  with  the

advice which he had received from the Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 7th of July I received

the following minute from His Excellency:-



<br><br>"Minister,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, please, I think it would

be more in accordance with the new Constitution for

the  reply to go from your Ministry, written by the

direction   of   the   Minister,   informing    the

petitioners  that  the  Minister  has  given   full

consideration  to their request but regrets  he  is

unable to advise His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara to grant any further clemency. This would be

in line with U.K. practice."



<br><br>On  the  8th  of July, the State Advocate-General

wrote the following letter to the President of  the

Emergency Committee of U.M.N.O.:-

<pre>

"Sir,



 I  am directed by the Minister for Labour and  Law

to  refer to your letter, ref: P.E.N./ 1/59,  dated

5th  June,  1959, addressed to the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  and to state that the Minister  has  given

full consideration to your request but regrets that

he  is  unable to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

to   grant  any  further  clemency  to  the  Muslim

prisoners referred to in your letter.



                     (Sd.) State Advocate-General."

</pre>

<br><br>It will be seen, therefore, that the reply was sent

in  this  form at the express wish of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara himself after he had considered  the

petition and had decided to act in accordance  with

the advice of the Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I pointed out earlier, the

power  to remit a sentence is a discretionary power

vested  in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara by the  Order

in  Council, and not in the Cabinet. In  exercising

this power by the Royal Instructions, the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  must  act in accordance  with  the

convention  applicable in such cases in the  United

Kingdom. In this case, he acted in accordance  with

the   convention   applicable  to   petitions   for

remission  of sentences in the United  Kingdom  and

took  the  advice of the Cabinet not  to  show  any

clemency. The petitioners were so informed  in  the

manner suggested by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



himself. There was no question, therefore,  of  the

Minister  for Labour and Law arrogating to  himself

the  functions  of  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  in

regard to these petitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 30th of July a report

appeared in the Straits Times stating that  at  the

Press  conference  at U.M.N.O. headquarters,  Inche

Abdul  Hamid  released  a  letter  from  the  State

Advocate-General, and the text of  this  letter  is

reproduced in this report. I will read it, Sir:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"I am directed by the Minister for Labour and

Law  to refer to your letter dated June 5 addressed

to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and to state that the

Minister  has given it his full consideration,  but

regrets  that  he  is unable to grant  any  further

clemency to the Muslim prisoners."'



<br><br>That, Mr Speaker, is a complete fabrication of the

truth. The letter that was written, reads as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am directed by the Minister for Labour and Law

to  refer to your letter addressed to the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara and to state that the Minister  has

given  full  consideration  to  your  request   but

regrets  that he is unable to advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to grant any further clemency to the

Muslim prisoners referred to in your letter."



<br><br>That is not the letter which Inche Abdul Hamid said

he received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a point made in the

motion  standing in the name of Inche  Abdul  Hamid

that the Minister has made misleading statements to

the  Press in connection with the rejection of  the

petition. Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure  you  that

there have been no misleading statements whatsoever

made  to  the  Press.  If there  was  a  misleading

statement,  it  was one made by Inche  Abdul  Hamid

himself. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister is not

referring to the Member for Geylang Serai  when  he

says "Inche Abdul Hamid".



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am referring to the President of the U.M.N.O.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That I think probably satisfies the

Member for Geylang Serai.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when this letter

appeared  in the Press, the Press rang  me  up  and

asked me for any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



comments, and my comments were reproduced in this

report. It reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Byrne said tonight he had never at any time

made the decision."



<br><br>That statement is quite correct.



"It  was a decision of the Cabinet. It was made  by

the   Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  himself   and   was

transmitted  to  the person concerned  through  his

Ministry."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Order in Council, the

discretion  to remit a sentence or not to  remit  a

sentence  is vested clearly in the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  by  law  and not in the  Cabinet.  So  that

statement is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He explained: "The petition was sent to the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara,  who  sought  advice  from  the

Cabinet."'



<br><br>That is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"The Cabinet gave him certain advice with regard

to  this matter and he decided that there should be

no pardon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His decision then came to the Ministry of Labour

and  Law as we deal with legal matters, and on  the

instruction  of  the Minister, the State  Advocate-General  communicated the decision  to  the  person

concerned."'



<br><br>That is also correct, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He said he had checked with law officers and

they confirmed that what the Ministry had done  was

"in    accordance    with   normal   constitutional

practice."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"It is complete nonsense to suggest that the

decision  came  from  the Minister.  The  power  is

clearly vested in the person of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  himself  and not in a Minister  or  in  the

Cabinet."'



<br><br>That is correct, and there is nothing misleading in

the statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last point I would make is

to  show the difference between practice under  the

old  constitution with which the Member for Geylang

Serai  is  familiar, that is, the Singapore  Colony

Order  in  Council, 1955. Now,  in  that  Order  in

Council,  the  power of remitting  a  sentence  was

vested   in   the  Governor.  Under   the   present

Constitution,  it is vested in the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara. In the old Constitution, the Governor could

consult  the Council of Ministers if he wished  to.

If  he  did not wish to, he need not consult  them.

And  if  he consulted the Council of Ministers,  he

could disregard the advice given by them. Under the

present  Constitution, the  power  of  remitting  a

sentence is still vested in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



counterpart of the Governor, that is, the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara; and under the present Constitution

he must consult the Cabinet on all matters, even in

matters  which are left to be decided in  his  sole

discretion. That is the position. So that today the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara would have to  consult  the

Cabinet  on petitions and requests of remission  of

sentences.  So  that,  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  would

submit  that as far as the Government is concerned,

it has not done anything which can be considered to

be unconstitutional. I would say that as far as the

charge relates to my conduct in this matter, I  can

assure    this    House   that   I    have    acted

constitutionally, and I have not at any  time  made

misleading  statements  to  the  Press  about  this

matter.



<br><br>5.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning the Government's

alleged misuse of the Constitution or that  it  has

gone  against  the Constitution, as stated  by  the

Member  for Geylang Serai, I feel that this is  not

so,  because the Member for Geylang Serai certainly

knows  the  Constitution very well,  and  also  the

powers  and functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

in  a self-governing Singapore, as contained in the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council; and also

because  he  was  one  of  the  Members  who   were

responsible  for  and who were signatories  to  the

Constitution   which   granted   Singapore    self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen and a representative of the people

of  this country, it is my responsibility to say  a

few words - in the form of explanatory notes - to those

people who have been misled. It is essential for me

to  emphasise here again, Mr Speaker, that I  rise

to  speak not merely because of sentiment. Not only

do  I  oppose  the Opposition Members, particularly

the  Malay  representatives  who  have  moved  this

motion, but I also oppose the motion from the point

of  view of our stand and discipline as far as they

concern the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I most certainly feel sorry for the Member for Geylang Serai who did not, in the first

instance,  make  a  thorough investigation  of  the

motion  which he has moved, to see whether  it  was

merely motivated by sentiment or for the purpose of

winning the support of the Muslim people, because I

am  of the opinion that he and his colleagues might

have  the  impression that they are heroes  of  the

Malay  community without, however, thinking of  the

consequences that would result therefrom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if certain U.M.N.O. leaders outside, for instance, the pro tem Chairman of the U.M.N.O.

Emergency Committee, Inche Abdul Hamid Bin  Allwie,

do    not   understand   the   substance   or   the

interpretation, or the definition of the  Singapore

(Constitution)  Order  in  Council  concerning  the

powers  and functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

or  the  powers of the Cabinet in the march towards

self-government, I feel confident that they will be

taught  and guided by the Member for Geylang  Serai

himself because, as I said just now, the Member for

Geylang  Serai  knows better the  contents  of  the

Constitution   of  Singapore.  Unfortunately,   Mr

Speaker, what we had hoped for did not materialise.

In  fact, the Member for Geylang Serai has seen fit

to  mislead and confuse the issue which is  already

confused and very dreadful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen and a representative of the people

of  Singapore, I wish to see the unity of all races

regardless  of religion, race, skin, etc, in  this

island  so that they can live in peace and harmony.

I  hope  that  the  Muslim people  particularly  in

Singapore will not be misled, or blindly succumb to

the  propaganda  which is being spread  by  certain

leaders who I can say are irresponsible leaders.  I

feel,  Mr Speaker, that there is no necessity  for

the  Minister for Labour and Law to dwell at length

on  the functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  or

the  powers  of  the  Cabinet, because  the  Member

responsible  is  with us, although  the  other  two

Members are in the dark.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



But  I feel that the Member concerned will be in  a

position to advise his two other colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have heard just now from the Minister, the

Minister  said that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  had

received on 5th June, 1959, a petition in the  form

of  a  letter  from the pro tem  Chairman  of  the

U.M.N.O.   Emergency  Committee  in   the   English

language. The letter was read in translation, and I

feel  no comment on this is needed. But what I  can

say here is that the reply which was transmitted to

the  pro  tem  Chairman via  the  State  Advocate-General was completely distorted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Mr Speaker, the Member has no need

to  move this motion. The Yang di-Pertuan Negara is

the  Head of State in Singapore. All State  matters

which  are transmitted to him, before they  can  be

disposed of, must be discussed by the Cabinet,  and

the  Cabinet does not comprise one person,  as  has

been   suggested  in  the  motion  to   appoint   a

Commission  of Inquiry to look into the conduct  of

the  Minister.  But the Cabinet  consists  of  nine

Ministers,    and   these   nine   Ministers    are

responsible - not  merely one Minister.  On  the  9th

June, the Minister received a letter from the Malay

Seamen's  Union, and on the 6th July the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  was informed by the  Minister  for

Labour and Law that the letter was routed first  to

the Minister for Home Affairs, then to the Minister

for Labour and Law, and finally to the Cabinet, and

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It is necessary that we

here  should study carefully the position  so  that

this  misunderstanding which has  arisen  will  not

occur  again in the future. In my opinion,  such  a

misunderstanding  is  very  dangerous,  because  if

matters  get out of control, there will be communal

conflict  or  riots,  as had occurred  in  December

1950,  during  which  18 people  were  killed,  130

people  were  wounded,  72  cars  were  burnt,  and

hundreds more cars were damaged. That was the  work

of a handful of people but it resulted in bloodshed

and the loss of hundreds of lives in Singapore.  At

that  time the people who were responsible for  all

this  disappeared.  Those  who  suffered  were  the

ordinary people. I hope this matter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



will  not  recur  as by the time it  was  over  the

instigators  would already have fled to  Ceylon  or

some other country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is important to me and to my colleagues on this side of the House, and I

believe,  to  Tunku Abdul Rahman,  and  Dato  Abdul

Razak too, for the sake of unity. However, I do not

wish  to  go  further into this matter because  the

question  of the unity of the various races  is  of

the utmost importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to revert to the motion. On the whole, I do not see where the Constitution has been

misused.  I  fail  to  see  the  reasons  for   the

appointment of a Commission to investigate into the

conduct  of  a  Minister of  this  Government.  The

reason  why I say that I cannot understand is  that

the questions asked by the Member for Geylang Serai

have  been  replied to by the Minister for  Labour,

and    it   is   clear   that   his   conduct   was

constitutional. My view on this matter is that this

motion was deliberately moved in order to challenge

the powers of the Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I allowed the hon. Member to

continue when he was becoming irrelevant.  But  now

he  is imputing improper motives to the Member  who

moved  the  motion,  and  that  of  course  is  not

permitted under our Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I said earlier,

we have facts which show the role of the Cabinet in

regard  to  the  exchange of letters  sent  to  the

Chairman. The facts are true. But what is not  true

is  the  means  of  disseminating  the  replies  to

newspaper reporters and to the people of Singapore.

The  reason,  Mr Speaker, is that there  are  many

sentences which were omitted merely to mislead  the

public,  particularly  the people  of  the  Islamic

faith,  because  this matter is one  in  which  the

prisoners involved are serving sentence as a result

of  religious feelings. I hope that the Member  for

Geylang Serai, the mover of this motion, can in the

future  be  on  the look-out so as to refrain  from

casting  aspersions.  We must  be  careful  in  the

conduct  of  our every-day affairs so as  to  avert

misunderstanding which is bound to occur and  which

will result in chaos.

debate  arose as the result of the failure  of  the

U.M.N.O.  Members  to  make capital  out  of  their

appeal   for   the  release  of  Muslim   prisoners

sentenced in connection with the riots of  December

1950.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai was an important

Minister  in the last Government and we wonder  how

it  is  that  nothing was done for those  prisoners

when he was in office.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I have already made

it  very clear that this debate must be confined to

the constitutional issue and nothing more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must say

in  passing  that  from something  straightforward,

where the case is judged purely on its merits,  the

U.M.N.O.  Members have chosen to turn this  into  a

political and communal issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again I think the hon.

Member  is getting off the track. Shall we come  to

the  constitutional issue and nothing more than the

constitutional issue?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Can I merely explain, Sir,

that  we  have  today a motion which  may  stir  up

racial feelings? As has been explained in detail by

the Minister for Labour and Law, there has been  no

unconstitutional  conduct  on  the  part   of   any

Minister.  It  is the normal process of  democratic

Government. Why then the call for the setting up of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



this  Commission? Responsible leaders  should  know

that a call of this nature, and in the present  set

of circumstances, can easily be misinterpreted, and

thus  lead  to  stirring up of a  lot  of  communal

strife.  The  official  U.M.N.O. policy   in   the

Federation  is to stamp out - excuse me, Sir - communal

feelings at whatever cost. It is thus all the  more

surprising  that the Singapore U.M.N.O. branch  is

adopting  such  an attitude. Can it be,  Sir,  that

these  so-called leaders of U.M.N.O. in  Singapore

are   so   bankrupt  of  ideas  and  so  completely

detached-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think they can be,

in  these  circumstances anyway. I think  the  hon.

Member  must try and keep to the motion before  us,

and  that is whether or not a Commission should  be

appointed  to  investigate into what  I  think  the

Minister   for   Labour  and  Law  would   call   a

"constitutional contretemps".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In the circumstances, Sir, may

I  end  by saying that whatever the ulterior motive

of  the U.M.N.O. Members across the Floor, we  hope

that they will not pursue actions that may lead  to

communal strife?



<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning the motion which

was  moved by U.M.N.O. through its Members in  the

Assembly today, I sincerely and honestly deny  that

we  have  an  ulterior motive which  will  lead  to

communal  strife.  However, the  Government  should

investigate  more  deeply  into  the  circumstances

which  have  resulted  in the  motion  being  moved

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this motion is not carefully studied, I do not

deny  that  the  accusations levelled  against  us,

representing  U.M.N.O., of creating  racial  strife

would appear to be so. But frankly and sincerely  I

believe  that  those  who  have  instructed  us  as

U.M.N.O. members,  who are guided  by  resolutions

adopted by our organisation, will pursue the motion

whether  it  is  acceptable to  the  Government  or

otherwise.  I  cannot accept the allegations  which

have been hurled by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>





Government  against my colleague,  the  Member  for

Geylang Serai. They alleged that it was his  desire

to  create  something which we  do  not  desire  in

Singapore.  Whatever the P.A.P., the Government  in

power,  may say, whether we directly wish to create

something  which we do not wish to see,  I  do  not

wish to speak about the feelings of the ra'ayat.  I

do not wish to create such an atmosphere because we

know  the hardships and difficulties of building  a

community. How can we destroy that community?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we do not have any ulterior motive. I personally support what has been said by one of

the  Members concerning the policy of U.M.N.O. not

only  in Malaya but also in Singapore - a policy  of

creating  harmony between the races. As members  of

U.M.N.O. in this Assembly, we are compelled to  act

on  the  instructions of our organisation. We  will

not hesitate to receive any clarification given  by

the  Government. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker,  we  in

U.M.N.O. are   still   in  doubt,   because   the

Constitution  is not clear and explicit  concerning

the   articles   contained  in  the   exchange   of

correspondence  received  by  U.M.N.O.   In   these

circumstances, U.M.N.O. has to mention its doubt so

that  the  spirit  of  the  Constitution  which  we

together support can be implemented without leaving

behind  the  basis  of  the Constitution  which  we

support today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, we Opposition

Members  are willing to accept the accusations  and

allegations  hurled  against  us  in   good   grace

because,  as I have explained clearly, the struggle

is to help build a society; it is not our intention

to  disrupt  it. Therefore, if the opinion  of  the

Government  is that U.M.N.O. has moved this  motion

with an improper motive because-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Kampong Kembangan is going on a track which I  have

asked  hon.  Members not to go on. I do  not  think

there has been any allegation from Government  that

the  motion has been moved with an improper motive.

I  think  the Hon. the Minister was quite clear  in

his statement when he debated this motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



He only touched on the constitutional point. He did

not  go on any extraneous point in deference to the

Chair.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I offer my

apologies,  Sir.  Mr Speaker,  to  revert  to  the

motion before us which we are debating now, what  I

have emphasised and as the mover of the motion  has

explained,  the correspondence which  U.M.N.O. had

received  was not explicit. Therefore, U.M.N.O. is

still  in  doubt  and consider that  the  functions

carried  out  by  the Minister  concerned  and  his

conduct  in  the matter are improper. Nevertheless,

Mr Speaker, I do not wish to lengthen this debate,

but  I  wish to reiterate that U.M.N.O. is  of  the

opinion  that  the letters which were  received  by

U.M.N.O. are not according to the Constitution.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, after what we have heard both

from  the  Government side and from the  Opposition

side  on the motion moved by the Member for Geylang

Serai,  I feel that this is not a big issue and  if

we  study this motion carefully, we will find  that

this  has  arisen from the doubts, misunderstanding

and misinterpretation of the mover of the motion. I

would  like to remind the Opposition that  if  they

were  to use scientific eye-glasses, they would  be

able to get a true picture of the whole affair; but

unfortunately the eye-glasses which are being  worn

by  the  Opposition side are so blurred  that  they

cannot even see the cat's fur and they mistake  the

cat  for  a  tiger  to such an  extent  that  their

thoughts have been influenced-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think another hon. Member was

guilty of using a "tiger" expression. Now the  Hon.

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

National  Development is going on to other  similar

expressions.  I think he is very fond  of  similes,

but  sometimes similes can become offensive.  So  I

ask him to be very careful in the use of similes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I did not

use the term "tiger" as an expression of anger but

I meant to show the difference between a tiger and

a cat because they are almost alike. Therefore, the

Opposition see the cat as a tiger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, it does make a

difference when the simile becomes offensive to the

people to whom the hon. Member refers, and I   think

probably he is on the verge of being offensive.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not

wish to have a debate with you. But I will continue

with my views on this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are wasting our time unnecessarily because of

the doubts of the mover of the motion. A Member  of

the  Opposition  has expressed his  regret  at  the

unsatisfactory  reply  received.  Therefore  it  is

clear that this action was taken because of doubts.

If   the   contents  of  the  letter  were  clearly

understood, then I feel that this motion would  not

have  been moved in this Assembly. I would like  to

convey my views on this motion. I made reference to

a  tiger  as  a warning to the Member  for  Geylang

Serai  who himself started by warning us that  this

motion  was not spurred on by sentiment or communal

feelings.  But I say that my views on  this  motion

are not based on sentiment or on communal lines but

on  the  basis of justice. We participate  in  this

debate for our common interest. It is true that  we

together promulgated the present Constitution which

is in force in Singapore, but the interpretation of

the  articles contained in the Constitution may  be

different. I think this is the main and fundamental

issue.  The Member for Geylang Serai did not accuse

but  indirectly  stated that we  must  rectify  the

mistakes  concerning the Constitution and  that  if

the  P.A.P. did not wish to uphold the Constitution

it  was going against the Constitution. If this  is

not  an  allegation,  I  consider  it  then  as  an

accusation, but I do not wish to dwell on  this  at

length. Charges and counter-charges will not end.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Yang-.di-Pertuan Negara was

explicitly clarified by the Minister for Labour and

Law  at  length. Regarding the reply  sent  by  the

State  Advocate-General to the protem  Chairman  of

the  Emergency  Committee of Singapore's  U.M.N.O.,

the  position was also explained in detail. I  feel

that  all the doubts in the minds of the Opposition

should  be  cleared.  The  Opposition  related  the

history of the Singapore riots which were connected

with  the  motion moved today. The Member  for  the

Southern  Islands stated that he did  not  wish  to

reopen  the  wound of 1950, and that  he  hoped  it

would be healed. But I am surprised that indirectly

the Opposition have brought out a sharp knife. This

will  only  serve to confuse the people. This  will

only  lead  to a new wound; it will not remove  the

old scar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, fortunately, the persons connected with the motion are in the wrong, otherwise we will

be discussing the rights of the Malays. If we study

carefully  the  speech of the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan,  which was supported by the  Member  for

the   Southern  Islands,  the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  stated that he had moved the  motion  on

behalf of Singapore's U.M.N.O., and the Member  for

the Southern Islands said that he was compelled  to

support the motion to comply with instructions from

U.M.N.O.  This clearly shows that this  motion  was

deliberately moved whilst the mover of  the  motion

himself was undecided as to whether to move  it  or

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Kampong Kembangan stated that U.M.N.O.'s representatives in this

House  did  not  bring up this motion  to  stir  up

communal feelings. On our side, we do not, in fact,

accuse them of stirring up communal feelings but we

would    like   to   say   this   to   them.    Any

misinterpretation of the facts outside  this  House

to  say  that this matter concerns the religion  of

Islam, a Holy War of struggle, and so on, is  going

to  cause us great concern. Therefore, this  matter

should not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



protracted. If it is true that the Opposition  side

wishes   to   seek   a  policy  based   on   mutual

understanding  between  the  Government   and   the

Opposition,  then  is there any necessity  to  move

such a motion which is based on doubts or based  on

what  they  term  "the contents of the  letter  not

being  explicit"? Even a child can answer this.  If

they do not understand it, why do they not write  a

letter  to  the State Advocate-General?  The  State

Advocate-General  is  not working  for  the  P.A.P.

alone but he is also working for all the people  of

Singapore.  He  will  be able  to  explain  matters

concerning the powers and functions of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  Send  a  letter  first  and  make

enquiries  before moving a motion.  But  here  with

letters  "the contents of which were not  explicit"

as  a  basis, a motion had been tabled and  then  a

statement was issued to the Press which appeared in

bold  headlines. Mr Speaker, as a Member  of  this

Assembly and as a citizen of this country, in touch

with  all races on this island, I have been flooded

with  enquiries consequent upon the Press statement

and   on  the  motion  which  was  tabled  by   the

Opposition  and  which we are  debating  today.  Of

course,  we do not expect the Opposition  to  light

the fire but we know that it is dangerous to strike

a  light in a hot situation when there is dry  wood

and oil around.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government, in

all  sincerity and honesty, I hope that motions  of

this  nature  will  not  be moved  in  future.  The

Opposition  say that this motion is  not  based  on

communal  issues or sentiments. The  fact  is  that

this  matter could have been resolved if  enquiries

had  been  made  to  the  proper  authorities.  Mr

Speaker,  I say there are two ways for an adult  to

cry. One way is to wail with an appealing voice and

the  shedding of tears. The other way of crying  is

to  cry  silently "in the heart".  I  think  crying

silently  in the heart is crying in the true  sense

of  the  word.  But,  the  shedding  of  "crocodile

tears",  shall we say, is merely designed  for  the

purpose  of enlisting the moral support of  others.

If a child cries when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



he loses his father, he will really loudly wail but

at  the  same time he will also be thinking whether

or not he will inherit his father's property. So  I

feel  this  motion, if studied carefully  and  with

proper perspective, is based on uncertainty or lack

of  understanding, as is obvious from the  speeches

made by the three Members of the Opposition. In the

circumstances,  I feel today's sitting  has  wasted

much  of  its time in discussing a matter which  is

based on doubts or lack of understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I welcome the speeches made by the Opposition to the effect that they are not based on

communal  feelings or carried away  by  emotion.  I

hope  the speeches as heard by all Members  of  the

Assembly,  will not only be heard in  this  Chamber

but also be put into practice outside this House so

that  the  unity  of the people of Singapore  as  a

whole will be maintained in a good spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I oppose this motion vigorously because, in my opinion, apart from it

being  based  on doubts as I said just  now  or  on

misunderstanding  or lack of understanding,  if  we

appoint a Commission to be presided over by a  High

Court  Judge  to  look  into  the  conduct  of  the

Ministers  and  the  staff of the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  it  will take months; whereas in  fact  the

motion   is  only  based  on  doubts.  We,   as   a

revolutionary Government, want to progress-we  want

to  work  more and talk less. We have  wasted  much

time  unnecessarily. Therefore, I think this motion

is  inappropriate if we truly want justice. On  the

other  hand,  as I said just now, the  Malay  maxim

says: if it is not because of the ripening padi the

weaver-bird  will  not bother to  nest  in  a  low-hanging branch. Therefore, to cut my speech  short,

my  stand  is that I oppose it vigorously.  On  the

whole,  the arguments or the explanations  of  this

motion  did not come from me but from the  speeches

of  the  three  Members who have  stated  that  the

replies  received  from  the  Advocate-General  are

vague. Therefore, my opinion is that we should  not

waste  our  precious  time in discussing  a  matter

which is only based on doubts.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there have been two sittings of  this

Assembly  and  on  each occasion  the  Members  for

Geylang  Serai, Kampong Kembangan and the  Southern

Islands  have  had the honour of  introducing  the

only motions to come from the Opposition. Strangely

enough,  both  of  these motions  have  had  to  be

prefaced  by  the  remark that  there  was  nothing

communal about them; that on the contrary they were

motivated  by  the  object of  ensuring  that  this

Government   observe   the   provisions   of    the

Constitution.  I  am told, Sir,  that  professional

anti-Semites always profess that they  number  Jews

among  their best friends and then proceed to  give

expression  to the anti-Semetic ideology.  Sir,  on

the  face  of it, the motion now before  the  House

appears to be concerned only with the finer  points

of  constitutional theory and practice. If that had

been  the only concern, this matter would have been

happily  resolved by the Member for  Geylang  Serai

taking his two bewildered colleagues quietly  to  a

room   and   explaining  the  real   constitutional

position. And I have every reason to believe,  Sir,

that the Member for Geylang Serai knows the correct

answer  to  the  constitutional  problems,  to  the

questions raised in this motion, since he was among

those  who went to London to help forge the present

Constitution. I would hate to think, Sir, that  the

hon. Member was party to something he did not quite

understand.  Since he knew what  he  endorsed,  the

Member  for Geylang Serai must be aware that  there

is  nothing unconstitutional in any Minister or the

Government advising the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  not

to  grant clemency to those sentenced in connection

with the riots in December 1950.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a constitutional expert myself, but I

had  no  difficulty in following the argument  that

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara even in regard  to  the

Royal prerogative of mercy acts in accordance  with

the  advice tendered by the Minister concerned;  in

this particular case, the advice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



was  given  by the Cabinet as a whole. I  am  quite

sure,  Sir, that the Member for Geylang Serai could

have  explained all this to his colleagues  outside

this  Chamber, perhaps in an atmosphere not  tinged

with high emotion. In fact, it should have been his

duty  to  do  so, because his colleagues  were  not

privileged   like   him  to  participate   in   the

constitutional deliberations in London. Instead  he

has  allowed  them  to harbour the  most  fantastic

notions about the Constitution. At least, right  up

to  the  present  moment, he has  allowed  them  to

continue  in  the  belief that the  Government  has

arrogated powers that are rightly those of the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, I came here feeling that

perhaps the Member for Geylang Serai had some finer

points  of the Constitution which he was  going  to

expound - to  confound, and to confuse  our  Minister

for  Labour  and  Law. But, Sir, listening  to  the

speeches  from  the  Members opposite,  I  got  the

distinct  impression  that they  were  not  at  all

particularly   concerned  with  the   niceties   of

constitutional  law. Certainly the speeches  stated

no   grave  doubts  as  to  any  breaches  of   the

Constitution. All that the Member for Geylang Serai

said  was that there were two letters, one of which

was  sent by the Minister for Labour and Law to him

and  another which appeared in the papers, and that

he  found  great  difficulty in  reconciling  them.

Because  of  this he now wants to  go  through  the

process  of setting up a Commission to be  presided

over  by  a  High Court Judge to decide on  a  very

simple  issue - an issue which arose  simply  because

the  Member  for Geylang Serai has made unnecessary

difficulties   for  himself  by   trying   not   to

understand this very simple problem. In  fact,  one

of the things about this motion is its curious wording. One of the terms of the Commission is



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to report as to whether there has been

unconstitutional conduct on the part of any and, if

so, which Minister of Government...".



<br><br>At least this implies that the mover of this motion

is  only  interested  in ascertaining  whether  one

particular Minister

has  been  guilty  of  a breach  of  constitutional

practice.  Sir,  I  have been  wondering  why  this

motion  singles out one Minister of the Government,

instead of charging the Cabinet as a whole, or  the

Government  as  a  whole, of  having  breached  the

Constitution.  Those of us who have  followed  very

closely  the  controversy which led to this  motion

will  probably not be in doubt as to which Minister

is  meant, which Minister is to be made the villain

of the piece.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the only Minister who has had anything to

say  on the matter was the Minister for Labour  and

Law. In fact, statements in the Press have been  so

couched  as  to  concentrate  the  attacks  on  the

Minister  for Labour and Law even when his  critics

knew that whatever advice the Minister gave was the

collective  decision  of the Cabinet.  The  Straits

Times  of  30th  July - it was quite clear  that  the

Minister  for Labour and Law was going to  be  made

the  scapegoat. The heading reads - "U.M.N.O. lashes

at  Byrne - took Goode's Powers". The report goes  on

to say:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pro tem chairman of Singapore U.M.N.O.,

Inche  Abdul  Hamid Bin Allwie, today claimed  that

the  Minister for Labour and Law, Mr K. M.  Byrne,

had `arrogated to himself some of the authority  of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was it necessary to single out one Minister

instead  of condemning the Government as  a  whole?

Perhaps the movers of this motion, since they  have

been  instructed to introduce this motion, are  not

aware of the association of ideas that could result

from  such a motion. As you know, Sir, the  subject

matter  of  the  motion relates to  certain  Muslim

prisoners who were convicted as a result  of  their

participation  in  the riots of December  1950.  At

that  time,  the  whole affair was associated  with

members of the Eurasian community. And now the same

tactic  of  fixing the blame for  this  on  another

Eurasian  would certainly have serious consequences

which  perhaps  the  Members who  have  moved  this

motion do not quite realise. And therefore, I would

say to the Members opposite that even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



if  they profess that any motion that they bring to

this  House has no communal or racial connotations,

they  must realise that people outside are  not  as

politically  sophisticated as they are,  and  might

make  other inferences from a motion of this  kind.

As  I  said earlier in my opening remarks, the  two

motions  that  have been brought  up  so  far  have

required  prefatory remarks by the Members opposite

that  these  motions  have no  racial  or  communal

connotations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the constitutional position has been

quite clearly stated by the Minister for Labour and

Law.  I  am quite sure that the Member for  Geylang

Serai,  if  he is genuinely interested  in  seeking

clarification of the constitutional aspects of  the

matter,  should now be quite satisfied  that  there

has  been no breach of the Constitution; that there

has been no attempt to arrogate powers that rightly

belong to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. But if he  is

not  persuaded that there has been no breach of the

Constitution, then I am afraid, Sir, since we  have

another  four years and ten months to go,  that  we

shall  receive  other motions  which  will  require

prefatory  remarks  by the Members  opposite,  that

there  is  nothing communal about motions they  are

going, to introduce, and that they are moving  them

with the highest of motives, probably motives which

are  commendable, but which we, on this side of the

House,  will  continue to expose and  criticise  as

being communal in character; and if they persist in

this  sort  of practice for another four years  and

ten  months, then we may land in precisely the kind

of  political atmosphere and tragedy that  overtook

many other countries in Asia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I was incredulous when  I  received

notice  of this motion which stands in the name  of

the  Member for Geylang Serai, and others. I wonder

why  he  did  not want to take the full credit  for

this  motion.  I  also wonder how he  overcame  his

pathological fear of Commissions of Inquiry to  put

himself into a position where he is asking for one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the draft of the motion that

was first submitted might or might not have been in

the  terms in which it has now appeared before  the

Assembly.  But I tell the Member for Geylang  Serai

quite simply that political rumbustiousness, crude,

coarse, political gangster tactics, are not  likely

to intimidate, overawe or paralyse this Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the whole of that

paragraph  must  be ruled out in reference  to  the

hon.  Member  for Geylang Serai.  If  there  is  an

allegation that he is adopting gangster tactics,  I

am  sure the Hon. Prime Minister must know that  it

is  wrong.  Let  us get down to  the  meat  of  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

get down to the meat of the motion, I would like to

lay down a few general principles which I hope will

guide the Opposition Members in their dealings with

this Government. One of the principles is that this

is  not  a  Government to be pushed from pillar  to

post.  If  the  Member for Geylang  Serai  wants  a

Commission of Inquiry at the end of this debate,  I

am  quite prepared to move three amendments to  his

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai

was  one  of  the  authors of this Constitution.  I

forgive him for not understanding it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If strangers in the Gallery

cannot keep silent, they will have to go. May I ask

hon.  Members  not to be too frivolous  about  this

motion?  I  know the Prime Minister is a very  good

speaker  and he entertains, but I think  that  hon.

Members should try to contain themselves,



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, in all

seriousness, I was prepared to forgive  the  Member

for  Geylang Serai for not being able to understand

the  somewhat abstruse language of the Constitution

itself    and   section   9   of   the    Singapore

(Constitution)  Order in Council.  But  I  find  it

difficult  to  believe that he could have  appended

his  signature  to  the  Report  of  the  Singapore

Constitutional Talks in London in March 1957, which

was phrased in ordinary simple English. It was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



for  the  specific purpose of making it  impossible

for  anybody subsequently to deny that he  intended

to  mean what he did sign. Let me read this to  the

Member for Geylang Serai - paragraph 17, subparagraph

(iv) of that Report of 1957, regarding the Head  of

State, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exercise of Responsibilities



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of the functions of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara should be governed by Royal

Instructions   which,  in  conjunction   with   the

provision  of  the Constitution Order  in  Council,

would  oblige the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to act  in

accordance with the advice of his Ministers (except

insofar  as  is  otherwise  provided  for  in  this

Report), save that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara would

exercise   the   degree   of  personal   discretion

ordinarily reposed in the Queen's representative in

a fully independent member of the Commonwealth e.g.

in relation to such constitutional functions as the

appointment  and dismissal of a Prime Minister  and

dissolution of the Legislative Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be more clear. The former Chief

Minister   signed  it.  The  former  Deputy   Chief

Minister  signed it. In his own time - the first  and

last   they  ever  held  office  in  Singapore - they

gazetted the Royal Instructions. They published  it

on  the 10th April, 1959. They expired on the - I  am

not  sure  on  which particular day the resignation

was put in, as required by constitutional form. But

at  the time when it was published, this was  their

Report.  The 10th of April - in the lifetime  of  the

Lim  Yew Hock regime - they issued Royal Instructions

setting  out  in  legalese  the  simple  words   of

paragraph  17  (iv)  of the Report  of  the  London

Constitutional Talks. Nothing could be more clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is also more clear - clear beyond a

vestige of any doubt - is the purpose with which this

motion  has  been tabled. If the Member  was  moved

purely by the desire to uphold the righteousness of

the  Constitution and the rights of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, let me point out the simple  remedy

that  he has got. Take an action in the High Court,

and get whichever Minister he believes to be acting

ultra  vires the Constitution properly dealt  with.

He  knows that. He went to London and, according to

what he told his constituency, he consulted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



lawyers before he signed this Report. I was glad he

said   that,  because  then  he  absolved  me  from

responsibility  for anything which otherwise  might

rest  on  my  shoulders as the only lawyer  in  the

delegation. What does he seek to do in this motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of a solicitous enquiry as to the

propriety of ministerial action and the conduct  of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  and  members  of  his

staff,  he  added in the operative  words  of  this

motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...appeal of U.M.N.O. for the release of

Muslim  prisoners sentenced in connection with  the

riots of December 1950...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is really the meat of the motion. If

one   cannot  sustain  political  leadership   with

political sagacity, then at least one should try to

get   mob   support  on  the  basis   of   communal

prejudices,   religious  automatic  reflexes,   and

perhaps, a Commission of Inquiry. This, despite all

the ruination that was brought upon him as a result

two  Commissions of Inquiry - one bullet  ricochetted

from Chew Swee Kee to one Kartini binte Haji Mulok,

and the other-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must stop all these

irrelevancies. I think the Prime Minister ought not

to be guilty of irrelevancies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with great

respect, far from being irrelevant, I would like to

suggest to the Member for Geylang Serai that  there

are  three alternative courses open to us  on  this

side  of  the  House. I do not know how  this  will

interfere  with the decorum with which you  require

us  to  conduct debates in this House, or with  the

rules   as  laid  down  in  the  Standing   Orders.

Depending  upon the contingencies, we  could  amend

this motion, for instance, to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

appoint a Commission, to be presided over by a High

Court   Judge,  with  powers  to  call   upon   any

Minister....".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is a very strange thing. Sir, the last

time  we had a Commission of Inquiry over the  City

Council, we subpoenaed a Minister. And just  before

he  was  to appear - there was an argument whether  a

Minister could or could not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



be  subpoenaed - the  Inquiry  came  to  a  premature

adjournment. We could change that to "call upon any

Minister  or ex-Ministers and Members of the  staff

of  the  Governor to give evidence".  Or  we  could

cause  such a Commission to be appointed,  for  the

purposes of ascertaining the circumstances in which

either   an  ex-Minister  or  a  present   Minister

committed  perjury  in  a  particular  High   Court

motion.  We  could turn this Commission of  Inquiry

into   a  Commission  to  inquire  into  much  more

fruitful  and much more dubious affairs  that  took

place   in  the  management  of  the  business   of

Government  in  this country.  As  far  as  we  are

concerned, this motion is a piece of impertinence-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am very sorry to have to

pull  up the Prime Minister who should give a  lead

himself  on being parliamentary. He knows that  the

word  "impertinence" is unparliamentary and  I  ask

him to withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I withdraw the

word  "impertinence", but that does not  mean  that

the  evil and the unbecoming motives which  led  to

this motion being tabled did not, in fact, exist at

the time when permission was sought to table it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sure the Prime Minister

has   sufficient  ingenuity  to  use  parliamentary

language when touching on that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

certain  difficulties in dealing with this  motion.

If  one  deals with an elephant, a rapier is hardly

the  appropriate  weapon.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   in

dealing with motions in which the movers have, as a

result of the way in which you have ruled that  the

debate  should  be  confined, found  difficulty  in

keeping  themselves  to  the  meat  of  their   own

motions, I am not sure whether or not I should give

them the benefit of the doubt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Mr Speaker, Sir, you must have

believed  that they were motivated by the  best  of

honourable desires to see the Constitution  upheld.

If  that  is  so, we shall see whether or  not  the

mover  of this motion will withdraw it. If he  does

not,  let  me assure him that we can appoint  three

Commissions of Inquiry in the very near  future - all

of  which  will concern ex-Ministers who held  high

office, and might even involve the present mover of

this motion. We will then regale him and his former

colleagues   with  very  delicate  and  sensational

revelations  of the things that transpired  in  the

last regime.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we have

heard  at  great  length  the  speeches  from   the

Government  side,  but  in  my  opinion  the   most

important point that has emerged from the debate on

our  motion  is the confusion over that part  where

the  Minister  for  Labour and  Law  translated  it

beyond the scope of my intention. The Minister  for

Labour   and  Law  stated - and  the  Prime  Minister

himself  also  said - that I did not  know  what  was

contained in the Constitution and what had occurred

in  London  when  I went with the Merdeka  mission.

Here,  I  should explain, Mr Speaker, that  in  my

speech  I  have explained as explicitly as possible

that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara can take the advice

of  anyone, whether it be from the Cabinet or  from

the Minister. This is contained in the Constitution

and   was  also  minuted  in  London,  and  we  had

confirmed  the  minutes. Therefore,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara can make his own decision on matters

relating  to the granting of pardons after  receipt

of  advice from the Cabinet. I do not deny this. As

I    have    explained   earlier,   that    is    a

misunderstanding  on the part of the  Minister  for

Labour and Law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is why the letter from the Ministry

of  Labour and Law did not state that the  Minister

had  received instructions from the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara to convey his decision in full?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Press statement, the Minister for

Labour  and  Law  said  that  the  statement   from

U.M.N.O. printed in the newspaper stated that  the

Minister  himself had regretted that he was  unable

to  grant  further clemency in respect of the  five

Muslim  prisoners still under detention. Concerning

the  U.M.  N.O. statement in the Straits  Times,  I

would explain that it was issued by the Chairman of

U.M.N.O.,  Singapore,  at a Press  conference.  But

unfortunately the Straits Times only mentioned that

the  Minister for Labour and Law had regretted that

he was unable to accept the petition from U.M.N.O.,

whereas the Chinese newspaper, the Sin Chew Jit Poh

itself gave a clear and explicit explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, the Minister for Culture

stated  that we from U.M.N.O. had moved two motions

since   coming   into   this  new   Assembly,   but

unfortunately, he stated that on each occasion when

we  moved a motion we had prefaced our speeches  by

saying   that   our   motions   had   no   communal

connotations. The reason why we from U.M.N.O. were

obliged  to  do that is because since we  are  from

U.M.N.O. we are always accused by other Parties who

allege  that  we  are a communal  party,  that  our

attitudes are always communal, and that our aim  is

merely  to create racial strife. For these  reasons

we,  from  U.M.N.O., are compelled to  preface  our

motions in such terms; but not because we feel that

we are a communal organisation, because U.M.N.O. is

not   a   communal   party  but   is   a   national

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, although we have received

threats   from   the  Government  side - threats   or

phraseology  which, in my opinion,  should  not  be

used here and which are irrelevant - I feel sure that

with the motion before us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



in this House, we can together, both the Government
