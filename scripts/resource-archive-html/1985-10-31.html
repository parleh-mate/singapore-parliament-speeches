   <b>CASE OF IMPERSONATION IN AMOY QUEE CAMP</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence if he will give details of the case concerning the person who impersonated a major and entered the 2nd Singapore Infantry Regiment, Amoy Quee Camp on May 9, 1985, and what measures are being taken to prevent an occurrence of such a serious breach of security in our Army camps.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Defence (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are specific standing orders on security for military camps and installations. They are adequate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the incident at 2SIR, a reservist Lance Corporal entered the camp by wearing a Major's uniform and claiming to be a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reservist officer. He has been prosecuted in civil court and fined $200 for impersonating a public servant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reservist Lance Corporal was able to gain entry because the unit, believing him to be a bona fide senior SAF officer, did not check his identity. This contravenes the SAF's security standing orders which require that all SAF personnel, regardless of rank, produce their identification card for verification when seeking entry into a camp.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All units have been reminded to comply strictly with existing standing orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, could the Minister of State inform the House whether there have been other such cases of impersonation and, if so, could he give details?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figures with me. I do understand that this particular Lance Corporal in question had on previous occasions posed as an SAF officer and gained access to SAF camps.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to retain good officers who have decided to make a career of the SAF.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to enable SAF officers to own flats at lower prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also the additional benefits when SAF personnel live together, of helping to build up the sense of identity, allowing quick mobilization of manpower when needed, and providing for the general welfare of families, especially when the officers are away.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives of building Normanton Park still apply. To further them, the lease for each of the Normanton Park units contains a covenant that seven years after purchase, the owner may, with the prior written consent of the lessor, sell the property, but only to an approved buyer. In order to preserve the SAF character of Normanton Park as long as possible, the Armed Forces Council has decided that approved buyers should be serving SAF officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial, and no doubt resale, prices of the flats have taken this restriction into account. The point-block units were sold in 1977 at prices ranging from $36,000 to $39,000. Over the last 10 months, 42 of these units have been resold by the original owners at prices ranging from $128,000 to $180,000. A further 11 units are in the process of sale. It would therefore appear that owners have been able to find buyers for Normanton Park flats at acceptable prices.

  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question for the Minister of State.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand him, when these flats were originally sold to these officers, they were told that the flats could only be sold again to MINDEF approved purchasers. Would the Minister of State appreciate that that is much wider than the restriction which I am told has now been brought in - that only SAF officers may buy them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your supplementary question, Mr Jeyaretnam?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Ministry realize that they are changing their contract with the officers?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, the Ministry does not change contracts which it has entered into. In clause 1(g) of the lease of the sale of the flats, there is a covenant. The covenant states:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Without prejudice to clause 1(e) [which is the bond period] not without the prior consent of the lessor in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> writing to assign, demise, underlet, divest, part with, dispose of or otherwise deal with (except by will) the title, estate, interest, right to or in the flat, or share or part with the possession, occupation of the flat, or any part thereof.'
  <br>
  <br>Therefore, the rules which MINDEF has made are perfectly within the meaning of this clause.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister of State perhaps not realize the import of my question? Does he not realize that the clause in the covenant allows sale to anybody, not just SAF officers, provided the approval of MINDEF is obtained? And does he also not realize that that approval cannot be unreasonably withheld?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 1(g) stands. I am not a lawyer. But I am advised by legal officers that what MINDEF has done is strictly according to the law.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, the answer is yes. I am surprised that that meeting is regarded as a political conference. In my view, a political conference is one where only politicians or parliamentarians attend. The meeting in question was a Foreign Ministers' meeting which included participation by officials. In that instance, an officer from the SAF was nominated to attend the conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister say whether only one officer was nominated or more than one officer was nominated?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, only one SAF officer was nominated to participate in the conference as a member of the Singapore delegation.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, had the Member for Anson been honest with the members of the public in reproducing an article from The Star in the Hammer, he would have got the reason for the officer's attendance at the conference.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hammer of August 1985 reproduced an article by courtesy of The Star in which only two paragraphs, out of three paragraphs, were printed. I thought the ending in the article was quite abrupt. So I asked for the original of the extract from The Star and, true enough, one paragraph was missing. Had this paragraph been published, I think he would have known the reason for the officer's attendance. I will read to the Member the missing paragraph. It says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Government makes it a practice to send its bright young citizens to conferences of this nature to acquaint themselves with international matters.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member has not been honest in his publication.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the claim is as stated in the article: that he is a bright, young citizen in the public service of Singapore. And it is our policy to send our bright, young, civil servants to attend international conferences. It is to expose them and to acquaint them with international matters so that they will be better officers. Whether they are in the SAF or in the Administrative Service, it does not matter. That is the policy. If the Member for Anson is a gentleman, he should, in fact, print in the next issue of the Hammer an apology to The Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister holding a brief for The Star in this Parliament? Would the Minister please try and answer my question? And the question, I repeat, is: what was the claim of this officer over all the other officers? Were any other officers considered? And what was his claim?
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> And if truth has been missing in any articles printed by any publication, it is my duty to point it out to Members of the House. As to the specific question, I thought I have answered loud and clear. It is our policy to send young civil servants to such conferences so that they would benefit from the exposure. Other officers were, of course, considered. Some were sent earlier - in 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985. Other officers were considered and one was selected.

   <b>SEPARATE HDB SHOP RENTALS FOR RESETTLEMENT CASES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether he will consider having a separate system of Housing and Development Board shop rentals for resettled farmers and shopowners who, despite the discounts granted by the Board, are still finding it difficult to pay their present rentals based on the tender system, in order to alleviate their problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at present, there is already a separate system of HDB shop rentals for resettled shopkeepers. While the rental for public applicants is based on tendered amounts, the resettlement rental is pegged at 90% of the rental paid by the lowest successful tenderer. Furthermore, under this system, resettled shopkeepers pay only 50% of the resettlement rental for the first year. Thereafter, the rental is increased by 10% each year until it reaches the full resettlement rental in the sixth year. Resettled shopkeepers thus enjoy rental concessions for a number of years. Resettled farmers are normally paid a cash grant of $26,000 as part of the resettlement compensation. If they opt for shop premises in lieu of the cash grant, they are also given similar rental concessions for a period of five years. Generally, these concessions work out to be more than the $26,000 cash grant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concessions enjoyed by the resettled shopkeepers are best illustrated by an example. Assuming the market rentals for shops in a neighbourhood centre range from $2,000 per month to $3,000 per month, the rentals for shops reserved for resettlement cases in the same neighbourhood would be pegged at 90% of the lowest market rental of $2,000 per month. The resettlement rental is therefore $1,800 per month. In the first year, a resettled shopkeeper would only be paying a monthly rental based on 50% of the resettlement rental, ie $900 per month. This works out to be only 36% of the mid-point of the rental range for public applicants in the neighbourhood. Although the rental for the resettled shopkeepers would be gradually increased to the full resettlement
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> rental in the sixth year, the final rental of $1,800 per month still amounts to only 72% of the rental range for public applicants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rental concessions enjoyed by a resettled shopkeeper are thus very substantial. Therefore, a resettled shopkeeper with normal business acumen will be able to conduct his business successfully. However, not everyone is endowed with business acumen, be he a resettled shopkeeper or a public applicant of HDB shops. No amount of rental concessions can help the person without the necessary business acumen to succeed in his business.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of opening the libraries on Sundays has been raised in this House before. There are constraints on opening libraries on Sundays because of the shortage of qualified staff.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ang Mo Kio branch library was opened only on the 17th August. Its present opening hours are from 10 am to 9 pm on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing opening hours of the National Library, which are from 8.30 am to 9 pm on weekdays, and its branches are already longer than those of libraries in the other countries with well developed library facilities.

   <b>IMPORT DUTY ON REFINED SUGAR</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Rationale)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry if he will explain the rationale for retaining the import duty on refined sugar after abolition of the excise duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the 1st September of this year the Sugar Industry of Singapore (SIS) was the sole supplier of refined sugar to the domestic market. SIS concluded favourable long term contracts with Australia and Fiji for the supply of raw sugar. In the last 10 years, world sugar prices fluctuated widely but the long term contracts guaranteed us regular supplies of sugar at stable and comparatively low prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation has now changed. There is a world sugar glut, as governments in Europe and the United States are subsidizing their sugar growers. Prices have fallen drastically and do not appear likely to recover to the 1970s levels in the foreseeable future. It is no longer worthwhile to pay a high premium for sugar supplied under the long term contracts. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has therefore decided to liberalize the sugar trade in Singapore. However, this has to be done in stages, as the long term contracts will last till 1987.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first steps were to remove the excise duty on refined sugar and to allow traders to import sugar from overseas, if they preferred, rather than to buy from SIS by removing the requirement for import licences. The excise duty on raw sugar and sugar syrups will also be removed shortly. As a result of these steps, both wholesale and retail prices of refined sugar have fallen by about 15%. Our sugar prices are about the lowest in the region. Firms producing sugar-based products for the local market are now in a better position to compete with imports. Manufacturers who produce for export markets have all along been exempted from the import duty on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sugar. The Government's intention is to eventually free the sugar trade completely and abolish the import duty on sugar.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas):</b> Notwithstanding those long term contracts, the published figures show that the imported raw sugar has dropped by over 30 cents per kilogram. Will the Minister please encourage SIS to pass its savings on to the consumers?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Indeed, SIS's practice has been to pass these savings on to consumers but, as things stand, anybody who wishes to import raw sugar or refined sugar at world prices is free to do so provided he pays the import duty. And, as I have said, the import duty will in due course be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, will the Minister of State state specifically when the import duty will be removed?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, without giving any hostages to fortune, I may say that the long term contracts expire in 1987 and it is our objective to have the sugar trade liberalized by then, if not before then.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what definite steps are being taken by the Government to prevent profiteering by companies, in particular those which enjoy a monopoly in their trade or business.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the best way to prevent profiteering by companies is to ensure that there is free competition. This is why MTI has been vigilant in ensuring that as free a market as possible exists in our domestic trade, particularly where essential commodities are concerned. Where by the nature of the trade a single company has a substantial monopoly, a completely free market is not possible. However, even in such cases, the Government should not rush to interfere by controlling prices itself. Doing so would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> require a cumbersome bureaucratic machinery, which consumers would ultimately have to pay for. Besides, recent experience has shown that the Government is not always in the best position to know what the correct prices should be. I am sure hon. Members will remember examples over the last few months. The Government's policy is therefore to allow firms to set their own prices. However, where there is clear evidence that a cartel is fixing prices unfairly, or a monopoly is abusing its position to raise prices, the Government will not hesitate to act against them. The general knowledge that the Government will do so has helped to keep companies in line. So far, this policy has served us well.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in view of the answer that has been given, does the Minister of State consider the recent price increase of newspapers belonging to the Singapore Press Holdings an act of profiteering and an abuse of its position as a monopoly in Singapore? If so, what action does he propose to take?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer must be no, otherwise the action would have been taken already.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, could the Minister of State advise why the answer is no? If I got him correctly, he said that there should be competition. In this case it is a company which enjoys a monopoly in newpaper publication and yet no action has been taken.

  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not holding any brief for any newspaper, but I think we have to look at the overall behaviour of companies over a period of time before deciding whether or not the companies are responsible and are justifiable in their pricing decisions. I would say that although the Straits Times is a monopoly, it is not a monopoly enforced by the Government and it is, in fact, open to anybody who wishes to break into the business to do so.

   <b>TEMPORARY GRADUATE TEACHERS SCHEME</b>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong</b> asked the Minister for Education, with reference to the recruitment of temporary untrained graduate teachers, (a) what alternatives have been considered; (b) why graduates, who read non-teaching subjects at university and previously were considered not suitable for teaching, are now considered suitable; (c) whether the two-week training is sufficient for them to cope with Secondary 5 pupils; and (d) why 600 teachers are needed for 8,000 pupils in the two levels in 1986, as it works out to a teacher/pupil ratio of 1:6.66, assuming that the 4,000 Secondary 5 students are an addition to the present 4,000 Secondary 4 students.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of introducing the Temporary Graduate Teachers Scheme is to help redress the general shortage of graduate teachers in our secondary schools. The scheme was not introduced simply to meet the shortfall of teachers required to teach the larger number of Secondary 5N pupils expected as a result of the recent relaxation of the promotion criteria to Secondary 5N.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of introducing the Temporary Graduate Teachers Scheme, the Ministry could have recruited more relief teachers or recruited teachers from overseas. Of these two options, recruiting more relief teachers is hardly a solution. Relief teachers should be employed to cover short-term vacancies due to permanent staff going on sick leave or maternity leave or short courses or to meet exigencies of service. The majority of our relief teachers are untrained and turnover is high. Sir, I do not see how this option
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> has any advantage over the Temporary Graduate Teachers Scheme which has at least the benefit of proper and standardized selection procedures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next option - the recruitment of teachers from overseas - is certainly one possibility. However, Sir, I see no reason why we should adopt this option until we have exhausted the possibility of recruiting enough teachers from our own graduates in Singapore. Only, Sir, if we are unable to attract enough teachers from our own graduates should we resort to recruiting from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> The Ministry would of course prefer that all graduate teachers, including the temporary teachers, should have taken teaching subjects as part of their university courses. However, graduates in Engineering, for example, could teach Mathematics and Physics, and some of these graduates may find that even if they had not previously considered being teachers they may be well disposed, after a year in the scheme, to take up teaching as a career.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the teachers to be recruited under this scheme will be given a two-week training course which is meant to give the graduates some basic knowledge about pupil and class management. These graduate teachers will be deployed mainly to teach the lower secondary levels. They will be supervised by the principals and the senior teachers. Students who are preparing for the 'N' level and the 'O' level examinations will be taught by experienced teachers.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the implication of that question is that the Government has encouraged the creation of that monopoly. This is far from the truth. The House was informed on 19th October last year and 23rd July this year that the Government neither directed nor initiated the merger of the newspaper companies. The newspaper companies decided to merge on their own, purely on business grounds. Like any company, newspaper companies are directly accountable to their readers and it is for them to

Such communication can be in the form of voice, picture or computer data, and can help individuals and businesses to increase their productivity.

  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a number of tax concessions were announced on 26th July and 31st August 1985. It was further announced on 24th October that the tax on PUB gas and electricity charges would be suspended for two years. It is estimated that the combined effect of these tax concessions will result in a revenue reduction to Government of around $550 million in a full year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, statutory boards have announced tariff reductions which will result in revenue reductions amounting to $120 million per year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total reduction in public sector revenue, resulting from the various tax concessions and statutory board tariff reductions announced since the 1985-86 Budget was approved, is estimated at $670 million in a full year.

  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Dr Lee Boon Yang) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to answer on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of preparing answers to parliamentary questions varies a great deal and depends on the nature and complexity of the questions posed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to the taxpayer arises principally from two components:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Imputed cost of Ministers', senior officials' and clerical officers' time involved in preparing the answers and also overtime costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Computer time spent on extraction and compilation of statistical data.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most questions raised by Members of Parliament relate to Government policies or are requests for information of general interest. Answers to these questions can be provided without incurring excessive effort or costs as the Government already has collected this information either for publication or for planning purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are occasions when requests are made for detailed statistical information which is not readily available so that the compilation of an answer will require much effort and cost. Members are, however, strongly urged to consider carefully their requests for information so as to ensure that public funds are not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> wasted on the production of answers to questions which have little public relevance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an example, Members of this House may like to know that the Member for Potong Pasir has a Question for Written Answer addressed to the Hon. Minister for National Development. He asks for the number of HDB tenants who are in arrears in the mortgage instalments for more than 60 days from the years 1975 to 1985 with breakdown in amounts by nine categories. The Hon. Minister has, in his written answer, replied that it would cost not less than $200,000 in terms of manpower and computer cost for HDB to provide all the information.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure Members that where information sought by Members' questions are of public interest and relevant to the good performance of this Government, no effort will be spared to provide the answers. But where questions are asked seeking excessive statistical detail without a thought for the cost consequences, Government may find it necessary to provide partial answers so as not to waste public funds.

  <br>

  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has taken over all the family planning activities of the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board, and most of the Board's staff have been absorbed into the Ministry since 1st
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> April 1985. The level of family planning activities has not been affected by this change.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's Maternal and Child Health Service has all along been chiefly responsible for the provision of clinical services and will continue to do so. Education of the public on family planning has become part of the health education activities undertaken by the Ministry's Training and Health Education Department. Counselling of women to accept family planning and sterilization will continue to be provided in the clinics and hospitals. The evaluation of family planning programmes and the monitoring of birth and fertility rates are now being undertaken by the Research and Evaluation Section of the Ministry of Health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is concerned about the current level of fertility which is below replacement level. If this low level of fertility persists, Singapore will be faced with the problem of a declining number of births and, early in the next century, a negative population growth and a rapidly ageing population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has observed that the current low birth rate in Singapore is due to low fertility among certain sections of the population, those women with '0' and 'A' levels, Polytechnic and University graduates. This is attributable to a sizeable proportion of women remaining single or marrying at a late age and having less than two children. The Government is taking various measures to improve the pattern of marriage and the imbalance in procreation. These include the setting up of the Social Development Unit and the encouragement of public and private organizations to provide child care facilities. On its part, the Ministry has stepped up its counselling programme to advise couples to have two children before considering sterilization.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is currently working closely with other Ministries to monitor the situation and to identify what further actions can be taken to raise fertility to replacement level.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng</b> asked the Minister for Health, in the light of the experience in the implementation of the Medisave Scheme, whether he will consider (i) liberalizing the use of the Medisave Scheme such as to cover patients other than the immediate members of the family and private hospital charges; and (ii) setting a ceiling on the amount to be retained in the Medisave Account; and, if so, when will such extension of the Scheme be effected, and what will be the maximum amount to be retained in the Medisave Account, stating how this amount is arrived at.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> The philosophy behind the Medisave Scheme is that the individual should set aside a small sum of money each month in the form of compulsory savings to meet the cost of hospitalization should he or any of his immediate family fall ill and require hospitalization. It is also to ensure that the individual will have sufficient savings to meet the cost ofhospitalization in his old age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the experience so far, and taking into consideration the balances in individual Medisave Accounts, the Government has been studying how to liberalize utilization of the Medisave Scheme without deviating from the basic objectives of the Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are the likely modifications:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Extending the Medisave Scheme to cover expenses in private hospitals. The Government is ready to extend Medisave to private hospitals along the same line as that for the National University Hospital and to the same extent as in the Govern-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment hospitals. How soon this can be achieved will depend on how quickly the private hospitals and the private doctors can come to an agreement amongst themselves on an equitable and acceptable implementation procedure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Extension of Medisave for Grandparents. This is in line with Government policy to encourage filial piety. However, the grandparents must be Singaporeans, permanent residents, work permit or employment pass holders. Medisave Accounts will not be allowed to be overdrawn to pay the hospital bills of grandparents. We expect to implement this within the next three months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Setting a limit on Medisave Balances. Setting a limit on Medisave Balances makes good sense, as it will further encourage account holders to stay healthy. The Ministry's statisticians are presently studying what this limit should be. The quantum must be large enough to provide for the expected hospitalization expenses of the account holder's grandparents, parents, spouse and children. It must also take into account that topping up will be available in-between hospitalization episodes since the account holder will still be working.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this modification will require amendments to the Central Provident Fund Act, it will probably take six to nine months to implement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Extension to 100% of Class A bills in Government hospitals. The Ministry is currently analyzing the Medisave withdrawal pattern and balances to ascertain the feasibility of increasing the scale of withdrawal for Class A wards from the existing 80% to 100%. We expect the study to be completed within the next three to four months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Catastrophic Health Insurance. The Government recognizes that persons with prolonged or major illnesses may not have sufficient balances to pay their hospital bills. Hence, some form of medical insurance scheme would have to be introduced to supplement the present Medisave Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is considering a catastrophic or major medical insurance scheme to cover certain major and high-cost medical conditions. The Ministry is holding discussions with the health insurers in Singapore and hopes to finalize such a scheme within the next year.

  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.
  <b>Mr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Acting Minister for Labour (a) how many new job openings have been created since the beginning of 1985 up to the latest convenient date; and (b) whether there are sufficient job opportunities for new job seekers as well as retrenched workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry does not compile statistics on new job openings created by establishments. Employers are not obliged to report such data. In any case such information can be misleading because new job openings in some establishments may be offset by job losses in other establishments. Job vacancies also arise from resignation, retirement, deaths and other causes not related to new job creation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What my Ministry does is to keep track of the overall employment situation. In the first half of 1985, there was a net job loss of 36,200 jobs mostly from the construction and manufacturing sectors. About 7,000 Singaporean workers were retrenched during this period whilst larger numbers of foreign workers returned home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment rate as at June 1985 has been estimated at about 4.1%. This is slightly higher than the average unemployment rate of about 2.9% over the last four years when the labour market was very tight and large numbers of foreign workers had to be imported.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1985, the Employment Service Department of my Ministry received approximately one notified job vacancy to each new job registrant. This compares with 2.2 notified job vacancies to each new job registrant in September last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recession, it has become more difficult for new job seekers and retrenched workers to find work. Nevertheless, employment opportunities, for example in the hotel industry, are still there if our workers are prepared to make the adjustment and accept lower paid jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Vasoo:</b> Sir, could the Minister tell us the steps that have been taken to assist older workers who are retrenched?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, what my Ministry does is to offer assistance to retrenched workers. But I can give some information to show that the situation, in fact, is not so bad. For example, in the third quarter of this year, my Ministry offered employment assistance to about 2,000 retrenched workers, including older ones. 533 of them came to my Department. This means that about 70% did not even bother to respond. And of the number who were referred to jobs, 34% did not attend job interviews. This seems to suggest that people are still able to find their own jobs and do not need assistance from my Department. But if they need assistance or if they have trouble in finding jobs, they can come to my Department and we will try our best to help them find jobs. What my Ministry can
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> do is to refer them to employers who have vacancies. But it is up to the job seeker to make the adjustments and show to the employer that it is worth his while to employ him. We, of course, try to counsel the older workers about their job expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, would the Minister say, where jobs were offered to these retrenched workers, whether the wages were of the same level or were much reduced?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the situation varies from case to case. The vacancies that we have in the Employment Service Department cover a wide range of jobs. For example, they vary from professional and technical workers, all the way down to clerical, sales, service, and production workers. But it is true that in this period many retrenched workers, have to make an adjustment to their pay expectations.

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise on a point of order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What do you mean by "point of order"?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The point of order concerns the petition that was presented to this House.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you mean a point of clarification?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is also a point of order, and it concerns the petition that was presented - whether the Standing Orders have been followed in dealing with this petition that was presented to the House. It is a point of order. It concerns Standing Orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Why do you say that it was not carried out? It was carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is the question I am asking, Mr Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a point of clarification then.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The question is simply this, Mr Speaker, Sir. There was presented to this House, not just to the Committee but to this House, Parliament, a petition from a member of the public to the peoples' representatives gathered here. I understand from the member of the public concerned that he has had no reply to the petition that was presented to this House. My first question then is: should there not have been a reply to the man? ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order. I do not see how this is a point of order. A point of order arises during the course of a debate. The Member cannot just stand up and raise a point of order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is a point of clarification.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Where does the clarification arise?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is on the Standing Orders that I am asking.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Please quote the Standing Order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I say it is a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir, because it concerns Standing Orders of this House.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not agree with you, Mr Jeyaretnam. If you want to raise a point of clarification, I will let you carry on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you, Sir. That is sufficient for me. All right, on a point of clarification then, Mr Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, there was a petition presented. Should not the man have had a reply from this House to the petition that was presented? Maybe this is the first petition that has been received by this House. But that does not afford an excuse for not giving a reply to the man.

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No. There was a Report to this Parliament from the Committee. I am talking about a reply to the man who presented the petition.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that so? Under which Standing Order must I send a reply?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no specific provision in the Standing Orders. [Interruption].

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I carry on, Mr Speaker, Sir?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are making certain allegations that I have not sent any reply. But a copy of the Report was sent to you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I was only sent this Report from the Public Petitions Committee of this House. But that is not the reply from Parliament. This is the point that I am making, Mr Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Surely that is a reply.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is not. With the deepest respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, to you, this is not a reply of Parliament. As I understand Standing Orders, once a Select Committee of this House ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you point out to me which Standing Order states that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is Standing Order 100. It says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Every Select Committee shall make a report to Parliament upon the matters referred to them ---' .
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, that is what I have done.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> ' --- before the end of the session in which the Committee was appointed, and if a Committee finds itself unable to conclude its investigations before the end of the session, it shall so report to Parliament.'

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I carry on in spite of all these interruptions?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not sure which part of the Standing Orders you are referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order. The Member has quoted a Standing Order which has absolutely no relevance to the point that he is making. If he wants to debate this matter, Sir, I think he should file a substantive motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> If I may say so, Mr Jeyaretnam, you were referring to Standing Order 100. Can you look at Standing Order 100, paragraph (5), which states:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any Member may, after not less than seven clear days' notice, move in Parliament that the report of a Select Committee, other than a report of a Select Committee on a Bill, be adopted.' You have not done so. You have been given well over seven clear days to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will you hear me on my complaint about the way in which ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no ground for a complaint. Everything has been carried out according to Standing Orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is my contention, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it has not.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Because there is a Report ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It was sent to you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> --- from this Public Petitions Committee to Parliament and Parliament must consider that Report. Parliament has not considered that Report yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Under which part of the Standing Orders must Parliament consider this particular Report?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> When it comes to a question on the Committee of Privileges, there is a requirement for the Leader of the House to give notice of a motion expressing the opinion of Parliament in regard to the Report. That is a question concerning privilege and this petition was a question of the privileges of Parliament.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It does say so, Mr Speaker, Sir. If you look at the Report of the Public Petitions Committee ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> But it is not the Privileges Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It concerns the privilege of this House that the petitioner prays that the legal proceedings instituted against him for defamation arising from his representation submitted by him to the Select Committee on the Companies (Amendment) Bill be declared a breach of the privileges of Parliament. It concerns the privilege of this House.
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir. But I am saying to the Leader of the House and to the Members here that this is a matter on which the House should consider the Report.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is so.

  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the achievements of the Housing and Development Board in the last 25 years; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commending the valuable contributions made by the Management, Staff and Workers of the HDB in achieving this; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscious that HDB's success has enabled the majority of Singaporeans to be proud home owners;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urges the Government to take suitable measures to assist those citizens in the lower income group who do not yet own homes to become proud home owners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are today a nation of proud home owners. In 1959, when the PAP swept into power, it was confronted with seemingly intractable problems. The immediate tasks were to provide jobs for the jobless and homes for the homeless. Sir, in 1959, it was estimated that a quarter million people were living in generated slums and another 300,000 in squatter areas. The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT), which was set up in 1927 by the then colonial Government, had managed to build only 23,000 units of public housing over a period of 32 years. The SIT flats accommodated about 9% of our 1.6 million population. Sir, the PAP Government therefore took immediate action to tackle the problem of public housing. The HDB was thus established in February 1960 to undertake the function of providing low-cost public housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today, after 25 years, the HDB has completed over 500,000 units of flats, accommodating over 80% of the total population of about 2.6 million people. This is indeed no mean task.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Today, Singapore's public housing record is the envy of many people and nations. Sir, last week I happened to be in Wushan in South Korea where I had the occasion to meet leading members of the business community. South Korea, as you probably know, has tremendous economic achievements and better performance records than Singapore. They lamented that only 15% of the population are housed in low-cost public housing, where our record, Sir, is well over 80%. Mr Speaker, Sir, this achievement has been made possible because of Government's strong commitment to its public housing policy and Singaporeans' full support for its implementation. The Government's goal is to provide sufficient flats for all Singaporeans who need them and at prices they can afford. Moreover, out of half a million flats more than 75% are owner-occupied under the Home Ownership Scheme. For the year 2000 we can expect virtually all HDB residents to be home-owners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the HDB in the last 24 years has successfully completed four Five-Year Building Programmes, and it is now at the tail-end of the fifth programme which ends in December 1985. This House should congratulate the HDB for its splendid achievement on its 25th Anniversary, which it is celebrating now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as at March 31, 1985, the properties under its management consist of over half a million flats, as well as a large number of shops, factories, car parks and a host of other facilities, such as swimming and sports complexes, town and neighbourhood parks, food centres, markets and offices. I have tabled these cumulative achievements of HDB. These Tables (Cols. 653 - 654) I and II have already been circulated to hon. Members.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the HDB's achievements underscore the commitment and the determination of the Singapore Government to provide not only a home for every citizen but also to build a viable urban community for people to live, work, shop, rest, relax and educate their children. All the time, however, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> HDB was also learning from its own experience and thinking of ways and means to improve conditions for future residents. In 1962, Queenstown, the HDB's first new town, took shape. Built on the neighbourhood concept, it became the basis for future generations of new towns. In 1964, Toa Payoh added another landmark in the Singapore scene.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next two 5-Year Building Programmes (1966 to 1975) saw HDB putting greater efforts to improve facilities and amenities for residents. More emphasis was placed on quality. Hawker centres, shopping and recreational facilities were also included. The estates that were completed included Telok Blangah and Marine Parade. By the end of 1975 a total of more than 180,000 units of shops and flats were completed against a target of only 173,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the completion of another 134,000 units in the fourth Building Programme, 65% of our population began living in HDB flats. By this time the lifestyle of Singaporeans had so changed that the "HDB Family" was recognized as a typical Singapore family. In fact, HDB also made several policy changes and decisions aimed to preserve the family unit, especially our Asian extended family lifestyle. In this connection, the Joint Ballot Scheme and the Multi-tier Family Scheme were introduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To even encourage upward mobility, in 1979 the HDB flat owners were allowed after five years of occupation to sell their flats in the open market and to purchase another bigger HDB flat. Before, however, all HDB flats had to be sold back to the Board at the original selling price. Recent revisions in the resale policy have also given flat owners more flexible options.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, income ceilings governing the eligibility criteria of HDB flats have also been revised over the years to enable those with rising income who could not afford private housing to purchase HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the start of the fifth 5-Year Building Programme in 1981, there was an
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> upsurge in the demand for HDB flats, resulting in more applicants on the waiting list. Immediately the building target was revised upwards from 100,000 to 155,000. By 1983, the waiting list had been significantly reduced. It was during this time that the HDB introduced mechanization and prefabricated flats successfully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1983, the first HDB executive flats were completed to meet the housing needs of the middle-class in our population. I am told that the Board is confident that by December 1985, the number of dwelling units completed will be over 180,000, exceeding its revised target of 155,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good physical housing is no guarantee for good and harmonious community living. Experience all over the world has shown that it is all too easy for public housing to degenerate into urban slums. This is so whether it be in advanced countries or in developing countries. Fortunately, for us, HDB towns were saved from falling into this trap by the creation of a harmonious and thriving community within each of our existing housing estates and new towns. This is not entirely due to good fortune. It was achieved through a mix of right Government policy on the one hand and hard work and cooperation on the part of the HDB, its residents and our community and grassroots leaders on the other hand. By having a mixed community in each housing estate and new town, this ensures that each represents a cross-section of the population distribution in Singapore. This prevents the formation of enclaves or closed communities. For this reason, Sir, the HDB discontinued the building of exclusive HUDC estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, tremendous efforts have been made by Residents' Committees, Citizens' Consultative Committees and grassroots organizations to ensure that living in HDB estates is a pleasant and harmonious experience. This is a goal which cannot be achieved by good housing design alone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few minutes I have tried to sketch the achievements of the HDB over the last 25 years. I would like now to turn to the people who have made this possible. If you consider the achievements of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the physical building which you see as the hardware, now let us look at the software behind the scheme. Permit me to propose a general salute to the unsung heroes of the HDB. Here, I am referring to the 13,906 management and staff who have been in the front line of the Republic's battle against homelessness. This House should commend the valuable contributions made by the HDB's dedicated and harkworking workforce as well as qualified management team. Since the inception of HDB in 1960, the staff strength has risen more than ten-fold, from over 1,000 employees to the present strength of nearly 14,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB management team, Sir, must be congratulated for effectively implementing well thought-out administrative policies, sound planning and designs and an efficient implementation system. These are the silent heroes who strive ceaselessly to make our housing estates clean and the environment habitable. Let us also not forget the maintenance crew who provide 24-hour emergency service to all constituencies to ensure that nobody gets trapped in our lifts. To all the HDB staff, especially the counter staff, we owe them a big Thank You for their patience in dealing with the public. A word of thanks should also go to the sweepers, counter clerks and all the other supporting staff throughout the 32 Area Offices around Singapore. I would submit, however, that the management of HDB continue to explore avenues to improve the HDB-resident interface. I can foresee that the HDB would be subject to increasing pressure for more, better and faster services and amenities in the years ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opening remarks I mentioned that we are a nation of proud house owners. Sir, home ownership is the cornerstone of our nation building. It gives every home-owning Singaporean a genuine stake in this land of ours. Singapore is today a property-owning democracy. Instead of the inevitable class struggle between the haves and the have-nots, we have in Singapore a healthy battle among Singaporeans each striving for a bigger slice of the Republic's real estate. Indeed, the lower and middle income groups can
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> look forward to constant improvement of the standard of living and eventually owning their own flats. The provision of large scale public housing in Singapore has contributed in no small measure to the stable, social and political climate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the home ownership scheme was introduced in 1964, overwhelming demand to own an HDB flat did not gather momentum until 1968. With the introduction of the Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Act in 1968, purchasers were permitted to use their CPF savings to meet down-payments and monthly payments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the rising general income level, and to enable a greater proportion of the population to own HDB flats, the income ceiling has been periodically reviewed. To further encourage Singaporeans to own their own homes, people living in squattered areas or rent-controlled premises which are affected by public redevelopment are given priority in the allocation of flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has gradually avoided disastrous policies of unlimited subsidies associated with the welfare state which are, in fact, crippling some of the industrial countries today. However, having said this, there does appear to be pockets of our less well-off Singaporeans who do not seem to be able to afford to buy HDB flats. One estimate gives the percentage of such Singaporeans as about 15-20%. According to the HDB, about 26% of its flats are still being rented out to Singaporeans who are either waiting to buy flats or for some reason are not eligible to own flats. However, there are also some Singaporeans who just cannot afford to buy their flats. I think it is our duty to help our fellow Singaporeans to move out of this trap.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's stated policy, and here I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our people can enjoy a better quality of life by 1999. There will be no unsewered households, slums or environmental pollution. Every family will own a home for we shall help the 15-20% lower income group to do so.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to various reasons, maybe lack of education, old age, personal circumstances, the 15-20% of our population
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> belong to this lower income group. They have not reaped much of the benefits of our 25 years of economic progress. Most of them are either odd-job workers, casual labourers or self-employed and are thus without the benefit of CPF. If nothing is done to assist them, then this lower income group living in their cramped flats will become more and more detached from the mainstream of our society and it will remain a dark spot in our social fabric. The $10,000 cash grant is one of the schemes introduced by the Government to assist the people in the lower income group. However, for various reasons, response to this scheme has been poor so far.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree with what the First Deputy Prime Minister has stated in this House, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government's approach to the problem of the poor is therefore high economic growth, universal education and skill training, small families, home ownership and working wives. It has in large measure succeeded although it has not eliminated poverty altogether. Our experience has confirmed that welfare and generous handouts are not the solution to the problem.'
  <br>
  <br>I submit, Sir, that it will take considerable time to solve the problem of the lower income group. As such, I believe special interim measures may be necessary. This has been articulated by many of my PAP colleagues in this House during the debate on the Presidential Address earlier in the year. The Government may want to consider some of the following measures to assist the poor in our society to own their own homes:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there is this question of reduction in the deposit for the purchase of flats. The current deposit level appears rather high for the lower income group. Another measure which Government could seriously consider to assist the lower income group is to extend the current repayment period of 20 years. And thirdly, as a further incentive, Government could consider offering lower interest rates for the people in the lower income group.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the above measures, if implemented, will enable some to become home owners quickly. The long term solu-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tion, I believe, will really be to increase the income levels of the people through higher productivity. If this can be achieved, then the lower income group can own their own homes and improve their quality of life. I would strongly urge the Government to work out a scheme quickly which will enable these lower income Singaporeans to join the rank of proud home owners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to offer my heartiest congratulations to the HDB on its 25th Anniversary and would urge the management and staff of HDB to scale even greater heights.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>12.34 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the name HDB is now a household name, a name which Singaporeans have identified as a provider of not only a roof over our heads for the last 25 years but also one who made clean, orderly and hygienic high-rise living a reality in Singapore. To most of us, it was really a dream come true. HDB has provided flats for 81% of the population. To the unsung, efficient, men and women of the HDB, we thereforeextend our heartfelt thanks and we all wish HDB a happy 25th Anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past 25 years, HDB has also provided hawker centres, wet markets, shops, offices and industrial premises. Thousands of Singaporeans have benefited and depend on these facilities for a living. For this, we thank HDB again. However, Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few years, especially during the property boom period, the rents of HDB outlets were pegged to prevailing market conditions which were then enjoying high growth. Despite steadily increasing rents, these tenants did not complain because they could still maintain a profitable margin as there was high demand. Today, the market situation has changed for the worse. The demand has dropped. The tenants of shops and factories are the hardest hit. Many of the small businesses in the HDB industrial estates are supporting industries to big multi-nationals
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> operating in Singapore. The multi-nationals' slow-down has also affected them terribly. Help is really and urgently needed and we must not allow them to go under.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Mr Speaker, Sir, the availability of such supporting industries is an attractive and important consideration for potential investors who are deciding to set up production in Singapore. It is a very important competitive edge for Singapore to project the image that our supporting industries are still available even during this worldwide economic downturn. I strongly believe that the Government, through the HDB, can help by lowering rents. May I urge fellow colleagues to join me in this appeal, and we hope that HDB will consider further lowering rents till the good times are here again.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that championing the cause of the poor has always been the delight and joy of all politicians all over the world. Many great speeches and impressive rhetorics have chosen the cause of the poor as their favourite theme. The poor will always be with us. Even America, the world's richest and most powerful nation, has the poor with them. We too have our share. We still have them now. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, with this Government, there is a very distinct and outstanding difference. Its unique difference lies in this: that its concern for the poor has always been translated into action.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this not because I am a Government Backbencher. Before I came into this House, I had the privilege of having lived in poor and unhygienic Chinatown - "privilege" in the sense that it has given me the background experience to compare realistically. It is not uncommon for a family of five to seven to cram into a room no bigger than a bedroom of any HDB flat. In the place I stayed, about 10 families shared a toilet and a bathroom. Today's one-room HDB flat would be considered a luxurious apartment then. There were two or three governments who governed Singapore but it was only when the PAP came into power that events began to take shape. I was poor. I know what life is like in cramped and stuffy cubicles. I am one of those who have benefited from this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government's concrete action. Now I know what it is to live in comfortable surroundings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many Singaporeans, I do not wish to go back to the living conditions of yesteryears. But for some various reason, there is a small section of our fellow Singaporeans who still find it difficult to keep pace with the rapid economic progress despite Government's efforts in helping them. Nonetheless, looking at them from a Third World poverty criteria, our poor is only relatively poor compared to those of us who have more. With the benefit of hindsight, coupled with the fact that I am now a Government Backbencher, I want to do my part. I join my fellow colleagues in urging the Government to continue to help the poor and, in this instance, to help them own their own homes. I fully support the measures suggested by my colleague from Chong Boon. In addition, I want to suggest a long term measure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the Government should ensure that this section of the population are gainfully employed during the tenure of their loan for the purchase of their own home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That their children be exempted from paying any form of fees and be given free textbooks from pre-primary to tertiary level until one member is able to subsidize family expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that this would give them a greater sense of dignity than just mere handouts. I further suggest that the Government consider allowing their richer relatives help pay part of their flat from their excess CPF. Secondly, that the richer fellow Singaporeans be encouraged to donate part of their excess CPF savings towards initial deposits required for the purchase of their flats. This should be done through a Government agency to avoid possible embarrassment or obligations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are confident that our appeal will not fall on deaf ears. The reason for our confidence is very simple. You see, Mr Speaker, Sir, the players have changed but the goals, aspirations, and the determination to continually better the lives of all Singaporeans remain the same.

  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join my colleagues in this House in commending the HDB for its achievements in the last 25 years. Most of us know that without the HDB we would not be what we are today, living in a clean, green and safe environment. The HDB has done much to change our way of life - from the slum dwellings in unhygienic and insanitary conditions in the sixties and, for some of us, even in the seventies, to the warmth and comfort of modern HDB homes, be they 3-room, 4-room, 5-room, executive apartments or even HUDC flats. Prices of HDB flats are now within the reach of the majority of our population. The waiting time for a flat has been reduced from what used to be five years or more to a mere two years. Today, 81% of our population live in HDB estates which are well equipped with facilities, such as markets, shops, clinics, schools, recreational facilities and social amenities. As if providing a clean and green environment is not enough, the HDB went a step further, to form Residents' Committees to promote social cohesiveness and community spirit among HDB flat dwellers. Today,the RC movement has been successful and has become a way of life for most HDB flat dwellers. All this would not have been possible without the foresight, hardwork and efforts of the management, staff and workers of the HDB in the last 25 years. May I say, Three Cheers to the HDB for a job well done!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are debating ways and means on how the HDB and the Government could help the lower income group own their own homes, which I support wholeheartedly, we should also draw HDB's attention to the need to keep maintenance and conservancy charges low, within the reach of this group of people. How can HDB do this? Yes, automate and mechanize its services and operations to improve productivity and keep costs down; perhaps even design special HDB flats for this group of people where the maintenance cost is kept to a minimum. But I believe, Sir, in the long term the solution is to help educate these residents, these people in the lower income group, on what
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> they themselves can do to help keep their own estates clean, green and safe.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well known fact that till today, we still hear of complaints by HDB residents about littering, lift vandalism, urinating in the lifts, damage to public telephones installed at the void decks, and so on. From my observations, as an MP for 10 months and as an HDB resident for the last 20 years, first staying in a 3-room rental flat, subsequently upgraded to a 3-room purchase flat, and presently a 5-room purchase flat, I find these undesirable anti-social acts of littering and vandalism to be more common in the 1-room and 2-room flats, and these are largely rental flats, and less so in the purchased 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats. Perhaps it has got something to do with the socio-economic background of residents living in those flats. Perhaps, residents of rental flats are less responsible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that the HDB intensify its community development programme and embark on an intensive education programme to help educate our residents, especially those in the lower income group, on the do's and don'ts with regard to their social responsibility and role in the upkeep of their own estate. Only by encouraging and getting them to look after their own estates will a good living environment prevail and maintenance and conservancy charges be kept low within their reach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has made a good start recently. Its recent Area Office Open House programme was a success. There were interactions between HDB staff and residents. Residents were shown how to be more considerate to their neighbours and even how to do simple plumbing work at home. I think we should have more of such activities for our residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I may be exaggerating or am unnecessarily concerned about the ability of the lower income group, when they eventually own their own homes, to pay maintenance charges and help look after their own estates. Buying or renting a house is like buying or renting a car. When one rents a car, one tends to spend less care on it. But when one drives one's own car, one tends to be more careful. What is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> more, when a car owner is on a tight budget, he will soon find the shortest route to travel and perhaps even maintain and service his own car. I hope this will also apply to our lower income group residents when they eventually own their own homes through the help and encouragement of the HDB and the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion by the Member for Chong Boon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 25 years of public housing programme has changed not only the physical but the social landscape of Singapore. Lifestyles of families, children and the young have changed. In fact, for many families, there is dramatic change - the way family lives has been organized. Mr Speaker, Sir, never in the history of public housing have so many people gained so much from governmental efforts to provide homes for people. I must say that credit must be given to the many people who had a hand in shaping our housing programmes for the last 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having relocated about 81% of our population in various public housing estates, the HDB has become a convenient target for social blame because it deals basically with issues from cradle to grave. The House, I think, has given sufficient critical comments. The Opposition too have given critical comments. The difference is that the comments by PAP parliamentarians are well-researched, documented, supported with sufficient evidence to get constructive programmes organized and done. Despite all these pressures and demands by the public, the Board has attempted to remain on course to do its best.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am concerned about is the issues which will arise in the next five to 10 years. I feel that HDB has to become more sensitive to the social and demographic changes and the needs of the people living in the various public housing estates. It has to gear itself to be more socially responsive to some of the social challenges ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what are these social challenges that the Housing Board needs to respond? I will just identify a few of them for the Board to think through in the next five to 10 years so that its social management perspective can be further strengthened. Some housing estates will have a growing number of elderly residents. This will be acute in older estates where more young people have been resettled into new housing estates. In view of this situation, it will be important for the Board to modify the existing facilities so as to attract more young people into these estates, and at the same time to make these estates more accessible, more conducive, to the growing elderly population in the next five to 10 years. Currently, about 21% of the HDB households, representing 108,745 households, are living in 1-room and 2-room flats. They are low income families. It is difficult for them to become home owners because the social and economic cost is too much for them to shoulder. This sector of the population will always find it difficult to meet payments when they become home owners. It will be desirable for HDB to waive the 20% deposit required, and perhaps consider extension of the loan repayment, to help this sector of people who wish to become home owners. Even with these considerations, there will still be a small number who will not be able to make it. I think the rental scheme should still be made available to this lot of people who have difficulties in moving into home ownership. I feel particularly concerned for this sector of people. More attention will have to be given to the building of social community organisation and infrastructure programmes programmes to help these residents to help themselves in solving their problems, and to encourage them to assist in the maintenance of the environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that it is time we reviewed the way in which social services and other community efforts, in terms of programmes, can be channelled to this sector. There are increasing number of children who are growing in this environment. And if we are looking at the cycle of poverty trap of families, then I feel that the Board must liberalize by giving facilities or make provision for facilities such as social facilities and facilities for programmes, to be organized for this sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also anticipate that there will be some changes in the social texture of the older housing estates. It is probable that they will not have a good social mix of people when the better-off move out. The neighbourhood will become less resourceful in tackling its problems at the local level. Therefore, there is a need for HDB to rethink ways to rejuvenate the older neighbourhoods in order to make them more attractive to people who have the potential to contribute and be attracted to live in these estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, many housing estates will age further in the next five years. More demands and pressures for maintenance tasks can be anticipated. In order that the Board may respond fairly quickly to these tasks, it will be necessary for the Board to decide decentralizing some of its decision-making processes to the estate level. Estate officers can be given more powers to deal with localized neighbourhood problems. In doing so, the estate will be able to galvanize itself and to mobilize the residents together to build a better social environment. I feel that perhaps a Residents' Enquiry Counter could be established in the Area Office so that residents themselves will feel comfortable when approaching the HDB to deal with problems relating to the neighbourhood, or to deal with issues that the residents may face with regard to the maintenance of their homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly too, I feel that when new estates are built, there is a need for the Board to build the Area Office when residents are moving into these new estates. By having the new Area Office located in new towns, problems related to new residents could be tackled as quickly as possible. A better rapport could be built between new estates Area Offices and new residents and through their mutual cooperation, the estates will then have its social throb and be better socially organized. The neighbourhood problems will be solved together with cooperation from the HDB. I thank you, Sir.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will report to the House on: (i) his discussions with the Chinese leaders on his recent visit to China; (ii) his discussions with President Reagan on his recent visit to the United States; and (iii) the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in the Bahamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the discussions which I had with the government leaders on my recent visits to China, the United States and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in the Bahamas have been extensively covered in my press conferences and reports in the press and on TV. I have no new items of information to disclose. If Members have any specific questions, whether or not arising from these reports, I shall be happy to answer them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, supplementary questions for the Prime Minister. First of all, if I may take the trips in their sequence. On the China trip, may I know what was the reason for taking such a large delegation and, particularly, what was the role and purpose of the Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office in this delegation?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I ask, when he uses words like "large" and "small", whether he can count? Would he let me know how many there were on the delegation?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Prime Minister not aware of the number that he took with him to China? We were told that there were at least 30 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is that a statement of fact that he is making?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am asking you. Are you saying that you did not take a team of 30 to China with you? And if you did not, how many did you take? It is as simple as that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not count the members in my delegation. I know the principal aides who accompany me, and the Ministers. And the official members of the delegation include secretaries, and people in charge of baggage and other transportational problems. I thought I carried a smaller team in 1985 than I did in 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Prime Minister please enlighten this House a little bit more? These things cannot be kept secret. May we know what was the function and the role of the Senior Minister in his Office?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is one of my closest colleagues. He shares his advice when I seek them. And if I did not think he was useful, I would not have brought him along.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What insights did he bring into the problems that you were discussing with the Chinese leaders?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the House must first have a sense of perspective. Either I am the Prime Minister, or I am not the Prime Minister. If I am the Prime Minister, then I have the constitutional right to appoint my Ministers. And I appoint them because I believe them to be valuable and useful in the running of the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister happens to be the man who pioneered our opening to China, so to speak. In April 1975, three years after the Nixon opening, he had established contact and he met the then Chinese Prime Minister, Mr Chou En Lai. He established our first links with the People's Republic of China, and he has been a continual thread in our relations with them throughout the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> years. It is my business to take advice from those who can give me advice. It is not my business to have to convince the Member for Anson that Mr Rajaratnam was a valuable aide.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Surely the Prime Minister must accept that he will have to justify every cost to the taxpayer. But let us move on to the next question. Was the Prime Minister satisfied in his talks with the Chinese leaders that they would not export communism to this part of the world nor encourage any insurrection in this part of the world?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what they have said to me and to other leaders have been well publicized and I have no reasons, from our experience in Singapore to disbelieve what they have said vis-a-vis their activities in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May we take it from the Prime Minister that he is fully satisfied with their assurance that they would not export communism nor any insurrection into these areas? And is he then satisfied that there is no communist threat to Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a non sequitur. Whether I am satisfied or not has nothing to do with whether there is a communist threat or not. The Chinese are not exporting communism to Nicaragua but there is a threat of communism in Nicaragua. The Chinese are not exporting communism to the Philippines, but nobody doubts that there is a threat to the Philippines by the New People's Army.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Prime Minister say ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Get your thoughts right!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am getting my thoughts right, Mr Prime Minister. It is you who is having difficult getting your thoughts right. The question is: do you now consider that there is any communist threat to Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have moved a long way from my visits to China, the US and the Bahamas. Would he like to come back to those questions?

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question concerns his discussions about stability in this part of the world. I thought that was part of his discussions with the Chinese leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I did not say it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Did you not? I thought that you were reported as having got these assurances.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member should come armed with my statements. I went to China for one major reason, namely, trade and economic relations. I did not bring with me my Foreign Minister because it was not an issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Prime Minister saying that there was no discussion at all with the Chinese leaders about stability in this part of the world? Is he saying that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am telling the Member for Anson that he should read his reports. At no time did I say that the stability of Singapore was a subject of discussion with my counterparts in the People's Republic of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It must have been obvious. I suppose it was not obvious to the Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> What was obvious?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If, from what he said that he had no reason to doubt their assurances that there is no communist threat here, may I ask what is the continued justification for the detention of Mr Chia Thye Poh?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is irrelevant to the question you have asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is in relation to the communist threat, communist subversion, which at one time the Prime Minister himself said originated from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no mention of communism in your question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am, Mr Speaker, Sir, trying to fathom the Prime Minister's mind ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Impossible!
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> --- to get answers to questions. It would appear to be an impossible task, Mr Prime Minister. I concede that. I have been attempting to ask the Prime Minister to get an answer from him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Have you sorted out your thoughts?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have, Mr Prime Minister, if you will listen. Were you not reported as having said that you were satisfied with the assurances that they would not export communism into this part of the world?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, I was never reported as saying that in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Not in China, outside. I take it that the Prime Minister proposes not to answer the question about the communist threat to Singapore and about the continued detention of Mr Chia Thye Poh. Is that what I am to understand?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister does not have to answer that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you rule that he does not have to answer. May I move on to his discussions with President Reagan. Did he discuss with President Reagan the question of stability and peace in this part of the world? Did he discuss it or not? Let us have a straight answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is no crime to discuss these matters with the President of the United States. But demeanour, the tone, the voice of the Member implies that I have committed some heinous offence. I discussed a wide range of subjects. Amongst them is the peace and stablity of Singapore and of the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Did the Prime Minister express his concern and the desirability of keeping this area nuclear free?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I did not, Mr Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Did the Prime Minister discuss with President Reagan the dispute that the United States is having with New Zealand over the visit of nuclear warships to New Zealand?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> No.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are we to understand from the Prime Minister that he is not desirous of keeping this area nuclear free?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am in favour of motherhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I see that the Prime Minister finds all this very funny. It must be his particular brand of humour. May I move on to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in the Bahamas. Because very little has been reported about the Prime Minister's utterances in this conference, may we know from him what stand he took on this question of sanctions against South Africa? Did he, for example, stand with the Prime Minister of a neighbouring country, one of the members of Asean, or did he line up behind the British Prime Minister?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think the Member for Anson has got his geography right at these conferences. We do not line up with each other. We do not stand behind each other, and I needed no skirts to protect me. My position was clear. It so happened that I had an interview, I think, with ITN, on the morning the subject came up for debate, and I made it quite clear that we were in favour of sanctions to send the right signals. As far as I was concerned, the majority of the members were also in favour. Mrs Thatcher was not. In the event, the outcome did not mention the word "sanctions" because they wanted unanimity. And so it was - no sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would he tell us what stand did he take in the discussions, not on the report he gave to reporters afterwards about whether he favoured sanctions or not? May we know quite categorically what was the stand that Singapore took?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> It was no secret, Mr Speaker, Sir, nor any surprise. The stand I took in the Conference was exactly what I told the ITN man. If he wanted further details, I will tell him that he ought to read the Straits Times because I met the Straits Times and SBC and Zaobao and Berita. If I could paraphrase myself, because I cannot reproduce the exact words I used.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whole debate was about to be repeated again on a Sunday afternoon at a delightful resort called Lyford Cay in the Bahamas at about quarter to one, I thought that we would all be late for lunch. So I interjected to remind the Chairman that five eloquent, articulate and powerful members of the Commonwealth had been at work on Mrs Thatcher for the whole weekend, from Friday evening to Saturday morning, afternoon and night, and we were then on Sunday morning, that if she had not changed her mind - and there were two documents on the table, one the majority view, the other the view of the British Prime Minister - it was unlikely that the 40 others who had not been at work on her would move her. I therefore suggested that there were two alternatives: (1) a majority document, and allow Mrs Thatcher to issue her minority point of view; or (2) a consensus document, which meant that the Five should get to work and resolve the differences between the two documents so that there could be one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussions went on till 9 o'clock that evening. I am sorry to say that I had an appointment for dinner with the Sultan of Brunei, so I was not present at the final resolution. But they did reduce the two documents into one, which was what I had suggested at a quarter to one. The pity, however, was that I did not have lunch till a quarter past two.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I ask the Prime Minister a supplementary question in regard to trade between Singapore and China? One of the areas which Singapore could provide China with is professional services. Has the Government taken any steps or made any provisions to ensure that if there should be any services provided to China, it will not be monopolised by the public sector, and that some area of this business should be reserved for our now very troubled private sector?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I understand the motives of the Member for Potong Pasir. He wants to ingratiate himself, reassure the private sector that as a result of his intervention they are going to get a lion's share of this China consultancy business.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my discussions covered a wide range, and it did no more than open doors. Actual business will have to be conducted by entrepreneurs and consultants who have goods and services to sell.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Prime Minister has not really answered the question here. If there should be some business in this area, will the private sector get a share of it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not the other party. I am giving no business away. I just ensure that doors would be opened, that any architect, or accountant, or engineer, or lawyer, could go not just to Beijing, which is mandatory, but other than the 14 economic zones and the four special development zones, they can also go to any provincial centre direct. I am not giving out contracts or consultancy services. It is the Chinese who are.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does not the Prime Minister realize that the PWD has taken steps to give local architects business, which they have not done so before, or at least not at this kind of level?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Do I understand now that we are talking about Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. This is only an example. When the economy was booming and doing well, the private sector was neglected. Now that the economy is not doing so well, the Government is taking steps to help the private sector here and there, in little bits. The PWD, I am saying, has taken some steps to farm out work to the architects of Singapore. Should there be business coming from China, would the Prime Minister please make a statement or say something as to whether or not the public sector, like the Port of Singapore Authority or other public Government bodies, will not hoard the whole business?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not the Prime Minister of China. I cannot order the PWD of China to put out tenders for Singapore architects.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I now speak on the motion and then on my amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir. When I saw this motion that was tabled, I wondered why the motion was tabled at this point in time. It is not, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I am against the principle of home ownership. I am all for it, and I think it is very desirable that as many of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> our citizens should be helped and encouraged to own their own homes. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not the burning question at the moment in the minds of many a Singaporean. I do not think for a minute that their priority - and, of course, we are talking about those who are not owning HDB flats and the motion is directed to helping them - I do not think their priority at the moment is whether they can buy an HDB flat or apartment. Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that one of the problems that many residents in HDB apartments are facing now is whether they will be able to continue with their instalment payments to the HDB in this time of recession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, only last night somebody came to see me in my office in my constituency, someone not from my own constituency but from outside the constituency. It was a woman. She said she had come to see me with a letter on behalf of retrenched workers. Their problem at the moment is how to meet the HDB instalment payments and the fear that was looming over them was whether they would lose their HDB apartments. Her suggestion was that I should say something in Parliament that the HDB should consider very seriously cases of these retrenched workers who find themselves unable to make their instalment payments and to give appropriate relief to them - either suspend the payments for the period of their unemployment, spread the payment and or reduce the amount of the instalments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to me to be the main problem at the moment in Singapore, not the question of whether they can buy an HDB apartment or not. There are now at least 7,000 to 8,000 of our workers who are retrenched. And particularly those who come from the lower income group, those who occupy the 1-room, 2-room flats, they are finding it very difficult, a struggle, to make ends meet. The question of buying their own homes is furthest from their minds at the moment. So I wondered why the Members, no doubt at the instigation of the Government, have tabled this motion. I suspected it was probably because the HDB wanted praise for the HDB's achievements. They wanted praise

  <br> from this House, acknowledgment of the contributions made by the HDB over the past 25 years. I am not against giving praise where it is due and no one can deny that there have been a tremendous number of apartments built for our people over the last 25 years. That was the reason for this motion, and it became clearer as I heard the mover of the motion and his seconder and others speak after that. The purpose clearly was to sing a chorus of praise for the HDB, and not only for the HDB but also for the PAP Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to be assumed from the Government side that the history of Singapore only started from 1959, that Singapore's progress only began in 1959 and before that there was nothing really to speak of. One is to forget that the people were enabled to buy their own houses because of the foresight of the government, before the PAP took over, in introducing the Central Provident Fund for our citizens. But that is all lost and forgotten. Whatever the SIT did should not be mentioned. All attention should now be focussed merely on the HDB and, of course, the PAP Government. That seems to me to be the real purpose of this motion because from the motion itself you will see, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the first three parts, as I said, sing a chorus of praise for the HDB's achievements. And, as I said a little while ago, I am not averse to giving praise or recognizing the contribution where it is due.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us not forget that whilst it provided houses for the citizens, the HDB has been used as an instrument of political control by the PAP Government. That is quite evident from the powers that have been given to the HDB under the statute and also from the powers that the HDB has arrogated to itself outside the Act - its list of people who are forbidden to apply for HDB apartments, its powers to throw people out, its exclusion of people from alternative accommodation when they are resettled. A number of these powers have been used to the misery and unhappiness of a lot of our citizens and, as I said, it has been useful because, through the HDB, people could be controlled. If they should attempt to be a little troublesome, as the word is, they can always be brought to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> heel through the HDB mechanism by a visit to their flat by HDB officers with a simple hint, a suggestion that they are there just at the pleasure of the HDB and that they owe their residence to the pleasure of the HDB and to the PAP Government. So it is not all a matter of the people's welfare and serving the people. The Government, of course, recognizes the effectiveness of a statutory board like the HDB to serve its purposes to maintain political control and in that respect the HDB has done very well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as was mentioned by the mover and perhaps the seconder, the reason for this motion is that the HDB is celebrating its 25 years of existence. Sir, a playwright in the 16th century, I think, wrote about good wine needing no bush. I do not know why it is necessary that the HDB be praised. If that is necessary, then it has not served the people of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have complained in this House several times about the draconian powers exercised by the HDB over the lives of our citizens through this home-ownership plan. It is some kind of home-ownership plan, Mr Speaker, Sir, ownership where the owner has really no rights over his home. If one looks at Part IV of the Housing and Development Act, Mr Speaker, Sir, one finds that the owner of an HDB apartment is only an owner in name. The HDB is given powers under the Act for a host of reasons to dispossess the owner and to re-acquire the property. And when it does, it pays him whatever it thinks fit he should receive for the property. A philosopher wrote about the state becoming a leviathan, Mr Speaker, Sir. Here in Singapore we have a veritable leviathan in the Housing and Development Board, notwithstanding that it has, as I said, built these homes for our people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part of the motion, Mr Speaker, Sir, deals with the question of encouraging our low-income group to own their own homes. It is only the last part of the motion which deals with that. Ostensibly it was intended as a motion to encourage our citizens to own their own homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, it is, of course, desirable that everyone should own their own
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> home, and it is to this end that I have proposed an amendment to this motion because we can then inquire into the cost of the HDB apartments that are made available to our citizens. Ever since the HDB took over the task of providing public housing for our citizens, prices have been increased for these apartments without any public justification or control over the increase in the prices. Before 31st October 1981, every year prices went up, sometimes it went up by 10%, 15%, and in 1981 the prices went up by as much as 38%. The Minister for National Development, in presenting the increase in prices for 1981 (this was before 31st October 1981) mentioned that the HDB would go bankrupt if it continued to sell the flats at the prices they had been selling them. But, as I pointed out, when I later came into this House, when he made the announcement he was not able to tell the public what was the unit cost to the HDB for the construction of the apartments. He was not able to do that because the accounts prepared by the HDB did not show a costing of the flats. And so all that the public had was a statement by the Minister that the HDB was selling at prices below the construction cost, below the cost to it, and it could not go on doing this and there had to be an increase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed out to the Minister, way back in 1982, that before he appealed to the public he should have gone to them with proper figures to justify the need for the increase and that he could only have done that if he had a costing of the flats unit by unit - 3-room, 4-room, 5-room, 6-room. I say this, Mr Speaker, Sir, because the HDB is a public body, a statutory board made accountable to Parliament and to the public through Parliament. But it has over the years completely disregarded its obligations to the citizens and to the public. It has become a law unto itself. It has increased its prices without considering whether it should justify these prices to the public and to the purchasers. I know the Minister for National Development still continues to deny that the HDB is making a profit on the construction and sale of these apartments. But may I tell the Minister that very few people believe that. We do not believe it and we have been saying this right from 1981, after I came in. I pointed out, in my first appearance in this House, that the service and conservancy charges
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> collected by the HDB were far in excess of what they were spending on the service and conservancy for these flats. And, of course, after that, the notes to the accounts were rewritten to show that the accounts also included a number of other items which were paid. But let us not forget that last year (was it?) $40 million was transferred from the service and conservancy charges to repay loans. If any illustration was needed, that provided ample illustration that the HDB was collecting far more than it needed for service and conservancy. So if the Government intends to promote purchase of HDB apartments among the lower income group, something must be done to inquire into the cost of the HDB apartments so that the fears of the public may be laid at rest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be an inquiry, and I have suggested a Commission of Inquiry under the Inquiry Commissions Act with quantity surveyors and the Commission receiving evidence from members of the public and from people who are in the construction business about the cost to the HDB inbuilding these flats and at what price they should be sold. There should be an examination by this Commission into the justification for the present prices, whether there is not a case for a reduction of these prices. That is one part of it. You have got to try and bring down the cost, particularly for the lower income group, of the HDB apartments. If you are serious about encouraging them to own their own homes, it is no good saying, "Well, we will give you a loan, my man" if it is going to saddle him for the rest of 20 years or more with having to make large payments from his salary which he can ill afford. That is not going to help him to make up his mind to buy the house. He wants to know whether it is being offered to him at a cost which he can well afford.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect, of course, is the method of payment of the price for the apartments. I was very glad to note from the mover of the motion that he had in mind, or he was recommending to the Government, that the HDB should consider lowering the interest on loans given to those in the lower income group. We made the suggestion at our National Day Rally in August of this year, and I am glad to find that it is being considered, if not by
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Minister for National Development, by at least the PAP Backbenchers. So it is not true that we do not make suggestions that are not worthy of consideration. He has also suggested that loan terms for repayment should be extended and that there should be a reduction in the downpayment that is required from all purchasers. Those are some measures and, of course, one can think of other measures to help the lower income group.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my plea is this: I think it is time we had a public inquiry into the whole question of public housing. We have had 25 years of the HDB providing public housing, and it is good, at this time when most of our people have been provided with apartments, that there should now be an inquiry into not only the prices that are being charged but also on the whole question of public housing - how much that should be subsidized, what should be the rights of the owners of these apartments, how their rights should be protected, what protection should be given to them against the HDB or against anybody else. The whole question should be examined. At the moment, under the law a tenant of an HDB apartment has no protection whatsoever. The HDB has only to serve a notice to quit, giving one week's notice, and if the man does not move out with his family, HDB goes to the court - it does not always go to the court, as I have been saying - and throws him out. It is time to consider whether they should be left completely at the mercy of the HDB. I am sure the Minister will say in his reply, "Well, we do not. We are not tyrants as you have made us out to be. We do not throw everybody out. We consider every case on its merits, and it is only in really bad cases that we exercise these draconian powers." But that is not the answer. The answer is that you should give our citizens their rights, and everything should be spelt out in Acts or in Regulations, and not left to the discretion of the HDB or any other authority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask the movers of the motion to accept this amendment because it gives substance to the motion moved by them. The motion, as it stands, is that it "urges the Government to take suitable measures". That is not going far enough. It is for us, as representatives of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the people, to suggest concrete measures to the Government, and a concrete measure towards helping the people would be to inquire into the cost and then to see whether the prices can be reduced for our people who are unable to afford them at the present prices, and also to inquire into how payments can be made easier for them, and then the whole question of the terms and conditions under which they occupy their flats. I have mentioned before that in other countries the tenants sit on the board of the public housing boards. Here, our owners of HDB apartments or tenants have no representation on the Board. Is it not time we moved up a little bit and gave them some representation so that their views can be heard?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion of the Member for Anson, and I would like to speak on the two motions together.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Members for Chong Boon and Paya Lebar is an obvious attempt by the PAP Government to pat itself on its back.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Why not?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> As I sat there, I heard, before the Member for Anson spoke, speaker after speaker rising in praise of the HDB, sky-high. It was nothing more than a self-reinforcing exercise. For a moment one would think that the HDB is a superstar which, in fact, it is not. At least the voters did not think so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Which voters?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Last year's voters. There was a 12% swing towards the Opposition. And as for the HDB residents in the estates at Jalan Bukit Purmei and Potong Pasir, they distinctly voted against what would have been expected if the HDB were that good. Of course, we know what their complaints were. The flats were too costly and, of course, the workmanship was shoddy, very bad. I shall speak of the high price later on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we hear two Backbenchers talk about going up the ladder; from 1-room to 2-room, to 3-room, and staying in a crowded 1-room, five families - a sob story. For a moment I thought I was listening to a Chinese TV serial. I hope they do not underestimate our intelligence. They know what HDB is for - to mop up the CPF; it props up the Singapore economy, and it has got much political mileage for the ruling Party. I do not think when the HDB, the Government, is building blocks and blocks of flats, they were thinking of the Member who was staying in a 1-room with five families in it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, can I make a point of clarification here? I think the Member for Potong Pasir was not listening to my speech just now. He was only trying to find ways and means to ridicule. I did not say five families in one bedroom. I said "five to seven people to one bedroom" and that I am only just one of the grateful Singaporeans who had benefited in living in HDB flats, and that is why I am like any other ordinary Singaporean who will say "Thank you" to those who have given to us. Perhaps both of them, I believe, have not lived in HDB flats before. That is why I think they are so ungrateful and they have an axe to grind against the HDB.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Last year, the electorate did not think so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon spoke of his experience in Korea. He said that one Korean told him that we were very fortunate. We have 80% of our population staying in public housing and they have only 15%. It is obvious that the Korean was just being polite to the Member for Chong Boon. They have 15% of public housing and the rest of the money is put in productive forces - factories, nuclear power stations, motorcar factories. That is why their economy is so vibrant, whereas in Singapore we put all our eggs only in the property market. And what has happened now? When the property market drops, we have got zero growth and, in fact, it is going to be negative growth. I think emphasis on property is bad economic culture. Property essentially is non-productive. Do not think for a moment that the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Koreans have not got enough houses to live in. I am sure they have. Otherwise they would not be hosting the 1988 Olympics if they were living in slums.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB was formed in 1960. It was not a PAP idea. As the Member for Anson has said, the British colonialists started the public housing programme. They had a body called the Singapore Improvement Trust. They were already building cheap houses for the lower income group. And so it was not a PAP idea to provide cheap public housing. The HDB was set up to take over the tasks of the Singapore Improvement Trust to provide low-cost public housing for people in the lower income group. In 1964, the home ownership for the people scheme was launched to enable citizens in the lower income group to purchase a flat. It would appear that, after 25 years of existence, the HDB has not fulfilled its objective of providing homes for the lower income group. If that is so, then we do not need to come here to debate on the motion of the Members for Chong Boon and Paya Lebar.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home ownership for the people scheme was started more than 20 years ago and yet substantial numbers of the lower income group cannot purchase HDB flats. The reason is obvious. HDB flats are no longer cheap in relation to the incomes of those in the poorer sections of the population. There is no shortage of HDB flats. In fact, it was reported in the press not long ago that there were surplus flats built at Yishun. Anybody who now wants a 3-room flat can go to the HDB Area Office and get one. I have personal knowledge; in fact, from my own staff who applied for a flat in Yishun, "When do you want it? You can get it tomorrow if you want to."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> What is wrong with that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The high cost of public housing is the main deterrent to home ownership for citizens in the lower income group. Prices of HDB flats have dramatically increased. In 1979, prices of HDB apartments increased by 15%; in 1980, by 20%; in 1981, a hefty jump of 38%; in 1982 and 1983, there were 5% increases; and in 1984, the increase was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 2 1/2%. On average, for the four years beginning 1979, the increase in selling price was about 19.5%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cite three examples to show the range of price increases of HDB flats by comparing, first, the 1973 and current prices. Take a 5-room flat in Buona Vista. In 1973, it cost $27,500. What about the current prices for a 5-room flat? The price range is from $82,000 to $132,000. The increases ranged from 3 to 4.8 times. For a 4-room flat in 1976, about 10 years ago, also at Buona Vista, the selling price was $17,500. At the present time, a 4-room flat is selling in the range of $57,000 to $91,000. There is an increase of 3.3 times to 5.2 times. In 1976 again, the selling price of a 3-room flat was $11,800 in the new towns. A 3-room flat today costs between $37,300 and $59,500. The increase is between 3.9 and 5 times. These are clear-cut examples of hefty jumps in prices of HDB flats. That is why the lower income groups are left out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public housing is no longer cheap. The present HDB 3-room flats have been priced beyond the reach of people in the lower income group who are sole breadwinners. As a result of the price increases, the HDB made hefty profits. Pricing of the flats by the HDB is not entirely guided by costs alone. This can be shown by the fact that construction cost and the cost of materials and the prices of property generally have dropped in 1984. And yet the HDB's selling prices went up against market trends, they were raised 2(r)%, as mentioned. All prices of properties this year have dropped drastically, ranging from 30% to 50%. Paper losses must amount to millions of dollars of the 1981 prices, when there was a peak, and yet there is no drop in the HDB selling prices of its flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development was reported to have said that, despite the big increase of 38% in 1981, the purchasers could still afford to purchase. Why? He knew exactly how much Singaporeans had in the Central Provident Fund. Therefore, according to the Minister, the amount of CPF Singaporeans had must be directly related to the prices of HDB flats. It would appear that the HDB is a tool of the Government to mop up the CPF of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people. The majority of purchasers use their CPF to buy HDB flats. The general trend of HDB flat selling prices can only be upwards because, in the long-run, building costs will go upwards. This would mean that the CPF contribution rate would move only upwards as well. The high rate of CPF contribution will cause the Government repayment problems in the future. Originally, everybody agreed with the Government that CPF contributions were a good thing as its overt purpose was savings for old age. Nobody was against having a nestegg on their retirement. We know now that the Government will have repayment problems in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, home ownership for all, on the face of it, is a commendable policy. But will this policy of 100% home ownership also end up like the CPF in a future date, encumbered with all kinds of problems causing great hardship and distress? With such high prices, purchasers will be tied up for life making substantial monthly repayments to the HDB. If the Government intends to pursue its policy of 100% home ownership, then I would call on the Government to lower the selling prices of HDB flats. Prices of HDB flats at the moment are priced too high, taking into account the HDB need not pay the increase in land prices since 1973. All the land acquired by the HDB is based on 1973 prices. There should be a reduction of at least 10% of prices of HDB flats. At this level of price reduction, the HDB will still not suffer a loss.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party has published facts and figures a year ago to show that the HDB was making profits. We have again published in our Party's paper, the Democrat, to show with a set of figures provided by the Minister himself that the revenue from sales of flats at Potong Pasir exceeds the construction costs. We have also attempted to show that a profit at Potong Pasir Estate was made. Our articles on the HDB are not wishy-washy. They are based on facts and are all substantiated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I asked the Minister what was the land area at Potong Pasir acquired. According to this report at page 30, it is 47 hectares. This works out to be about just
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> over 5 million. And if he says that compensation paid was $1,081 million - am I right? - that works out to $262 per sq ft. I know for sure that at the neighbouring Pek San Teng Estate, the HDB compensated the farmers there, inclusive of the farm, with $19,500, ie, at only $1 per sq ft. Why the big jump? At one place you pay only $1 and at another place, the HDB pays $200-odd. I really need this clarification from the Minister himself.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know now that the so-called subsidy given by the HDB is no subsidy at all. The truth of the matter is that the HDB, in its calculation of flat prices, has taken the open market value of land and not the actual cost of the land, ie, the actual amount of money it paid for compensation for compulsorily acquiring the land. The people of Singapore tolerated the Land Acquisition Act only because that piece of legislation was used by the Government to acquire land for public use. It is immoral for the HDB to acquire land at a cheap rate, at 1973 prices, and to charge flat purchasers at the open market value or at opportunity cost. The whole purpose of compulsorily acquiring land at a low price is to enable the HDB to sell its flats at a cheap rate to Singaporeans. The HDB should not charge flat buyers one cent more than what it paid for the land.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also ridiculous for the HDB to claim that it has given subsidy to flat purchasers because it has not charged the full market value of land. This absurdity can be clearly seen by a simple illustration. Take, for example, a company purchases a piece of land for $200 and sells it for $1,000. The market value of that piece of land happens to be $1,500. By HDB reasoning, that company should be able to declare to the Comptroller of Income Tax that it has suffered a loss of $500 because it has sold the land at $1,000 instead of $1,500. The company should factually report as follows: purchased land at $200, sold it for $1,000, profit is $800. That is what the HDB should do. Similarly if the HDB acquired land at, say, $6 per sq ft in a certain area, its cost of land is $6 per sq ft. The HDB cannot say that it could have sold the land at $50 per sq ft in the open market and therefore it has given a subsidy of $44 per sq ft. The HDB should not adopt a double
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> standard. When it acquires land, it gives very low compensation. The reason is that it acquires the land to build cheap public housing. But when it sells the flat, it makes a turn around and charges purchasers the market value. If the Government really wants to help the poor in owning homes, then it must ensure that the HDB does not price the land higher than the prices paid for its acquisition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the value of land as far as public housing is concerned is a moral issue. The HDB should not take into account the potential value of land or its opportunity cost. It has acquired the land cheaply and, therefore, it must sell it back cheap. The HDB has the advantage of the Land Acquisition Act. Why must it charge people more than what it acquired the land for? The HDB considers the HUDC flats as subsidized. The drop in property market prices this year has brought some prices of private condominium units even cheaper than the HUDC units which are supposed to be subsidized. New private condominium units along Lorong Chuan are priced at $210 per sq ft, whereas an HUDC apartment is selling at $250 per sq ft. Not only are the said private condominiums selling at a lower rate, but if you have a look at them, they have more amenities than the HUDC units. They have got squash courts, swimming pool and free parking. You pay for your facilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing for all is a good policy but the HDB must not profit from it. If the HDB has stuck to its original objective of providing cheap housing to the lower income group by charging the cost of land as the cost it has paid for, then today I would be standing here to praise the HDB. But unfortunately that is not the position.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my Party alleged that the HDB was making profits, the Minister, instead of taking the proper step of coming forth with his own facts and figures to prove that we were wrong, issued me a challenge to build four blocks of flats. I accepted the offer in writing, with 19 conditions. The Minister replied that all the 19 conditions were impossible conditions. One of the conditions was that we required the Minister to prove us wrong, ie, my Party's allegation that the HDB was making a profit. The Minister has put it in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> writing and said that that was an impossible condition, ie, to refute my Party's claim that the HDB was making a profit. Is that really an impossible condition? You are unable to prove us wrong. If the Minister cannot prove my Party wrong, then my Party's allegation that the HDB is making a profit must be right. As far as I am concerned, the issue of building the four blocks of flats is still alive. The Minister must come back to me and tell me why all the 19 conditions are impossible. You cannot just brush them off.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> What about making the land free?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Well, that was his offer, not mine.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Why didn't you take it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> He cannot just brush aside a big issue by making a sweeping statement that all my 19 conditions were impossible. Whether or not the HDB makes a profit is a big issue and will remain so, and it will never fade away until the people of Singapore get a satisfactory reply from the Minister. There are 80% of the population out there who are interested in this issue. They are all residing in HDB flats. Many of them are flat owners, and eventually if this policy gets through, they will all be flat owners. Therefore, I want the Minister to tell me exactly why he thinks those 19 conditions are impossible. We all want to know the truth of the matter.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has announced that with effect from April it is going to have a new accounting system. Under that system all parcels of land will be transferred by the HDB to the Government land bank. The Government will then resell the land back to the HDB at a price subject to Government valuation. By this method, it was alleged that the unit cost of flat can be determined. This new accounting system will not bring down flat prices. The HDB has still to pay for the price of land at market value and not at its original acquired cost. Only this time the profits on the land will be transferred, probably to the Government.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been reported that one of the functions of the HDB is to provide community facilities. Much as been said about the RCs, CCCs, CCMCs, but unfortunately these so-called grassroots organizations have not really seeped down to the bottom level of the HDB estate residents. They still remain at the top and only reach out to a few. Why? Because these so-called grassroots organizations are politically motivated. If they are to be effective, then I would say that the HDB should recommend strongly that they should be taken away from the Prime Minister's Office and put in the hands of the residents themselves. Then they will become effective, and then we will see a truly cohesive society, a truly meaningful community, effective. The Government should show that the people would be given responsibility; then they can be effective. Then we would not have these social problems of killer-litter, as one Member there from his own experience mentioned such anti-social activities like urinating in the lift, vandalism, and the like.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir has again repeated his allegation that the HDB is reaping untold profits from the sale of too costly flats. He has supported those of us on the Government side of this House in recognizing and commending HDB's achievements and contributions in the area of public housing. This is evident from the wording of his amendment to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> motion. However, he has, in his part of the amendment, attempted to belittle the contribution which HDB has made to our nation building effort.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is no mean task to provide homes for nearly two million people and to provide daily care and management for the vast number of housing estates which are sprouting all over the island. The HDB and all those who are associated with its operations must be congratulated for having done a fine job, for having accomplished the objectives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is the HDB making unseemly profits? The Hon. Minister for National Development had, on the 21st March 1985, explained to this House the various costs involved in putting up a housing estate. He has stated that the HDB is, in fact, losing money. I recall, Sir, that on the same occasion the Hon. Minister for National Development asked the Member for Potong Pasir if he was indeed a liar who distorted facts on the cost of building HDB flats in order to mislead the people. What was the Member's reaction? Did he jump to his feet to protest that he was being maligned? Did he produce more facts and figures to further prove his case? No, Sir, he simply changed the subject of the debate at that moment with another question so that the question of whether he lied or not was left unanswered till this day.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not lie.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> That clearly showed how much faith the Member for Potong Pasir had in his own figures and in his own advisers. Sir, today he is repeating the same chant that the HDB is making a profit, yet in the same breath he admitted himself moments ago that the cost of flat must go up because cost of construction goes up. Sir, if he had any faith in his own claim or in his own figures, then should he not have accepted the Hon. Minister for National Development's previous offer to build four blocks of flats and keep the vast profits for himself or for his Party? Again, he chose to evade the issue by asking for ridiculous preconditions. Where is the element of sincerity in the Member for Potong Pasir? Either he believes in his allegation that they are true and show by deeds what his words claimed, or he
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> stands accused as a manipulator of facts without credibility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir would have us and the people of Singapore believe in him. But, as the records stand, there is nothing to substantiate his claim to be an honest and sincere seeker of the truth.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What is wrong?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, he last came to this House with a motion to reduce MP's allowance by 25%. What happened next was a forewarning of his tendency to juggle figures. Inexplicably, he changed his mind and reduced the amount of his sacrifice by 10% to 15%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It wasn't his motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> And we are still waiting to hear about his personal act to support this motion of his.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have digressed slightly for a reason - to show that insincere rhetorics and artfully twisted arithmetics must not be allowed to reduce the scale and magnificence of the HDB's endeavour to provide homes for Singaporeans.
  <br>4.02 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to reject the amendment moved by the Member for Anson.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think his amendment is really inconsistent with the preamble of the motion as moved by the Member for Chong Boon. The preamble very clearly shows that the Housing and Development Board has achieved a very substantial degree of public housing for the people of Singapore, and yet in his amendment the Member for Anson asked for a commission of inquiry. The Member for Anson also acknowledges the achievements of the Housing and Development Board, and yet what does he want? At the drop of a pin, indeed even without the drop of a pin, he is asking for a commission of inquiry. What is the purpose of a commission of inquiry?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> To find out the exact cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Naturally a commission of inquiry is to be appointed if you think there is something wrong. The Member for Anson himself recognizes the achievements of the Housing and Development Board and yet he wanted a commission of inquiry. In his amendment, he has asked the Commission of Inquiry to inquire into four areas. Areas (1) and (2) are that the present prices charged by the Housing and Development Board are too high. Area (3) is to examine whether or not Government could facilitate the purchase of subsidized housing by citizens in the lower income group. So far as these points are concerned, they have been adequately answered by the mover of the motion, the Member for Chong Boon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would do is to spend some time on the fourth point raised by the Member for Anson, and that is, his amendment "to examine all the powers at present exercised by the Housing and Development Board and their justification therefor." By this, he implies that either the Housing and Development Board has been exercising its powers unjustifiably, for which he really has not given us any evidence, or that the Housing and Development Board has powers given to it which are unjustified.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his amendment he made a series of allegations without any substantial evidence to support them. One was that the Housing and Development Board is entitled to give notice to quit to the owners of the flats. I wonder where did he get such a provision which entitles the Housing and Development Board to give notice to quit without cause, without any reason. He did say that Part IV of the Housing and Development Act gives the Housing and Development Board very draconian powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Point of clarification. May I ask the Member for Chua Chu Kang whether he has ever seen a notice to quit from the HDB? Does he not know what it says?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have seen a notice to quit from the Housing and Development Board.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What does it say?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> The Housing and Development Board does not give notice to quit without reason. If they do give a notice to quit, it is because either the tenant has breached a condition of the sale or ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A point of clarification. Is the Member seriously saying that the notice to quit issued by the HDB specifies the reason? Will you produce one?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Is the Member for Anson seriously saying that the Housing and Development Board can give a notice to quit without reason? If that is so, why does he not take the Housing and Development Board to court?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would he like to ask the Minister to produce the notices to quit? He must know his facts before he speaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a notice to quit simply gives the tenant notice to quit. But what the Member for Anson is alleging is that the Housing and Development Board can give a notice to quit without reason.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Of course not! If that is the case, why does the Member for Anson not take the Housing and Development Board to court? Because every notice to quit is made pursuant to a reason. There must be a reason. If there is no reason, you cannot get the tenant out. I think that is the usual habit of the Member for Anson, that is, he is telling half-truths. Even in a notice to quit by a private landowner to a tenant, all you need do is to say that you are served with notice to quit and could you please quit the place within a month, or some period like that, after the service of this notice. The reason is that he has breached a condition. Without a reason, you cannot get the tenant out.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Chua Chu Kang is able to follow what he is saying himself, or he is lost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest way of answering all this, if I may suggest to the Member, is to produce the notices to quit, and then we can talk about them. It is obvious that the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Member does not know what is contained in the notice to quit from the HDB.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> That is precisely the reason why I say that the Member for Anson is telling half-truths to this House. The notice to quit need not contain the reason itself but you must have a reason before you can serve the notice to quit. What does that mean? Do you mean to say that the Housing and Development Board can serve a notice to quit on a tenant and get him out of the place without any reason at all? It must have a reason.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> rose ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not giving way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Because you do not know what you are talking about. You really do not know what you are talking about.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> My main point is that the Housing and Development Board cannot serve a notice to quit without any reason and ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Ask the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> --- if there is a notice to quit without reason, why does he not take the Housing and Development Board to court? The court would then be able to adjudge that the Housing and Development Board has, for no reason, served a notice on the tenant, and the order would be that the tenant can stay put. The Housing and Development Board will be pronounced wrong. That is precisely why the Member for Anson is always telling half-truths to this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose ---
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> remained standing.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He does not know what he is talking about. Will somebody show him the notice?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> The Member for Anson has not been giving any reasons to this House why these were draconian powers. In fact, the conditions on which a tenant can be asked to quit are amply spelt out in the Act itself, and if the Member for Anson wants an inquiry there is really no
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reason for it. Does he know how much it costs to appoint a commission of inquiry? He simply thinks that at the drop of a hat he could get a commission of inquiry. I would reject his amendment to appoint a commission of inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the allegations of the Member for Potong Pasir are concerned, I think they have been adequately answered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. All I can say is that what he quoted are not facts and figures but just lies and lies. [Interruption] Anyway, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. He has been offered the opportunity to build houses, and he has not accepted it. If he had accepted it, why did he not build the houses? Therefore, I would suggest that if he thinks the Housing and Development Board is making such large profits, he should accept the offer to him to build the flats so that he would make a lot of money for his Party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would reject the amendment moved by the Member for Anson.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I just seek a clarification from the Member for Potong Pasir? It is usually not my habit to speak but, since this matter is of great public significance, I just want him to explain. First, I believe that the Minister for National Development this morning quoted the acquisition cost of land in Potong Pasir as, very roughly, $181 million. Have you got my figure?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> 1,800.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> No. $181 million. The Member for Potong Pasir just now quoted a figure of total land acquired: 5 million sq ft. You said, "land acquired is 5 million sq ft". You claimed just now that the Government is paying $240 or $160 per sq ft. How do you arrive at that figure?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I must have heard wrongly. I have it as 1,081. The Member for Anson clarifies that it is 181. So 181 is about 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we can recall that some months ago he was confused with his arithmetic of the CPF. Now he is confused with his arithmetic of compensation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> So if he has no ability to handle figures, then I think this bigger figure of HDB making profit is even more untrustworthy. I also suggest that ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of clarification.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> I will not give way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is just that I heard it at 1081. You divide that by 5, and see what you get.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> There is another point which, I think, is of great public significance, and we have to state it. There are some members of the public who may be misled by it, and that is: a lie repeated often enough gets believed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That's right!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> So I think that, in future, the public ought to be more aware of what the Member for Potong Pasir says.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> He agrees.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a motion for the adjournment to be moved by the Member for Siglap called Dignity and Decorum of Members of Parliament. I am sure from the behaviour of the two Opposition MPs, he will have plenty to talk about afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on the amendment submitted by the Member for Anson. But before doing so, I would like to comment on some of the points they have made. Both referred to the role of the British colonial government and the SIT concerning the provision of homes for the people of Singapore. Now, if they think that the British colonial government and SIT deserve praise, as we think the HDB does, then they should put a motion before the House and let us debate on that. If they did, and I hope they do, they will be the laughing stock of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of them mentioned about the draconian measures taken by the HDB, the aggressive policies of the HDB, and yet it is undeniable that more than two-thirds of the people of Singapore own their own
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> homes. 76% of residents in HDB estates own their own homes, and many more thousands of Singaporeans want to own their own homes. Why the rush to home ownership if the HDB is so draconian, takes unfair measures against them, and it the prices are not quite right for them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They are forced.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Clearly they do not know, Mr Speaker, Sir, what they are talking about.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What are they?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> The Member for Anson in his introductory remark made a very revealing statement. He referred to the motion put forward by the Member for Chong Boon which refers to the question of home ownership for the lower income group, and he said, "This is not a burning question." I would like the press and the public to take note of this statement ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> At the moment, yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> --- that the Member for Anson is not concerned about the question of home ownership for the lower income group, and yet he professes to be the champion of the lower income group. Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the amendment put forward by the Member for Anson, I would really like to talk about this tendency on the part of the Opposition MP to suggest ever so often Commission of Inquiries into various matters before the House.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You want ample participation, don't you?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> His strategy, Mr Speaker, Sir, is very simple. Make false allegations about the Government, produce half-truths, and then say, "The only way to get to the truth is to have a Commission of Inquiry." It is a very simplistic line of strategy, and I do not think intelligent people will be taken in by that line of argument. Just imagine, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we accede to this amendment to have a Commission of Inquiry into the HDB, what is there to prevent the Member for Anson to suggest, henceforth, Commissions of Inquiries into the work-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ings of Government ministries, departments, statutory boards?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is very good.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> And then there will be so many Commissions of Inquiries involving considerable finance, manpower, and we will not be surprised that at the end of it, the Member for Anson will come before Parliament and say, "I would like to have a Commission of Inquiry to end all Commissions of Inquiries."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not saying that the Opposition MPs, if they have rational suggestions to make to the HDB, cannot do so. In fact, I am sure that the Minister for National Development would be only too happy to receive whatever suggestions they have and will give them due consideration and come to a decision befitting those suggestions. So the avenue is open to them to put forward whatever ideas and suggestions they have.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir mentioned the fact that the HDB is a political weapon of the Government, implying that the HDB in some way or another has discriminated against Opposition MPs. Here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have an example of not a half-truth but of an Opposition MP lying to the House and to the public. Let me state what the position is with regard to the treatment of MPs by the HDB. And if the Member for Potong Pasir refutes my points, then he should stand up and say so. All MPs, irrespective of whether they are PAP MPs or Opposition MPs, are given certain privileges, for example, the allocation of an MP's office. And both Opposition MPs have their offices allocated to them by the HDB.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Not yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Well, the Member for Potong Pasir said, "not yet". But he has already been allocated and his office is in the process of ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> When? One year already.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> --- construction and due for completion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is that how efficient the HDB is?

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir is very impatient. He should be patient and he will get his due. Then there is the question of the issue of HDB parking labels. Well, if you look at his car, he has got the HDB parking label ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Why not?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> --- which allows him to park in HDB, URA carparks just like any other ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Not URA.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Yes, URA carparks too, unless of course he does not know that he has this privilege, and that he has been paying for it. But I am sure that if he appeals, he cannot get a refund. But he has the privilege. Where is the discrimination? All MPs have use of the void decks, the open space, for various functions. And I am sure that the Area Offices have approved their requests ---

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last but not least, the referrals which all MPs submit to the HDB on behalf of their constituencies. They are given due attention, and I am sure the Opposition MPs cannot deny that. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Opposition MPs feel that there is serious wrongdoing, or if there are wrongdoings of whatever nature on the part of the HDB, they should so state it specifically and let the public know. And I am sure the Minister will have to respond to those allegations if they can be substantiated by facts. Otherwise, they are again misleading the House and the public, and I would call for the rejection of the amendment put forward by the Member for Anson.

  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson seems to have a liking for suggesting the setting up of various commissions of inquiry to investigate into one thing or another. I was told that in China there was one joke. In a certain place there was an instance of a rabid dog biting people. The cadre members there called a meeting to look into the matter and, after one whole day, they could not come to a conclusion, and the dog was still there biting the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Members of the Opposition do not understand the feelings of the people living in HDB flats. They have never stayed in an HDB flat. Of course, they have not stayed in an attap house. Nevertheless, they are making a lot of noise here. What is their intention? Their intention is to gain some political capital. Just now the Member for Potong Pasir attacked the speeches made earlier by my colleagues, the Member for Paya Lebar and the Member for Kaki Bukit, relating their personal experiences of how they struggled and gradually upgraded from living in a crowded 1-room flat to a 3-room and to a 5-room flat. The Member for Potong Pasir described this as a cheap tear-raising episode of a Chinese TV serial. I think this remark is a great insult to all those people who live in HDB flats. I feel he should make a public apology to all of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen who is now living in a 4-room HDB flat, let me tell you my experience and feelings. For more than 10 years I have been living in a shabby attap house in a kampong. At that time my family was very poor. When it rained at night, the roof leaked and the whole house shook in the storm. It was awful. I spent my childhood in the kampong. It is a nostalgic place. But, Mr Speaker, if you ask me to go back and live in such a place, I still have this lingering fear in me. I do still have this kind of nightmare sometimes. [Laughter] Please do not laugh. This is a true experience. I believe the majority of the people living in HDB flats have this kind of experience. After leaving the kampong, like the Member for Paya Lebar, I spent seven years living in a shabby house in Chinatown. But I can tell you this is another place which holds a nostalgic memory in my heart because there I met my wife. But if you want me to go back to such a place where you have to live with the rats, cockroaches and mosquitoes, of course, I will not agree. And I would not suggest that we preserve such an environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1975, about 10 years ago, there came a turning point in my family. After a few years of waiting for a flat, we were allotted a 3-room HDB flat. Now, any Singapore citizen who is not too choosy should be able to get a flat in Yishun or any other new town.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you had not experienced life in in a shabby attap house or in a crowded pigeon hole type of house in Chinatown, like Kreta Ayer, you will not be able to appreciate the feeling of joy and a sense of security when you move into an HDB flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, point of order. The point of order is: how is all this relevant to the amendment to the motion? It is all very interesting to hear the Member's personal history. But how is it relevant to the amendment?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is coming to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am coming to it. I want to emphasize this point. In Singapore, 80% of our population
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are living in HDB flats. Most of them came from poor families. They struggled to improve their earnings, and gradually upgrade their living environment. There were many children living in the same kampong where I lived. They are now living in HDB flats which they now own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, how is it possible? What is the reason? How could the poor people of Singapore keep improving their standard of living over the past 20 years? There are three reasons. First, our parents saved every cent they earned so that their children would be able to receive good education, good training. And the children, on their part, have not failed their parents. They worked hard at their studies. They have acquired a skill of their own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must give credit to the HDB. The Housing Board has built many flats for the people, flats which they can afford.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must give credit to the Government. If not for the Government, there would not have been the Housing and Development Board today, and we would not have political stability, economic growth, and full employment where everyone who wanted a job could get a job, and would be able to earn more and so improve their standard of living and purchase their own flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot deny that at the present time there are still some people who cannot afford to purchase their own flats. They have to settle for a rental flat. But I believe even the poor people have a backbone and are resolute in their will. They would not do what some people who, on the one hand, while handing out a few hundred dollars for charity would, on the other hand, ask for hundreds of thousands of dollars from people to pay for the cost of litigation. But Singaporeans have a backbone and are a very resolute people.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder if he has a guilty conscience. I believe the people of Singapore all have a backbone and are straightforward. They could be poor, but they would not beg on their knees from others. They can stand straight, and would not beg for money or to swindle.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I have asked you for a ruling under Standing Orders. Is this Member allowed to go on making imputations? First of all, it is completely irrelevant to the amendment to the motion before the House. Secondly, he is making imputations, which are quite unnecessary and uncalled for.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Goh, please come to your points.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, when I raised this point, I was trying to say that Singaporeans do not beg. They would not ask for a free house or something. They would rather find fulfilment of living through their own efforts. In these circumstances, how do we help them to buy to own their flats? This is the question I have been talking about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who are now living in rental flats and cannot afford to purchase their own flats, the Housing and Development Board may want to consider these suggestions; in fact, there have been some announcements regarding these. I would urge the HDB to consider the two recommendations made by the Member for Chong Boon, as they are practical and realizable and should be implemented as soon as possible, ie, to waive or reduce the deposit for the purchase a flat and to prolong the period of repayment. Perhaps for those who have been living in HDB rental flats for a long period of time, the HDB may want to consider lowering the selling price for them. But on a long term basis, to solve this problem of providing flats for the lower income group, I think the best way is to give their children more opportunities to be better educated. If their children are better educated, they will be able to earn a better income and have a better living, and with a better earning power and they will be in a position to purchase their own flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly object to the amendment to the motion by the Member of the Opposition. I fully support the motion by the Members for Chong Boon and Paya Lebar. I am sure there is no other comparable organization in any other part of the world whose achievements can be compared with those of the HDB. In 1980, I had an opportunity to visit China. I went to the countryside in Xiamen and I saw, for myself, that many of the people are still living in the old type of houses that my parents and their generation lived in, before they migrated to Singapore. Therefore, over the past 25 years, the Housing and Development Board has contributed much towards providingSingaporeans with proper living accommodation. The Board's undeniable contribution to solving our housing problem is not something which the two Members of the Opposition can challenge with their senseless ravings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from helping the lower income group to own their own flats, the HDB should also continue with their effort to build flats which members of the public could afford. As it is now, every newly married couple would like to own their own flat. So the practical solution to this problem is not to set up any commission of inquiry to look into the cost of building or into this or that. The Government should persist in carrying out its declared policy and ensure that the HDB build flats at a price which members of the public could afford to buy.

  <!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Yatiman Yusof (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to support the motion moved by the Member for Chong Boon and the Member for Paya Lebar and oppose the amend-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment moved by the Member for Anson and the Member for Potong Pasir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Government announced its intention to give every Singapore citizen an opportunity to own his or her own home, it is only appropriate that measures toward this end be taken immediately without any further delay. This is because our Government is well-known as an efficient government which acts quickly. This is not a government which relishes in empty talk. In this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, the HDB has discharged its functions and responsibilities magnificently. It is not wrong for us to offer our heartiest congratulations and profound thanks to this organization which has transformed Singapore physically, population and occupation-wise, and the lifestyles of the community, an achievement unmatched anywhere.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Governmnet Backbencher, I do not wish to indulge in self-praise nor the HDB as alleged by the Opposition Members. The fact of the matter is that the HDB has fulfilled its tasks and the people of Singapore still need flats even today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I am rather disappointed with the Opposition Members of this House who seize every opportunity to exploit this issue, which affects the majority of our citizens, purely to score political capital. Although they claim to represent the workers and the forces of democracy, they have failed to respond well to the Government's measures. In fact, they keep on drumming issues to which my colleagues in this House have adequately responded.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the allegations brought up is that when the Government intends to expedite the process of giving opportunities to our citizens to own their own flats, this is misconstrued as fishing in troubled waters. It is alleged that Government wants to speed up this housing project in order to reap profits. If this allegation is true, the answer can be found if the Members visit the HDB office at Maxwell Road to see for themselves the large crowds of Singapore citizens, morning and afternoon, queueing for flats. Is it
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> suggested that these Singapore citizens, of their own volition allow themselves to be hoodwinked, thereby making it possible for the Government to reap profits? It is obvious that such allegations are untrue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can deceive a person all the time, we can throw wool over the eyes of many people for a certain time. But it is too far-fetched for us to dupe 81% of the flat owners and tenants for a long period of 25 years. It is clear that such loose talks is irresponsible and in the long term will not produce the desired results. It is clear that the Opposition is exploiting this issue for its own ends. It is alleged that the HDB's enforcement action against tenants is too harsh. We have already suggested that a Town Council be set up to deal with such matters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition also raised the question of setting up a Commission of Inquiry. Is this necessary where the people have no need for it? And the erroneous claim that public housing was started by the then Singapore Improvement Trust. They have their facts wrong in that the Singapore Improvement Trust only built flats for rental.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the time constraint, I merely wish to list some of the points which, in my opinion, were raised with ulterior motives. It is alleged that the selling prices of flats on the average rose 38% every year. I ask the Member concerned: Do the flat owners suffer monetary losses when they sell their flats? The fact is that those flat owners who purchased a 4-room unit at $30,000 could easily sell them at $80,000 at the present time. That point was not raised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the most dangerous and dirtiest allegation is that the HDB is being used as a tool by the Government to rob our poor citizens of their CPF savings, by compelling them to buy flats. Such wild allegations can easily arouse the resentment of the people. But it is clear that such allegation contains lies. Are the flats not the property of the people? Have not the flats purchased by the people got no values in the market? Can the money not be exchanged after the flats have been sold? Such utterances made in this august Chamber will not help the people to grasp
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the significance of the praiseworthy measures which the Government intends to take.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these grounds, Sir, I oppose the amendment, and I support the motion expressing our thanks to the HDB.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion moved by the Members for Chong Boon and Paya Lebar.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the attempts made by two Members in this House to belittle the efforts and the achievements of the HDB, the valuable contributions made by the HDB cannot be overstated. Many Singaporeans, including Members of this House, join me in expressing admiration and gratitude to what the HDB has done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is of special interest to me. In my first speech in this august Chamber, I highlighted the plight and difficulties of those who were living in 1- and 2-room flats. I do not intend to go into a description of the living conditions. This has been covered by previous Members. My contention then was, and it still is, that helping these people to upgrade to better homes is only a necessary condition to a longer term overall improvement. Better homes
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will help their children to improve educationally and in this way enable the family to break out of the cycle which they are trapped in. The essence then is an overall improvement through their children's education. When there is hope, a man will live with short term difficulties, and no sacrifice is too large for a man to see that his child has a better future than himself. There is a link between a better home and a child's education. Ownership of a better home is a necessary beginning.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall cover two points very briefly. The first relates to the scheme which has been mentioned several times before. There are many ways of trying to make this scheme interesting, but it must be flexible and innovative. No downpayment or a little downpayment, and a longer term repayment scheme has already been covered, but there are many others, such as increasing annuities. If we assume that income increases year by year, they can always pay less now but more as they go along. Repayment schemes can also be designed in such a way that members do not have to pay in any one single month of the year, ie, the Chinese New Year month, Hari Raya month, and so on. In other words, they can skip payment for a festive month. This is probably better than letting this group of people fall into rental arrears. With computers, this is now not difficult. But these are really details and I bring this up to urge our policy makers to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to design a package to make sure that most, if not all, of these people, can take up the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to touch on is the speed of implementation of this scheme. This matter is a long standing one. It was brought into the limelight late last year when the 20% downpayment was discussed. This was further highlighted in the President's Address this year. Since then it has been in the air, revived time and again. I realize that a major policy decision of this nature takes time, but there is much apprehension and anticipation. Each time it is revived, expectations rise. I hope that a decision will be taken soon and that the scheme will not come attached with so many riders and conditions that, at best, it becomes a scheme that is not significant, or at its worst, it will be unpalatable to the population.

  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Members for Chong Boon and Paya Lebar and other PAP Members of the House who spoke on this motion commending the HDB, its management, staff and workers who have contributed to the success of our public housing programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> We should have a chorus for the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Indeed, Singaporeans have every reason to be proud of our achievements in public housing under the PAP Government. To date, the HDB has built half a million flats to house 82% of our population. This is a remarkable record, unmatched by any other country in the world. What is even more remarkable is that 76% of the residents living in HDB flats own their homes. Few countries in the world have achieved such a high percentage of home ownership in public housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievement of the HDB is not just in quantity, that is, the construction of half a million flats, but also in the extremely high quality achieved in the construction of the flats and facilities. I believe a copy of the HDB publication, Design for Living, has been forwarded to all Members of this House. From this publication, we can see beyond any shadow of doubt the high quality of housing provided by the Singapore Government for the people. The high quality is evident in the physical design and layout of the flats and the housing estates and in the comprehensive range of facilities provided in each estate. These include shopping facilities, sports complexes, recreational areas, schools and clinics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any reasonable Singaporean, I really do not have to request the Members in this House to praise the HDB. In fact, the HDB flats are all over Singapore. HDB flats are not something that is very small and is hidden somewhere and I have to ask the people to notice it, otherwise they will miss it. So it is totally unnecessary for me to request the House to praise the HDB ---

  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> --- which the Opposition Member was insinuating just now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two decades, the real income of Singaporeans has gone up continually. As a result, there is a constant upgrading by tenants of HDB flats to become flat owners. Statistics from the HDB showed that in the last five years, about 55,000 tenants have, on their own efforts, upgraded themselves to become home owners. In addition, more than 14,000 tenants are presently on the waiting list to purchase HDB flats. In other words, within the short period of five years, 70,000 of the tenants become flat owners on their own efforts. Singaporeans' incomes are continuously improving. It is not, as some people suggest to the foreign correspondents who are totally ignorant about Singapore, that thousands of Singaporeans are starving. However, notwithstanding the fact that there is already a constant stream of tenants upgrading themselves, the Government is now considering various measures to provide further assistance to low-income families so that more tenants will be able to become home owners, earlier.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very grateful for the various useful suggestions made by PAP Members, both inside and outside this House, concerning the further assistance that could be given to help more tenants and low-income families to upgrade themselves. Continuous studies are presently being carried out by my Ministry and the HDB on this issue. It is hoped that a comprehensive announcement will be made on this in the next few months.

  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the basic objective of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is to provide for the old-age financial security of our citizens and for contingencies. CPF savings also help to achieve our goal of a 100% home ownership society as well as to meet hospitalization expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst maintaining the high savings rate through the CPF, members can be given the flexibility to manage their own CPF savings. Once they have saved a minimum reserve for old age and contingencies, they can be allowed the option to invest their CPF funds in excess of this minimum reserve in other types of investment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore approved the setting up of a scheme to allow CPF members to invest a portion of their Ordinary Account savings in shares, loan stocks, unit trusts and gold.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Savings which can be used for such investments</i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CPF member should have at least a minimum reserve of $30,000 in his CPF Ordinary and Special Accounts before the excess balance in his Ordinary Account will be allowed for such investments. The minimum reserve of $30,000 will include CPF amounts which have been invested in a home. It does not include the Medisave Account which is meant for hospitalization expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reserve of $30,000 is estimated to be the amount necessary for an individual to meet his barest living expenses after retirement. The minimum reserve of $30,000 will be adjusted periodically for inflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the reserve of $30,000, the excess balance which can be used for investment will be termed "Investable CPF Savings". For a start, members will be allowed to invest up to 10% of their investable CPF savings in the local stock market or in gold. There will be a sub-limit of 5% on the amount which can be invested in gold. They can only use amounts in their Ordinary Account for this purpose. The ultimate intention is to allow CPF members maximum discretion in the way they deploy their investable CPF savings, subject to minimum essential safeguards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Type of shares and loan stocks</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me outline the salient features of the scheme for investment in shares, loan stocks and unit trusts. It is desirable that members be allowed to choose from as wide a variety of stocks as possible, exercising their own judgment and discretion. However, as many CPF members may be investing in the stock market for the first time, certain minimum standards should be set. Investable CPF savings will only be permitted for investment in shares which satisfy the minimum conditions laid down under the Trustees Act and are listed in the Stock Exchange of Singapore. I will refer to them as trustee shares. These conditions include a minimum paid-up capital of S$5 million and require the companies to have paid dividends for each of the last five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in the convertible loan stocks of companies whose shares are classified as trustee shares will also be allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other companies with good track records but whose shares do not meet the conditions to be classified as trustee shares can apply to the Securities Industry Council (SIC) which will be asked to assess their applications for inclusion under the scheme. Those companies that are seeking listing for the first time can likewise apply to SIC for consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the liability of CPF funds is wholly in Singapore, the scheme will be confined to stocks of Singapore-incorporated companies. This is similar to the present situation where CPF funds can only be invested in properties located in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Unit Trusts</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investable CPF savings can also be used for investment in unit trusts. Unit trusts will similarly have to apply to SIC to be considered for inclusion in the scheme. The CPF savings invested through unit trusts can only be invested in shares or convertible loan stocks which are included under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Limits for investing in shares, loan stocks and unit trusts</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 308 companies listed on the local stock exchange, 59 are trustee shares of Singapore-incorporated companies. Their total market capitalization is about $20 billion. Their turnover last year is estimated at about S$2.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid artificially inflating the stock prices, the liberalization of CPF savings for such investments will be done gradually. For a start, members will be allowed to invest up to 10% of their investable CPF savings under the scheme. The intention is to gradually allow the limit to go up, subject to evaluation of the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that initially up to about S$1 billion, or S$1,000 million, will thus be made available for investment under this scheme. It can be used for the purchase of qualifying stocks from the local stock market as well as for re-financing of such stocks already purchased.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide hon. Members with a better picture of how the investment limits will be applied, I will ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a paper (Cols. 649 - 652) which contains three examples for Members' information. If Members have any questions on the examples, I will be happy to answer them afterwards.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Trading in shares, loan stocks and unit trusts</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to some other details of the investment scheme. CPF members will be allowed to use their investable CPF savings up to the initial limit of 10% to pay for the full price of the Singapore trustee shares, related convertible loan stocks and unit trusts, as well as the brokerage, administrative and other charges incurred. If they already own such stocks, they can use their investable CPF savings up to the approved limit to re-finance these assets. Where the available CPF funds are insufficient, they can top up with cash.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be allowed to trade freely in the shares, convertible loan stocks and unit trusts under the scheme. However, as the scheme is to enable members to invest but not to speculate in the stock market, there will be administrative guidelines to prevent the use of CPF monies for speculation and trading on margins. These guidelines will be formulated so as not to hinder the flexibility required for non-speculative investments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is a scheme to enable CPF members to manage the investment of their old-age savings, all gains derived from CPF funds must be kept in the CPF accounts. Dividends received (net of corporate tax) must be returned to the member's account. Upon the sale of the shares, loan stocks and unit trusts purchased under the scheme, the amount realized from the use of CPF funds, including any capital gain, must also be returned to the CPF accounts. However, members will not be required to make good trading losses or to reimburse the CPF interest forgone. Any cash top-up and related earnings will be returned to the member.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Implementation of the Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme will come into operation after the Central Provident Fund Act has been amended and the operational Regulations drawn up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF members who decide to take advantage of the scheme should do so carefully, as investments in stocks, shares and gold carry both opportunities of capital gains and risks of capital loss. With CPF members investing under the scheme, it is expected that the number of small investors will increase. They will benefit from sound advice on investment. Banks and other financial institutions will be encouraged to develop the capacity to provide such services for a fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Investment in Gold</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the investment scheme for gold are being finalized and will be announced within the next two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any questions?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> May I ask the Hon. Acting Minister for Labour whether this scheme, as proposed by him, will effectively demolish the false argument put forward by the Member for Potong Pasir that the CPF Board does not have sufficient funds to pay its members?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this scheme is a clear demonstration that the Government and the CPF Board have more than adequate resources to pay all the CPF members. The fact that we have been liberalizing the CPF scheme to allow more and more money to be taken out for purchase of private residential properties, commercial properties, and now shares and gold and, in future, other schemes, means that we have the money already available. So Members need not be worried about this. In fact, I would be surprised if the Members for Anson and Potong Pasir were not happy to make use of the scheme themselves and withdraw the CPF savings that they have.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained before in this House, the Government has carefully invested the CPF savings in sound investments. I do not know whether the Member for Potong Pasir is able to read accounts or he is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> unwilling to accept the facts. If he understands accounts, he will realize that over the last few years the Government has been generating healthy surpluses, so much so that the CPF savings are saved up and invested in sound assets. When the need arises to repay members, there will be more than enough money to pay all the members. In fact, our reserves are more than the sum total of the CPF savings. So the CPF Board is, in fact, the strongest bank you can find.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, has the Minister considered the reason why he prefers allowing CPF members to withdraw from the investable funds and invest in stocks and shares to the more stable and better investment of higher education for children of CPF members? Has he considered the reason for his preference for shares and stocks rather than for education?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this question of using CPF for education was raised at the last sitting of Parliament, and I take it that Members are very keen to have CPF savings released for education. I assured Members at that time that the committee in my Ministry, which is looking into the overall issue of CPF, will also look into the use of CPF for education. It so happens that we have finalized the scheme for shares and gold at this point, and so I have announced the scheme. But we are still looking into the use of CPF for education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee (Kampong Chai Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, the answer to the question asked by the Member for Chua Chu Kang has some relationship. I would like to ask the Minister if he will agree that the implementation of this rule will benefit the richer CPF members. By that I mean, Mr Speaker, Sir, the higher income members of the CPF. Would the Minister agree that this scheme will benefit those richer members of the CPF who have already acquired a certain amount, or even a substantial amount, of shares in their hands? And in advantage of this scheme, they could easily dispose of their existing shares, say, $100,000, and use their CPF savings of $100,000 to acquire the shares, and so use that money for their children's education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask the Minister whether he will agree that those CPF members, who do not have existing shares or stocks in their hands, would not be able to use this advantage, quite legal and perfectly in order, to circumvent the CPF rules by taking out the money, quite justifiably, to use for their children's education? Would the Minister therefore agree that this provision will benefit those richer members but depriving the poorer members of the CPF, who are still faced with problems of finding money for their children's education?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the Member was asking a question or expressing his opinion on the subject.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> I asked the question with a proper question mark behind the sentence. If the Minister cannot understand, he should not be in this place.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> A very, very long question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> May I request Members not to be personal in their remarks. But I will just answer the question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have estimated that, based on this requirement of a minimum reserve of $30,000, about 300,000 members will be able to take part in the scheme. That is quite a large number of people. In fact, we feel that those people who have lower CPF savings should really save carefully and hold the money with the CPF, where it is safe and which pays a guaranteed return of 6 1/2% interest at present, before they venture out into more risky areas. Because when you invest in stocks and shares, and gold, you may make or you may lose. It is up to your judgment and good fortune. In fact, as for the poorer members, the majority of them are already using their CPF for housing. You know, more than half a million people now have their own homes. So these people have benefited from the CPF scheme, and they will further benefit from this scheme if they save enough. So it is erroneous to say that the CPF scheme is only meant for the richer members.

  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, may I ask a question? I agree with the Minister that investment of CPF funds in shares entails a high degree of risk on the part of the CPF member. I would therefore like to ask him about the criteria for companies qualifying as trustee shares companies. He has stated that this will be companies which have been able to declare dividends for the past five years. In view of the fact that there are companies who do not perform well but continue to declare dividends, does he not think that such a criterion would not be so prudent? Would it not be more prudent to define such companies as those which have been able to make a certain amount of profits, probably defined as a certain percentage of return on capital, rather than to use the criterion of having paid-up dividends continuously for five years?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that is a very good question. Now, we have to strike a balance here. The objective of the Government is to allow members maximum flexibility and choice. We do not want to limit them to any particular stocks because we do not favour any particular stocks. So the conditions that we have laid out are really the minimum conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify as a trustee stock, all that the company needs to have is just $5 million paid-up capital, which is not big by today's standards, and also to have paid dividends over the past five years. So members should really be very careful. It does not mean that trustee shares are safe shares. Members should really look at the future profit projections of the company. A company might have made money over the past five years but it may not be making money in the future. So they should go in with their eyes open.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the question, as I said, is how to draw a balance, which class of shares? What we are doing here is just to provide a minimum level of protection, beyond which we will be, in fact, investing the money for members, which will not be desirable. So I want to emphasize the point that members should go in with their eyes open, and they have to accept the consequences of their investment decisions.

  <br>

  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Leader of the House):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order. I think it is quite clear in the Standing Orders that a question cannot be framed as to ask for an opinion. This question is an opinion, and it is out of order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I agree with you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that applies to questions for oral answer, not on a Ministerial Statement. I hope the Leader of the House understands his Standing Orders.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding investment of funds in such shares which can be pledged to the banks and money may be used, will the Minister look into some safeguards? In other words, this money which comes from CPF to buy shares which can also be pledged to the banks means this money can still be used. So perhaps some safeguards may have to be looked into.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I do not understand the question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> The point really is this. Shares which you purchase with CPF funds can be used as shares to be pledged to the banks and from there you can get your money out, indirectly. In other words, you use the CPF money to buy shares and the shares are pledged to the bank, and you get the money out from the bank. So in that way, you are indirectly taking money out from the CPF. So I think some safeguards may be necessary because the amount involved may be quite large.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister please tell the House whether or not this scheme is to get the very slow stock market moving again, just as the second house scheme despite which the release of CPF did not move the property market?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not the intention of this scheme. The intention is to allow CPF members greater flexibility to manage their own savings. If they feel that they are better-off leaving their money with CPF, we will be most happy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the three examples tabled by the Hon. Minister, could he enlighten the House as to when his Ministry will be able to fully discharge item (e) Amount of Investable CPF savings? At the moment, it is only 10% of item (e), as given in item (f). And by that stage, will the CPF have enough money to fully meet the requirements of those seeking to make use of that amount?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if Members had listened carefully, they would have realized that the 10% was because we do not want to overheat the stock market. It is not related to the ability of CPF to provide the money. I said so before, that even if all the members were to be allowed tomorrow to withdraw their CPF money entirely, there will be enough money to pay. There is no doubt about that. As to when this limit of 100% of investable CPF savings will be reached, I can remind Members that, in fact, CPF members are now allowed to use 100% of their Ordinary Account savings for properties, either residential or commercial. So as far as properties are concerned, we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have already reached the limit, but for shares, gold and other instruments, we are approaching it cautiously to see how the market reacts, whether there are any problems to the scheme, and we will liberalize as we go along. It is difficult to put a time-frame on this.

  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Siglap):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have laid claim to speak on the Motion for Adjournment today on a matter which, I believe, is of considerable importance to the public and which I hope
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Cabinet could look into and consider action, if necessary.
  <div align="center">
   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter, Sir, which I am referring to has bearing on the dignity of MPs and their conduct, especially outside this Parliament. With regard to our conduct in this Parliament, I think the Standing Orders determine quite sufficiently how we ought to behave, what we ought to say, what we could and what we could not do. In fact, I am quite highly tempted to pursue the suggestion by the Member for Serangoon Gardens. But I am afraid I have to disappoint him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must accept that the values, the moral beliefs that MPs hold, determine their conduct, whether they be Ministers, whether they be Backbenchers, even Opposition MPs, and this in turn sets the tone of the political life and the quality of political activity in this country. I believe, Sir, we have heard of instances in countries where improper conduct has spelt the demise of governments. Now, while there are clear laws and rules governing who can and who cannot stand for election, there are, I am afraid, no definite guidelines or codes of conduct on how all Members of this House ought to conduct themselves after being elected to Parliament. Their conduct, Sir, is usually based on unwritten assumptions of fair play, moral behaviour and the dignity of their office. But this, Sir, can only be possible if and when each and everyone of us accepts these assumptions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, previously when this House comprised entirely of PAP MPs, control of a Member's behaviour and ensuring the proper conduct of its Members was easy and effective. A high standard of moral conduct was set by the Party leadership and, if I may say so, accepted and generally adhered to by all its Members. However, since the passing of legislation allowing for Non-Constituency MPs and with the entry of Opposition Members to this House, this quality control over MPs' conduct could become increasingly difficult. Now, new MPs like me would therefore be faced with codes of conduct different from what we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> know. Hence, as one who is new and still learning the rope in politics, I would therefore like to know if there could be some guidelines from Cabinet so that they could serve as common reference for all of us in this House. Sir, I would like to know, so do my new colleagues would like to know too, so do some of my constituents who asked me, they too would like to know.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for such guidelines is crucial because virtually everything we do outside this Parliament could be turned to political advantage by an unscrupulous but smooth politician. As an example, it would be entirely absurd for anyone of us to break the law, to get into scandals perhaps, or, even to commit a criminal offence, and then to portray it as a political act or, when convicted of that act, to portray it as political harassment or persecution.

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The point is, as I said, this would appear to be directed at a particular act or conduct on the part of my Party. It is an imputation on my integrity here and, what is more important, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it touches upon matters which are before the courts at the moment. The courts are inquiring into the whole matter at the moment. And here is a

  <br> Member - I do not know whether he knows what "sub judice" means - who is touching on matters which are strictly sub judice, talking about people convicted, of persons having been convicted in courts. I know what he is driving at and I ask for a ruling. Because if he is allowed to speak on that, then I shall claim the right to speak on the whole facts of the prosecution.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Things like what?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> It is examples like these, Sir, which make people view politics as dishonest, as unethical and even as a dirty and immoral activity. Woe betide. Everything, Sir, they say, is fair in love and war. Many would even say of this in politics. But need this be so in Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am well aware of the remarks describing PAP MPs as bland, as uninteresting, as uncolourful, as too prim and proper, as too straight and unbending. In short, a cross between a robot and a priest. It is possible that the codes that we live by make us so. And I concede that perhaps we ought to soften our sharp and rough edges. But I believe, Sir, that we should not compromise our scruples just to further our own political ends, with scant regard for the fate and well-being of our citizens and of our country. This standard, I submit, Sir, could only be maintained if we agree on the fair and proper rules of the game and conduct which all of us in this House, without exception, could adhere to. Therefore, if I could beseech the Cabinet to look into this proper rules of the game, and perhaps respond to my pleas.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Siglap has not got the courage, it would appear, to come quite clean with what he has in mind. That is the sort of conduct we have had from PAP Members in this Parliament. That is the sort of conduct that demeans the dignity of this House. He keeps talking about examples like this and like that. Like what? Why does he not have the courage, if he is a Member of Parliament, to say exactly what he means instead of trying to hide behind mumbo-jumbo?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in full agreement that Members of this House should comport themselves with dignity and decorum, not only in this Chamber but outside it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Ya, ya, ya! Listen. But what demeans the dignity of the Members of this House? Have you considered that? Does it or does it not demean the dignity of the Members of this House when you have Ministers who cannot and will not answer questions directly? Does it or does it not demean the dignity of this House when Ministers do not give even truthful answers to questions asked of them? That is the sort of conduct that demeans the dignity of this House to the people outside?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does it or does it not demean the dignity of this House when Members of Parliament do not and will not stand up to be counted according to their conscience? I have seen several instances in this House, since I came in here in 1981, when Members of the Government Party have been strident outside this House, telling their constituents that they are opposed to measures. And they come into this House to try and speak up. But when we put it to the vote, what happens? What happens? I have never had a single Member from the Government Party standing for what he has been voicing outside in protest to his constituents. May I ask whether it is that conduct that demeans the dignity of this House? Or is it the conduct where a Member is seen to be standing up for what he believes to be right, for the principles that he espouses at whatever cost to him? I would ask Members of this House to consider that. Which conduct demeans the dignity of this House? Which conduct demeans or attacks the privilege of this House? We have had someone complaining to this House about his being intimidated when he took part in parliamentary proceedings. Are we not going to uphold the privilege of this House?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is these things that demean this House - when Members are frightened to stand up and to be counted for what they believe in or what they profess to believe in outside, when Members sheepishly follow the Party dictate because they are frightened to lose their seats in Parliament
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> because of a loss of monetary gain. Is that not conduct which demeans the dignity of the Members of this House? Or is it conduct where a Member is seen to stand up for the principles that he espouses?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, on the Opposition Bench, have nothing to be ashamed of. We have stood up time and time again for the principles that we have espoused, and we are prepared to stand up and to be counted. So I would ask Members to think carefully about what conduct demeans the dignity of this House and of themselves as Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Siglap, as I said, was obliquely referring to an appeal that we had made. I could see that that was what he was driving at and that was what the motion was directed at. I am well aware of the Standing Orders that reference must not be made about proceedings in courts. I could speak on it if you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, will excuse me from the observance of that Standing Order. I could talk about these proceedings. So let us not smugly point an accusing finger without knowing the full facts. If you want to know the full facts about that prosecution, I will be very happy to enlighten you on it. I have tried to do it outside, in the courts. So I would be very happy to do it here, but I am aware of the constraint in this House because these proceedings are still before the courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson in his statement was trying to imply that the PAP MPs did not stand up on principles and, because of Party directives, compromised their scruples and allowed themselves to go against their conscience and just voted for the Party's directives. If I understood him correctly, this was what he meant. I think this is the most insulting thing that he has said of the PAP MPs. If he were to refer to the proceedings of this House in the last 10 or 15 years, and if he is honest in his assessment, he will notice that PAP MPs have stood up in this House to challenge Ministers' statements and Government policies on several occasions. They had not flinched when the moments came. But, of course, there were also moments in which they believed in what the Government was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> trying to do. Of course, the Opposition will never agree with the PAP's ideology and philosophy. And the fact that PAP MPs belong to the PAP must indicate that they believe also in the philosophies and ideologies of the PAP. Therefore, what is wrong for the PAP MPs, on matters of fundamentals which the PAP believes in, to stand with the party? It is perfectly in order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the point behind the motion of the Member for Siglap is this. Let me be very specific so that the Member for Anson cannot say that we are trying to dodge.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I on the behalf of the Government respond to the points raised by the Member for Siglap. I agree entirely with the Member that the conduct of Members of Parliament both in the House and, perhaps more so, outside the House sets the tone and character of the whole of our political life and process.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many things that we in Singapore can be proud of. We can be proud of our achievements in providing jobs for our people, homes for our people, education for our people. But I think one aspect that we can be most proud of is our political life and political process. We can be proud without any apology, when there was no Opposition in the House, for the tone and quality that we demanded and set for ourselves as political leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> "Yes, Sir. No, Sir."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Because what we do, not only determines the political process and the political life but also sets the whole tone of our society.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> "Yes, Sir. No, Sir."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> And there are many, many examples which I can quote of how the whole of society can go to the dogs when the political leaders do not set a high standard for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do you?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> I think it was the former First Deputy Prime Minister and the Member for Kreta Ayer who said that when PAP MPs enter politics they are taking up holy orders because the standards expected of them, not only in their political life but in their personal life too, are very high indeed. We have also set ourselves very high standards in some of the key institutions that are pillars of our society - our courts, our Parliament, our Cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Straits Times!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> These are key institutions of our society. No Singaporean who
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> has the welfare of the citizens and the future of Singapore at heart would do anything to undermine any of these key institutions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as this House is made up of Members of the PAP, of course, we could set and maintain and impose high standards. And as far as the PAP is concerned, we will continue to maintain these high standards, and we will continue to demand these high standards. I think every PAP member of this House knows the standards demanded of him, and that if he falls short of these standards, he will find himself dropped. Every one of us knows this. HBut for those who are not within the control of the party, I am afraid ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> We cannot say, "Yes, Sir. No, Sir."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> --- the Cabinet cannot do much. The laws pertaining to the qualification required for candidates for Parliament, the laws relating to the powers and privileges of Parliamentary Members, these only set minimum standards. There is a very wide gap between these minimum standards and the very high standards we set for ourselves in the PAP. We can only look to the good sense of everybody who participates in Singapore political life that we do not narrow these satndards. And apart from setting the example and making the appeal, I am afraid I have to tell the Member fgor Siglap that there is really nothing much we can do. But I think it behoves the Singapore electorate to consider what we have achieved and to always bear in mind that this is one aspect of our life which we have achieved with great cost and which is something that we should not give up easily.

  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Singapore Government paid for the travelling expenses of the official delegation to China and back. It amounted to S$64,631. No travelling and hotel expenses were incurred within China as the delegation was accorded hospitality by the Government of the People's Republic of China.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Between 1979 and 1984, Singapore's trade with PRC grew by more than one and a half times from $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion. If the PRC maintains its present trade policy and economic modernisation,there are good prospects of further increases in our trade, both in the immediate future and in the long-term.

  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> In September 1985, a representative of the Swediah Government informed my Ministry that his Government was investigating a Swedish company's involvement in any possible irregular re-exports of arms by it via Singapore; and that because of the investigation, his Government imposed a restriction on the Swedish company's export of arms. The Swedish representative requested for a written confirmation from my Ministry that the arms supplied by the Swedish company, pursuant to two procurement contracts in 1979 and 1981, were for the exclusive use of the Singapore Armed Forces and had not been exported to any third country. As this was in fact the case, my Ministry gave the confirmation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry was informed on the 22nd October 1985 by the Swedish Ambassador that his Government has since lifted the restriction on the export of military equipment to Singapore.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-disclosure stipulations are the norm in arms sales agreements. In the same way, when MINDEF buys arms from overseas, it insists on non-disclosure of the details of the procurements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of arms by MINDEF-controlled companies is subject to strict supervision by my Ministry. Every sale is carefully assessed for its political and security implications. It would be neither prudent nor responsible to disclose details of such sales.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the period 1981 to September 1985, 782 SAF personnel incurred various degrees of permanent disablement arising from training and work mishaps. Annual figures are:

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure for 1981 differs from that of 22 stated in a Written Answer to the Member for Anson on 31 Aug 82. The earlier figure was confined to National Servicemen. Also it covered only those cases where the degree of disablement had been settled by 31 Aug 82. Injuries take some time to stabilise before a final determination of degree of disablement may be made.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 782 cases in 1981-85, only 4 involve 100% permanent disablement. 95% of the 547 cases which have been settled involve less than 30% permanent disablement. Please see table below:

  <i>Compensation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As several hundred cases are involved, it would be more meaningful to list out the compensation provisions and give an indication of the amounts of compensation paid, than to list each case individually.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation benefits are specified in detail in the SAF Pensions Regulation, 1978. In summary, the provisions for death cases are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Lump sum payment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Various pensions and allowances as applicable, including:
  <pre>

          (i)  Widow's pension.

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre>

         (ii)  Child(ren)'s pension.

        (iii)  Dependent's pension for mother (or father if the mother is deceased).

         (iv)  Education Allowance for dependent children.

</pre> The provisions for cases of permanent disablement are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Lump sum payment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Pension and various allowances as applicable, including:
  <pre>

          (i)  Disability pension.

         (ii)  Allowance for constant attention.

        (iii)  Treatment allowance.

         (iv)  Education allowance for dependent children.

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantum of payment depends on the degree of permanent disablement, defined in the SAF Pensions Regulations on the same lines as in the Workmen's Compensation Act. Free medical and rehabilitative treatment and equipment for the disabled serviceman are provided,even after release from SAF service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lump sum compensations for the 54 cases of death in 1981-85 ranged from $15,000 to $52,000. This includes 10 cases involving National Servicemen, whose families were each paid $45,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lump sum compensations for the 4 cases of 100% disablement ranged from $45,000 to $ 60,000. This includes 2 National Servicemen,who were each paid $60,000 and another who was paid $45,000.

   <b>LOWER SHOP RENTALS UNDER RESETTLEMENT SCHEME</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether his Ministry will consider lowering the rentals of shops allocated under the resettlement scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Shop rentals for resettlement cases are already lower than those paid by public applicants. The resettlement rental is based on 90% of the rental payable by the lowest successful tenderer. Resettled shopkeepers need pay only 50% of the resettlement rental in the first year. The rental is increased by 10% each year. The full resettlement rental is paid only from the 6th year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the lower rentals, concessions offered to HDB shopkeepers to help them tide over the current difficult conditions are also extended to resettlement cases. These include:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a 15% rent rebate from Apr 85 to Mar 86 for shops allocated between 1.1.80 and 27.3.85.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a 1-year deferment of the 3rd stage rental increase for shops affected by the 1983 Rental Increase Exercise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a 30% property tax rebate from Jul 85 to Dec 86.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB also monitors the resettlement rentals for shops in its commercial complexes. Where the rentals are assessed to be too high,they are adjusted downward to reflect prevailing market conditions. Such adjustments have been made for the shops in Tanjong Katong Complex,Cheng Yan Court, Blk 55 Upper Changi Road and Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rentals of shops allocated under the resettlement scheme are therefore already very reasonable. There is no need for the HDB to consider lowering the rentals further at present.

</pre> Figures before 1982 are not available as the HDB does not keep these statistics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak of fire in HDB apartments is due mainly to the negligence or carelessness of residents. The main causes of fire are the use of faulty gas appliances, unauthorised electrical extensions,storage of combustible materials in the flat, leaving lighted gas stoves unattended, children playing with matches and the throwing of lighted cigarette butts out of the window into the flat below. In view of this,the HDB has concentrated on creating a greater sense of fire safety consciousness among residents. Home safety and fire
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> prevention exhibitions are regularly organized jointly with the Singapore Fire Service and grassroots organizations in HDB estates. Fire prevention messages are also incorporated in Residents Handbook and from time to time in HDB's "Our Home" magazine.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the HDB exercises strict control over renovations and alterations to flats. Works which are likely to increase the risk of fire are strictly prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The HDB has been exempted since 1960 from submitting building plans to the Building Control Division. This, however, does not mean that HDB's buildings do not comply with fire safety requirements for highrise dwelling units. The HDB buildings are designed according to different stringent fire safety standards. For example, the layout of lobbies and staircases allows smoke to disperse quickly. Design features together with the use of non-combustible building materials prevent the spread of fire from one flat to another.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the large number of HDB flats housing 82% of the total population, the outbreak of fire in HDB buildings has been extremely rare. In every case, the fire has been confined to the unit itself. This speaks for the fire safety standards adopted by the HDB.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> A total of 26 countries participated at the recent Asian Track and Field Championships held in Jakarta. 10 countries, including Singapore, did not win any medal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our population and our talent pool in sports are small. Our athletes are amateurs. Those who have the talent have to set their own individual priorities between sports and studies or working careers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member probably thinks that the Government should act to produce champions. Sports and other recreational interests must be left to the individual to pursue privately. These are not areas into which the Government should intrude too much.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government through the Singapore Sports Council's "Sports for All" policy provides the facilities to encourage healthy sports recreation for all citizens. The policy benefits everyone. It is up to those who are interested to take advantage of the facilities and train and discipline themselves to gain international recognition for their achievements. Some have done so, eg in swimming, squash and bowling.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>(a) The new international indoor stadium will be for multi-purpose use. It will provide facilities for sports, rallies, cultural events, musical shows, exhibitions and concerts. It will be airconditioned and incorporate the latest technological advances.
  <br>
  <br>(b) The estimated time for completion of the stadium is three years. The estimated cost is $68 million.
  <br>
  <br>(c) The multi-purpose nature of the stadium makes design work rather complicated and poses a real challenge. It is prudent to selecta reliable team of consultants who have experience in designing such structures and facilities.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) therefore decided to appoint a team of local and international consultants on an equal partnership basis. The appointment of a team involving more than one consultant firm is not a simple matter. Apart from technical competence, there must be assurance that the consultants can establish good working relationship with each other and work as one team. SSC decided to appoint a joint team of Raglan Squire &amp; Partners and Kenzo Tange.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenzo Tange Associates (KTA) was chosen as the foreign consultant as Prof Kenzo Tange has considerable experience working on projects in Singapore and is familiar with local conditions. He had also in 1972 drawn up a Master Plan for a "National Sports Complex" at Kallang which included an indoor stadium. As Prof Tange has done some preliminary work on the proposed indoor stadium, it is logical to appoint Kenzo Tange Associates as joint consultants to complete the project. He has also designed and supervised the construction of six multi-purpose indoor stadiums.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry if he will state the total amount held by the Public Utilities Board for deposit on accounts which have been closed and where the depositors have not been returned their deposits for some reason or other and what the PUB policy is as regards these deposits which are not claimed by depositors for some period of time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> When a consumer closes his account, PUB sends him a cheque for the balance of his deposit after offsetting the outstanding charges in his account. If the cheque cannot be delivered at the consumer's usual address, PUB tries to trace him through the National Registration Office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB has on record 2,171 closed accounts for which deposits totalling $154,400 have not been claimed despite efforts to trace consumers through the National Regsitration Office. This represents 0.3% of the total number of accounts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB maintains a record of such unclaimed deposits for six years to check claims by consumers. Deposits which are not claimed within the six-year period revert to the Board as revenue. Under the Limitation Act, PUB has no liability for claims made more than six years after the account was closed.

   <b>EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE FOR RELEASED PRISONERS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will consider taking measures to help those with previous convictions but who have lived a crime free life for three years after their release from prison to get employment either in the Government, Statutory Boards or the private sector and will the Government take a lead in offering them employment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> The Government does not as a rule exclude persons with previous convictions from seeking employment in the Civil Service or Statutory Boards. Generally, an enlightened policy is adopted towards convicted persons who apply for jobs in the public sector. Each case will be considered on its own merit. The seriousness and nature of the offence as well as evidence of rehabilitation and likelihood of recidivism and the nature of the job applied for need to be considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has a policy of assisting reformed ex-prisoners to secure jobs on release from prisons. The process of helping ex-prisoners to secure employment begins in the prisons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vocational training and work programmes are provided in the prisons. Prisoners acquire necessary skills and develop good work ethics so that they can secure suitable jobs after their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are Day Release Schemes for certain categories of prisoners. The prisoners on the Schemes are released to work in the day and return to the prisons after work. The Day Release Schemes are to prepare the prisoners for working life after their detention and to provide them with employment which they can continue after release.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before their release, all convicted prisoners who have served one year or more are offered employment and other assistance by a pool of trained Welfare Officers from the Ministry of Community Development's Prison Welfare Service and Aftercare Officers from the Singapore Aftercare Association. Assistance to secure employment for all released prisoners is therefore part of the rehabilitation process. Ex-prisoners who have difficulty in finding employment can seek assistance from the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Community Development or the Singapore Aftercare Association.

   <b>ROBBERY, HOUSEBREAKING AND THEFT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there has been a noticeable increase in the number of robbery, housebreaking and theft cases in the last six months; and, if so, what measures are being taken to curb this increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> There has been an increase in the number of robbery and theft cases in the first three quarters of 1985,whilst the number of housebreaking cases has decreased for the same period.Robbery increased from 375 cases in the first quarter to 395 in the second quarter and 467 in the third quarter. Housebreaking has decreased from 1002 cases in the first quarter to 850 in the second quarter and 900 in the third quarter. Theft cases increased from 5408 in the first quarter to 5803 in the second quarter and to 6549 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the crime situation under control, the police have increased preventive patrols in crime-risk areas and also adopted various enforcement strategies. More police officers have been put on plainclothes detective duties to concentrate on detecting and solving crimes. Anti-crime operations involving Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs), Police Task Force (PTF) and Voluntary Special Constabulary (VSC) officers, detectives and off-duty officers have also been stepped up. These measures have resulted in more arrests. Comparing the period January-September 1985 and January-September 1984, robbery arrests increased by 67 cases (22.1%) arrests for housebreaking increased by 47 cases (11.5%) and arrests for thefts increased by 303 cases (8.4%). The availability of on-line computerised screening at police stations since August 1985 has facilitated checks on suspicious persons and vehicles by patrol officers. As a result, more wanted persons have been arrested and stolen vehicles recovered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the police measures alone are insufficient to effectively control crime. Public cooperation with the Police is also necessary. Timely information from the public can greatly assist the police to detect and prevent crimes. The Police, on their part, will continue to keep the public informed of the crime trends in their neighbourhood and disseminate information on crime prevention through publications, regular exhibitions and talks. More Neighbourhood Watch Groups in residential areas and Crime Prevention Committees in commercial premises and shopping complexes will be organised. The establishment of more NPPs will also help to bring the police closer and more accessible to the public. Police Officers now work more closely with the residents living in the neighbourhood and with the community grassroot organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts to cultivate police/public cooperation have had an impact on crime control and arrest rates. There has been an encouraging trend over the last two months of members of the public rendering assistance to the police in arresting criminals. About 20 criminals were arrested either directly by members of the public or indirectly through information which led to the arrest of the criminals. These cases show that community-oriented policing is a step in the right direction.

   <b>JAYWALKING</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.
  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there has been a substantial increase in jaywalking offences in the past twelve months; and, if so, whether his Ministry is considering stricter enforcement measures in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> For the past twelve months (October 1984 - September 1985), a total of 866 persons were booked for jaywalking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the figures for this period ought not be compared with figures for the previous period (4,230) because over the years,the Police have altered their strategy from enforcement at all pedestrian crossing points in the city to one of selective enforcement at certain identified locations, e.g. accident prone areas and areas where there are numerous complaints of jaywalking. At the same time, greater emphasis is placed on public education on road safety. The number of persons actually booked, therefore, was reduced. In addition to the selective enforcement at certain pedestrian crossings, Police on normal patrol duties are also instructed to take enforcement action against jaywalkers and to advise pedestrians on the need to observe the Pedestrian Crossing Rules.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant indicator of the strategy is the number of pedestrians involved in road accidents. The number dropped from 1,301 from January to September 1984 to 977 cases for the corresponding period in 1985, a decrease of 24.9%. The number of fatal accidents involving pedestrians has also dropped from 67 to 47. Members of the public are now more conscious of their own safety on the road. The Police is therefore not considering stricter enforcement action against jaywalking. However, they will continue to enforce the Pedestrian Crossing Rules. The Traffic Police together with PWD will continue to identify accident-prone areas with a view to building more overhead bridges or installing other pedestrian crossing facilities. Furthermore, the police will still be visiting schools and community centres to encourage road safety through exhibitions and talks. Some 62,482 school children have been instructed on road safety through the Road Safety Park which was opened in 1981.

  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he is aware that Bedok Reservoir Road (from Bedok North Avenue 3 junction to Jalan Eunos junction) has become hazardous and what enforcement action will be taken by the Traffic Police to improve safety on this stretch of road in view of the daily indiscriminate driving by drivers of heavy vehicles serving the construction site in the vicinity and the illegal kerbside parking by vehicles throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> In the first three quarters of this year, there were 29 accidents along Bedok Reservoir Road between its junction with Bedok North Avenue 3 and its junction with Jalan Eunos. Fifteen of them involved heavy vehicles. The number of accidents on this road is considered high.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy flow of traffic, speeding vehicles, and illegal parking along the road are the main factors which have contributed to the high number of accidents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police are aware of the high accident rate at this location and have taken strict enforcement action to curb speeding and illegal parking. Between January and September this year, 238 vehicles were booked for speeding and 1,457 for illegal parking along the kerbside.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police and the Roads Division of the PWD had carried out joint site inspections of the road to determine how the flow of traffic and pedestrians could be better regulated. Following the site inspections, two traffic lights were recently installed in the area. One is a signalised pedestrian crossing light in front of Block 713, a point used by a large number of pedestrians patronising the hawker centre at Block 739. The other is a signalised traffic light near Block 704. The traffic lights became operational on 17 October 1985.

  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will provide the House with a statement showing: (i) the gratuities that were paid to those Members of Parliament who relinquished office as Ministers at the end of last Parliament stating the amount paid in each case; (ii) the pensions that are now drawn by them stating against each Minister the pension drawn by him; (iii) the gratuities that were paid to Members of the last Parliament who did not seek re-election,giving the amount against each Member; and (iv) the pensions that are currently drawn by those Members giving against each Member the pension drawn by him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Gratuities and pensions were paid, in accordance with the Parliamentary Pensions Act, to eligible Members of Parliament who relinquished office as Ministers at the end of the last Parliament and to eligible Members of the last Parliament who did not seek re-election. To be eligible for gratuity and pension benefits as a former Minister, a Member must have completed not less than eight years reckonable service as a Minister and attained the age of 50 years. If he has served less than eight years as a Minister, the period of his service as a Minister will be taken into account when his gratuity and pension benefits as a Member of Parliament are calculated. A former Member of Parliament will be eligible for gratuity and pension benefits if he has completed nine years reckonable service and attained the age of 50 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full annual pension for a former Minister is computed at the rate of 1/324 of his last-drawn annual salary for each completed month of reckonable service. The full annual pension for a former Member of Parliament is calculated at the rate of 1/360 of his annual salary for each completed month of reckonable service. 1/3 of the full annual pension for 12 1/2 years can be commuted into a lump sum gratuity. The remaining 2/3 of the annual pension is paid monthly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries of Ministers and Allowances for Members of Parliament are matters of public record as are lengths of service of retired Ministers and Members of Parliament. Pensions and gratuity entitlements are therefore calculable by anyone interested in the details.

  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he is of the view that the strength of the Singapore dollar may be a contributing cause for the present downturn in Singapore's economy and if it is, does the Government propose to do anything about it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The strength of the Singapore dollar is not responsible for the present downturn in the Singapore economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, in the absence of foreign exchange controls, the exchange rate of a country's currency is dependent on the country's balance of payments, its foreign exchange reserves, and the direction and magnitude of capital and monetary flows.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past decade, the Singapore dollar has appreciated against most major international currencies as a natural outcome of the strength of our economy, strong capital and monetary inflows, a tight fiscal policy which led to steady fiscal surpluses, and large and increasing foreign reserves. The value of the Singapore dollar is determined by these fundamental economic parameters. The Monetary Authority of Singapore intervenes only when foreign exchange speculators distort the value beyond its normal range against a basket of currencies of our main trading partners.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each country is run differently depending on its people, resources and state of development. It is not appropriate to adopt in total conventions drafted to meet the standards of more advanced Western countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has its own programmes for the vocational rehabilitation and employment of disabled persons. Thus the Disablement Resettlement Scheme of the Ministry of Labour assists persons disabled by industrial accidents to undergo vocational rehabilitation for the purpose of gainful employment. Under this Scheme, disabled persons are helped in securing on-the-job training in light industrial establishments as well as in sheltered workshops run by voluntary organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development administers an Incentive Scheme funded by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry to help disabled people to gain employment. Under the Scheme, the employer is reimbursed for the first 1 month's salary paid by him to the disabled employee. The Scheme also provides a transport and meal allowance of $5/- for the disabled employee during the first two weeks of his employment or until he receives his first salary payment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Handicaps Welfare Association has set up a Vocational Assessment and Placement Centre and a centralised job placement service with the support of the Ministry of Community Development and the Singapore Council of Social Services.

  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum</b> asked the Acting Minister for Labour whether the statements of accounts for Central Provident Fund contributors can be printed more frequently and show details such as the amount and date of contributions and deductions to facilitate verification.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Presently, the CPF Board issues statements of accounts to CPF members in January every year. From next year, the CPF Board will issue an additional statement to members in July. Two statements a year should meet the requirements of the majority of members. Those who need more frequent statements can at anytime obtain them from the Board's main and branch offices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board is looking into the Member's suggestion that the statements provide more details to facilitate verification.

   <b>(Early Retirement of Selected Employees)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Acting Minister for Labour how his Ministry views the practice by some companies to force early retirement on selected employees and if he will make a statement in particular on the exercise carried out by Jurong Shipyard noting especially the fact that all the selected employees were Singapore citizens and the Malaysian employees were left untouched.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The view of my Ministry is that no company should force its employees to accept early retirement. However, employees may agree to accept early retirement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jurong Shipyard, workers were offered benefits as specified in the Collective Agreement if they agreed to retire early to help the company cope with the downturn in the shipbuilding and repairing industry. A total of 275 workers took up the offer and collected the benefits provided under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after accepting the offer, some of the workers approached my Ministry for assistance alleging that they were forced to accept early retirement. They also wanted to claim extra benefits. My Ministry took up the matter with the Management and was informed that the union and the workers had agreed to the early retirement scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Management had given the assurance that the scheme was voluntary, my Ministry and the NTUC requested them to accept any worker who wished to return to the Shipyard without any break in service. The Management agreed to do so provided that the worker refunded the retirement benefit and other payments which he had collected under the scheme. 18 workers have since refunded the benefits they received and returned to work. Some other workers insisted on being allowed to return to work without having to pay back the retirement benefit and other payments they had received. This the Management could not accept.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that only Singaporean workers were involved in this scheme. The company had 139 Malaysian workers of whom 10 accepted early retirement. The company has over the past 3 years almost halved its foreign workforce through resignations and non-renewal of work permits when they expired.

  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) when the proposed pedestrian overhead bridge between Street 41 and Street 43 in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 will be ready; and (b) what will be its cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Work is now in progress on the pedestrian overhead bridge across Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 between Street 41 and Street 43. It will be completed by mid-February 1986. The cost of the bridge is $150,000.

   <b>OPTIONS ON STANDARD FEATURES OF HDB FLATS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a)what is the annual estimated dollar value of the work, such as doors and walls, including labour and materials, torn down and thrown out by owners in renovating their newly constructed Housing and Development Board homes; and (b) whether such wastage of resources can be avoided by allocating the flats earlier in the construction process and providing the potential owners with the option of accepting or rejecting HDB standard features as well as rebating any labour and materials savings to the owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>(a) HDB flat owners who tear down internal walls and doors when renovating their flats form only a small percentage of new flat owners. An estimated 1.7% of new flat owners are observed to have knocked down part of the internal walls and 8.6% to have replaced internal doors with decorative doors. Over the last 5 years, the estimated value of such renovations is about $1.7 million per annum. This is less than 0.1% of the total construction cost of $2.5 billion per annum.
  <br>
  <br>(b) Allocation of flats earlier with an option to accept or reject HDB's standard finishes just to cater for this very small group of owners may lead to higher cost for all new flat owners. If the option is given, HDB building contractors would be faced with different requirements for different flats and uncertainties over the final quantities required. Such uncertainties lead to higher tender prices.The co-ordination of the construction programme would be more complicated with higher administrative costs for the HDB and possible delays in completion of flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impracticability of this proposal is borne out by the experience of HUDC. Previously, HUDC flats were allocated when the flats were midway through construction. Lessees were given the choice of a variety of finishes. Tremendous administration and site supervision problems were encountered leading to contractors jacking up their tender prices for subsequent contracts to cater for such problems. This scheme has now been abandoned.

   <b>REVIEW OF CONTROL OF RENT ACT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what types of dwellings and how many units of each type are still under the Control of Rent Act; and (b) whether the government will review the need for the said Act in view of the liberalisation of government rules and regulations to encourage private entrepreneurship.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> All premises built on or before 7 September 1947, except those owned by government and statutory boards, come under the Control of Rent Act. Since 1947, many of these premises have been demolished or rebuilt through the process of development. The Ministry has not kept any record of the type and number of rent-controlled premises as there was no need to monitor such premises.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in consultation with the Ministry of Law and Inland Revenue Department, the Ministry is currently reviewing the need for the Control of Rent Act. Data on rent-controlled premises including the type and number is being collected. The study is expected to be completed next year.

  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what were the reasons for the delay by the Public Works Department in erecting pedestrian crossings and other road safety features along Bedok Reservoir Road although requests for them had been made by residents as early as November 1984 and the PWD knew well in advance the planned development for this neighbourhood; and (b) what and when additional measures will be taken by the PWD to avoid a recurrence of the recent tragic accident which resulted in the death of a 10-year-old schoolgirl whilst crossing this road.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> There is no delay in the erection of pedestrian crossings and other road safety features. Along Bedok Reservoir Road, there will be a total of 9 pedestrian crossings. 5 of these crossings have already been built and 4 more will be installed by the end of this financial year. It was unfortunate that the fatal accident should have happened while the crossings were progressively being built along Bedok Reservoir Road.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many of the 159 units of 3-room Housing and Development Board flats in Blocks 739 to 746 Bedok Reservoir Road have been sold up to the latest convenient date; and (b) when the HDB expects to complete selling all the units and when these units will be occupied in order to provide the badly needed clientele for the shop tenants there who have been suffering poor business for the past months, in some cases since January/February 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>(a) Not even one of the 159 units of 3-room HDB flats in Blocks 740, 742 and 744 Bedok Reservoir Road has been sold yet.
  <br>
  <br>(b) These flats are expected to be sold within the next few months and to be fully occupied by the second quarter of 1986.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shops in this neighbourhood centre serve a total of 3,687 residential flats in 45 blocks of which 3,400 flats (92%) have been occupied since the beginning of this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The occupation of the remaining 8% of these flats is unlikely to substantially improve the business of the shopkeepers.
