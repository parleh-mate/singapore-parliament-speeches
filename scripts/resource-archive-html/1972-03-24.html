<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 01 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item 001 of  subhead

101.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the Development

Estimates  last  year, the Minister  for  Law  and

National Development said that he hoped the Member

for  Katong  would  support his  project  for  the

building of the new subordinate court complex.  In

view  of  the  remarks I made regarding  the  slow

progress  d  building that was going on,  I  would

certainly  support  this  project  wholeheartedly,

because  a  place  where justice  is  administered

should   reflect  the  fresh,  crisp,  and   clean

atmosphere   and  appearance  which  characterises

Singapore.  I  hope that it will not be  necessary

before  long for those who are required to  appear

in  court  for one reason or another to experience

the   gloomy   atmosphere  of  dilapidation   that

characterises the present subordinate courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, with some dismay that I note

that  of  the  $2 million voted for last  year,  a

large  sum has been re-voted this year, the actual

amount  spent being less than $200,000. Last  year

we were promised that piling work was scheduled to

begin early in 1971. Now we are told that the same

piling work will begin in early 1972. Perhaps  the

Minister could give us a progress report  on  this

development,  and  assure us that  steps  will  be

taken to expedite the development of this project.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, speaking as a lawyer, I

would  associate myself with the  remarks  of  our

learned Member. The delay has been caused again by

resettlement  problems  as  we  experienced   much

difficulty  in  clearing the  site.  However,  the

Member  will be pleased to know that the site  has

now  been  completely cleared,  not  only  of  its

occupants  but  also  of  the  existing  buildings

thereon. The tender for piling was accepted on the

6th  of March this year. The piling contractor has

taken  possession of the site, and  has  commenced

piling on the 22nd of March.

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101(The same

amendment also stood in the name of Mr Teong

Eng Siong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

know  from  the  Minister for Communications  what

progress  has  been made by this Unit  last  year.

Sir,  since  there is an increase of $355,000  for

this  year, there must be some plans, and  if  so,

what   are  they?  Also  the  Memorandum  on   the

Development   Estimates   indicates    that    the

additional provision is for a feasibility study. I

would like to know what this feasibility study is,

and when will it be completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang):</b> I am not moving,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in the fortunate

position of being able to report some progress  in

respect  of  our  Mass Transit Planning  Unit.  An

application  has been made to the  United  Nations

Development Programme for assistance to  undertake

a study of this Mass Transit System. The objective

of  the study is, firstly, to compare the economic

feasibility of alternative mass transit systems in

the metropolitan areas, in relation to alternative

pricing policies for urban transport. Secondly, to

recommend   a   long-range  transport   investment

programme,    which   includes   mass    transport

facilities.  And,  thirdly,  to  define   specific

investment  projects as well as the implementation

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study will be guided by a steering

committee of seven officials under the Ministry of

Communications   and  will  be  carried   out   by

consultants employed by the World Bank,  which  is

the  participating and executing agency. The study

will  take  about  15  months. Five  international

consulting firms two from the United States,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



one  each  from  France, Germany, and  the  United

Kingdom  have  been  asked by the  World  Bank  to

submit  proposals, and the study  is  expected  to

commence sometime in the middle of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local counterpart and accounting staff are being

provided by Government and, in this connection,  I

am  pleased  to say that four local officers  have

been   sent   overseas  for  training  under   the

U.N.D.P./World  Bank  fellowships.  They  are  now

under  training in the United States,  Japan,  and

Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also found suitable accommodation to

house  the Mass Transit Planning Unit in a  P.S.A.

bungalow known as the "Golden Bell", and  we  have

provided  $855,000  for the coming  year  to  meet

Government contribution towards the project.  This

amount is to provide for the salaries of the local

counterpart and other subordinate staff, rental of

accommodation, P.U.B, services, etc.

the  new  Motor Vehicle Inspection Centre  at  Sin

Ming  Road is almost completed. Currently,  cables

for  the  supply of electricity are being laid  by

the  Public  Utilities Board, and the construction

of a dual carriage-way leading to the Centre is in

progress.  All these are expected to be  completed

by the middle of next month and, if all goes well,

this Centre will commence operation in May.

us  as  to  the  number of vehicles which  can  be

inspected at this Centre? I believe the Inspection

Centre  at the Registry of Vehicles, Middle  Road,

is  not  able  to  cope with the great  number  of

vehicles which are waiting to be inspected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I can assure the Member

that  there will be 10 additional inspection pits,

with  an  increased staff of 16, at the  Sin  Ming

Road  site.  We should, therefore, be able  to  do

much  more  than what we have been  doing  now  at

Middle  Road, which has: a capacity  of  only  six

inspection  pits. I must add that the Middle  Road

Inspection  Centre will continue to  be  used  for

private vehicles. The new Sin Ming Road Inspection

Centre  will he used for the inspection of  public

service  and goods vehicles, such as buses,  taxis

and lorries, and the present Inspection Centre  at

Middle  Road  will  be confined to  inspection  of

private vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I thank the Minister for his

reply. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the headquarters of

the Registry of Vehicles will soon be relocated at

Sin  Ming  Road. In this connection,  I  have  two

simple and straightforward questions to put to the

Minister for Communications. Is this vote of  half

a million dollars to provide for the total cost of

the   building?  Has  construction  work  on   the

building actually started, and, if so, when is  it

expected to be completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have merely

one  small point to clarify with the Minister  for

Communications. I would like to know  whether  the

R.O.V, headquarters  at  Sin  Ming  Road  will

eventually be the R.O.V, headquarters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  Member for Mount-batten, I would like to say

that  a  piece of land of about three and a  half

acres  has  been  allocated by  the  Housing  and

Development  Board for the building  of  the  new

R.O.V, headquarters. This land is adjacent to the

new  Motor Vehicles Inspection Centre at the  Sin

Ming  Road  site, which has a total area  of  2.4

acres, if we combine the two areas, we shall have

a  new  R.O.V, headquarters occupying almost  six

acres of land. It is, therefore, our ultimate aim

to remove completely the R.O.V, headquarters from

Middle Road to the Sin Ming Road site. Of course,

we  have  to  begin first with the new Inspection

Centre  at Sin Ming Road, so as to cope with  the

increasing  demand for the inspection  of  public

service  vehicles.  Later, we will  transfer  the

R.O.V, headquarters from Middle Road to the  Sin

Ming  Road site. When this transfer is completed,

we will also provide a new driving test centre at

the  new  R.O.V, headquarters. This is to replace

the present test centre located at Maxwell Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole cost of the project for this new

R.O.V, headquarters is around  $5  million.  The

Ministry  of  Finance has already supported  this

project to the tune of $4.5 million. There is  no

urgency to move the headquarters to its new site,

which  is  still under acquisition. The provision

shown in the Development Estimates for the coming

year  is to enable piling and earth-works  to  be

carried out during the course of this year.

tourists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,, in reply to

the  Member for Sembawang,. I would like  to  say

that  the redevelopment of the Passenger Terminal

Building was completed in September last year, in

time for the arrival of the Jumbo jets. What  has

yet  to  be done is the installation of equipment

which costs about $1 million. Hence a revote  has

been  made  for  the coming year. The  equipment,

which  includes telecommunications equipment  and

the   flight  information  display  system,   was

ordered but has not yet arrived, and therefore no

payment  was made in the 1971-72 financial  year.

But  I think the equipment will be delivered soon

and put into operation sometime in the middle  of

this  year;  hence,  the  revoted  provision,  in

addition, a portion of this provision is for  the

cost  of completed works, which has been retained

as  retention  fees, and late payment  for  other

completed works, which has to be made in the next

fiscal year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the Passenger Terminal

Building redevelopment has resulted in more  than

doubling   the  floor  area  of   what   it   was

previously,  and it should therefore give  better

service  than what it used to provide before  its

re-development.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead  303.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $200,000 under this subhead is

for  the setting up of a new Air Freight Terminal.

I  have  two simple questions to ask the Minister.

First,  has  this  new Air Freight  Terminal  been

completed  and, if not, when will it be completed?

If it has been completed, then what is the purpose

of  this  additional provision, which  includes  a

revote   of  $50,000?  What  services  will   this

terminal  provide? All this money comes  from  the

taxpayers, and we have to see that it is  properly

spent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang is right this time. The new Air  Freight

Terminal  has  yet to be completed. This  Terminal

forms  part  of  the intermediate  phase  `of  the

development proposals for our Airport costing $2.3

million, out of a total development cost  of  over

$100  million. The foreign cost-component of  this

project, which is estimated at $1.7 million,  will

be  financed by an Asian Development Bank loan  of

over $60 million. This Bank has projected that  an

annual  total of 79,000 metric tons of air freight

is  likely to be handled at Paya Lebar Airport  in

three  years' time, that is, in 1975. That is  the

year  in  which  the new Air Freight  Terminal  is

expected  to  be fully completed and  operational.

The tonnage of the air cargo handled last year was

25,000 metric tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area where the Air Freight Terminal is to be

sited  has been acquired. It is in the process  of

being  cleared of squatters. Extensive  earthworks

will have to be carried out on the site to prepare

for drainage, and building construction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



work  is expected to commence in April next  year.

Estimates.

have  two  questions to ask the Minister. Firstly,

is  the  building  in the process of  construction

and,  if  so, when will it be completed? Secondly,

what facilities will be provided in this building,

and  whether the services will be better than what

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 307 refers to the New Boeing 747

Hangar  and  a  sum  of  $1.5  million  has   been

provided.  I  wish  to  ask  the  Minister   three

questions: (1) When will this Hangar be completed?

(2) What is the total area of this Hangar, and how

many Boeing 747s can it accommodate? (3) What  are

the  charges per day for each aircraft garaged  in

this Hangar?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the New Sub-terminal Building at an approved cost of $31.3

million is also part of the intermediate phase  of

the  development plan for our Paya Lebar  Airport.

We expect it to be completed by 1976 or earlier in

order  to  cater  for  the  very  high  growth  of

passenger traffic over the next few years. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



stated previously that passenger traffic for  last

year, 1971, passed the two million mark, and it is

anticipated  that  by 1975, the passenger  traffic

through  Paya  Lebar  Airport  would  exceed   3.6

million per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land for the new sub-terminal building has been

acquired,  and  it  is  in the  process  of  being

cleared   for   preparatory  building   works   to

commence.  The first phase of the works is  mainly

that of earth filling which has to be carried  out

over a very wide area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Member has also asked what is

the  anticipated revenue. For the present,  I  can

say  that  the  revenue will increase considerably

because there will be more planes landing at  Paya

Lebar  Airport. I do not think I need go into  the

details  of  the  revenue except  to  say  that  a

considerable amount of revenue is expected as time

goes on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the New Boeing 747 Hangar, there is a

provision of SI ,500,000. The project cost is  $12

million for this hangar and it forms part  of  the

intermediate  phase of the development  plan.  For

the information of Members, the size of the hangar

is  300  feet x 300 feet x 80 feet. This provision

of  $1 million is to meet the cost of earthworks,

drainage, and the laying of pavements, which  will

be carried out in the next fiscal year. We hope to

get this hangar operational in two years' time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister inform the House as to what

is  this Airport Information Dissemination System?

I understand that it is not a closed circuit T.V.;

but  that  it  works  on an electronic  principle,

which  is  an  improvement over the old  fashioned

closed circuit television.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol  is  right  in stating  that  the  Airport

Information Dissemination System, in short,  AIDS,

is  an electronic data display system for our  air

traffic  controllers  and is an  improvement  over

what  was  previously known as the closed  circuit

television  system. AIDS will display air  traffic

flight  data  and other associated information  to

the  air  traffic controllers, and  thus  enabling

them   to   exercise  their  air  traffic  control

functions  efficiently. The  current  practice  is

done  through an intercommunication system,  which

is  hardly an efficient system. It is slow because

of the need to transmit data to multiple addresses

and also because of the writing work load involved

at  each receiving unit. The existing system  with

its heavy manual work load will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



able  to  cope  with  the increasing  air  traffic

passing  through Paya Lebar Airport.  Accordingly,

it   is   necessary  to  provide   an   electronic

information  dissemination system which  will  not

only  speed up the work of air traffic controllers

but  will also relieve them of their manual  work,

thereby  enabling  them to  concentrate  on  other

essential functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is estimated to cost $250,000 in all,

but  $50,000  have been provided  for  the  fiscal

year,  1972-73, for initial preparatory work.  The

scheme  is planned for commissioning in two years'

time, 1974. I would like to add further that  AIDS

will  form  an  integral part of  the  future  air

traffic  control system at the Paya Lebar  Airport

when   other   facilities,  such   as   long-range

surveillance  radar, are implemented around  1975.

In  the coming years of supersonic air travel,  it

is  imperative that the air traffic controllers be

provided  with  suitable  and  adequate  tools  to

enable them to perform their functions efficiently

to  match  the  speed of supersonic aircraft.  The

electronic AIDS is such a tool.

Could  the  Minister for Education enlighten  this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$750,000 is provided for the proposed setting up

of the Singapore Educational

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister also tell us what will be the

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum originally

allocated last year was meant for the purchase  of

studio  equipment  and other  photographic  needs.

Members  may  be aware, at the beginning  of  last

year  an agreement was reached between UNESCO  and

Singapore  to  expand  the Educational  Television

service  into  a  full-fledged  educational   mass

media.  A  feasibility team was formed, and  their

report  has just been completed. For this  reason,

only   $1,300  has  been  spent  during  the  last

financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired into the functions of

the new Educational Media Services. This primarily

involves  the  enlargement of  the  range  of  the

as E.T.V.

Minister of State for Education has used the  word

"range",  I  will  rephrase my question:  can  the

SEMS? I believe he has not satisfactorily answered

my question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, SEMS involves the

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item 001 of  subhead

203.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an acute shortage of students'

hostels  in  Nanyang University. At the moment  101

Honours  students, 120 Pre-university students  and 27   Russian  and  American  students  of   Nanyang

University   are   all  housed   in   Jurong   Town

Corporation flats. Because of a shortage of hostels

for girls, three students' hostels and another half

meant for boys have been converted into hostels for

girls.   So  those  local  students  who  ask   for

allocation   of  accommodation  in  the  University

hostels are not allowed because they must give  way

to foreign students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now there is a request for a revote. With the

development  of Nanyang University, there  will  be

more   students  requiring  hostel  facilities   in

Nanyang   University.  Two-thirds   of   the   land

belonging to Nanyang University are not being used.

Since  Nanyang University had asked for a vote  for

students  hostels  and the vote was  approved  last

year,  how is it that this vote is carried  forward

to  this  year? If we have to wait for the approval

of  the  10-year development plan,  then  with  the

present  administration of Nanyang University,  the

building of students' hostels will not be in  sight

for  a  very  long time. It is the  policy  of  the

Government to assist Nanyang University in building

hostels.   I  do  not  know  whether  the   10-year

development  plan has been accepted or not;  anyway

the   details   have   not  been   announced.   The

development  plan and the hostels are two  separate

matters;  they are not closely related. I hope  the

Ministry of Education will ask for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



necessary vote to help Nanyang University to  build

all the necessary hostels to alleviate the hardship

and  to solve the problems of the students in terms

of accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, as there are a few

amendments on the Order Paper Supplement  regarding

the development of Nanyang University, I would like

to  take  this opportunity, in answering the  first

question  from the Member for Delta, to make  clear

the  philosophy  of the physical development  of  a

university.   Universities  are   not   built   and

developed just for today, for tomorrow, or for  the

year. They are built to stay for hundreds of years.

Therefore, any physical development programme  must

be  considered  in the greatest detail.  We  cannot

build  a cluster of concrete buildings just because

there  happened to be some empty space, or  because

it  is  the most suitable development to  meet  the

needs  for  the present. I believe it  is  in  this

context that the Member for Jurong last year  asked

whether  a Master Plan was being prepared  for  the

Nanyang University. I believe Members know  that  a

10-year development programme has been prepared and

is  under  active consideration by the Ministry  of

Education.  The  building of students  hostels  and

other  forms of development are part and parcel  of

the  total  physical  development  of  the  Nanyang

University,  and  therefore the matter  has  to  be

looked, into very closely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (In Mandarin.):</b> Sir, it goes

without  saying  that we must build in  preparation

for  their use for the next 100 years or more.  But

at the moment the students have no place to put up.

Before  you  can  finish your  10-year  development

programme, the lot of them will not be able to live

anywhere within the University campus. They have to

put  up  in flats in Jurong Town together with  the

workers.  Perhaps because of the  present  lack  of

hostels,  many students are not able  to  join  the

Nanyang University. So you must have both the long-term plan and also the short-term plan. I hope  the

Minister will answer this question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, in order to get over the

short-term problems, I think the Member knows that

we have certain accommodation facilities in Jurong

Town   made   available  to   Nanyang   University

students.  To solve this problem further,  perhaps

we  can  look into the possibility of renting  out

premises or quarters returned to us by the British

Forces on their withdrawal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point I would like to make about

this  question of travelling. I think our students

are  being a bit spoilt! I do not see what  is  so

difficult  to  travel  six  miles  to  go  to  the

university to study. I used to travel 12 miles  to

study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (in Mandarin):</b> Sir,

notwithstanding  the  fact that  the  Minister  of

State   had  travelled  several  miles  to  attend

lectures, in my days overseas I had also travelled

about  one  hundred miles to attend lectures.  But

Singapore  is  Singapore. We  cannot  compare  our

situation with conditions overseas. At the present

moment,  there are 92 units of J.T.C, flats  made

available  for  Nanyang University  students,  but

only  half  of  them  are  occupied.  Perhaps  our

Nanyang University undergraduates are not prepared

to  live  in  the J.T.C, housing estates,  because

they  would  have no choice but to travel  a  long

distance to attend lectures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will ask for more money from

the  Ministry of Finance to build more hostels.  I

understand   that  at  the  present   moment   two

buildings  have  been put up by  the  Hokien  Huay

reduced  by $10 in respect of item 003 of  subhead

203.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the building of the sports complex in the

Nanyang University should not be delayed any more.

Originally  a  vote of $700,000 was  asked  for  a

sports  complex. After revision and  reassessment,

another  request  was made for $1.2  million,  but

this  was  turned down. In order  to  provide  the

urgent  needs  of students for sports  facilities,

the  Nanyang University have condescended  to  cut

down  their  original request for an Olympic-sized

swimming  pool for the sports complex. Because  of

that,  the  sum was reduced from $1.2  million  to

$900,000,  but the request for this sum of  money,

which  was made to the Ministry of Education,  has

so far not been approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nanyang University urgently requires a

sports  complex. This time last year when we  were

debating  the  same  item  under  the  Development

Estimates,  the Minister of State agreed  with  me

that  of  these  three items  in  the  Development

Estimates - students' hostels, staff quarters  and

sports  complex  - the most urgent were  students'

hostels  and  the  sports  complex.  Sir,  at  the

present   moment   whenever  it   rains   in   the

University, all sports or physical activities have

to   be  stopped,  because  these  activities  are

carried  out in the open air and it is  impossible

to  carry on in the rain. The building of a sports

complex  will not only solve the present needs  of

the  students but will also provide facilities for

the  training of coaches and instructors  for  the

various  schools in Singapore. There is no  reason

for  the  Minister for Education not to press  the

Ministry  of  Finance  further  for  the  vote  to

complete  the  building of the sports  complex  as

early as possible.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

we are more ambitious than the Member for Delta. It

is  precisely  because we do not want a  half-sized

swimming  pool  but a full-sized swimming  pool  of

Olympic standard that negotiations are still  going

on.  Since the Budget sitting last year, a team  of

experts has been engaged to draw up the Master Plan

for the development of Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the complaint by the Member for Delta

against sports activities being held in the rain, I

can say that this only enhances the argument of the

wisdom  of  making  students  do  national  service

before they join the university.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 203.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I am seeking

elucidation   from  the  Minister  of   State   for

Education  on the matter of students'  hostels  and

staff  quarters. Sir, this question was  raised  in

last year's debate on the Development Estimates  in

this  House.  At that time, there  was  a  vote  of

$500,000  for  the construction of staff  quarters.

But according to this year's Development Estimates,

the  same amount of $500,000 is being re-voted  for

the  same purpose. We can see from this that  there

has  been a prolonged delay in the construction  of

staff quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that the provision

of  quarters to the staff of Nanyang University  is

considered  an urgent matter. There  are  about  30

members  of the staff in Nanyang University waiting

for   staff  quarters.  Furthermore,  Sir,  because

Nanyang University is situated in an outlying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



area,  lack  of  quarters will  cause  considerable

inconvenience  to  the  staff,  and  it  will  also

aggravate  the difficulty of recruiting more  staff

for  Nanyang University, since new staff will  have

to travel all the way up there to work. As a result

of this, I would like to ask the Minister concerned

the reasons for the delay.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  I  can elaborate any more than what  I  have

said when I answered the question put by the Member

for  Delta. It is considered as part and parcel  of

the  Master  Plan, and this is being considered  by

the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  he has said that staff quarters is part  and

parcel of the whole development plan, we must  wait

for the Master Plan to be approved before we can do

anything.  In that case I would like to  know  when

the Master Plan will be approved and when will such

approval be announced. Sir, in last year's  debate,

in  answer  to my question, the Minister  of  State

said  that  as  soon as the Ministry  of  Education

received  the 10-year development plan for  Nanyang

University it would be announced. This can be found

in Volume 30 of Hansard, Col. 1293. I would like to

ask the Minister of State to implement what he said

last year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry

of  Education  has  already  received  the  10-year

development plan. I believe the Council of  Nanyang

University  has issued a statement  and  the  local

press has fully publicised this. As to when we  can

implement the Master Plan, we have only gone to the

stage of conceptual planning and have not drawn out

the physical development plan as yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

can  the Minister of State tell the House how  much

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note, Sir, that the Government plans

to  build three primary schools, one of which  will

be in Tiong Bahru. I would like to ask the Minister

concerned  where will the new school be built,  and

when   will  construction  commence?  I  hope   the

Minister will not consider my request as excessive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the 1970 census, there were in

Tiong  Bahru about 7,652 children in the age  group

of  five  to  nine. These children  should  by  now

already be in primary schools. But this figure does

not  include those children who have moved into the

Housing   and   Development  Board  flats   in   my

constituency in the last two years. At the  present

moment,  there  are  33  classrooms  in  the  three

primary  schools in my constituency, and  they  can

accommodate  a maximum number of 2,640 students  if

there   are   double  sessions  running   with   an

accommodation of 40 students per class. I hope  the

Minister  concerned  will sympathetically  consider

the  urgent request of my constituents to  build  a

school early.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

implementing  our  school  building  programme   as

contained in the Development Plan, we do  not  take

into  consideration the needs of each  constituency

but the area as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the proposed primary school at

this financial year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the shortage of primary schools in Toa Payoh is  an

annual  problem.  Every year,  parents  clamour  to

enrol  their children in schools near their  homes.

Some  of  them even had to camp overnight at  these

schools   to   ensure  that  their   children   are

registered. There are only three primary schools in

Toa  Payoh proper and 11 other schools in Toa Payoh

constituency.  But they are all sited  outside  the

Toa  Payoh  housing estate. I understand there  are

several   sites   reserved  by  the   Housing   and

Development Board for the construction  of  primary

schools  in  Toa  Payoh. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister of State how many of these sites have been

reserved by the Ministry of Education and how  many

have been taken up by private organisations for the

construction of primary schools in Toa Payoh?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not able

to  give  the  exact details of  how  many  private

say that plans are being finalised to resite in Toa

Payoh housing estate two aided primary schools  and

three aided full-schools, that is, a primary and  a

secondary school housed in one building. There  are

also plans to build three other primary schools  as

replacements in that area in the future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that although a sum of $1 million has

been   allocated  for  the  construction   of   new

secondary schools, none is to be provided for Tiong

Bahru constituency. I am jealous about this. In his

answer  to  my question just now, the  Minister  of

State  for  Education said that  his  Ministry  was

still  considering the 10-year development plan  in

which  the building of new secondary schools  would

depend on the needs of the various constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister of State to take

note of the statistics I am going to quote, which I

hope will help him in his consideration of the  10-year  development  plan. According  to  the  census

taken  in  1970,  Bukit  Ho Swee  had  about  7,363

children  between  the ages of  10  and  14;  Delta

6,385;  Bukit Merah 9,039; Queenstown,  5,993;  and

Tiong  Bahru  8,094.  In all these  constituencies,

Sir,  Bukit Ho Swee has two secondary schools  with

60 classrooms; Delta, two secondary schools with 46

classrooms; Bukit Merah, one secondary school  with

25  classrooms; Queenstown, three secondary schools

with 100 classrooms. In Tiong Bahru, there is none.

Sir,  by  giving  all these statistics,  I  am  not

complaining  that there are more secondary  schools

in  other constituencies. But the Minister of State

concerned has answered me earlier that schools  are

built  according  to the needs of  the  area  as  a

whole. That being so, according to the 1970 census,

there are altogether 36,874 children in the correct

age group for admission to secondary schools in the

five constituencies. And there is a total number of

eight  secondary  schools, housing  231  classrooms

with  accommodation for 18,480 students.  It  would

appear,  therefore, that there is an acute shortage

of secondary schools for these five constituencies,

it means that there is only one place for every two

students in these five areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister concerned will look into this.

Tiong  Bahru's appreciation of the difficulties  we

are  facing.  In  fact, in view  of  the  predicted

shortage  of  places  at  Secondary  I  level,  the

Ministry of Education has, at the beginning of this

year,  expanded the facilities of all the secondary

schools  in  the  Queens-town area, which  includes

Tiong  Bahru.  As  a  result, only  a  few  hundred

students  were posted out as against  a  figure  of

over   a  thousand  last  year.  However,  we  have

earmarked  two new secondary schools  to  be  built

within  the  Queens-town area  in  our  Development

Plan.  Of  course, the Member will also  appreciate

that  we are at the moment faced with the fact that

the  bulge of the population is in this age  group,

and it will only level off around 1976.

question of building a secondary school in  Jurong.

On   two  previous  occasions,  I  have  asked  the

Minister concerned to consider building a secondary

school  in Jurong Town. I am glad to note that,  in

the Memorandum on the Development Estimates for the

next  financial  year,  the  Ministry  has  finally

agreed  to allocate the sum of $1 million for  this

purpose. This is good news for the people living in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment, may I

ask  the  Minister of State for Education  whether

any provision is being allocated for the extension

of the existing secondary school in Jurong. I have

appealed  to the Minister on several occasions  to

extend   Jurong  Secondary  School.   The   Jurong

Secondary  School is one of the smallest secondary

schools in Singapore and it lacks many facilities.

In   view  of  the  increased  population  in   my

constituency of Jurong, there is an urgent need to

extend the Jurong Secondary School. I believe  the

Minister  has received a very detailed  memorandum

from the principal of this school requesting funds

for  the urgent extension of the school. I do  not

like to repeat the reasons for this extension, but

to ask the Minister whether any provision has been

made for the extension of Jurong Secondary School.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if my memory

serves  me  right,  the present  Jurong  Secondary

School   has  only  eight  classrooms.  It   will,

therefore,  be  extremely  uneconomical  to  spend

large  sums of money to extend it into a  standard

type  secondary  school, especially  when  we  are

going to build a 24-classroom secondary school  in

Jurong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Jurong Secondary School is for children living

in Jurong Town. According to the Development Plan,

Jurong  Town  will  soon  have  a  population   of

100,000.  The Jurong Secondary School also  caters

for  children  living in Chua  Chu  Kang  and  The

surrounding  areas.  According to  investigations,

there are altogether 47 Primary VI classes in this

area  with  a  student  population  of  9,000.  In

addition to the Jurong Secondary School, there  is

the  Jalan  Lama Secondary School. However,  these

two  secondary  schools  are  not  big  enough  to

accommodate all the students who would be  leaving

primary  school.  There is, therefore,  an  urgent

need  to extend the Jurong Secondary School.  Even

if  the  number of classes is not extended,  there

should  at  least be more facilities so  that  the

students  will  feel  that  their  own  school  is

comparable  with  other schools. The  students  of

Jurong  Secondary School will, therefore,  not  be

ashamed of their own school because of the lack of

laboratory  facilities.  I  would  appeal  to  the

Minister   of  State  to  consider  this  question

seriously.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree

with  the  Member for Jurong that there should  be

sufficient  places  for  students  in  any   given

locality.  However,  in the  case  of  the  Jurong

Secondary  School, I think any  extension  to  the

school  will take just as long a time to complete,

and it will probably cost more than building a new

school. The whole point of the question is whether

it would be better to build a new secondary school

or  to  spend as much money on extensions to  this

particular school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  not  satisfied with the answer  given  by  the

Minister of State. Jurong Secondary School  has  a

great  prestige built up over the years, lit  has

twice   won   first  prize  in  the   horticulture

competition organised for schools in the whole  of

Singapore. The students have also done  very  well

in  the  field  of  sports. Academically  too  the

students have shown a very good performance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,    my   request   is   worth    serious

consideration  by  the  Minister  of  State.  Even

though  he does not wish to build more classrooms,

he  should build more laboratories. There is  only

one  laboratory now, and that is used for biology,

chemistry  and  other experiments.  What  about  a

domestic  science laboratory?  I  think  it  is  a

question worthy of his consideration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

deny  that  the Jurong Secondary School  has  done

very  good work over the last few years.  But  the

proposed  plans for the extension to  the  school,

referred  to  by the Member for Jurong  just  now,

are,  I  am  afraid, too elaborate.  The  proposed

extension  will cost almost as much as building  a

new  school, and therefore we cannot consider  any

proposal of that magnitude.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

will the Minister of State then consider this?  If

it  is agreed not to extend the number of classes,

will  he  consider  the  provision  of  additional

laboratories  for  domestic  science   and   other

necessary facilities?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

about  12  Government schools  in  the  Queenstown

area.  We  are  at the moment engaged  in  a  very

interesting  experiment  of  building  a  "special

facilities" room. Perhaps the needs of the  Jurong

Secondary  School can be considered in  a  similar

light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State

whether  he is prepared to make some provision  to

rebuild  Loke  Yang  Public  School.  May  I   say

something  about  this  school?  This  school  was

originally situated at the 16th m.s.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



Jurong  Road. It was later demolished as a  result

of   a   resettlement  scheme.   The   authorities

concerned  had reserved two acres of land  at  the

9  m.s. Lim Chu Kang for the re-building of this

public school. I understand that all the villagers

have been moved out from the Jurong area. They are

mainly poor farmers. It is, therefore, unfair  for

them to bear the cost of rebuilding this school. I

hope  the Ministry of Education will provide  some

funds,  at least on a dollar-for-dollar basis,  to

help these people to rebuild Loke Yang School.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish  to raise two questions  under  this

subhead. The vote under this subhead is in respect

of  Capital  Grants  to Government-Aided  Schools.

This  is  a  form of financial assistance  to  the

aided   schools   for  various   expenditures.   I

understand  that  it  is quite  difficult  to  get

approval  for  such grants. For instance,  certain

schools  have  applied  for assistance  to  repair

school  equipment and furniture, such  as  chairs,

but  their  applications have usually been  turned

down because of the tedious procedure involved.  I

hope  the  Minister of State will look  into  this

matter  to see whether there is any truth in  such

allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $1 million for the next

financial  year is quite a large sum of  money.  I

wish to know whether any applications have already

been made in this regard.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

just  wish  to  raise  one  question  about  aided

schools. I cannot understand why the Umar  Pulavar

Tamil  School at Maxwell Road has no  field  or  a

playground.  I  wonder whether  the  Minister  can

provide a playing field for that secondary school.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to

the question raised by the Member for Sembawang, I

believe  he  is  aware of the  policy  on  capital

grants.  This  policy has been  enunciated  by  my

Minister in answer to a question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



raised  during  the debate on the Main  Estimates.

There is no point for me to dwell on it again.  As

regards the particular point he has raised, if my

memory  serves me right, the Ministry has not  yet

received any proposals, and therefore I am not  in

a position to answer him one way or another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question raised by the Member

for  Jurong, I am sure he realises that there  are

sufficient  places for primary school entrants  in

Singapore,  except perhaps in those schools  which

are  located  out  of the way. There  are  primary

schools  in certain areas which are not, in  fact,

fully occupied. Therefore, we cannot consider  any

request  too generously. However, if  he  has  any

case    which    he   thinks   deserves    special

consideration, will he please let us know. I think

the  Member for Sembawang has also asked for  the

names  of  schools which have applied for  capital

grants. I am afraid I do not have the details with

me  now. If he so wishes, he can give notice of  a

Question  for Oral Answer, and I shall  then  give

him the full details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Anson, I am not very

familiar  with  the  Tamil  school  in  the  Anson

constituency.  There  are playing  fields  in  the

other schools in that constituency, and I am  sure

the  students from that Tamil school can use them.

Alternatively, they can make use of the  community

centres in that constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  the  site  at Lim Chu Kang  area  was  being

selected  for  a school, a representative  of  the

Ministry of Education was present. Therefore,  the

Minister  of State for Education cannot deny  that

his  Ministry is not responsible for re-siting the

Loke Yang School. However, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether he will give sympathetic

consideration to an application by this school for

funds to rebuild it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for the Hotel and Catering

Training Centre is $258,600. I would like to raise

five questions: (1) What are the actual conditions

of  training  at  this Centre? (2)  What  are  the

courses  offered by this Centre, and  is  there  a

course for the training of cooks? At present  with

so many hotels and restaurants being set up, there

is  an  acute shortage of cooks. Many of the cooks

working  in our restaurants at present  have  come

from abroad, and we have to spend a lot of foreign

exchange on them. If we can train our local people

to  be  cooks, we can reduce the foreign  exchange

spent on importing foreign cooks. (3) What are the

qualifications  required  for  admission  to  this

Centre?  (4)  What  are the fees  charged  by  the

Centre  for each student? (5) What is the duration

of  each training course? Will it take six  months

or one year to complete a course?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Member for Sembawang has asked  various

questions about the Training Centre.  I think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



best  answer  I can give is to ask him  to  pay  a

visit to the Hotel and Catering Training Centre so

that  he  can  see for himself how the  Centre  is

being  run.  Among the courses run by the  Centre,

there is a course for the training of cooks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the qualifications required for the

admission  of students, this is largely  dependent

on the type of training course that the student is

applying  for. There are various kinds of  courses

available, each requiring a different standard  of

qualification. As regards school fees, the  amount

is dependent on the duration of the course and the

different  levels of training to be provided.  For

instance, for the training of cooks, the  duration

of  the  course is long and the fees will have  to

cost more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, how many

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 51 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sim Boon Woo)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sum of $190,000 has been provided for the

T.V. Outside Broadcasting Equipment. Under this

subhead, I would like to raise two queries to the

Minister: (1) Can the Minister give this House a

detailed information regarding this Equipment? (2)

Is there any plan for the setting up of colour T.

V, in Singapore? Many countries, including some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



South-east Asian countries, have introduced colour

T.V.  As  an  advanced country in this region,  we

should   now  give  early  consideration  to   the

provision  of colour T.V, so that our  people  can

enjoy their programmes better.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, has the

Minister  any plans to start a third T.V, channel,

especially for Tamil and Malay programmes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, we have two outside broadcast  vans,

and they are used to cover events occurring in the

various  parts of Singapore, such as National  Day

parades,   sports  activities  and,  occasionally,

variety  shows at the National Theatre.  The  vans

were purchased in 1962 at a cost of $794,000. They

are  useful for covering events live. But  because

of  the lack of crew, we have not been able to use

the vans as much as we want to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second query is about colour T.V. This is a

very complicated matter. Of course, colour T.V, is

the  logical follow-up of the black and white T.V.

that  we  now  have. The problem is:  do  we  have

enough   technicians  to   run   a   station   for

telecasting colour programmes? As it  is  now,  we

are  actually short of technicians. Therefore,  it

is  not  possible at this stage to  say  with  any

certainty  when we can introduce colour T.V.,  but

we  are  certainly travelling on that course.  The

problem  is much more complicated than  it  seems.

For instance, there are at present three different

systems  used by countries all over the world  for

colour   TV.   Firstly,  there  is  the   N.T.S.C.

-National Television System Committee -  which  is

used   by   the  United  States,  Canada,  Mexico,

Philippines,  Japan and Taiwan. The second  system

is  S.E.C.A.M. - do not ask me what it is, because

I  am  as ignorant as some Members are. All I know

is  that it is called S.E.C.A.M, and it is used by

France,  the U.S.S.R, and certain Eastern European

countries. The third system is P.A.L. It  is  used

by  most Western European countries, including the

United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom,  and it is going to be used by  Australia

and  New Zealand. The important consideration here

is to choose a system that is used by the majority

of  the  countries in the world.  If  we  were  to

choose the wrong system, then we may come up  with

many difficulties in the future, such as programme

exchanges,  spare  parts,  and  others.  For   the

moment,  it  appears  that the  P.A.L, system  is

gaining  the upper hand. So much about the systems

that we have to choose from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that if we want to run our

colour  T.V, as successfully as we want it to  be,

then  it  is only logical that as many viewers  as

possible  do enjoy our colour T.V, programmes.  At

the  present  moment,  I am  afraid  this  is  not

possible because of the high cost of a colour T.V.

set. I understand that an ordinary colour T.V, set

costs  between $1,000 and $2,000 each. Even though

we  are getting this 13th salary payment, I do not

think  colour  T.V, is within the  reach  of  many

people in Singapore. I hope that the day will come

when  these  colour T.V, sets can be  produced  in

such large numbers that their price can be brought

down  to a level where many people can enjoy  this

service. It is no use spending millions of dollars

to  provide  a service which can only satisfy  the

luxurious needs of a small section of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the problem is that it takes

a  long  time to put this service into  operation.

Take,  for example, Australia. Since 1967  it  has

committed itself to colour T.V, but up to  now  it

has  still not telecast any colour T.V, programmes

yet.  From this example, we can see that  we  have

barely  the  knowledge of how to initiate  such  a

scheme.  All  I  can say is that  at  the  present

moment  we are travelling on that course. We  have

sent  two  engineers to Germany for training,  and

another  two will be sent in the near  future  to,

possibly, the British Broadcasting Corporation  in

England. When they return, we hope to be  able  to

build up a nucleus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



of  engineers to start this service. But I am  not

able  to  say when it will be because of the  many

problems which I have outlined just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a third T.V, channel, I do not think

it  is possible to provide because we do not  have

enough  channels on our T.V, sets. If we  want  to

have a third channel for Singapore - the other two

are occupied by the Malaysian network - we have to

introduce  a different system, which  again  is  a

very  costly matter. Therefore, I do not think  it

is  possible to introduce a third channel  at  the

present moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

the Minister for his very detailed explanation  of

the  problems. I am glad to hear that his Ministry

has  sent  two engineers abroad for this  sort  of

training, and that he is paying close attention to

the development of colour T.V. In view of this,  I

believe that very soon our people will be able  to

enjoy  colour  television. Although  the  Minister

cannot  say  for certain when we can  have  colour

television, what he has said augurs well  for  our

provision of $10, but for this year a sum of  half

a  million  dollars  is being allocated  for  this

project,  that is, the Adult Education  Television

Service.  Just  now,  the Minister  of  State  for

Education  mentioned  that  the  S.E.M.S, project

would   complement  that  o  the  Adult  Education

Television Service. In this respect, I would  like

to   know  from  the  Minister  for  Culture  what

programmes and courses will be organised  by  this

Adult Education Television Service, in view of the

fact  that the setting up of the A.E.T.S, is  the

result  of  a joint venture between the  Singapore

Government  and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.  The

information  I am seeking on this topic  is  quite

similar  to  that asked by the Member for  Katong.

With  the programming of this service, I  wish  to

know  what is the medium of instruction and  which

level  of  the adult population are we  trying  to

programme this service for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, this Adult Education

Television Service is not so much a joint venture.

It   is  actually  a  joint  effort  between   the

Singapore  Government  and  the  Friedrich   Ebert

Stiftung  to  provide training in adult  education

television programmes for countries in  this  part

of  the  world. The Centre is known as the  Centre

for  Production  and Training of  Adult  Education

Television (CEPTA T.V.). CEPTA T.V, will be  sited

at  the  R.T.S, complex; iii fact, it  is  just  a

stone's  throw from the present T.V, complex.  The

cost of the building is estimated at $1 million to

be  totally borne by the Singapore Government  and

the  cost of the equipment, which is estimated  at

$6.5 million, will be borne by the Friedrich Ebert

Stiftung of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is

not  possible to say now what kind of courses will

be  conducted or what language medium will be used

for  the  training  of these programme  producers.

What I can say now is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



it  is not so much a centre for the production  of

adult  education programmes but a place  to  train

producers  so  that  they  can  return  to   their

respective countries and produce their  own  adult

education programmes. I think Singapore,  as  well

as many other countries in this part of the world,

is  in great need of such training facilities, and

it is to our great benefit to have the Centre here

in  Singapore. That is as much as I  can  disclose

for the time being.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 51 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item 001 of subhead

201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that out of a provision of $1

million  in the last financial year for Works  and

Buildings,  only $14,000 has been  spent  and  the

balance  of  $986,000 is being revoted this  year,

together  with  an  increase  in  the  allocation,

making  a  total provision of $2 million  for  the

next   financial  year.  I  would  like  to   seek

clarification from the Minister for Culture as  to

what progress has been made with regard to the new

Radio  Studios  and  Office Buildings.  With  this

additional provision I believe there must be  some

real  need for it, and I therefore hope  that  the

studios will be ready soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect I would also like the Minister to

inform this House whether the construction of  the

building  has  been completed, and  when  will  it

become operational? Moreover, with the setting  up

of  the  new  studios, will there be a  new  radio

station over the air?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the new radio station

complex costing about $2 million will be going  up

very  soon. The project will be open to tender  at

the end of this month. I was advised that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



building  works will take at least  18  months  to

complete.  Therefore,  the  installation  of   the

equipment  and other facilities will take  another

six  months.  Iii all, that will take  us  to  the

middle  of  1974. But the operation  of  this  new

complex will solve a lot of problems, one of which

is congestion in office and studio space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the query about whether a new radio

station will be launched when the radio complex is

ready,  the answer is no. We already have quite  a

few  stations  in service now. In  fact,  we  have

altogether eight different wave lengths,  four  in

the AM, and four in the F.M, service, and with one

F.M, stereo station thrown in. Since  we  already

have a lot of broadcasting outlets, the problem is

not  to  increase the number of stations,  but  to

improve  the  quality of the programmes.  That  is

what we are trying to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I thank the Minister for his

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 404.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I merely wish to ask the Minister where

will  this Katong Library he sited. The Memorandum

on  the Development Estimates says "it is proposed

to  build another branch library in the Katong/Joo

Chiat/Siglap Area." Presumably the designation  of

these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



districts  refers to constituencies. I would  like

to know what is the estimated population that will

benefit  from  this provision, and  what  sort  of

investigation  or data has led to  the  siting  of

this  library. I reserve further comments for  the

Minister's reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, if the Member for Katong

thinks  that  the  library will be  sited  in  his

constituency, I am afraid he will be disappointed.

It will not be sited in his constituency, but in a

district  which  we  have  always  called  vaguely

"Katong District". Therefore, the name "Katong" is

quite  relevant to the site for the library  which

we are going to provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site will be in the Katong Estate, Phase II

Development, on reclaimed land between  Joo  Chiat

Road  and  Still Road. The library  will  serve  a

densely populated area. It will be about two miles

away  from  the Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate,  which

the  Member for Katong has so fondly referred  to.

Therefore, his constituents will have easy  access

to this new library. I was told that a new housing

estate will he built in this area, and, therefore,

a  library there will serve much more people  than

if   it   were   sited  merely   in   the   Katong

constituency. I think we should look  at  it  this

way:   a   library  should  serve  not  just   one

constituency.   If   we  are   to   provide   each

constituency with a library, we will  run  out  of

funds in no time. The problem is how to distribute

the   services  of  a  library  so  that   several

constituencies  can  share one  library.  In  this

respect I think the proposed site should serve the

purpose.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect to

the  Minister's  view that we should  not  site  a

library  in  each constituency, I  would  like  to

point  out  that, apart from the establishment  of

this  new  library  in the new  development  area,

there is also, already, a library in the Too Chiat

constituency serving the people in that area.  Too

Chiat  constituency is in very close proximity  to

this new library. If this is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



so,  I would suggest that perhaps we could have  a

small  library in the Katong constituency too,  or

at least extend some kind of service from this new

district centre to the Katong constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point 1 would like to raise is that the

development  of this new housing estate  would  be

finer  than  that which is characteristic  of  the

Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate, The majority of people

in  the  Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate are living  in

one-room and two-room flats, and it will therefore

be   more   convenient  if  some   provision   not

necessarily such a library - were made  for  them.

This  would be better than to site a library close

to an area where the characteristic of the housing

is  large bungalows and houses that belong to  the

more affluent people. In view of what I have said,

perhaps  the  Minister will consider extending  at

least  some sort of service to the people  in  the

Tanjong  Rhu Housing Estate. If the Minister  does

not wish to answer, but wishes to consider -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I see that he wishes to answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when it

comes  to  considering where to site a library,  I

think  we should not be parochial in our approach.

In  fact, Katong constituency is now served by two

libraries,  one  in Too Chiat and one  in  Siglap.

Though  they  are both quite small libraries  they

serve  the  purpose for the time being. By  siting

this new library in the reclaimed land, we hope to

serve  a  much bigger population than just  Katong

constituency because, unlike what the  Member  for

Katong has described just now that the place  will

be  full of large bungalows and so on, it  is  not

quite true, and I understand that the Housing  and

Development  Board has plans to build  fairly  big

flats in the housing estate there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Four and five-room flats!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes. So I think the population

there will be quite large



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



in,  say, 1974, when this project will be put into

operation.  Further, by siting this  library  away

from   the   Katong  constituency,  we  have   the

advantage of not only serving Katong but also  the

rural  areas  like Changi, Siglap,  Tam-pines  and

many others. This will, in fact, benefit much more

people, including the poorer people living in  the

rural areas, than just those living in Tanjong Rhu

flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all I am saying

is that, since both Siglap and Joo Chiat have each

a  library, can the provisions of this new central

library  be  extended by way of  a  better  mobile

service  to the Tanjong Rhu area, which is  in  my

constituency? Never mind if Katong cannot get  the

same provision a the other constituencies, but  at

least  he  can afford the provision  of  a  mobile

library service. Otherwise, it is very unfair; but

as the Member for Anson would say, "What to do!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> It is not just a matter of

what  to  do.  We can do something. For  instance,

after we have set up this new branch library,  and

if  we find that the present Too Chiat Library  is

too  close  to it, we may even consider taking  it

away,  and,  if the Member for Katong can  put  up

concrete  proposals, set it up  in  his  community

centre.  I  think that may solve his problem.  But

for the time being we have to make-do with the two

libraries in Joo Chiat and Siglap.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the

Minister  will give consideration to the  proposal

that we will put forward later on. I beg leave  to

withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote of $150,000 is for rural

community  centres.  I would  like  to  take  this

opportunity to praise the People's Association for

promoting  the  various  activities  in  community

centres. I would also like to thank the management

committees  of the community centres for  devoting

their  time  and effort in promoting  many  useful

kinds of activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all we have about 190

community  centres, including those in  the  rural

areas. However, the provision of $150,000 for this

financial year is inadequate to meet the needs  of

the  rural community. Therefore, I would like  the

Minister  to ask for more money from the  Minister

for  Finance.  Although there are  nine  community

centres in my constituency, I still think they are

not  enough because the rural community is  spread

over  a  very wide area. But in town, the area  is

very  small and one or two community centres  will

serve  the  purpose.  For example,  there  are  15

community  centres in Chua Chu Kang  constituency,

which is six more than my constituency. There  are

also  15  community centres in Jurong. However,  I

still think there should be more community centres

for  Chua  Chu  Kang  and  Jurong  constituencies,

because  more and more people are shifting  in  to

these rural areas. Therefore, we should build more

community centres for the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he has

any  plans to build a rural-type community  centre

for  Sembawang  out of this vote.  There  are  two

villages  in my constituency with a population  of

about  500  families.  They  have  asked  for  the

provision of a community centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  is  rather  covetous, not  only  in  other

respects but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



also  in respect of community centres. If that  is

what  he wants, the answer is no. In fact, we  are

going  to cut down the number of community centres

in his constituency, because we feel that they are

not  being properly used. The problem is  not  how

many community centres we should have, but how are

we going to use them to the best advantage so that

they  can  provide beneficial and useful amenities

to  the people. If you have a very good and active

community centre, it is as good as having 10.  For

instance, there is only one community centre in my

constituency. I think the Member for  Tanglin  has

not  even got a standard-size community centre  in

his  constituency. In the case of Sembawang, there

are  already three standard-size community centres

and  six rural-type community centres. And we feel

that many of them have not been properly made  use

of or under-used. So we may even initiate plans to

cut  down  the  number  of  community  centres  in

Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like

to  lodge a protest against the Minister.  I  have

only  brought forward the views of the people from

my  constituency. There is a real  need  for  more

community  centres in my constituency,  because  I

have  toured my constituency and the people  there

have  made  such  requests  to  me.  Perhaps   the

Minister  has got his information from  the  wrong

sources, and I would like the Minister to  rescind

his  order  to  reduce  the  number  of  community

centres in my constituency. This is tantamount  to

a  threat on his part. If he withdraws his threat,

then  I  will withdraw my amendment. But he should

reply to some of my questions first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it

is  necessary to make a study of the activities of

the  community centres. We are going  to  initiate

plans  to  find out whether or not they have  been

properly used. And if they are not used,  I  think

it  is  only fair that we should close them  down,

because you just cannot have a centre when  nobody

wants to use it. It is true that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



people want community centres, but they want  good

and active ones. So the solution really is not  to

have  more centres but to have good organisers  in

them  so  that they can rally the interest  of  as

many  people as possible. As I have said, you  may

only  have  one community centre, but if  you  can

make  it a success, it is worth more than 10.  The

emphasis is on quality, not quantity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  thank the Minister for his reply,  but  I

would like to tell him that all the nine community

centres in my constituency are fully utilised. For

example,  during  the day, every  centre  conducts

kindergarten  classes,  and  during   the   night,

cooking and sewing classes are conducted in  these

centres.  I would like to make a request  for  yet

another   community  centre  on  a  new  site   in

Sembawang.  I hope the Minister will  consider  my

request.

Sembawang is now interested in female prisons! The

provision  of $45,000 shown under this subhead  in

the  Development  Estimates  for  1972-73  is  the

amount   necessary   to  meet   the   balance   of

expenditure for the project which has a total cost

of  about  $180,000.  To-date the  expenditure  is

$142,554.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the female prison, the emphasis, of course, is

on   rehabilitation.  There  is  a  rehabilitation

programme aimed at assisting the inmates to return

to  the  community  as  law-abiding  and  socially

useful   persons.  This  programme  includes   the

following:    training   in    self-control    and

discipline;  vocational training and  work;  moral

training    and   the   cultivation   of    social

consciousness;  group work and female  counselling

work.  They are also given opportunities to  learn

skills,  to  improve  their  work  habit  and   to

participate in work for which they are paid a fair

wage, ranging from $1 to $10 per week according to

their  skills  and  industry. For  those  who  are

involved   in  productive  work,  like  tailoring,

laundering or the manufacturing of stuffed  dolls,

an  industrial bonus at piece-rate is payable,  in

addition  to the normal prison earnings. They  are

not  eligible for any prison earning for the first

month.   However,  thereafter  they   are   graded

according  to their performance and  are  paid  as

follows:  (a)  eight cents per day  and  15  cents

bonus  for  each completed week; (b) 10 cents  per

day  and  20 cents bonus for each completed  week;

(c)  15 cents per day and 30 cents bonus for  each

completed week; (d) 20 cents per day and 40  cents

bonus  for each completed week; and (e)  25  cents

per  day  and  60  cents bonus for each  completed

week.  On an average, Sir, a female prisoner  gets

approximately  $5  a  week  as  industrial  bonus.

Higher earners can get as much as $10 per week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a showroom at Changi Prison where the

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote is intended for the building of a

fire station in Jurong. Sir, in last year's Budget

Estimates,  there was a provision of $242,100  for

the  building of a fire station in Jurong.  Jurong

urgently  needs a fire station. I spoke at  length

on  this  matter  last year, and in  reply  to  my

question  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the

Minister  for Social Affairs said that  this  fire

station  would be built sometime in 1971 or  1972.

The  Minister  can  refer to Hansard,  dated  25th

March,  1971,  at col. 1337. However, construction

of this fire station has not yet commenced. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



we  are  now coming back to this House to  approve

the same vote. I would like to know why there is a

delay in building this fire station at Jurong. Can

the  Minister say definitely when will work  begin

on this fire station?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret

that, although the project for the fire station at

Jurong  was approved in this House this time  last

year, work on the building of the fire station has

not  yet  started. The Jurong Fire Station project

is   now  being  evaluated  by  officials  in  the

Ministry  of Finance. When the project papers  are

finalised,  they  will be put to  the  Development

Planning Committee for consideration. It  is  not,

therefore,  possible for me to inform  the  Member

for  Jurong  as to when the fire station  will  be

built,  because formal approval has not  yet  been

granted by the Development Planning Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the reason for the delay, this can only be

attributed to the need for costing. This was  only

completed in January 1972. We were advised by  the

Senior  Architect  of the Public Works  Department

that  the cost of building the fire station  would

amount to $750,000 approximately. The Member  will

appreciate  that  development  projects  from  the

various  Ministries are submitted to the  Ministry

of  Finance and the Economic Development  Division

who will then process these projects in accordance

with  their  priorities. The Jurong  Fire  Station

project  is now receiving the urgent attention  of

the officials of that Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to build a fire station was first

mooted  in  June 1966 for inclusion  in  the  1967

Development    Estimates.   This   proposal    was

considered   and   approved  by  the   Development

Planning Sub-Committee which had recommended a sum

of  money  towards the project. The  approval  was

conveyed  to us on 21st August, 1968. However,  on

14th  November, 1968, my Ministry was advised that

the  Minister  for  Finance  had  decided  not  to

proceed with the Jurong Fire Station project  and,

as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



a  result,  the Fire Brigade head of  expenditure

was  deleted from the 1969 Development Estimates.

The  Minister for Finance was then  of  the  view

that   the   Jurong  industrial  town  would   be

adequately  served  by the  Alexandra  and  Bukit

Timah Fire Stations. My Ministry subsequently re-submitted the proposal for a Jurong Fire Station,

and  it  was  included in the 1971-72 Development

Estimates. Negotiations have been concluded  with

the  Jurong Town Corporation for a suitable  site

for  the  fire  station, and cost estimates  have

been  submitted to the Ministry of Finance.  Sir,

as  the  situation stands now, it is  anticipated

that  construction work cannot begin before  June

or July this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like the Minister to take personal note

of this matter and to expedite the building of

as possible. I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the increase in provision for the

development  of parks in both the MacRitchie  and

Seletar Reservoirs. In view of the fact that more

and more people now live in high-rise flats, more

open  spaces and parks will be required by  these

teeming  flat  dwellers for their relaxation  and

recreational  activities  during  week-ends   and

public holidays. In this respect I would like  to

know what recreational amenities will be provided

in  the  parks. May I suggest that more pavilions

be  built in these parks and more grounds be made

available  for children to romp around,  as  they

are  generally brought there by parents to  play.

There should also be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



some food stalls, although the Memorandum on  the

Development    Estimates   states    that    some

refreshment kiosks will be set up there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know what has happened

to  the proposal to set up a miniature zoo at the

Seletar   Reservoir   by  a  Government-sponsored

organisation. What progress has been made in this

respect,  and  when will this zoo  be  ready  for

public view?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public

Utilities  Board has already initiated  plans  to

at MacRitchie and Seletar Reservoirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $170,000 for development at

MacRitchie  Reservoir will be  utilised  for  the

construction  of an additional car park  and  the

development of a landscape area along Lornie Road

to  provide additional amenities, such  as  large

lawns  which would be suitable for family picnics

and a play area for children. Simple shelters and

benches will also be provided, and planting  will

be  incorporated in this area. Although there  is

already  a tea kiosk at the MacRitchie Reservoir,

which    provides   refreshments   to   visitors,

additional food stalls have also been constructed

recently in the vicinity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of more than $181,000 for

development at Seletar will be utilised  for  the

construction of a bandstand, fountains, ice-cream

and  refreshment kiosks, benches,  an  additional

car  park  and  toilets, augmenting the  existing

children's playground, rock garden, marsh garden,

shelters and landscaping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zoo at Seletar is being looked after by the

Singapore  Zoological Gardens, a Government-owned

public  limited  company incorporated  under  the

Companies Act. This zoo is expected to be  opened

to  the public either at the end of this year or,

at  the  latest, in early 1973. A  sum  of  about

$600,000 has already been spent by the Company in

respect  of  salaries for staff and  landscaping,

buildings and staff quarters,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



and   the  building  of  animal  enclosures,   and

$3,300,000  has been committed to  provide  a  car

park  and  access  road to the  zoo  entrance  and

construction of enclosures, administration  block,

and other buildings.

201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of lorry parks by the

Ministry  of  National  Development  is  indeed  a

welcome move. Many lorries and trailers are parked

along roadsides,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



causing   unnecessary  traffic  hazards.  I   would

suggest  that legislation be introduced  to  compel

these  drivers to park their lorries  and  trailers

and  heavy-duty lorries in parking bays  designated

for  them.  I  would also like to ask the  Minister

what  is  the  capacity of the lorry park  that  is

proposed to be built at Lorong Kebun Limau?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Car Parks Division has

proposals  for  the development  of  a  centralised

lorry  park  initially  at Lorong  1,  Geylang,  to

accommodate the lorries at present parked in season

car  parking  places in the City  centre.  If  this

lorry  park  is  inadequate,  the  development   of

another  lorry park at Lorong Kebun Limau  will  be

considered  later.  The  Singapore  Lorry   Owners'

Association  feels that as there are 4,000  lorries

in  Singapore, the proposed parking sites  will  be

insufficient, and they have asked for more sites at

Newton, Redhill and Pasir Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for legislation, although it is proposed to

amend  the  Motor Vehicles (Parking Places)  Rules,

1959,  in  due  course to prohibit the  parking  of

heavy  lorries (especially lorries with cranes)  in

any  parking place in the City area throughout  the

day  and  night, it is not the intention to prevent

lorries  from  parking  in other  places,  such  as

private  compounds, garages, Housing Board estates,

or  even  the Jurong Town Corporation's  industrial

estates.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 205.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

seek  clarification from the Minister for  Law  and

National Development. Although the purpose of  this

pro-vision  is  to resite the motor  repair  shops,

which  are now scattered in the City area and along

trunk roads, may I know whether the intention is to

centralise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



the  motor  repair workshops located in this  area?

Furthermore,  will  those  workshops,   which   are

unaffected by public projects, be allowed to  apply

for  sites  in  the centralised motor  repair  shop

area, when completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, a census taken last year revealed

that there are about 70 workshops, engaged in motor

repairing,  located at Bukit Timah Road,  Sembawang

Road, Jalan Pandu and Jalan Pasar. Their operations

have contributed quite a great deal to the problems

of  noise, air and water pollution. They have  also

contributed  to traffic obstruction  and,  in  some

cases,   have   even  caused  accidents.   It   is,

therefore,  proposed  to  resite  some   of   these

workshops  on  a  four-acre  site  off   the   12th

milestone Woodlands Road. After the acquisition  of

land and resettlement, the actual construction work

will take about one and a half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board is also developing a

centralised  motor workshop complex at the  Thomson

Road   industrial  estate  for   the   purpose   of

resettling  motor  workshops  affected  by   public

schemes.  Initially, these two centralised workshop

areas  will  be allocated to clearance cases  only.

But  it  is  hoped  eventually to resite  all  such

shops,  which now operate along main roads  and  in

the  Central  area,  to several  centralised  motor

repair shops away from the City.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the

Minister   say  whether  the  motor  repair   shops

Sin Ming Road?

this must be so. Perhaps the Minister will bear  me

out on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the very detailed reply given by

the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 72 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 304.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment concerns reclamation work,

Phase  IV,  taking place from Bedok to Tanah  Merah

Besar. I would like to request the Minister to bear

in   mind  the  following  factors.  Most  of   the

residents living in Bedok, Padang Terbakar, Kampong

Ayer  Gemuroh  and Tanah Merah Besar are  fishermen

and  farmers. Consideration should be given to  see

that  no  hardship or inconvenience  is  caused  to

these  farmers, fishermen, or the residents due  to

reclamation  works. If any land is to be  acquired,

the affected families should be fairly compensated.

Of  course, the purpose of reclamation work  is  to

add  some more land to our Republic, but if  it  is

carried  out without sufficient foresight  and  due

attention  to the existing conditions of the  area,

this may cause untold hardship to the residents  in

that area. There are many small canals in this area

earmarked for the reclamation project. These canals

serve as outlets to the sea for the fishermen. When

these canals are filled up, the fishermen will  not

be  able  to push their sampans out to the sea  nor

will  they be able to berth their fishing boats  or

sampans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is, the area between Bedok and Telok

Mata  Ikan is low-lying and often gets flooded when

heavy  rain  falls or when the tide  is  high.  The

filling  up  of  these canals will,  therefore,  be

another  cause for floods in this area. I am  told,

Sir, that floods bring untold damage and misery  to

the  residents in the affected area as a whole.  It

is   hoped   that  the  Minister  will  give   full

consideration to these problems before  the  actual

reclamation work commences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, Phase IV of the reclamation

scheme  from Bedok to Tanah Merah will  cause  some

inconvenience to the people living along that  part

of  the  coast. With reclamation, inconvenience  is

unavoidable. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



every  effort  will  be made  by  the  Housing  and

Development Board to minimise the inconvenience and

to  prevent any hardships to those affected. In its

experience in reclaiming land from Bedok to Tanjong

Rhu,  the  Board has learned from its few mistakes,

and  I  am sure they will be more careful with  the

second stretch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be pleased to learn that there is

no  proposal  to acquire the land along  the  coast

above  the  high-water mark. This reclamation  will

only be confined to the coastal foreshore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the danger of flooding, the major canals

serving the area, namely, Bedok canal, Sungei  Mata

Ikan  and  Sungei  Ayer Gemuroh, will  be  extended

across the reclaimed land into the sea so that  the

existing  stretch in the area will not be affected.

During the progress of reclamation, the Board  will

also  construct more drains to facilitate the  flow

of rain-water from the foreshore to the sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fishermen living along the coast, they

will  be able to retain the use of these canals  as

an  access for their boats. From our experience  in

reclaiming  the  coast along the Siglap  area,  the

fishermen are, in fact, now using the new foreshore

for pitching their boats. All they have to do is to

walk  the additional distance of the reclaimed land

in  order to get to the sea. This takes about  five

minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Member himself to let my

Ministry  know  if  there  is  any  part   of   the

reclamation  work which leads to the  inconvenience

of  the  residents  there  or  if  any  canals  are

blocked, thus causing floods.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the assurance given

by  the  Minister that the Board will minimise  any

inconvenience or hardship, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 104.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few days ago we have been debating on the

fact  that the prices of agricultural produce have

dropped  to  a very low level recently.  Even  the

price of pigs has been going down sharply, causing

heavy  losses  to  the  farmers.  According  to  a

general investigation, one of the reasons is  that

the  Central  Abattoir  in Jurong  has  adopted  a

working system of one rest day every week. Because

of  this,  the usual number of pigs sent  on  that

particular  day was not slaughtered. According  to

calculations that number will total  up  to  5,000

pigs  per month owing to rest days. I believe  the

Minister  is as concerned as Members on this  side

about  the interest and welfare of the farmers.  I

appeal to him to reconsider the matter of allowing

the  Central  Abattoir to close for one  rest  day

every  week.  This should stop, and  the  Abattoir

should be opened throughout the whole week.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I rise to support the motion moved by the

Member for Jurong. The request he has made is also

the request and the fervent hope of the people  in

Jalan  Kayu. To my mind, the 7-day working  system

as adopted by the Central Abattoir until now was a

very   practical   one,   even   in   respect   of

administration. The question of a rest day can  be

easily solved in other ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem also relates to the question of

rural abattoirs. I remember two years ago in this

House I made a request for the setting up of rural

abattoirs in the rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



Two years have elapsed, and I still cannot find

its inclusion in the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the weekly rest day on Mondays

for  butchers  slaughtering pigs  at  the  Central

Abattoir  in  Jurong and the French Road  Abattoir

was  introduced  last  year after  representations

were  made to the Government by the Singapore Pork

Merchants  Association. But if all concerned  feel

that  the  rest day is not necessary, the existing

arrangements can be reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the price of pigs, I believe it is

influenced  by more important market factors  than

just  having another working day for the butchers.

As an indication of this, the total number of pigs

slaughtered  in both abattoirs has maintained  its

steady normal increase since the implementation of

the  rest day. My Ministry itself would prefer  to

have  a 7-day week, but we cannot force people  to

work  for seven days. A 7-day week means  you  get

good fresh pork for seven days of the week. It  is

not  a  question  of the farmers  as  against  the

butchers. But somehow the question of farmers  and

butchers went on to the abattoir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for rural abattoirs, recent studies have shown

that   there  is  no  immediate  need  for   rural

abattoirs.  But it is not a lost hope  or  a  lost

cause.  It  is still very much in the mind  of  my

Ministry,  .but there are no immediate  plans  for

their implementation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

fact  that  the  Minister has said  that  he  will

review  the matter of getting the Central Abattoir

to  carry on business for seven days a week, I beg

leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote is for Intensive Farm Improvement

Schemes. I have noticed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



that this year's vote is a mere sum of $6,100. As

compared  with the provision for last year,  this

is  a  huge reduction. I do not know whether  the

programme has been well implemented and  achieved

success,  or whether there is no need to  further

this scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I merely

want to raise one question under this subhead.  I

feel  that the vote of $6,100 for this  year  for

Intensive Farm Improvement Schemes is too meagre.

I  want  to know how the money is to be spent  in

this regard.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Intensive Farm Improvement

Scheme has been, in fact, in progress since  1968

and  is  now coming to its end-phase. Hence,  the

diminishing financial provision for it.  But  the

two  Members  need  not be  concerned.  When  the

project was first approved, there was a provision

of  about  $220,000 for capital expenditure.  The

bulk  of  this  provision has been  utilised  for

land,  buildings,  furniture and  equipment.  The

balance  which  has been revoted this  year,  and

about  which  the Member for Sembawang  enquires,

will be used for the purpose of a few more pieces

of equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researches, which have been initiated, have been

made towards improving the yield of our crops  by

the  selection  of  good parent  plants,  through

better  fertilising practices, and through better

control   of   pests  and  diseases.   In   fact,

experiments  have  been  carried   out   at   the

Sembawang  Field  Station and  the  demonstration

farm  at  Lim  Chu  Kang. The  results  of  these

experiments are passed on and made known  to  the

farmers through the extension service or training

courses  organised by the Department  of  Primary

Production.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  thank  the Minister for his detailed reply.  I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a period of three years has passed since

the  Central  Fish  Market opened  for  business.

During   this   time,  the  fish  merchants   and

fishmongers  have been co-operating  and  working

together under the give-and-take spirit, which is

in  the  interests of the consumers and  for  the

progress and development of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that when the idea of the

Central Fish Market was fish mooted, it met  with

considerable  opposition from the fish  merchants

and      fishmongers.     Subsequently,     after

consultations and discussions between the parties

concerned,  some  agreement was reached  and  the

fish merchants agreed to move over to the Central

Fish  Market.  According  to  officials  of   the

Singapore Fish Merchants Federation, one  of  the

terms of agreement was that the temporary offices

in  the  fish  market would be  rebuilt  after  a

period of two years. Sir, these temporary offices

are  made  of  planks  and each  office  measures

roughly  15  feet x 10 feet x 10 feet.  They  are

very  small and the height is low, and under  the

scorching sun they are as hot as oven. Apart from

space  for desks and cupboards, there is no  room

left to put even a canvas bed for the workers  to

rest.  I understand that some of the plank  walls

of  these  offices have already been attacked  by

termites.  Sir,  the question of  rebuilding  the

temporary  offices has always been troubling  the

fish  merchants  there. They have  referred  this

matter   to  the  Primary  Production  Department

several   times   but  have  not   received   any

satisfactory answer. I understand, Sir, that  the

Primary Production Department is now thinking  of

extending  the  auction  market  itself.  Between

extending  the auction market and rebuilding  the

temporary  offices, I think the  latter  is  more

urgent.   The  Minister  concerned  should   give

priority to this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next matter I wish to deal with is the

management and administration of the market. I have

received several complaints that the management and

administration of the market is very poor.  Sir,  I

took  up the matter of security of the market  with

the  Minister  for Home Affairs yesterday  in  this

House.  This  is related to the management  of  the

market.  I  feel  that  the  passes  required   for

entering the market should not be issued at random.

Furthermore,  there should be stricter check-points

at the entrance to ensure that bad elements are not

allowed in. I also understand that there is no full-time  staff  to  take charge of administrative  and

management matters in the fish market. The  Primary

Production Department sends a man there  about  two

or  three times a week to look things over, and  on

each occasion the officer will stay there for about

one or two hours. After that, he will have to go to

Changi  to attend to other matters. I cannot  blame

him  for  that.  But whenever this officer  is  not

present at the market, the fish merchants will have

nobody  to  turn  to  for  help.  So  under   these

circumstances  it  is  difficult  to   expect   the

management  of the fish market to be  efficient.  I

hope  the  Minister will ensure  that  the  Primary

Production Department will send a full-time man  to

take charge of the market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there are altogether six

supervisory  officers and 12 subordinate  staff  on

duty  at  the  fish auction market.  Each  morning,

during  the auctioning period, their duties are  to

see   that  the  fish  merchants,  auctioneers  and

retailers,  conduct their business  in  an  orderly

manner  and  that  the facilities  of  the  auction

market  are  properly made use of.  These  officers

also   patrol  the  market  and  its  surroundings.

Supervision-wise, there have, in fact, been  a  few

instances  where the fish merchants have complained

to the Department that these officers have been too

strict  in the enforcement of rules and regulations

at the auction market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gates to the fishing port are manned by

two  security  guards per shift. These  guards  are

retired police officers, whose duties are to  check

on persons entering the fishing port area. However,

as the number of people entering the gates is about

3,000  per  night  in  about 500  vehicles,  it  is

practically   impossible  to  check  every   person

entering  the  market as this would  cause  a  long

queue and much inconvenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the site of the buildings, may I say at

the  outset that when this idea of transferring the

fishermen or the fish merchants from Ellen  borough

Market and Clyde Terrace Market to Jurong was first

thought of, there was, as the Member for Jurong has

pointed  Out, considerable opposition.  There  were

protests   to  the  M.P.s  concerned.  There   were

protests  also  to  more senior and  more  powerful

Ministers.  But finally we managed to get  them  to

shift. Within two months, they threw a tea party to

which  I  was  invited, which means  that  we  were

correct in getting them there. But to recapitulate,

as   for  the  buildings,  the  Primary  Production

Department  has erected three blocks  of  temporary

timber offices for the use of these fish merchants.

The  Department  did  not undertake  to  construct

permanent offices for the fish merchants. In  fact,

the  Department  is of the view  that  the  private

sector  should  erect their own  facilities.  So  a

number  of  commercial  companies  engaged  in  the

catching  and  auctioning of fish have  constructed

their  own  offices  as  well  as  fish  processing

installations. The Department itself is prepared to

recommend  to  the  Jurong Town Corporation,  which

owns the land at the fishing port, to lease land to

fish  merchants  who  wish to construct  their  own

permanent offices, or to lease a piece of  land  to

the   Fish  Merchants  Association  for   them   to

construct offices for their members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand that not all the fish merchants are rich

people.  But some may be rich. Those who  are  rich

want to invest their money in deep-sea fishing  and

other  business  ventures.  So  they  do  not  have

adequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



cash to build their own permanent offices. In this

respect, can the Minister suggest to the J.T.C, to

build offices and rent them out to the merchants'?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I will certainly make that

recommendation. However, what I am more  concerned

with is not the fish merchants or vendors of fish,

who  have already been given space in the  market,

but for others who are even poorer and who have no

space within that market and have to rent a little

space from those who have places in the market.  I

understand that they are being held practically to

blackmail,  and it is my duty first to help  these

fish   merchants  or  fishmongers  without  proper

accommodation,  rather  than  to  build  permanent

buildings  for those who have already  been  given

accommodation and who are, in fact, making quite a

bit  of  money  by subletting little  portions  of

space for the use of smaller fishmongers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am glad to hear that the Minister knows what is

going  on  in the market. This is praiseworthy.  I

must  show my appreciation for his concern in this

respect. Sir, in view of the Minister's promise to

make  a  recommendation to  the  J.T.C, to  build

offices and to let them out to the fish merchants,

I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 307.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 307 deals with the development of

Kangkar Fishing Base, which is in my constituency.

This  fishing  base  has  been  in  existence  for

several  decades. It has developed  from  a  small

fishing  village into a thriving fishing  base  in

that   part   of  Singapore.  Sir,  although   its

contribution to our economy may be small in  terms

of  percentage, but in terms of dollars and  cents

its  contribution  is about $7 million  per  annum

since 1969. The small fishing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



fleet  has  also grown to over 100 fishing  boats.

Last  year  in  this  House,  I  brought  up   the

difficulties encountered by those involved in  the

fishing industry at Kangkar. For example, with the

increase in the number of fishing boats, there was

lack of proper facilities for unloading catches of

fish,   and  owing  to  the  narrowness  of   that

particular  end of the Serangoon River  there  was

congestion  and  overcrowding of boats  trying  to

find anchorage facilities.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing jetty at Kangkar is far too small

and   narrow.  Therefore,  as  1  have   mentioned

earlier, I made an appeal to the Minister for  Law

and  National Development in this House  that  his

Ministry  should  look into this  matter  together

with some other matters which I raised. Today I am

happy  to  note  that  there  is  a  provision  of

$100,000 in the 1972-73 Development Estimates  for

the development of Kangkar fishing base. According

to  the  Memorandum, the development will  provide

landing  and  other facilities for  the  fishermen

operating at Kangkar. I would like to know whether

the  Primary Production Department has  any  other

plans  to  develop this fishing base, in  view  of

this year's provision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the last Budget

session  the  Member for Punggol inquired  whether

there  were  plans  to develop  the  Kangkar  fish

market and what action was being taken. It was  as

a  result  of his representation that my  Ministry

took  this matter up with the Ministry of Finance.

As  a  result, the Ministry of Finance  agreed  to

provide $100,000 for the project, which will be in

two  parts.  First, there will be an extension  to

the existing jetty. The proposed extension is an L-shaped  jetty to be added to the existing one,  so

that  the facilities for boats and fishermen  will

be  extended. Secondly, there will be a  new  fish

market near the jetty comprising an open shed  120

feet  x  60 feet occupying an area of about  7,200

square feet. This is about double the area of  the

existing market,

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Sembawang

Research  Station occupies an area  of  about  40

occupied  since its establishment in  1959.  Over

the   years   the  programme  for  research   and

experimental work has increased to such an extent

that much of the land apportioned for use by  the

various  sections  of the Station  has  now  been

fully  utilised.  In  order to  meet  the  future

demand  for  more  land,  as  more  research  and

experimental projects are undertaken, the Primary

Production  Department has acquired 50  acres  of

the adjoining rubber estate. The land acquired is

located   immediately  south  of   the   existing

station.  Action is now in hand  to  prepare  and

develop this additional land to meet the needs of

some of the new projects to be carried out by the

Research Station. In fact, the extra land will be

used    for    experiments   and   research    on

horticulture,    livestock    production,     and

freshwater fish culture. Research on horticulture

will  include  plant breeding, pest  and  disease

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $4 million under this subhead

is  for the development and improvement of  parks

and  open  spaces. In recent years the Government

has  launched intensive programmes to build  more

parks  and  to beautify our open spaces  so  that

more recreational facilities will be provided for

our  people.  These programmes are  praiseworthy.

For this year, Sir, a provision of $4 million  is

allocated for the development of parks  and  open

spaces.  I am sure this development plan will  be

warmly appreciated by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to ask the Minister one

question.  Is there any plan to build  a  seaside

park  in  Sembawang? There should be  a  plan  to

provide  recreational facilities for  the  people

living  in Sembawang. Moreover, the seaside  park

can   become  one  of  the  tourist  resorts   in

Singapore. We will be killing two birds with  one

stone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the development of

parks is currently under planning and design.  It

is  expected to be implemented this year, but  it

will  not  be  completed this year.  The  project

includes  the  East Coast Park on  the  reclaimed

land between Bedok and

Pearl's Hill Park, Labrador Hill, Mount

Faber Park extension, and a park in

Sembawang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is a lucky man today.

He  has his Sembawang Research Station extended.

He is now going to have a park with an area of 35

acres  at  the 15th m.s. Sembawang Road, opposite

the  Sembawang School, and extending right to the

sea. The Member for Sembawang will have a seaside

park  where  not  only his constituents  but  he

himself can rest after a hard day's work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the Minister deeply

for  this plan. Of course, this park is  not  for

the  use of people of Sembawang alone. It is also

meant  to  be  a tourist resort. I beg  leave  to

withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg

to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 75

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 102.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the exception of Lengkong Tiga.

Kampong  Pachitan area and in Kampong Eunos,  all

roads  in the eastern sector of Jalan Eunos  have

been  made  up  under section  19  of  the  Local

Government  Integration Act. The  conditions  of

these  roads  are  similar to  any  other  public

roads.  I  believe the Minister can  imagine  the

speed with which traffic moves along these roads.

When  motorists  reach  the  junctions  of  these

roads, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



are  in  a hurry to cross the road. They  do  not

know who should give way. This is because of  the

lack  of  traffic signs at these road  junctions.

The  only exception is the road junction at Jalan

Senang and Jalan Lapang. The traffic sign was put

up only a few weeks ago. In fact, I have appealed

to  the  Traffic Police to provide  more  traffic

signs, but the answer I have received is that the

provision allocated for this purpose has already

been spent. Therefore, with this new provision of

$100,000 for the financial year 1972-73, can  the

Minister  give  an assurance that  traffic  signs

will be installed at all these road junctions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Kampong

Kembangan  Citizens Consultative  Committee  did

make  a request for the erection of 12 STOP signs

at  road  junctions in that area.  Two  of  these

signs  have since been erected. There was a  lack

of  funds in the last financial year, but we  are

getting more money this year. Like the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan, I myself feel that more  STOP

signs  should  be  erected at road  junctions  in

order to prevent nasty accidents. I would suggest

that  he press on with his representation, and  I

myself will see what I can do at my end.

<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Sir,   last  year  an  amount  of  $500,000   was

allocated for the extension of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



Pan-Island.  I  want  know  why  another  sum  of

$300,000 has been provided for 1972-73, which  is

more  than  half of the amount provided  for  the

last  financial  year, when only little  work  is

left  to  be  done. Can the Minister explain  the

plans  that  require this provision of  $300,000

for 1972-73?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for the extension of Sims Avenue

(from  Paya Lebar Road to Changi Road), a sum  of

$600,000  was  provided for  the  last  financial

year. The construction work from Paya Lebar  Road

up  to  Jalan Eunos has been completed, and  the

road  is now being used. What is left to be  done

is  the extension work from Jalan Eunos to Changi

Road.  Sir, from the point where work on the  new

road  ends  up  to  the frontage  of  the  Muslim

Women's  Welfare  Home at Jalan Eunos  to  Changi

Road  is  only  a  quarter of  a  mile.  Can  the

Minister explain why such a big vote of $300,00()

for  this  year, which is more than half  of  the

provision for the last financial year,  has  been

provided for this extension work?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, funds provided under

item  010 of subhead 201 are for the construction

of that section of the Pan-Island Expressway from

Paya  Lebar  Road to Jalan Eunos.  Work  on  this

project  was delayed by the presence of squatters

along the proposed alignment of the road. But to-date  most of the squatters have been moved,  and

about  90  per cent of the project has been completed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $300,000 has been provided for 1972-73 merely to complete the

project.  There is the cost of compensation  for

resettling the remaining

squatters,  and the payment of some  bills  which

have not yet been paid for work already done.  It

is  not  unusual that every year bills  for  work

done   could  not  meet  the  deadline  for  that

financial  year, and have to be met  out  of  the

funds for the following financial year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter raised by the Member concerns

the extension of Sims Avenue from Paya Lebar Road

to  Jalan Eunos to form part of a one-way system,

comprising Geylang Road and Sims Avenue, in order

to  ease  the  heavy traffic along Geylang  Road.

This  extension was completed in 1971.  I  think

the   Member   will  agree  that  it   has   done

considerably  to brighten life in that  area.  It

has also eased the traffic problems and, all  in

all, it has been a tremendous success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This additional sum of $300,000 provided for the next financial

year is to complete this one-way system. We will

be widening that stretch of Sims Avenue from Paya Lebar

Road  to Lorong 3, Geylang Road, away from Changi

Road.  And  we will also construct  a  link  road

between  Sims Avenue and Kallang Road. Hence  the

provision  of  5300,000.  The  Member   will   be

interested to know that this one-way system  will

ultimately he extended beyond Jalan Eunos towards

Changi Road.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, just now the Minister stated that the vote

is  for the payment of bills which have not  been

paid. Does this provision include the payment  of

compensation  to  the squatters  who  have  been

affected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, part of it.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, can the Minister explain what are the plans

for the extension of Sims Avenue to Changi Road?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to describe the

extension in words. It is best shown by way of  a

plan  which I do not have with me now, hut  I  am

prepared to show it to him. Roughly extension, or

a  continuation  of the present  extension,  from

Sims  Avenue towards Jalan Eunos, it would  carry

on  parallel to Changi Road, and meet Changi Road

somewhere near Kampong Chai Chee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Sims Avenue is parallel to

(ieylang  Road. Part of it has been  widened.  We

will  be  widening that part of Sims Avenue  from

Paya Lebar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



Road  to  Lorong 3; call it Phase II if you  like.

Phase  III  will  again  be  an  extension  or   a

continuation  of  that road,  i.e.,  Sims  Avenue,

towards  Changi, and running parallel to  the  big

road,  Geylang Road, which at present is a  double

carriageway running past the old Garrick  Theatre.

That  is the best that I can explain in words!  If

the  Member  is interested in knowing  what  lands

will be affected by this extension, I suggest that

he sees the plan for himself.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I thank

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Cheong Yuen Chee -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 75 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 201.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 306*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs J. F. Conceicao and Sim Boon Woo.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a provision for pedestrian overhead

bridges  and underpasses. I wish to find out  from

the  Minister whether there are plans to  build  a

pedestrian overhead bridge or an underpass  across

Mountbatten   Road  at  a  point  somewhere   near

Guillemard Road. 1 consider it necessary.  Let  me

give the reasons. When games are held in future at

the Sports Complex in Kallang Park, there will be,

as  can be expected, a heavy volume of traffic  as

well  as a big crowd of pedestrians going  to  and

returning  from  the  games.  A  specially  strong

pedestrian  overhead bridge, or preferably  a  big

underpass,  would  draw the crowd  of  pedestrians

away  from the road, leaving it entirely free  for

the  use  of vehicles. Otherwise pedestrians  will

find  it  difficult  to  cross  Mount-batten  Road

before and after the games.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bulk of the population of my

constituency  live  in  the  Old  Kallang  Airport

Estate,  which  is  directly opposite  the  Sports

Complex  and  separated by  Mountbatten  Road.  An

overhead  bridge  or underpass across  Mountbatten

Road   will   be  convenient  for   some   of   my

constituents, who are sports enthusiasts, to  walk

across  to  the  Sports Complex instead  of  going

there  by car or bus, which may add to the traffic

congestion  that is expected there. In fact,  most

of  the people who do not own cars will benefit if

there  is  a  pedestrian  overhead  bridge  or  an

underpass  for them to go across Mountbatten  Road

to the Sports Complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to hear the Minister's views.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

take  this  opportunity to bring to the Minister's

notice a certain oversight in the building  of  an

overhead  bridge in my constituency,  which  I  am

sure  is not characteristic other overhead bridges

-  I  hope  not anyway. The overhead bridge  I  am

talking   about   is  the  one   standing   across

Mountbatten  Road from the vicinity of  the  Jalan

Batu  housing complex on one side to the  vicinity

of  Tun Sen Lanang School on the other. The  steps

leading  up to the bridge on the Jalan  Batu  side

are  very well constructed, and there seems to  he

logic in the construction of two stairways down to

the  pavement. But on the other side of the bridge

at  Tun  Sen  Lanang  School, there  is  only  one

stairway  down leading to within one  and  a  half

feet  of  the  road. One would  imagine  that  the

stairway of an overhead bridge should open out  on

to  the  pavement  away from  the  road,  and  not

immediately on to the road. The whole  purpose  of

the  pedestrian bridge is to get pedestrians  away

from the road. But this bridge seems to be leading

pedestrians back on to the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had occasion to talk this matter over with one

of  the  Minister's officials, and as a  result  a

railing has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



placed to protect the pedestrians, should  a  bus

or   a  vehicle  come  too  close  to  where  the

pedestrian  bridge ends up on  the  road.  But  I

would imagine that if such a thing should happen,

this   railing  will  not  be  very  much  of   a

protection  to  pedestrians.  I  would  urge  the

Minister to ask his officials to consider working

out  a  safer way for my constituents to go  from

one side of Mount-batten Road to the other.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, action has already

been  taken  in  the  light  of  the  Member  for

Katong's representation to widen the footpath  in

front  of  the  steps of the overhead  bridge  in

question, and to make a slight realignment of the

roadside kerbs. As the Member has pointed out,  a

30-foot long railing has also been erected  as  a

further  safeguard. If the Member  is  still  not

satisfied,  we will proceed further to  meet  his

complaint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Mountbatten,

investigations carried out have shown  that  very

few  pedestrians cross that portion of  the  road

referred  to by the Member. Besides traffic  flow

along  Mountbatten Road is regulated  by  traffic

light  controls  at  Guillemard  Circus  and  the

junction  of the Old Airport Road and Mountbatten

Road,  thereby facilitating pedestrians  crossing

the   road.  A  pedestrian  overhead  bridge  is,

therefore,   not  necessary  at  this   juncture.

However,  on completion of the National  Stadium,

which  is what the Member is looking forward  to,

the Public Works Department will certainly review

the situation and build an overhead bridge, if it

is considered necessary. In my view, without even

looking into the future, I am sure the Member  is

right  in saying that an overhead bridge will  be

needed   when  the  Stadium  is  completed.   The

provision  of an underpass is, I am  afraid,  not

feasible as the location in question is  just  by

the side of a big canal.

310.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

draw  the attention of the Minister for  Law  and

National  Development to some of the bus shelters

from  Upper  Serangoon Road, 64 m.s., to  Punggol

Point.  I  notice that some of these bus shelters

are  not  only  small but also are without  stone

benches, especially those shelters along  Punggol

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I also had occasion to make some

requests  for  more  bus shelters  along  Punggol

Road,  where there was a need for them.  In  this

respect, I would urge the Minister to consider my

suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I would like to take

this   opportunity  to  ask  the   Minister   two

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, last year I made some requests for bus

shelters  to  be erected in Toa Payoh.  This  has

been  done,  but  apparently  most  of  the   bus

shelters are second-hand and they appear to  have

been  taken  from other areas and dumped  in  Toa

Payoh.  Surely a new town like Toa Payoh deserves

something  more  attractive than second-hand  bus

shelters!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of bus bays. I believe

that  when bus bays are constructed, arrangements

should  be made with the relevant authorities  to

site  the bus stands near the bus bays. There  is

one bus bay in Toa Payoh which has not been used.

The  bus  bay is constructed but the bus stop  is

far  away from this bus bay, and one long trailer

has monopolised it as its parking lot for several

months.  I would like to seek clarification  from

the Minister on this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in the outlying rural areas

like  Punggol, where bus commuters are fewer than

in  the  urban area, standard rural bus  shelters

with  a  floor area of about 60 square  feet  are

considered  adequate. Seats are not provided  for

the shelter as they take up too much standing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



room.  But  where  the needs  are  justified,

bigger  bus  shelters are constructed, like  those

along Upper Serangoon Road in Punggol, which  have

been  provided with seats. Altogether six new  bus

shelters  along  Punggol Road were constructed  in

1971, in response to requests from the public  and

the  Citizens'  Consultative Committee.  More  bus

shelters  will be provided if these are  requested

for and found necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Toa Payoh, I do not know

why a trailer is parked on the bus bay, but if  he

will let me know where this bus bay is, I will ask

my  officials  to look into it. We can  build  bus

bays,  but  we cannot force buses to  stop  within

them. Nor can we prevent trailers from parking  in

bus bays until we get to know about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for second-hand equipment, perhaps anything

second-hand  is  better  than  none.  I  hope  the

department  did not pull them out of  Punggol  and

put them in Toa Payoh. I agree with the Member for

Toa Payoh that a new town like Toa Payoh needs new

bus shelters. I promise that I will do my best not

to  renovate  the  old but to  give  him  new  bus

shelters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister has just

mentioned that since Punggol is an outlying  area,

therefore,  the  bus  shelters  there   are   much

smaller.  Let  me  say  that  even  if  these  bus

shelters are pulled out of Punggol, I do not think

they would be put in Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which the Minister just pointed

out  is  that since the bus shelters along Punggol

Road are smaller, about 60 square feet, therefore,

there  is no need to have seats. Sir, in the light

of  some  vigorous comments from this  House  last

week  with regard to commuters having to wait  for

quite  some  time  before a bus comes  along  -  I

believe  to some extent this is also true for  bus

commuters in the Punggol Road area - I would  urge

the  Minister  to  reconsider  my  request  before

asking for permission to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, though these bus shelters in

Punggol are small, six of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



them  were  built last year. Six is a considerable

number  compared  with that for  Tanglin!  I  have

always stated that we are open to request. If  the

Member for Punggol can justify his representation,

we  will  certainly provide him with bus shelters,

perhaps even bigger ones with seats thrown in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I must thank the Minister

for his assurance, and I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $15,803,000 for Head 75 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 76 -

Paper Supplement -





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuan Hail Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng Yeow Chong:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 76 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 401.







<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff:</b> I am not moving, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,726,000 for Head 76 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a resolution of the House, Mr

Speaker  thereupon left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that

the  Committee of Supply has made progress on  the

Development  Estimates  of  Expenditure  for   the
