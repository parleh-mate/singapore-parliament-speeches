<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> May it

please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I consider

it my duty to bring to your notice conduct which

you may consider a breach of the liberties and

privileges of this House. I produce, Sir, a copy

of a newspaper called the Singapore Free Press of

Friday, the 22nd of July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw attention to the headline - "ROYAL

MESSAGE ATTACKED"- and

to the first paragraph wherein parts of my speech

were so juxtaposed as to give a completely

distorted picture of what was, in fact, said  and

intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this House are entitled to freedom from

malicious  distortion  in  any  report   of   our

proceedings.   I  would  add,  Sir,   that   this

malicious  report did, in fact, produce  to  some

extent what may have been the intended result. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



understand   that  certain  jelly-fish   on   the

Committee   of   the  Straits   Chinese   British

Association  capable of reading  headlines  began

quaking   and  emitting  noxious  substances   as

frightened jellyfish are wont to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there had been anything said which

reflected on Her Majesty, whether intentional  or

otherwise, I have not the slightest doubt - nor has

any Member of this House - that you would promptly

have  named  the Member responsible,  be  he  the

Chief  Minister  or any other person.  But,  even

assuming  that it is possible, Mr Speaker,  that

in  the  rapidity  of debate  you  may  not  have

noticed    any   slighting   reference,   however

unintentional, I do ask, with respect,  that  you

look  at the Hansard, the Official Report of  the

Proceedings of this House, and that you take such

steps to clarify the position, either towards  me

or towards the paper in question, as you may deem

fit. And I think it only proper to add, Sir, that

I  personally resent very strongly the suggestion

that  I  should be capable of discourtesy to  Her

Majesty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue of the Singapore Free Press in question

handed in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Question - [22nd July]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Speaker do convey to His Excellency the

Governor  the view of this House that the  people

of  Singapore  are determined to end  colonialism

and  to  rule  themselves through  their  elected

representatives;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that as a demonstration of the good faith of

Her  Majesty's  Government  in  its  oft-repeated

promise  to the people of Malaya that they  would

grant  self-government at the  earliest  possible

moment,  the  most  liberal construction  legally

permissible    in   favour   of    the    elected

representatives   of   the    people    in    the

interpretation of the Singapore Colony  Order  in

Council, 1955, should be adopted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that where the Governor is required by the

provisions  of  the  said  Order  in  Council  to

consult with the Chief Minister before taking any

action,  he  should act in accordance  with  such

advice;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the Speaker do report back to this

House   on   the  reply  he  receives  from   His

Excellency the Governor to this message, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



that thereafter this Assembly do take such action

on  motions  without notice as the  circumstances

may require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Rochore):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to support the motion standing in the

name of the Hon. the Chief Minister. It is indeed

tragic  that a constitutional crisis should  have

arisen  so  early  in  the life  of  the  present

Government. Some people say that the  crisis  was

brought  about by my Party's desire to  patch  up

the  differences  within our Party  by  offering

jobs  as  Assistant Ministers to Members  of  the

Party.  Nothing  is further from  the  truth - that

there  is  any  split in the Party.  It  is  only

natural  for  our opponents to fabricate  stories

and impute sinister motives towards us -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already overruled any

reference  to  the  merits  or  demerits  of  the

appointment  of  Assistant  Ministers.  Will  the

Member for Rochore please keep away from it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> This is the first time in

the    history   of   Singapore   that    elected

representatives of the people have been called to

shoulder the responsibilities of government,  and

we  do  not  claim that our Party is  overflowing

with  talent  and  sufficiently  experienced   to

shoulder  such responsibilities. It is  therefore

necessary  that  if  we  are  to  achieve   self-government  within  a  set  time-limit,  as  many

persons as possible in the early stages should be

afforded  the  opportunity to acquire  experience

and  knowledge which would enable them to run the

government   independently  in  time   to   come.

However, I would observe that to make the  Rendel

Constitution workable and to prove the  sincerity

of  Her  Majesty's Government in its oft-repeated

assurance that we would be given self-government,

the   constitution  should  be   interpreted   as

liberally as possible, and it should also be made

as  flexible as possible. Above all, there should

be  a  spirit of compromise in the event  of  any

difference   of  opinion  arising   between   the

Governor  and  the  Council of Ministers.  It  is

therefore unfortunate that His Excellency  should

have  adopted an adamant attitude on such a minor

issue as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>

the   appointment   of  junior   Ministers,   and

precipitated a constitutional crisis.  It  is  of

paramount importance that we should make it clear

once   and  for  all  as  to  who  governs   this

country - that  is,  the Governor  or  the  elected

representatives  of  the  people.  It   will   be

meaningless  to  claim that it  is  the  people's

representatives  who govern, if their  advice  is

rejected and their efforts thwarted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this controversy has at least one

good  effect. It has made the colonial Government

come  out of its shell and to admit publicly that

it  was not their intention to grant rapid  self-government to the people of Singapore.  This  has

exposed their hypocrisy. Self-government  is  one

of  the  main platforms of every political Party,

not only in Singapore, but also in every colonial

territory in the British Empire. However,  it  is

our  Party,  and our Party alone, which  had  the

courage and foresight to announce that it was our

intention to achieve self-government within  four

years.  If  we  hope for self-government  without

fixing  a  definite date for achieving  same,  it

would  be  tantamount to hoping for the moon.  We

cannot  achieve anything, either in our  personal

ambitions or in politics, unless we fix our  goal

and work according to schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While vested interests are happy over the

Governor's statement in this respect, the man-in-the-street  is  doubting  whether  Her  Majesty's

Government are genuine in their promise to  grant

us self-government. If we are wrong in hoping for

self-government within four years, let them  tell

us,  in  no  unmistaken terms, when we  would  be

granted independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Twentieth Century no civilised nation

would  like  the  idea  if  being  subjected   to

another,  and I ask for a clear-cut statement  on

this  point.  I am amazed to hear  from  my  hon.

Friend Mr Sutherland that there are thousands of

Asians in this island who have little to complain

of  under  colonial rule. It shows the narrowness

of   his   sphere  of  acquaintance.   Being   an

expatriate  himself and a representative  of  the

vested  interests in the bargain,  he  cannot  be

expected to, and would not climb down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



from his pedestal and mix up with the man-in-the-street to obtain his views on the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, for one, would grant that we owe a lot to the

colonial power in the same way as we are grateful

to   the  pioneering  Chinese  and  Indians  who,

through  their  sweat  and  toil,  built  up  the

prosperity  of Singapore and Malaya. We  are  not

hostile  towards  the British, and  there  is  no

reason  why  we should not continue  on  friendly

terms  with  them even after we have  gained  our

self-government or independence. Colonialism  has

had its usefulness, but the time has come when we

must  demand what is our birthright - the right  to

govern ourselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in all territories under the jurisdiction of

the  United Kingdom Government, Britain holds the

responsibility  for  answering  to   the   United

Nations  and the world at large for their affairs

and administration. That is the reason why in the

constitution  of every British non-self-governing

territory the final say in the administration  is

vested with the Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you examine the constitution of Singapore and

even  more  advanced territories  like  the  Gold

Coast,  you  will  find  that,  wherever  it  is

provided  that  the Governor, before  taking  any

action,  should consult a Minister, or  even  the

whole  Council of Ministers, the final say  rests

with  the  Governor. It is only when there  is  a

transfer  of power granting independence  to  any

hitherto  dependent territory that you find  this

reserved power of the Governor eliminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Party has already made it quite

clear that it is in full agreement with the first

and  second parts of this motion. The third  part

seeks to place an interpretation which will have

the  effect  of  removing some of the  Governor's

powers  and  of  having  the  final  say  in  the

administration  of this country. If  such  powers

are, in fact, to be taken from the Governor, then

we   shall  have  the  position  of  the  British

Government  remaining responsible and  answerable

to  the  world at large for the affairs  of  this

country,  and  at the same time deprived  of  the

power of being the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>

ultimate   authority  over  some   administrative

matters.  It  is  therefore logical  that  if  we

demand  such powers, then we must be prepared  to

shoulder all consequential responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tone in which this debate has been

carried on, it is obvious that many, in fact  the

majority of the Members of this House, are of the

view that we should now demand that whenever  the

Governor should consult the Chief Minister, and a

fortiori  the Council of Ministers, the  Governor

should  not  have the final say. That  being  the

case,  let us be honest about it. Let us not  ask

for these very far-reaching powers without having

to  shoulder the resulting responsibilities.  The

demand for these far-reaching powers without  the

consequential  changes in the constitution  would

result  in  our  having the powers while  Britain

retains  the  liabilities. Let us therefore  play

the game, and ask for a full transfer of power so

that  we, and we alone, shall be responsible  for

our  own  affairs  and destiny and  the  British

Government need no longer be answerable for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the principles which I have

stated, I therefore move an amendment, which will

not  only  be in line with the first  and  second

parts  of this motion, but also remove all future

occasions  for dissatisfaction. I therefore  move

that   the  motion  be  amended  by  adding   the

following new part between parts three  and  four

of the motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that in the opinion of this House the time

has  arrived  for a transfer of  power  from  the

Government of the United Kingdom to the people of

Singapore, and that a new constitution  providing

for independence should he granted immediately."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.

Chinese, and some others, said they were  against

multi-lingualism.  In  this  House  we  had  the

horrible spectacle, Sir, very soon after we sat,

of seeing them perform political somersaults -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I apologise , Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I remind you. Mr Chief

Minister, of our Standing Orders? There must  not

be  any  offensive  or insulting  language  about

Members of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> With respect, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Progressive  Party  consists  of  many

parts, of which only the rump is in the Assembly!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, Sir, we had the spectacle of the

existing   Members  in  this  Assembly   of   the

Progressive Party complaining bitterly that  some

power  would be taken from the Governor and given

to  the  people's  chief elected  representative.

Today,  in  order  to make a farce  of  a  solemn

motion,  of one that answers our deep  needs,  we

have  an  amendment - an  amendment  which,  it  is

suggested, would be politically  impossible  for

anyone to resist. I am not a politician. I  could

not  survive  even  one year in  the  Progressive

Party.  But  I  am  not afraid of  taking  honest

decisions,  whatever the political  consequences.

Independence today is an impossibility, and may I

say,  Sir,  with respect to the Standing  Orders,

that  the amendment is made by the hon. Gentleman

with  his  tongue  in  his  cheek!  We  have  the

Federation of Malaya to consider. We seem to have

forgotten it, as in its hustings it seems to have

forgotten  us.  We  are not  playing  a  game  of

marbles: children in a dirty back-alley.  We  are

supposed  to be men of responsibility, answerable

for  the  welfare of more than a million  people,

not political manoeuvres. In these circumstances,

Sir,  I  welcome this further disclosure  of  the

traditional conduct of the Progressive Party, and

I  move this amendment to the amendment - that  for

the   word   'independence'   the   word   'self-government' be substituted, and that  we  do  ask

for  a  transfer  of  power, for  self-government

immediately. I beg to move.

and on the Monday, after the picture has become a

little bit clearer -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. We are now on the

amendment  to  the amendment. We are  talking  of

self-government as against independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  will  have  the  opportunity   of

speaking,  as  he  wishes  to  speak,  when   the

original  amendment is put to the House.  Now  we

are concerned with whether or not the word "self-government"  should be inserted in the  place  of

"independence". As I understand it, the mover  of

the   original   amendment  has   accepted   that

amendment to the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the word 'independence' proposed

to  be  left  out,  be left out of  the  Original

Amendment, and the word 'self-government' proposed

to  be  inserted,  be there inserted,"  put,  and

agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original amendment, as amended, again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  the  Member  for  Paya  Lebar  moved  the

amendment   just  now,  he  was   bewailing   and

bemoaning  the  fact that certain powers  of  His

Excel1ency  the Governor were going to  be  taken

away  and  transferred to the representatives  of

the  people.  Sir,  just after he  finished  that

sentence,  he  came out with an amendment  which

sought  to  give  us  complete independence;  and

before   one  minute  had  expired,  he  accepted

another  amendment to the effect that  we  wanted

self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, self-government and independence are

poles  apart. This shows the political acrobatics

of those who sit in that corner of the House -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must rule the Minister out of

order.   Will   he  please  withdraw   the   word

"acrobatics"?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I withdraw it. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would

all  rejoice if, for one moment, we could believe

that  these  gentlemen believe in what  they  are

today  proposing sincerely and not as a piece  of

political chicanery.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Kuan Yew, I should like to

put  this debate on a proper plane. Let  us  have

this debate on a high plane. Let us not come down

to  personalities.  You  are  offending  Standing

Order No. 31 (6), which says that no Member shall

impute  improper  motives to  any  other  Member.

Remember, hon.  Gentlemen,  that  what  you  say

outside this Assembly cannot necessarily be  said

in this Assembly because of our Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir. I seldom

indulge in what you refer to as personal attacks.

My  attack  on them is not one on their  personal

merits as Assemblymen or as good fathers and good

sons  and loving husbands. My attack on  them  is

for  the  hypocrisy  of this move,  that,  in  my

opinion -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will not have unparliamentary

language in this Assembly. I have said that  before.

Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If the word "hypocrisy", Mr

Speaker, Sir, is unparliamentary, may I put it  this

way?  I find it extremely difficult to imagine  that

within  the space of three days a Party,  which  has

stood  against more power being given to  the  Chief

Minister, could, in all sincerity, come and say that

they would wish Her Majesty's Government to transfer

all  the Governor's powers to the Chief Minister and

his colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has said that he is not a

politician.  Sir,  if he were,  he  would  not  have

accepted this amendment. He would have let it go  on

the original motion as it stood, for having moved an

amendment  to  minimise  the original  motion,  they

would have given us the singular privilege of seeing

them  vote for that motion. There were three  things

they  could have done on that original motion - either

vote  for;  vote  against; or  abstain.  They  could

hardly  have voted for, because they have  moved  an

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now we have the most astonishing spectacle of

seeing  the  Progressive Party  being  the  fiercest

Party of us all! They are the people, the Member for

Paya Lebar has said it bold and clear, whose cry  is

"We want independence now!" When the People's Action

Party  said these things, the world trembled because

they  thought that if these people got in, then they

would  do what they said they were going to do.  But

when  the Member for Paya Lebar said it, I can quite

imagine the hon. Mr Sutherland being quite unmoved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will have to accept this amendment because

the  Chief Minister has moved it. If he had not been

such a political innocent, he would have forced this

issue  as  it  stood  and  we  would  have  had  the

privilege  of seeing the four Progressive  gentlemen

vote  against that motion, if they had the  courage;

or  abstain, if they had not the courage. Be that as

it  may,  they hope - it is still not certain yet - that

they can go back to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



country  and  say, "We went to the Assembly  and  we

said  to  the  Chief Secretary (Mr Goode)  that  we

wanted   independence  now.  And  then   the   Chief

Minister, who is a timorous man, said he only wanted

self-government. But the Progressive Party  believes

in independence. It believes in it fearlessly!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a topic on which I think the People's

Action Party is on much more familiar ground. If  it

is of any assistance to the Member for Paya Lebar, I

could  give him some of the scripts of the  People's

Action  Party's views in the past on this  topic  of

independence.  I  think he would make  a  much  more

convincing  case  if he were to  crib  some  of  the

passages  from our Party manifesto and our  election

platform.  The Progressive Party was the  one  which

went   before   the   electorate   and   said,   "We

believe" - (the  Straits  Times  gave  it   tremendous

prominence, and I am sure it must have pleased  Mr

Sutherland  very  much) - "in slow, orderly  peaceful

government.  We are against all this haste  and  all

this  wild  talk  by irresponsible  people  of  this

country  for independence." Today we are entertained

by the unique spectacle of the mouse turned lion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That a new part be inserted between the third and

fourth parts of the Original Question, "And that  in

the opinion of this House the time has arrived for a

transfer of power from the Government of the  United

Kingdom to the people of Singapore, and that a  new

constitution providing for self-government should be

granted immediately;",



<br><br>put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> As the debate developed, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on Friday, and as it  has  developed

indeed this morning, we have had a certain amount of

Party  rancour and even manoeuvre from some  of  the

Opposition  Members, which has  had,  in  fact,  the

happy  result  of  producing an  amendment  to  this

motion  which has just been accepted, and  this  has

left us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



pretty  well where we were before. The Progressive

Party  are anxious to attach a name to what  would

already have been the substance in any case.  What

do  they  mean by "immediately" I do not  know.  I

presume  they do not expect a new constitution  to

be  written  tonight and published  tomorrow,  but

they will no doubt accept that "immediately" means

"as soon as possible".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I hope that we have, with this last

amendment, reached the end of the party strife and

manoeuvre, because this is a matter which  should

rise far above personal and party feelings. As the

Chief  Minister opened the debate  on  Friday,  he

informed  the Opposition that the Party  Whip  had

been  withdrawn,  and he invited  all  Members  to

speak   and  to  vote  in  accordance  with  their

innermost convictions. I hope that from now on all

will  do  so. I hope all have done so so far.  But

although the Chief Minister did his best to secure

that  we  should be free from party strife,  there

were and there have been a number of bitter words,

imputations   and   recriminations,   which   have

compelled  you, Mr Speaker, to intervene  and  to

remind  us  continually of  the  Standing  Orders.

Members  have  gone beyond what is permissible  in

this  chaste Assembly, and as a result  there  has

been some confusion of the constitutional issue. I

wish  to stress again that the importance of  this

constitutional issue lies finally in the fact that

we  are  all substantially agreed on it. If  there

was  real  disagreement in this House,  the  issue

would  be dead, or at least would have to be  kept

in  cold  storage until you could get  substantial

unanimity   in   the   people   and    in    their

representatives. But since all are agreed, then we

should  all speak and vote in unity; vote  loyally

to  give effect to the wishes of the people;  give

effect  to our own innermost convictions.  But  to

try to reap party advantage on this occasion, to

give  vent  to  personal  ill-feeling,  bears  the

appearance   of   indescribable  small-mindedness.

Tomorrow   there  will  be  a  proper   and   full

opportunity  for  all  the bitterness,  the  party

strife,   the   rancour, the   manoeuvres, the

imputations, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



misrepresentations,  in  which  some  Members  are

happy to indulge. But today can we not all join to

put  forward  together the cause of  freedom,  the

cause  of self-government, on which we all  agree?

And  if  today is no time for party bitterness,  I

suggest  that  it is also no time  for  expressing

bitterness against the Imperial power, or  against

the  representatives of the Imperial power in this

territory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This sounds like moral rearmament!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is rather more practical than

moral rearmament. We have in the world today three

major  world groupings. You have, to the north  of

us,  what  the  geo-politicians call  the  "heart-land",     which    is    controlled    by     the

Communists - Russia,  China and  their  dependencies

and  subordinate  bodies.  You  have,  across  the

Pacific,  the  United States of America  with  its

dependencies  and  its dollar diplomacy;  and  you

have,  away on the west of us, the United  Kingdom

and around us the Commonwealth of Nations. And  as

the  world is today, no small territory can  stand

alone. We are a small territory. We shall still be

small  when  we  have  achieved  union  with   the

Federation. We cannot stand alone. We  shall  have

to  associate  ourselves with one of  these  major

world  groupings. And if a choice has to be  made,

there  is  no  doubt in my mind  that  the  choice

should fall on the Commonwealth of Nations. I  say

this  without  prejudice to what I hope  we  shall

achieve  in  the future - which is a  fourth  major

world  grouping,  which  would  extend  from   the

Himalayas to the South Pacific, to include so many

new  and  free nations and peoples, and  which  we

hope  could  rise above the greeds and jealousies,

rivalries, disputes and war and folly, which  have

disgraced the history of the great Powers  in  the

past.  But that is over the horizon of the  future

still, and for the time being this territory  will

have  no  choice but to go with one of  the  three

major  world  groupings  that  I  have  named.  It

appears  to me that all the advantage to  us  will

lie in retaining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



in  some  form our present association. So  I  shall

refrain from wounding words and from bitterness, and

perhaps  I might take this opportunity, Mr Speaker,

Sir - and  here  I  am  sure I  shall  not  transgress

Standing Orders - in expressing my personal feelings,

my  deep sense of the most fulsome compliment  which

was  paid  by  the  Member for Telok  Ayer  (Mr  R.

Jumabhoy)  when  he  was speaking  about  the  Chief

Minister. I know that he was pulled up for  improper

language in parts of his speech, but nevertheless he

did  describe the Chief Minister as a bee,  a  honey

bee,  and  I  thought  it  was  a  most  appropriate

comparison to make -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir. Is it necessary to make references now on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Why, does it hurt you? [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The hon. Member is

perfectly  entitled to make his  speech.  If  he  is

irrelevant, I will pull him up. Mr Thomas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am sorry that the Member for Telok

Ayer is not happy with my enlarging on his metaphor,

but  I  would like to complete it. In comparing  the

Chief  Minister  to  a  bee,  I  felt  it  was  most

appropriate  because the bee is  such  an  energetic

fellow.  With  incessant  energy  he  continues  to

accumulate  honey,  not  for  himself  but  for  the

service  of  others.  Moreover,  the  bee  is,  when

attacked,  armed with a sting with which he  can  do

damage!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on Friday, the Chief Minister argued - and I

felt  with very great force and cogency - that in  the

relevant section of the constitutional document  the

word  "may"  is  directive and not permissive.  This

point seems to present some difficulty, perhaps,  to

some Members of this House, and certainly elsewhere,

and if people are unconvinced, I would suggest that,

for  the purposes of argument, I shall pass  by  the

Chief  Minister's  array of legal  authorities,  his

picul  or  so of calf-bound tomes which  he  brought

with him in case they were needed, and I will grant,

purely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



for  purposes of argument, that in this  matter  His

Excellency has certain discretionary powers. I  will

proceed  to  examine what is then  the  position  if

those   powers,   in  fact,  are  rightly   in   His

Excellency's control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote as my first authority Professor

Barriedale  Keith. His textbook - the British  Cabinet

System - is,   I  believe,  a  reasonable   work   of

reference  which  is accepted as  an  authority.  He

points  out  that when a British Colony  adopts  the

British  Cabinet  system - as  we  are  doing  here - it

necessarily  adopts also the fundamental  principles

and  practice of the British Cabinet system. And so,

if we can accept Professor Keith as being right - and

obviously  he  must be because you  cannot  adopt  a

model  of  democracy without adopting the principles

which  have produced that model - if he is  right,  we

have  to  examine  the principles on  which  we  are

hoping to proceed. Our attention has been very  much

fixed  on  one major principle, which  is  that  the

Sovereign,  or  in  this territory  the  Sovereign's

representative,  should act on  the  advice  of  his

Ministers   when  it  is  formally  and   officially

tendered  to  him through the Chief  Minister.  That

principle,  I  think,  is clear  to  everybody,  and

nobody  has  any  difficulty  or  doubt  about   the

statement of the principle. Where the difficulty and

doubt  has come, at least in His Excellency's  mind,

is whether that principle should be applied here and

now. My object is to show that it can and should  be

applied, without hesitation and without delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote, in support of that, another

principle  which is equally fundamental and  perhaps

more  far-reaching: a principle which  can  best  be

stated  by  saying  that the  constitution  must  be

flexible.   It   must  have  flexibility   and   the

possibility of adaptation to things as they  change.

In  Britain,  there is no written constitution.  You

have  various  fixed constitutional points  such  as

Magna Carta or the Bill of Rights, or the Parliament

Act of 1911, or the Habeas Corpus Act, which can  be

called  constitutional documents, but  they  do  not

amount to a written constitution. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



so  far as they have any effect, their effect  is

to  give more freedom and more liberty of action.

They do not restrict people in any way, except to

restrict  the  power  of the  Executive  to  some

extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commonwealth of Nations also has no written

constitution. The whole British system  is  based

on the fact that you deal with situations as they

arise,  and  you  do  not tie  yourself  down  in

writing  to  an  intention which you  cannot,  in

fact,   carry  out  because  the  situation   has

changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do have in the United States of America a

written  constitution, and they get into quite  a

mess  with  it  sometimes. My little  reading  in

American  history  has indicated  that  they  get

conflicting  interpretations  according  to   the

political  colour  of  the country  at  different

times.  There is a fairly long time  lag  between

changes,  and  certainly in  Singapore  we  have

already got into some difficulty with our written

constitution. It is precisely because we  have  a

written  constitution that we need this principle

of  flexibility. It was inevitable that we should

have   a  constitution  written,  because  whilst

elsewhere constitutions have grown up slowly over

a  long  period of time, here no opportunity  for

constitutional progress was made. If progress had

started 50 years ago, we should now no doubt have

conventions  instead  of a written  constitution,

but we have not. We have to cram into a few years

the  progress  that might well have  been  spread

over half a century.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I pass to my next authority. This is no

massive tome, but I received it some two or three

months  ago  from  our worthy friend  the  Public

Relations Officer. It is published by the Central

Office  of Information. The title is The Monarchy

and  The Commonwealth, and it says on the  inside

cover that this document is intended as reference

material   and   is  derived  from  authoritative

sources  and  may  be freely  used  in  preparing

articles,  speeches, broadcasts, etc. I  take  it

that  it is authoritative, because it comes  from

an authoritative source, and I take it as being a

reasonable and fair statement of what the British

position is.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constitutional conventions differ from strict

law  in  that they are not recognised and applied

by  the Courts" - I know that some Members of  this

House wish them to be brought to the Courts,  but

they  did not appreciate the British approach  to

constitutional problems. They are not  recognised

and applied by the Courts - "but nevertheless they

are   indispensable   and  lend   themselves   to

adaptation to changing conditions without serious

disturbance to existing legislative forms. It was

largely  by  means  of the firm establishment  of

such  conventions that in the course of centuries

restrictions were imposed on the use of the Royal

prerogative  and that the powers  of  the  Crown,

ceasing  to  be at the personal disposal  of  the

Sovereign" - or  in  Singapore  the   Sovereign's

representative - "came to be the means  of  giving

effect  to  the  wishes of the  people".  I  will

repeat    the   two   key   portions   of    that

quotation - "adaptation  to   changing   conditions

without    serious   disturbance   to    existing

legislative  forms". We have changing conditions.

They  have changed rapidly. We do need to be able

to  adapt to them. The Progressive Party has  now

made  it necessary, through their amendment, that

we should disturb the existing legislative forms.

The  point  is  not of any vital  importance,  it

seems to me in this case, but, as far as it goes,

they  have  gone  somewhat  against  the  general

spirit of democracy; but it does not matter  very

much.  The other portion which I wish to  remind

Members  of is - "powers of the Crown came  to  be

the  means of giving effect to the wishes of  the

people". His Excellency is the representative  of

the  Crown,  and it is not unreasonable  to  hope

that the powers which he exercises now can, by  a

simple   constitutional   transference,   without

serious   disturbance   of   any   sort,   either

legislative or any other kind, become  the  means

of giving effect to the wishes of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it is necessary to argue

this  point  any further, but I think perhaps  it

will    be   useful   to   cover   briefly    the

interpretation of this, as it is quoted  in  this

booklet,  in  the  history of  Canada,  which  is

called   the  senior  Dominion  of  the   British

Commonwealth.  Hon.  Members will  recollect,  no

doubt,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



the  American Revolution where the Imperial power

stood on its strict constitutional rights and, as

a  consequence, lost its American colonies  which

now  become the great and dollar - powerful  United

States  of  America, with whom we have,  happily,

friendly   relations.  That  gave   the   British

Government furiously to think, and at the end  of

about  70 years they had thought it all  out  and

Lord Durham went to Canada and produced in 1839 a

Report  from which the future development of  the

Commonwealth has grown. The effect of this Report

was  that although there were powers retained and

reserved - powers of disallowance, surveillance and

so  on,  which  were  retained  by  the  Imperial

Government - they were not, in fact, used and  they

were  obsolete long before they were removed.  In

other words, it was perfectly feasible under  the

British practice to have powers, but not  to  use

them. The situation did not call for them. Canada

was   perfectly  competent  to  act  responsibly,

achieving  economic  and political  independence.

The  principle  of flexibility was  applied,  and

although  the  powers were there  they  were  not

used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the Rendel Constitutional

Commission,  as  they  surveyed  the   field   of

Singapore    with   conscientious   thoroughness,

brought to their study the full knowledge of this

principle of flexibility, and they also  knew,  I

am  sure,  that  in  the wrong hands  flexibility

could degenerate into flabbiness. They might wish

that  the  Governor should be strong, because  on

surveying  the Singapore scene at that time  they

felt  that there was a danger of flabbiness. They

felt  that  democracy was a  difficult  thing  to

transplant into this tropical climate. They might

have  had  in their minds the old quotation  from

Rudyard  Kipling that "East is East and  West  is

West,  and never the twain shall meet": and  they

might  have wondered whether, in fact,  democracy

could  be  transplanted  into  Singapore  in  the

course  of a few years - that fragile flower  might

wilt  and droop, become flabby and might  need  a

strong gardener in the person of the Governor  to

drive in a stake and tie the plant to it so  that

it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



might  stand  up,  until it had  gathered  enough

strength  to stand by itself. I am only assuming

what  might have been in the minds of the  Rendel

Constitutional  Commission, but I  would  suggest

that  we  might  take note of the whole  of  what

Kipling said, because it is rather relevant.

<pre>

  "Oh,  East is East, and West is West, and

    never the twain shall meet,

  Till  Earth  and Sky stand presently  at

    God's great Judgment Seat;

  But there is neither East nor West,

    Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,

  When  two strong men stand face to

    face, though they come from the ends

    of the earth!"

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our situation today. We have two strong

men - His  Excellency and cur Chief Minister.  They

have come into conflict. They are grappling today

in   a   constitutional  struggle,  and  in  that

struggle the great gap between East and  West  is

abolished. It is brought together into  a  single

democratic    process,   which,   as   democratic

processes  do, is producing difficulties,  making

the  sparks fly; but out of it we see  this.  The

struggle  between His Excellency  and  the  Chief

Minister  is  a  clear  and  obvious  proof  that

democracy  has  taken strong  root  here  and  is

already  a real and vital political principle  at

the  very  heart  of  our  political  life.  This

struggle  would  not  have been  possible,  as  I

pointed  out before, if there was not substantial

unanimity,  and  if the Chief  Minister  was  not

representing effectively the wishes of the people

and  of the representatives of the people.  There

can be no question about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this struggle resolves itself, I think it

will  be  plain that Singapore has taken a  great

step  forward. We shall be grateful not  only  to

the  Chief Minister for fighting this battle, but

we  may well feel grateful to His Excellency  for

having  provided  the occasion  for  the  battle.

Because  this  struggle  has  given  to  us   the

opportunity  of demonstrating to the whole  world

that   Singapore  no  longer  needs  to   receive

democracy as a gift, but has taken democracy  and

made  it her own; is able to use it and live  it,

and  fight for it, and to succeed in its practice

and in the interpretation of its principles. This

constitutional struggle is nothing  new.  It  was

foreshadowed in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



very heavy poll at the time of the elections.  In

spite  of  some ingenious simple arithmetic,  the

fact  remains that the poll was extremely  heavy.

The electoral register contained numerous errors,

and  although there may have been in theory  some

300,000 potential electors, the actual figure was

much   nearer  200,000  and  the  poll   was   an

exceptionally   high  poll  for  any   democratic

country, and an astonishing poll in a place  like

Singapore   with  a  small  and  weak  democratic

tradition.  If further proof of the  strength  of

democracy  here is needed, it has been  given  in

the  energy  and  vigour of the Chief  Minister's

Government. His Excellency's powers to  prop  and

shelter  the  flower of democracy are  no  longer

needed.  Where they should have been  a  support,

they are now an encumbrance, a hindrance, and  an

obstruction to the free development, growth  and

movement  of  the  democratic  process.  We  need

flexibility and not rigidity, and I would like to

close  by  quoting  to  the  House  what,  to  my

astonishment, nobody has quoted so  far - Sir  John

Nicoll's words to this House on the 22nd of April

in his Opening Address:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have already had a most striking

demonstration of the realisation by the people of

Singapore  of  their  responsibilities  in   this

matter"  (that  is  in  the  matter  of  the  new

constitution). "The General Election held earlier

this  month  showed that the people of  Singapore

understand  the importance of the  vote  and  the

need  for casting their votes in accordance  with

their  convictions. It is now for the Council  of

Ministers and this Assembly as a whole to see  to

it  that  the  popular  will thus  democratically

expressed is carried out. Let no man suppose that

he knows better than the Election results."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note I would like to end with these last

words: That out of this struggle, and out of  our

ultimate  victory in it, there  can  grow  a  new

unity  of  the people of Singapore. We  can  look

forward  to  a  period of useful  and  prosperous

relationships between His Excellency and all that

he  stands  for, and the Chief Minister  and  all

that he stands for.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the issue before this House  is  an

issue which involves not only the interpretation

of  the  Order in Council, but also the sin-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



cerity of the Colonial Office and, in particular, of the

British   Government   towards   granting   self-government to this island. I wish Members of this

House  would  realise  the significance  and  the

gravity  of  the situation. It is not  something

which  could be treated with emotion or hilarity.

The  outcome  of this debate will  depend,  to  a

great  extent, on whether or not this  Government

is  capable of carrying out its proper  functions

in a spirit of goodwill and understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has pointed out on various

occasions  that  there could be no responsibility

without power. For three and a half months,  Sir,

the  Coalition Government has had to face and  to

solve  problems  which would  do  credit  to  a

Solomon.  Much against our will, but  because  we

thought  it  was for the good of  the  people  of

Singapore,  we  acquiesced  in  the  use  of  the

Emergency  Regulations, and when criticisms  came

thundering  in,  it  was not His  Excellency  the

Governor  nor was it the Hon. the Chief Secretary

who  had  to face the music. It was the Coalition

Government  who  was  responsible.  It  was   the

Coalition Government who was the bad hat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the Elected Members on this side of the

House,  have  never  shirked  our  responsibility

either  to  the people of Singapore  or  for  the

conduct  of  good government. If  we  are  to  be

responsible, I say, and I say it with conviction,

let  us  also share in the power which we firmly

believe is embodied in the Order in Council. What

is this power that we say is ours by right? Is it

the power to corrupt? Is it the power to destroy?

No, Mr Speaker, it is the power to enable us  to

carry  out our duties as responsible and  elected

Ministers  of  the  people with  the  dignity  it

deserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members in this House have insinuated that

the interpretation of section 32 of the Order  in

Council  was  the  interpretation  of  the  Chief

Minister himself. If this were so, I would not be

standing   here   today   addressing   you.   The

interpretation,  Mr  Speaker,  is  no  more  the

interpretation of the Chief Minister than  it  is

mine.  It  is the interpretation of the Coalition

Government as a whole. The Chief Minister is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



dictator.  It  is to his credit  that  during  my

sojourn  in  hospital, he visited me on  no  less

than   six  occasions  to  consult  me  on  every

important aspect of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insinuations have also been made that there is

a  split in opinions within the Coalition itself.

If  this  had  been  intended to  mean  that  the

Alliance thinks differently, then I say  to  you,

Sir,  that  it  is  absolute  nonsense.  On  this

particular  issue,  we of the  Alliance  have  no

doubt  at all. We sink or swim together with  our

friends  the  Labour Front,  and  with  our  good

friends  across  the table, the  People's  Action

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only hope, my only prayer, is that the

Secretary  of  State for the  Colonies,  when  he

arrives  here this week, would be made to realise

how  deeply we feel about the present crisis. Let

him   also   realise  that  we,  the  people   of

Singapore,  want  'Merdeka', not a  revolutionary

'Merdeka', Mr Speaker, but an evolutionary  one.

Lest  I  tread on the sensitive toes of the  hon.

Mr  Sutherland, let me assure him in advance,  I

shall  not shout 'Merdeka' seventeen times within

his hearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I repeat, once again, there

can  be  no  stable government  in  this  island,

unless and until responsibility goes hand in hand

with power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one newspaper has

suggested that the Chief Minister does  not  have

the  full support of his colleagues in his  fight

to  gain recognition of the fundamental rights of

the  people's  elected representatives.  This  is

utter nonsense, Sir. We are with him to the hilt.

It  is not the Chief Minister's fight at all.  It

is    the    fight   of   every   self-respecting

representative of the people, and I am  happy  to

say that there are many in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House are prepared to

resign,  if we are not given the power that  goes

with   the   responsibilities.   The   hon.   Mr

Sutherland, Sir, in his speech last Friday,  made

a  very  brave  attempt  to  defend  the  British

colonial system. He stated that we must learn  to

crawl before we can walk. For the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



benefit of the Member, Sir, I would like to  say,

with  all the emphasis at my command, that we  on

this  side of the House do not crawl and are  not

so  spineless as to crawl, and they, too, Sir, on

the other side of the House do not belong to that

species that grovels and begs for crumbs from the

colonial table.

independence is geared to the will of the  people

of  Singapore, and is not chained to the colonial

chariot, with the Secretary of State holding  the

reins.   If  we  want,  if  we,  the  people   of

Singapore, want self-government and independence

tomorrow, we will have it, and nothing  is  going

to stop us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the handful of Progressive Members who

survived the elections, together with the  Member

for Telok Ayer, made ridiculous attempts to cloud

the  issue by making odious suggestions about the

Chief    Minister's   recommendation   for    the

appointment  of  four  Assistant  Ministers.  The

Chief Minister, Sir, has clearly stated that this

is  a  side  issue, and that he  is  prepared  to

reconsider   his  recommendation,   but   it   is

imperative in the interests of the welfare of the

people of Singapore, and in the implementation of

Her  Majesty's Government's oft-repeated  promise

of  granting self-government, that section 32  of

the  Singapore Colony Order in Council should  be

interpreted  in  a  manner in  keeping  with  the

spirit  of the Rendel Constitution; and this  is,

Sir,  that  in  so  far as domestic  matters  are

concerned,  the  people's representatives  should

have  absolute  control. I am qualified  to  make

this  statement  because I was a  member  of  the

Rendel   Commission;  perhaps  I  am   the   only

surviving member of the Rendel Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the interpretation of section 32

of the Order in Council, it appears that the whole

question hinges on the interpretation of the word

"may".  The Governor's interpretation is that  it

connotes the exercise of discretionary power, and

the  Chief Minister's interpretation is  that  it

connotes  the granting of authority to  exercise,

which  authority  must  be  exercised  when   the

circumstances  stated therein  arise.  The  Chief

Minister  has quoted legal authority  to  support

his  interpretation. Sir, I am not  a  lawyer  by

profession,  and I am therefore not qualified  to

touch  on the legal aspect in my contribution  to

the debate on the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have stated on several occasions in the

last   Legislative  Council  that   the   English

language is indeed difficult to understand, and I

find  it  necessary in this present  instance  to

repeat  what I said to illustrate the point.  Two

friends, Sir, a Frenchman and an Englishman, were

travelling in a train in England. When the  train

was approaching a tunnel, the Englishman shouted,

"Look  out!"  The  Frenchman,  on  hearing   this

command, looked out, and got soot all  over  his

face.  He  turned round angrily to the Englishman

and demanded an apology for having played such  a

dirty  game  on  him.  The  Englishman  was  very

surprised,  but he felt sorry for the Frenchman's

ignorance of the English language. He, therefore,

explained  calmly to the Frenchman that  when  he

said  "look  out",  he meant "look  in".  So  the

Frenchman  scratched his head and muttered,  "You

English  are  a funny race. When you  mean  'look

in',  why  do  you have to say 'look  out'?"  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  English language  is  indeed

difficult to understand, and when "look out"  can

mean  "look  in", surely "may" can mean  "shall"? [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is important to the

people  of  Singapore  is not  how  the  Governor

interprets section 32, or how the Chief  Minister

interprets section 32. The deciding factor should

be - what is the popular interpretation? By this, I

mean,  what is the interpretation of the for  the

expression of this interpretation amendment. With

that  amendment, Sir, constitution was  drawn  up?

The forum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



is    in   this   Assembly,   by   the   people's

representatives. We, who are gathered  here  this

morning, are the people's representatives, and we

are  here  to  express the people's views,  their

aims, and their aspirations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was at school, Sir, I was taught English

history,  and I learned that when King Charles  I

attempted to interpret the constitution according

to  his will and not according to the will of the

people, he brought upon himself a fate which  we

all  know.  The purpose of the motion before  the

House   is  to  impress  on  Whitehall  to   take

cognizance  of  the  will of the  people  through

their   elected  representatives,   and   I   ask

Whitehall  to  take  new heed.  The  debate  last

Friday,  Sir,  has shown that there  are  elected

representatives and elected representatives,  and

I  hesitate to expand on this, because, even with

the privilege of this House in freedom of speech,

I  am  afraid I cannot find words apt  enough  to

describe  what  I  mean by  the  second  type  of

elected  representatives,  but  without  uttering

those words. Sir, I feel sure that the people  of

Singapore  know  what  they  are.  The  hon.  Mr

Sutherland,  Sir,  in  his  speech  last  Friday,

asked, "Who are the people of Singapore?"



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> Yes, you tell me!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I wish to enlighten him, Sir,

and  perhaps improve his political education, but

I am rather hesitant, when I have to do this in a

language  that  is difficult to understand,  that

is,   the   English  language.  The   people   of

Singapore, as embodied in the first part  of  the

motion  before the House, are the people who  are

represented  by  their  representatives  in  this

Assembly,  and in a democracy, the majority  view

represents the view of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  a Back-bencher, it is not easy to be original,

but  I  think the long, full week-end has enabled

Members  of the Progressive Party ample  time  to

adjust themselves to enable them to come to  this

House this morning with their people of Singapore

for whose welfare the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



they have deprived themselves of the right to use

the  habitual 'No' to any motion coming from this

side of the House, and the Member for Telok Ayer,

Sir,  in  supporting  that  amendment, has  also

deprived   himself  of  the   right   to   be   a

professional abstainer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not, Sir, issuing a threat, but I am

sounding  a  warning  of  the  danger,  if  self-government  to  be  followed  in  good  time   by

independence  is  not  granted,  but  is  delayed

intentionally  or otherwise, of the consequences,

which we all should like to avoid. I am one, Sir,

who  believes  that  if the power,  against  whom

today   we  are  struggling  to  get  our   self-government and independence, would co-operate with

us  and help us to achieve what we aim for, it is

not  impossible  that when we have  obtained  our

independence, we should be friends and behave  to

our mutual benefit.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

indeed  very sad that attempts were made by  some

Members on the Opposition benches last Friday  to

sidetrack  the real issue which was put  squarely

before  this  House  by the Chief  Minister.  The

issue  was very simple. We were asked to  express

our  determination to rule ourselves.  No  wonder

there  was much moaning and wailing from some  of

them.  They  could no longer sit  on  the  fence.

Their  delicate constitutions could  not  stomach

such an outspoken principle as self-rule. Yet, as

elected representatives, they could not very well

oppose it. If they did, they would be exposed  to

the  public. They could not stand up and declare,

"We  shall  have none of it." That would  require

courage.   So   they  tried  to  side-track   and

attempted to cloud the real issue -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The Minister must

not  impute improper motives to a Member of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sorry, Sir. So much emphasis

was  therefore laid on the question of  Assistant

Ministers.  Charges  of  deceit  have  been  made

against  the  Chief  Minister. With  well-feigned

righteousness,  they  cried,  "Why  was  a  minor

matter  allowed  to develop into a constitutional

issue?" This was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



the method to confuse the House. It did not occur

to  them  that  a  major point of  principle  had

emerged,  as a result of the raising of  a  minor

matter. I shall now, therefore, put it in  simple

schoolboy  language, which perhaps  they  may  be

able to understand better -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. That is offensive

language. Will the Minister please withdraw that?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I shall

therefore  put  it in very simple  language.  The

Chief Minister has not made a mountain out  of  a

molehill;  rather not even expecting a  molehill,

he  discovered a mountain, and when this mountain

was   discovered,  it  became  the  duty   of   a

democratically  elected  representative  of   the

people's  House to put it before  the  House  for

their  views. This he tried to do by  putting  in

this motion in the true and humble spirit of  one

who  has  dedicated himself to the cause  of  the

people.  But was he appreciated? No.  Fears  were

expressed  that  he might turn  dictator.  I  say

shame, Sir. What a sad mutilation of facts!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Progressives tried last Friday to amend

the  motion so that it would appear to the people

that  they supported the principle of the motion.

Yet  by  deleting the last portion of the motion,

they could then have the motion put on paper only

as  an ideal that would remain on paper and which

could  not  be  put  into practice.  That  is  in

keeping  with  many of the ideals that  they  had

told  the  public  often  during  their  election

campaigns.    There   is    one    ideal    about

Malayanisation, which was accepted by  them  long

ago, but  it  is  on paper and has  remained  on

paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now when they found themselves cornered,

they have taken to the word "Progressive" with  a

vengeance,  and  progress has  been  achieved  by

leaps  and bounds during the week-end,  and  from

the  wailings and moanings about powers that  may

be taken away from the Governor, they have jumped

to  an  ideal of independence and later  accepted

self-government. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not, for

one moment, think that the people of this country

can be fooled by such tactics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have the privilege of supporting the Chief

Minister's motion which, in my opinion, truly

represents the expression of the political

sentiments of the vast majority of the people of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing this motion, however, I am guided

by one brave principle and that is, what is right

and  not  who  is right. To me, Sir,  the  entire

Order  in  Council  is  inadequate  to  run   the

government  in the interests of the people.  Many

of  its sections do not represent the true spirit

of    the    recommendations   of   the    Rendel

Constitutional Commission. I shall  try  to  give

you, Sir, a special instance. Paragraph 68 of the

Rendel Constitution Report states as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We recommend that the method of appointment of

the  six  Elected Ministers, and  of  any  junior

Ministers,    should    closely    follow     the

constitutional practice in the United Kingdom and

should  be  as  follows. On  the  result  of  the

election  being known, the Leader of the  largest

Party or Party group in the Assembly would become

the  "Leader  of the House", and  as  such  would

exercise  many  of  the  functions  which   would

normally devolve on a Prime Minister in  a  fully

self-governing  State. The Leader  of  the  House

would  then be asked by the Governor,  with  whom

the   power  of  appointment  and  dismissal   of

Ministers must necessarily lie, to submit a  list

of  names,  including his own  name,  of  Elected

Members  of  his  Party (or of any  coalition  of

Parties  which  might  be formed  to  secure  the

necessary majority in the Assembly) to  fill  the

six  Ministerial posts and the one or more junior

Ministerial  posts referred to above.  This  list

might,  if  necessary,  include  the  name  of   a

Nominated  Unofficial  Member  as  suggested   in

paragraph  61  above.  Unless  there  were   some

consideration which in the view of  the  Governor

seemed    likely   to   render   any   particular

appointment contrary to the public interest,  the

Governor   would  then  appoint  the   candidates

proposed to the six Ministries and to the  junior

Ministerial post or posts concerned."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a definite suggestion in the

Rendel Constitution recommendations to model  the

Singapore   Constitution  on  the  constitutional

practice   of  the  United  Kingdom,   the   only

exception being as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless there were some consideration which in

the  view of the Governor seemed likely to render

any particular appointment contrary to the public

interest, the Governor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



would then appoint the candidates proposed  to

the  six Ministries and to the junior Ministerial

post or posts concerned."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having elevated the position of the Chief

Minister,  in  the  exercise  of  many   of   his

functions, to the one that would normally devolve

on  the  Prime Minister of a fully self-governing

State,  it  would seem to me that  the  Order  in

Council  expects him to perform  the  duty  as  a

feudal vassal in a feudal court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the declaration of Her Majesty's Government

on  the future of the country appears to be  very

flexible against a rigid Order in Council - gradual

self-government  for Singapore and  Malaya.  Only

misguided   politicians   will   entertain    the

truthfulness of this kind of self-government.  We

have  heard  a similar declaration in respect  of

India  a  few  years ago, and let us examine  how

gradual self-government worked in India. In 1917,

the   United  Kingdom  Government  declared   the

objective  of  its future policy  towards  India.

This was the increasing association of Indians in

every  branch  of  the  administration  and   the

gradual     development     of     self-governing

institutions  with  a  view  to  the  progressive

realisation of responsible government in India as

an  integral  part  of  the  British  Empire.  In

pursuance  of this policy, the Montague-Chelmford

Report made recommendations for the setting up of

new  institutions  in the provinces  and  at  the

centre,  and these were, to a very large  extent,

implemented  in the Government of  India  Act  of

1919,   which   considerably   increased   Indian

participation  in the government.  The  franchise

was  widened,  the  provincial legislatures  were

enlarged,  and  the  principle  of  diarchy   was

introduced.  Under  this  system,  Sir,  in   the

provincial government a number of portfolios were

held  by  Ministers  who sat  in  the  Governor's

Executive  Council, but were responsible  to  the

Legislature,  while  other  portfolios  including

finance,  law and order were dealt  with  by  the

officials who were also members of the provincial

Governor's    Executive   Council,    but    were

responsible  to  the Governor and,  in  the  last

resort,  to the Government of the United  Kingdom

and not to the Legislature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the situation in Singapore today is like

that which existed in India thirty-six years ago.

The  promise of gradual self-government to  India

in 1919 meant continual domination by the British

Government  up  to  1947  when  independence  was

realised  by India - twenty-eight years  after  the

United  Kingdom  declared their policy.  Sir,  if

that  is  the  sort  of slow self-government  for

Singapore,  I  am  really  sad.  The  people   of

Singapore, especially the freedom-loving  people,

would  expect a further and clearer statement  of

policy  on self-government from the Secretary  of

State  for  the  Colonies  when  he  arrives   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House today is a very

timely  reminder  to  the  Malayan  people   that

independence  is  not just a  ready-made  product

that will be imported into this country tax-free.

It should be won by the people by struggle and at

the  expense  of great sacrifice.  Let  us  today

reiterate   our  determination  to   pursue   our

struggle. Let the people remember this day  as  a

red-letter day in the history of our struggle for

constitutional  reform and  right.  Let  us  also

ignore the lone voice of a few reactionaries  who

are    trying   to   enslave   our   people    by

misrepresentation of our political  goal.  If  we

are  true  and sincere to ourselves  and  to  our

people, I am sure we will achieve our goal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  after  hearing  the  speech  made  by   Mr

Sutherland, champion for the British expatriates,

I  was  reminded of a conversation I had  with  a

European  friend of mine who was  connected  with

the rubber tyre industry. I asked him one day why

he  did not advise his company to start a factory

in Malaya instead of sending the raw materials to

England,  eight thousand miles away. "Do  not  be

stupid,"  he said, "our tyres can still  sell  in

Malaya, can they not? If that is so, what is  the

point  in  establishing a factory in Malaya?  The

rubber  is  being shipped to England  in  British

ships, insured with British companies, handled by

British  workmen on the other side,  manufactured

by  British  factories and  gives  employment  to

British workmen. If there is any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



profit to be made, do you not think we would like

to  make  it? If there is any starvation,  it  is

better  to  be  your brothers  and  sisters  than

ours." This must be the reason in the mind of Mr

Sutherland when he spoke so strongly against  the

motion  on Friday last, because, as he  said,  he

represents   the   interests   of   the   British

expatriates,   and  as  long   as   the   British

expatriates' interests are well looked after, the

people of Singapore can go to hell -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wong - [Interruption.] Can I have

some  order,  please. I do  not  think  the  word

"hell" can be considered as parliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I am sorry, Sir. Today, we are

faced with what is virtually a test case. Are we,

as  Ministers and elected representatives of  the

people,  going to have a real say in the  affairs

of    Singapore?   True,   the    Governor    has

discretionary powers, but does that mean  we  are

to  be  little children over whose decisions  the

Governor   can  over-ride  us  as   he   pleases?

Doubtless,  he  has the welfare of  Singapore  at

heart, but so has everyone else in this Assembly.

We,  as Assemblymen, do not seek the approval  of

the Governor only, but we have the well-being  of

the public in mind in whatever decisions we make.

Otherwise, we are the elected representatives  of

the  people in name only, in which case one  sees

no  point  in being an Assemblyman.  If,  on  the

other   hand,   we  are  to  be   considered   as

responsible men, then our word should carry  full

weight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are fighting over the principle of the

matter. If we are baulked or likely to be baulked

at  every stage in any decision we may make, then

the  Order  in Council is interpreted  in  a  way

definitely   not  as  expected  of  the   British

Government. When a matter is at issue, it  should

be  settled in the Assembly. Once that  stage  is

passed,  there should be no hindrance,  unless  a

decision is outside our power. If a decision made

is wrong, then those who form the Government will

have  to  answer for it. Are we to cater for  the

wishes   of   the  Governor,  or   are   we,   as

Assemblymen,   elected   by   the   people    and

responsible to the people?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his installation, not long ago, the Governor said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The principal instrument of policy is now the

Council   of  Ministers;  the  Governor  acts   in

accordance  with  the Council's  advice,  and  the

successful  functioning of the Constitution  is  a

burden which falls directly on the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, there are people who still do not

understand adequately what is meant by the Council

of  Ministers  responsible to a popularly  elected

Legislature.  The  effect of its  introduction  in

Singapore  has  been  the transfer  of  power  and

responsibility from an external authority  to  the

authority of the people themselves. If, therefore,

the  people, or a section of the people,  obstruct

or frustrate the acts of the Government, then they

are  challenging  what is no  longer  an  external

authority, but the authority for which  they  gave

the mandate at the recent elections."



<br><br>We  take  it  that  these  words  were  spoken  in

sincerity and that they should be acted upon.  The

Alliance  has  been  fighting for  self-government

since  its inception, and will continue  to  fight

for it until the evil of colonialism is completely

eradicated out of this territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all those hon. Members of this House who

have  the  interests and confidence of  the  local

people  at heart will support this motion, as  one

of them may be the next Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the motion that was

proposed  by  the Member for Paya  Lebar  for  the

Progressive side has taken me rather by  surprise.

On  further considering the matter, I  am  of  the

opinion that it rather clouds the original  motion

standing  in  the name of the Chief Minister.  The

intention  of the motion of the Chief Minister  is

that  you.  Sir,  do convey to His Excellency  the

Governor  the view of the House and  that  you  do

report  back  to the House the reply  you  receive

from His Excellency. The amended amendment to  the

motion  does  not, in fact, permit His  Excellency

the  Governor  to  make  any  reply,  because   it

directly concerns the Secretary of State  for  the

Colonies, and for that reason, Sir, I do propose a

further amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at the end of the new paragraph between

paragraphs  3  and 4 of the original motion  these

words be added:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and that such view be conveyed by His

of State for the Colonies."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will appreciate, Sir, and I am sure the hon.

Members  of this House will appreciate, that  that

is a matter upon which His Excellency cannot reply

and is a matter which only the Secretary' of State

for the Colonies can give effect to.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this has

been a very heartening debate. I am conscious  of

my personal failings, one of which is that when I

am  attacked,  I react immediately by  trying  to

attack  twice  as hard. In that  way  I  make  no

friends,  and  I  appreciate I  have  made  many

enemies  on the opposite Benches. It was my  duty

as  a Malayan to appeal for an impersonal, for  a

national  view of the problem, and  I  am  deeply

grateful,  Sir, that the P.A.P. has responded  in

so   magnificent   a  manner,  transcending   our

personal  animosities and coming clearly shoulder

to  shoulder with me in the struggle in the  name

of  the  people of this country. I am  also  very

appreciative  of what, if I may be  permitted  to

say  so, I consider to have been one of the  most

statesmanlike speeches delivered in  this  House,

the   speech  delivered  by  the  leader  of  the

Democratic  Party (Mr William Tan). It  may  not

have   been  enlightening  to  people   who   are

Malayans, but I know that the debates which  took

place here on Friday and today have been an  eye-opener to Mr Sutherland and his ilk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that I went to England in the

dreadful time of November, suffering its cold and

its  damp  and influenza virus, because  at  that

time   I   said  it  was  vital  that  we  should

counteract  the  propaganda  of  the  Progressive

Party,  which  has convinced Whitehall  that  the

people   of   this  colony  do  not  want   self-government,  and  I was going  to  seek  to  make

contacts  and do the little bit I could.  It  was

only a little bit, Sir, but I think what was said

on  Friday and today should convince all,  except

those  who are intentionally blind, of our  deep,

earnest  and  urgent desire for  self-government.

The  Governor  has appointed, Sir, the  gentleman

for Tanglin Club by name. Mr Sutherland - although

I  appealed to Malayans as a Malayan - saw fit, at

the earliest opportunity, the moment the question

was  put, to intervene in this debate. He has the

legal  right.  He  saw fit to intervene,  and  he

proceeded by stating that the first paragraph was

self-evident - of course, Singapore  wanted  self-government - and he promptly proceeded to  tell  us

that his many Asian friends had told him that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



really  nobody  wanted self-government.  That  is

known  as  commercial logic, Sir, the logic  that

makes a faith, a religion, a way of life based on

the  motto  "Heads  I win, tails  you  lose."  He

suggested that before we run we should crawl -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Walk!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He said, "crawl".



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Crawl before walk, not run. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In one of the most

unfortunate speeches I have heard in  this  House,

and,  with respect, Sir, to the Standing  Orders,

one which reflects no credit to the community  in

whose  name  it  is  made, the  hon.  Member  has

suggested that we should crawl before we walk.  I

would like to say this to him, Sir: Before he and

his ilk get us to crawl again, neither he nor the

Tanglin  Club, for which he stands, nor  anything

for which it stands, will ever exist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> On a point of order, Sir. What

does  he mean by a "member of Tanglin Club"? That

is  a  very extraordinary thing to say!  Could  I

have that withdrawn, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Are you ashamed of the Tanglin

Club? -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Mr Chief Minister,

objection   has  been  taken  to  the  expression

"Member of Tanglin Club". [Interruption.] I  will

not  have  any  frivolity. I ask you,  Mr  Chief

Minister,  to withdraw that expression  as  being

offensive.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Sir, the

Europeans. What I say stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we then have had the hon. Mr. Ong Piah

Teng.  For  one frightening moment, I thought  he

was  going to follow the commercial logic of  his

colleague  in  the banking world. I  am  glad  he

stood  up and spoke as a man of honour and  as  a

Malayan, and I salute him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is only a simple question involved

in this debate - whether the constitution should be

constitutionally interpreted, no more,  no  less.

Even His



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



Excellency,  in  his message, never  suggested  that  an

amendment was necessary. All that he says is that what I

ask  of him is tantamount to an amendment, but, in point

of  fact, there is no need for any amendment at  all  of

the constitution. I merely ask that it be interpreted in

a  spirit  of  goodwill,  in a spirit  that  takes  into

account the needs of the people and seeks to meet  those

needs in a proper fashion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Stamford (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy) put it

somewhat neatly when he said that I did not come here to

make  a  mountain  out  of  a  molehill,  but  not  even

expecting  a  molehill,  I suddenly  found  myself  slap

against a mountain. It is not just section 32. There are

many  other  sections  in  this constitution  where  the

Governor  has to consult me, and the whole thing  meshes

with  this  very important issue: are we  to  have  self-government as rapidly as we are capable of achieving it,

or are we going to have an interpretation which seeks to

hinder, obstruct and delay self-government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in this House twenty-eight Malayans. I am

going  to ask for a division, Sir, whatever we voice.  I

should like on this occasion, perhaps the first historic

debate  of  this Assembly, that we should stand  and  be

counted on the record for ever. As a Malayan, it  is  my

hope  that,  irrespective  of personal  animosities  and

antagonisms, irrespective of party politics, we will all

stand  together in this assertion of our need for  self-government,  for the transfer of powers  in  an  orderly

manner   to   the  people,  and  for  an  interpretation

compatible with the most rapid self-government possible.

I  say to you fellow Malayans in this House that it  is

my  hope, it will be my privilege to stand side by  side

with whomsoever wishes to stand by me. I will disdain no

vote. I will look down upon no man, however much he  may

dislike me, who comes to the assistance of the people of

this  country  today in supporting  a  motion  that  has

nothing  personal, nothing political, and nothing  party

about  it. It is a motion that speaks for the people.  I

want twenty-eight voices raised in a solid solemn "Aye"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Speaker do convey to His Excellency the

Governor  the  view  of this House that  the  people  of

Singapore are determined to end colonialism and to  rule

themselves through their elected representatives;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that as a demonstration of the good faith of Her

Majesty's Government in its oft-repeated promise  to  the

people  of  Malaya that they would grant self-government

at  the  earliest  possible  moment,  the  most  liberal

construction  legally  permissible  in  favour  of   the

elected   representatives   of   the   people   it   the

interpretation of the Singapore Colony Order in Council,

1955, should be adopted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that where the Governor is required by the

provisions of the said Order in Council to consult  with

the  Chief Minister before taking any action, he  should

act in accordance with such advice;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that in the opinion of this House the time has

arrived  for a transfer of power from the Government  of

the  United Kingdom to the people of Singapore,  that  a

new Constitution providing for self-government should be

granted  immediately, and that such view be conveyed  by

His  Excellency the Governor to Her Majesty's  Secretary

of State for the Colonies;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the Speaker do report back to this

House   on   the  reply  he  receives  from   His

Excellency the Governor to this message, and that

thereafter this Assembly do take such  action  on

motions  without notice as the circumstances  may

require.

His  Excellency has been pleased to grant  me  an

audience  at  half-past two today.  My  power  of

suspending the sitting is only limited  to  three

hours.  That would take us to 3.15 p.m. I do  not

think  there is time for a message to be received

from  His  Excellency between half-past  two  and

3.15. Would a Minister move that we adjourn, say,

until  about 3.45 or 4, if it is the wish of  the

sitting  that  that should be so?  On  the  other

hand,  hon. Members may think that I could report

back  tomorrow  morning. I leave it  entirely  to

this  House to consider the Question.  "That  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this purpose, I am quite willing, naturally,

to  take  the  feelings  of  the  House  entirely

freely. I am prepared to change my mind, but  the

way  I see things is that we may wish to consider

the  message received from His Excellency  before

we  proceed with the last part of the motion, and

it  would  give us time if, after the message  is

delivered, we were then to adjourn till  tomorrow

morning,  Sir. It would give us time to  consider

the  necessary  action; whereas  if  we  were  to

adjourn  now till tomorrow morning, we  might  be

taken by surprise by some aspects of the message,

and we might not be quite prepared for the issues

that might be indicated. In the circumstances,  I

would  respectfully suggest that it is preferable

that  the message be delivered to us at 3.45 p.m.

today, if possible. Sir.

<div align="center"><b>(Letter from the Governor)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was received in audience by His

Excellency at 2.30 p.m. today, and I conveyed  to

His Excellency the terms of the Resolution passed

by the Assembly this morning by handing to him  a

certified   copy   of   the   Resolution.   After

consideration of the terms of the Resolution, His

Excellency addressed a letter to me, which I have

his  permission to read to the Assembly. This  is

the letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This afternoon you delivered to me personally a

certified  copy of the Resolution passed  by  the

Legislative Assembly today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



You have asked me to place you in a position  to

report  back  to the Assembly my  reply  to  the

views expressed in that Resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read its terms, I explained to you

verbally  that the Resolution as passed  by  the Assembly  today has assumed a significance  much

more far-reaching than in its original terms and

that,  in these circumstances, I must have  time

to  study its implications before I can ask  you

to convey a reply to the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart, however, from consideration of the

implications  of the Resolution,  I  can  assure Honourable Members of the Assembly that  I  will

faithfully communicate to the Secretary of State

the terms of the Resolution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is accordingly, at the moment, no reply

from  His Excellency the Governor to the  message

of  the Assembly which I can report back to this

House and, consequently, nothing further can  be

done   in  the  matter  today.  Will  a  Minister

therefore propose that the Assembly do adjourn?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

some difficulty in understanding the message, and

with  respect,  before we do  adjourn,  I  should

like, if possible, to clarify the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original terms of the motion have in no way

been  extended  except  by  that  amendment.  The

purpose  of that amendment was merely  to  convey

the  expression of certain views to Her Majesty's

Secretary  of  State for the  Colonies.  That  is

separate - a  completely different issue  from  the

immediate  issue  of  the interpretation  of  the

powers of the Governor and the interpretation  of

the constitution in a manner that is adequate for

the requirements of the people. Sir, I would like

to  understand from you whether His Excellency is

conscious   of  the  distinction  between   those

paragraphs,  and  whether  there  has  been   any

conversation on that aspect.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, I am afraid I

cannot give you any further information than what

is  contained  in this letter. The terms  of  the

Resolution  were read, I might say, with  anxiety

by  His  Excellency, and the  impression  I  have

received  is that he has taken the terms  of  the

Resolution as a whole and he wishes for time  to

study



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



that  Resolution.  I  do  not  think  any  useful

purpose   can   be  served  by  continuing   this

discussion. I do ask a Minister to move that  the

Assembly do adjourn. May I have that, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am entirely in your hands if  you

desire an adjournment, but I am in a very unhappy

position,  Sir, and I think it is only fair  that

we should have a moment or two to deliberate that

message before we do adjourn. There seems  to  be

no  indication when His Excellency may  be  in  a

position  to give us a reply, and there seems  to

be  a  confusion between the immediate issue  and

the  issue of self-government. I do not know  if

you  are  in  a  position, Sir, to  give  us  any

indication as to how that position can be met.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir may I, with

respect, suggest that this House be suspended for

five minutes to allow Members of the Assembly  to

consider  the  changed position? As I  understand

it, Mr Speaker, Sir, you would wish the House to

adjourn, in which case we will probably  have  to

adjourn  till  ten o'clock tomorrow morning.  The

Chief  Minister is not anxious to take this  step

without   consultation   with   his   colleagues.

Perhaps,  if  you  would  be  kind  enough,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, to allow the Chief Minister  a  few

minutes  to consult his colleagues on the matter,

he might have less hesitation.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am just interpreting the

Resolution which hon. Members passed. That is the

last paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the Speaker do report back to this

House   on   the  reply  he  receives  from   His

Excellency the Governor to this message, and that

thereafter this Assembly do take such  action  on

motions  without notice as the circumstances  may

require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position then, hon. Members, is that there

is  no reply to the message whatsoever before the

House.  Therefore, strictly in  terms  with  that

motion,  there is nothing further to be  done.  I

wish to be persuaded. Can I be persuaded?

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it may please you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I take it this way, that if  we

do  adjourn till tomorrow morning, this could  be

the  first subject to he debated tomorrow - on  the

final  aspect  of it. Sir, this  is  a  reply  of

sorts. It is a reply which says that he is in  no

position to give an indication yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will read the letter to you

again,  if  you  like.  I will  read  the  second

paragraph  which  seems quite clear.  The  second

paragraph of the letter addressed to me reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I read its terms, I explained to you

verbally  that  the Resolution as passed  by  the

Assembly  today  has  assumed a significance  much

more far-reaching than in its original terms  and

that, in these circumstances, I must have time to

study  its implications before I can ask  you  to

convey a reply to the Assembly."



<br><br>The  position is that this is not a reply to  the

Resolution.  So  there  is  nothing   to   debate

tomorrow, as far as I can see. I can assure  hon.

Members, of course, that His Excellency  will  be

giving this his attention as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, it seems that there is

nothing  that can be done except to  take  it  up

tomorrow,  but  I am loath to do that  unless  I,

with  respect, Sir, receive some indication  from

you  that we may continue consideration  of  that

letter tomorrow as the first business of the day.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, strictly this

is not the message. This is a letter addressed to

Mr Speaker, and I have had the permission of His

Excellency to read it to the hon. Members.  So  I

do  not see how we can initiate a debate on  this

letter.  It is a bit difficult, I know, but  that

is the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If that is so, Sir, it may

not  be that the House may wish, but in the light

of the comment contained in that second paragraph

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>

seems  to  confuse  the issue of  self-government

with  the immediate issue, it may well wish, Sir,

to  seek  to  send  you on a further  mission  of

clarification  and  no more  and  that  can  come

within the terms of the original motion. That  is

what  is in my mind at the present moment in  the

light of this letter.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, I do feel that

a  matter  of  this nature it needs very  careful

consideration, and I do not think that  it  would

be quite fair to His Excellency to rush him for a

reply in this matter. He has, as I said, read the

terms  of  the Resolution as a whole, rightly  or

wrongly,  and he wishes for time to consider  the

whole  matter very, very carefully, and  I  think

hon.  Members  are entitled to have very  careful

attention   paid   by  His  Excellency   to   the

Resolution.
