<div align="center"><b>HOUSING BOARD FLATS USE OF VOID DECKS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for National

Development  and Communications if he will ask the  Housing

and  Development  Board to consider reducing  by  half  the

present  high rental for the use of void decks  charged  to

residents  of  purchased  blocks and  exempting  Residents'

Block Committees from payment of the rental when decks  are

used for residents' functions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Haji Sha'ari.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present rental of

$50  per day for the use of void decks is applicable to all

residents in the housing estates and not just to  those  in

purchased blocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rental is levied by the Board to cover the costs of

three cleaners, a supervising mandore to clean up the space

after  its  use, inspectors to check the condition  of  the

space before and after its use, and the need











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



for periodic repairs and colour washings of the areas as  a

result of continuous intensive use of the space. It is also

to  cover the electricity supply and, in the case of  newer

blocks. water supply from the standpipes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rental of $50 is reasonable as compared to the rentals

charged  by  other organisations like St. John's Ambulance.

People's  Association and Fraser and Neave for the  use  of

social function halls which normally range between $100 and

$160 per day, between stipulated hours for each occasion



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, it is not recommended that the present

rental of $50 for the use of void decks be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate must also be applied uniformly to residents as

well   as   non-governmental  associations  including   the

Residents'  Block  Committees, as any departure  from  this

practice would give rise to complaints of unequal treatment

and favouritism

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no plan to set

up  a  post  office in Neighbourhood I of Bedok  New  Town.

However,  a  post office will be established in  the  Bedok

Town Centre which is adjacent to Neighbourhood I. This post

office  will serve the whole of Bedok New Town and will  be

ready  in  early 1978. In the meantime, there is  a  mobile

post  office providing temporary services from 9.00 am. to 12.30  p.m.,

Mondays to Saturdays, at the car park at Bedok

Plain in Neighbourhood I.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

supplementary question. Judging by the number of  questions

raised by a number of hon Members these two days, it  would

seem  to me that there is no comprehensive planning of  the

provision  of  basic facilities and amenities  in  the  new

housing  estates. Would the hon. Minister of  State  please

inform  the  House  as to what sort of coordination  exists

between the Housing and Development Board and all the other

Ministries?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my reply to some of

the  observations made by hon. Members, in  particular  the

arrangements  between the Singapore  Bus  Service  and  the

Housing  and  Development Board, I indicated  that  in  the

planning  of  new  estates the HDB  does  consult  the  bus

authority.  But for more detailed planning,  especially  of

providing bus services to the new estates, a lot depends on

when the residents have moved into a particular area. As to

exactly  where  the bus routes are going  to  be,  it  will

depend  on the actual situation of resident-occupancy  when

it is nearer the period of completion. I have also informed

Members  of  this House that the HDB and  the  SBS  have  a

planning committee which is looking into this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the general planning of HDB estates. I can assure

Members  here that in the overall planning of a new estate.

for example, the Bedok New Town. either Neighbourhood I  or

II. all the necessary main infrastructure is











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>





planned  well  in  advance,  For  instance,  the  necessary

requirements   for  sewerage,  social amenities,   public

utilities and major roads, are all planned ahead  of  time.

But    the   more   detailed   requirements   within    the

Neighbourhood, such as in Bedok New Town Neighbourhood  II.

will have to be done nearer the period of completion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In this case. Mr Speaker, Sir, would not

the Ministry of National Development look into the question

of  providing  other  social services,  such  as  community

centres,  post office, and related services which cater  to

the  needs  of  the residents more than just  bus  services

only?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

said that the provision of bus services will be included in

the  more detailed arrangements between the HDB and the SBS

when the period of residential occupation is nearer to full

completion. But I do assure Members that as far as  overall

planning  of a particular estate is concerned; roads,  post

office.  including a library, are standing instruction  for

HDB architects to incorporate them in all new estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's suggestion for the provision

of community centres, there is a thinking whether community

centres should be incorporated as a standard requirement in

all HOB estates. I think that is left to be discussed.

<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I deal with the

various points raised by hon. Members in this House, let me

recall  the lament of the British Prime Minister which  was

referred  to in the President's Address and which  our  own

Prime  Minister  reiterated yesterday.  The  British  Prime

Minister  was  said to have lamented that the most  hateful

slogan  he has ever heard was made at the protest march  of

Marxist infiltrators of his Labour Party:

"What  do we want? Everything. When do we want it? Now!"  I

cannot  agree  with him more, Sir, that this is  lamentable

not only because the demand was unreasonable and impossible

to  meet but also because this is happening to a once-great

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of the analogical example of the sniffers

of  roses  once  quoted  by our hon. Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs. The sniffer of roses, upon discovering that a rose

smells  better than a cabbage or onion, concludes  that  it

will  make better soup. He therefore demands the soup while

sniffing at the roses. On the other hand, the soup maker or

the so-called "establishment" unfortunately has to get down

to  the  more  exacting  job of producing  the  soup  which

normally  falls short of expectation of the rose sniffers.

Sometimes they may not even meet the taste of every  Member

in  this House. Sir, I am not for a moment suggesting  that

the hon. Members on the other side of this House or on this

side  of  the House are sniffers of roses. I have  not  the

slightest intention of implying so. Sir. I happen  to  know

that  they are no roses, notwithstanding the fact that  100

flowers are allowed to blossom in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And to be chopped off!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> I was only trying to illustrate how

difficult it is sometimes for reasons to prevail when faced

with  such  an impatient and recalcitrant lot  who  demands

nothing   less   but  the  out-of-this-world   fantasy   of

"everything now!" Well, Rome was not built in one day. Sir.

No  great  nation  was  ever built  in  one  day.  Whatever

brilliant plan for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



development  we  may  have, it must  be  accompanied  by  a

practical  programme of implementation. The  critical  path

must  be  clearly  defined and the order  of  priority  put

right.  Confucius,  in  his opening chapter  of  The  Great

Learning said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every entity has its origin and termination, Every event

has its beginning and ending. To know the sequence thereof

and the order of priority, is to be near Tao (the way).'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of my learned colleagues on the other side

of  the  House, especially the Member for Katong.  it  goes

like this in Chinese: <i>Wu you ben mo, shi you shi zhong,

zhi suo xian hou, ze jin dao yi</i>.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I do not understand this!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Well, those hon. Members who do not

understand this are recommended to read the book. It is  in

the opening chapter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this note, Sir, I shall now reply to the various

points raised by the hon. Members. First of all, the  hon. Members  for  Telok Blangah and Punggol are unhappy  about

the  inadequate bus service in new towns and  new  housing

estates.  They suspected that this was due to  a  lack  of

liaison and coordination between the Singapore Bus Service

and the Housing and Development Board. But as my colleague -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification if the

hon. Minister of State will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong, are you prepared to give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Yes [and resumed his seat].



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I did not say that the residents are

unhappy.  What  I  said was that there  should  be  overall

planning so as to provide bus services to the residents  of

the  new  towns, because public transportation is a natural

expectation  of the residents. Surely, when  the  residents

move in, bus services must naturally follow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the answer to the query is: there

actually  is.  The SBS is, in fact, liaising  very  closely

with  the HDB on this matter. When a new town is opened  up

and  people  begin moving in, bus services are provided  at

the  same  time,  The  level  of  services,  that  is.  the

frequency and types of services, increases as more and more

people move in. Good examples are Ang Mo Kio and Bedok  New

Town.  Telok  Blangah  New  Town  and  other  new  estates,

including  industrial  estates, will  have  more  and  more

services as they fill up. I have no doubt that in  view  of

what  I  said earlier, quoting Confucius. the hon.  Members

would  appreciate  that  it  is  not  always  possible   or

practicable to provide everything all at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each month, SBS adds 10 to 20 new buses to its fleet.

Therefore,  the  fleet is increasing, but these  new  buses

have  to  be  allocated to the various new  towns  and  new

estates. In other words, each new town or estate will  have

its fair share of bus services,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the request for improvement of the

transport services in the rural areas, made by the  Members

for  Bukit Panjang and for Punggol. I would like to  assure

them  that  the SBS, in its efforts to upgrade its  island-wide  services  will not overlook the requirements  of  the

rural areas,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has suggested that canteens and

toilets  for  bus  employees  should  be  set  up  at   bus

terminals. The SBS management is conscious of the  need  to

provide  proper facilities because they lead to an increase

of  moral  and  higher  efficiency of the  staff.  Wherever

practicable, toilets have been built and canteens  provided

even  to  the extent of building "bus canteens".  that  is,

converting  old  bus bodies into canteens  as  a  temporary

measure. Improvements, unfortunately have not been as rapid

as  the  management  would want to see,  for  a  number  of

reasons,  among  which are the unavailability  of  land  to

build  these facilities, uncertainty over long-term  status

of  the land, the temporary nature of some locations and so

on.   Where  the  long-term  status  of  the  terminal   is

determined  and  where land is available,  proper  terminal

facilities have been developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Paya Lebar International Airport, for example, a

new  terminal has been built and another one would soon  be

completed  at  Jurong, The SBS is now  making  a  concerted

effort   to  upgrade  all  sub-standard  terminals.   Since

September  last year. Sir, it has embarked  on  a  terminal

improvement programme. Various Government authorities, such

as  the  Registry of Vehicles, the Public Works  Department

and  the Housing and Development Board, are cooperating  to

improve and, where possible. to build proper terminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as with all limited resources, improvements cost

money  and,  therefore, would have to  be  carried  Out  in

stages over the next three to five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee has suggested that more women

should be employed by the SBS and trained to be bus drivers

and  conductors because they are not as impatient and  rude

as  men. I agree with his observation. With the recruitment

of  female  bus  conductors, the number  of  complaints  of

rudeness  from commuters has dropped and the bus conductors

are now more courteous in their work. The policy of the SBS

with  regard to recruitment since August 1974 has  been  to

engage women to work as bus conductors. Equal encouragement

has  also  been given to the recruitment of  women  as  bus

drivers. As a result of this policy almost one-third of the

bus conductors in the SBS now are women. The recruitment of

women   as  bus  drivers  has  been,  unfortunately,   less

successful.  The  staffing position  of  bus  crew  in  the

Company  as at 31st January this year is as follows.  There

is  a  total of 3,592 bus conductors and 3,737 bus drivers,

Of  these,  1,121  bus conductors and 34  bus  drivers  are

women.  Although the SBS has tried every means  to  attract

women to join the Company as bus conductors, the supply  is

tapering  off, with the result that men have to be employed

again as bus conductors so as to obtain a sufficient number

of  conductors to pair off with the bus drivers to meet the

immediate shortage. In spite of this move, the SBS is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



still making every effort to encourage women to be employed

as bus drivers and conductors,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now refer to the point raised by the Member for

Moulmein  on  whether  or not the  objective  of  the  Area

Licensing Scheme (ALS) would still be served by terminating

the  hours of restriction at 9.45 a.m. instead of 10.15 a.m. Hon.  Members will recall that when the ALS was  introduced

in June 1975 the hours of restriction were from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30  a.m. While the number of motor vehicles entering  the

Central  Business District (CBD) was substantially  reduced

during   those  hours  of  restriction,  traffic  increased

considerably after 9.30 a.m. giving rise to severe  traffic

congestion along the major roads on the fringe of  the  CBD

between  9.30 a.m. and 10.00 a.m. From August 1975 the  hours

of  restriction  were  extended  to  10.15  a.m.  This  had

effectively eliminated traffic congestion between 9.30  a.m. and  10.15 a.m. There was still, however, an upsurge in  the

volume  of traffic entering the CBD between 10.15  a.m.  and 10.45 a.m., but the congestion was of a reduced scale and of

short  duration. Observations of traffic conditions  up  to

the end of last year indicate that there has been a gradual

upward  creep  in  the post-10.15 a.m.  traffic  volume  in

recent  months.  Therefore, shortening  of  the  restricted

hours now would certainly result in a further deterioration

of  traffic  conditions  and the  need  again  for  further

restraint.  It would be prudent, therefore, to  retain  the

present hours of restraint, that is, from 7.30 a.m. to 10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah spoke on the lighterage trade

and  suggested  that  the breakwater at  Pasir  Panjang  be

extended  to  make the water there safer  for  lighters  to

operate. The PSA wants the lighterage trade to continue  as

it  supplements the normal cargo traffic. Because  of  this

the PSA is developing Pasir Panjang with a lighterage cargo

handling  and  mooring  area.  Before  completion  of   the

breakwater,  the waters at Pasir Panjang were quite  choppy

and not too conducive for the handling of cargo to and











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



from lighters. Since September last year when the two

arms of the breakwater costing almost $6 million were

completed, lighters could safely moor and operate  at

Pasir  Panjang.  The  PSA  is  in  contact  with  the

Singapore  Lighter Owner's Association  on  this  and

other  matters concerning lighterage.  and  they  are

presently  satisfied  with the  water  conditions  at

Pasir  Panjang.  In fact, since November  last  year.

with  the introduction of the reduced tariff and  the

completion of the breakwater at Pasir Panjang.  there

has  been  a  sharp increase in the lighterage  cargo

from  an  average  of 21,269 tonnes  per  month  from

January to October last year to an average of  67,483

tonnes  per month from November last year to  January

this  year.  To further promote the lighterage  trade

and  to allow for a lighterage operation at both  the

Eastern  and  Western Anchorages,  the  PSA  is  also

considering  providing  a lighter  mooring  area  for

about 60 lighters alongside the HDB reclaimed land at

Telok Aver Basin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also spoke on behalf

of  those  who were unsuccessful in their application

for PSA passes for entry into the PSA. The Member for

Telok Blangah may wish to take note of this. The  PSA

issues  more than 102,000 passes to port users  valid

as  at  end of last year. In a representative  survey

carried  out  last  year, out of a  total  number  of

13,507  applications  for  PSA  passes,  12,995  were

approved  outright. Upon appeal,  an  additional  187

were granted PSA passes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can be seen that there is actually only a

very  small  fraction of about  2.4%  of  the  total

applications not given passes to enter the  PSA  port

area.  The PSA has the responsibility to ensure  that

its premises are kept reasonably safe, and that entry

is  confined  to  those who have legitimate  business

with  the port. The port users must generally  be  of

acceptable  character  and  who  would  not  cause  a

nuisance  to  the  port in one  way  or  another  The

reputation  of  the PSA as a generally pilferage-free

port with good security has to be safeguarded and, as

such,  the  Authority cannot approve all applications

without proper screening.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, on a point of clarification. If I

recall correctly, the point raised was why did the

PSA disapprove applications for passes or withdraw

the passes issued merely on the basis of minor

criminal records committed a few years ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

mentioned earlier. about 187 cases were granted after

appeal. I have also mentioned earlier, the importance

of  protecting the image of the PSA as  a  pilferage-free  port.  If  we want to develop  Singapore  as  a

transhipment centre, as the Member for Marine  Parade

would  like  it to be. then we have to maintain  that

image.  Normally when goods or items are stolen  from

the  warehouse,  they would not be  discovered  until

months later when the cargoes reach their destination

overseas.   So  there  is  a  need  to   screen   all

applications. But each application upon appeal  would

be  given the opportunity of a further consideration,

and the applicants would be either granted a pass  or

otherwise depending on the merits of the application.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a

further point of clarification. Sir, I do not in  any

way suggest that the PSA should not screen applicants

for PSA passes. In fact, I had the happy occasion  of

getting  a very clear reply from the PSA stating  the

reasons why applications were rejected. The point  is

why  must  the PSA disapprove, first, on the strength

of  petty  crimes committed many years ago  and  only

awaits for the person to appeal. I had such cases  in

my constituency and, pending appeal, these people are

jobless. May I repeat, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  also  to

the  Minister, that I do not in any way suggest  that

the  PSA should be lax in its screening. In fact,  it

should  screen the applications in order to  maintain

its reputation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether  the Member wants me to reply to  his  point.

But if he has any problems here, I would suggest that

he  refers  them to me I cannot give him  a  definite

reply unless these specific cases are investigated.











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Marine Parade suggested that we should

strive to be a world transhipment centre and not just  rest

on  our  laurels as a regional warehousing and transhipment

centre. This is exactly what we are striving to be.  It  is

only  due  to  modesty  that  we  use  the  term  "regional

transhipment centre" instead of "world transhipment centre"

in the Addendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority is presently offering a

number  of  incentives to encourage cargo  transhipment  at

Singapore. Incentives are in the form of lower charges  for

stevedorage and wharf handling for conventional cargo.  For

containerised  cargo  the charge for  stevedorage  is  also

reduced by half from $200 to $100 per 20-foot container. In

addition,  for  both conventional and containerised  cargo,

free  storage up to 28 days is given as against the  normal

72  hours  free storage given for local cargo.  Cargo  from

conventional  vessels  to be transhipped  on  to  container

lines  are given a tariff incentive of $4 per tonne rebate.

These incentives have assisted Singapore's development as a

regional   transhipment  centre.   To   encourage   further

development    of    Singapore   as   an   intercontinental

transhipment  centre, particularly for cargo  from  Europe,

Mediterranean and Middle East to Australia and New Zealand,

the PSA is developing the inland container depot which will

provide  cheaper  storage for containers  both  loaded  and

empty. The ample space at the inland depot would also allow

for  cargo  consolidation and repacking which are sometimes

necessary   before  transhipment.  If  necessary,   further

incentives  in the form of tariff or other incentives  will

be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Alexandra has suggested that air cargo

charter  services  be allowed to operate out  of  Singapore

offering rates lower than regular scheduled airlines so  as

to  allow our export industries to transport their goods to

the  markets  at  lower cost. The hon. Member  is  probably

aware  that  freight  rates for air cargo  charters  are  a

matter   of   agreement  between  airline   operators   and

charterers or shippers. This agreed rate is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



determined  by market forces and is usually different  from

the  published rate for scheduled airlines. One of the main

aims  of Government is to develop Singapore as an air cargo

distribution  and  storage centre.  And  in  pursuing  this

objective.  Sir, the operation of both scheduled  and  non-scheduled  airlines, including air cargo charter  services,

will  be encouraged. We will strive to create an atmosphere

conducive  to  efficient airline operation by  streamlining

administrative procedure, reducing bureaucratic redtape and

providing   the  necessary  infrastructure  at  competitive

prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, several points have been raised by

hon.  Members  concerning the Ministry of Home  Affairs.  I

will now deal with them subject by subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on internal security. Sir, I am gratified to note

that  among  the  subjects  under  Home  Affairs,  internal

security was the subject which received the most attention.

All  those  who spoke on it agreed that the communists  are

and  will  remain  the main threat to Singapore's  internal

security.  Some  Members  rightly  stressed  the  need  for

vigilance not only on the part of the authorities but  also

amongst  our people. This is crucial because the communists

will   use  every  means  at  their  disposal  to   subvert

individuals and organisations and use them to advance their

cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve their objectives they will not hesitate to

employ every form of deceit and treachery, use violence and

commit  any  crime including murder. They  believe  in  the

philosophy  that the end justifies the means. They  operate

clandestinely through their underground network. When  they

have  ensnared sufficient numbers of open front leaders  in

mass  organisations to act as their proxies  above  ground,

then  they would launch what is known as a Communist United

Front  offensive and create strikes. riots and  instability

as in the 1950s and early 1960s in Singapore.











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs has taken great pains to

publicise  and expose their machinations after every  major

security operation. It is hoped that this would educate our

public  and  keep  them constantly on their  guard  against

attempts at subversion by the communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Khe Bong managed to draw laughter in

this  House  when  he spoke on internal security.  However.

there  are  one  or  two points that he  raised  which  are

serious  and  need to be replied to. He had suggested  that

internal  security measures taken are still inadequate  and

not  thorough enough. He referred to G. Raman and asked why

was it that he had not been arrested earlier since he was a

communist some time ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is that G. Raman did come to our security

notice  quite some time ago. But it is not necessarily  the

best  strategy of combating communist subversion by  making

an  immediate  arrest  once  a single  communist  has  been

identified. We should first try to identify his  associates

so  that  they also can be taken in. On this,  we  have  to

exercise  great care and thoroughness in our investigations

to   ensure  that  the  wrong  persons  are  not  detained.

Otherwise our action will be counterproductive.  I  do  not

think I should go further than this in my explanation  lest

we unwittingly give away information of our strategy to our

enemy. What I would like to emphasise here is that the real

test   of   the  effectiveness  of  our  Internal  Security

Department  is not whether communists and other  subversive

groups  continue  to  exist but  rather  whether  they  are

identified and dealt with before they can do any real harm.

On this, Sir, the records of ISO's achievements not only in

the  present  G  Raman's case but also  in  smashing  other

underground   communist  groups  and  network   speak   for

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Khe Bong has also suggested that

information be gathered from Government departments.  I  do

not  know exactly what he has in mind. But I would like  to

assure  him that no effort has been and will be  spared  to

gather information of security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



interest not only from Government departments, schools, but

also  elsewhere.  The ISD will continue  to  take  periodic

security action to pre-empt the communists underground  and

keep them on the run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Leng Kee, while stating that hardcore

communists  should  be severely dealt with,  has  suggested

that   students  and  youths  who  had  been  misled   into

supporting  the  communists should be  given  a  chance  to

correct themselves. In answer, may I just refer to  what  I

said  in a TV interview in the programme entitled "Year-End

Roundup 1976". And I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'in the security operations, the powers of detention under

the  internal  Security Act were used discriminately.  Only

the hardcore and those who refuse to recant their communist

involvement were issued with Orders of Detention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students who were released went back to their studies.

Those  who  had  superficial involvements  were  called  up

together  with their parents and warned of the  dangers  of

associations with communist subversives.'



<br><br>However,  this programme was broadcast during the midst  of

the  1976 General Elections, I am sure the Member for  Leng

Kee  was busy campaigning at that time and must have missed

the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to road safety I must confess that I am somewhat

disappointed  that only a few Members had any  comments  or

suggestions.  However, the Member for  Kallang  had  raised

some  points  which need to be answered. He criticised  the

proposal to change the law to put the onus on the driver of

a  larger vehicle to prove that he was not in the wrong  in

any  collision between a larger and a smaller  vehicle.  He

said  that it was an example of "legislative overkill".  He

contended  that  the  drivers  of  smaller  vehicles   like

motorcyclists and scooterists could be equally at fault. He

called for the problem to be tackled by other measures such

as  education. stricter enforcement. more severe punishment

for those found guilty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer, let me first put this proposal for change in

the  law  in its proper perspective. It is not an  isolated

proposal  but  it  is  part of a series  of  new  and  more

vigorous   measures  which  included  greater  efforts   in

educating road users in the highway code. culminating











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>





in  a  nationwide  "Road Safety For You" Campaign  in  June

1977.  This  will  be followed with vigorous  and  stricter

enforcement to cut down the carnage that is going on on our

roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Kallang says that

there  is  an "overkill". I agree that there is  "overkill"

but  not  in the proposal to change the law. The "overkill"

is  that  which lies on our roads. Nowadays it  is  not  an

unfamiliar  sight  to see dead bodies lying  on  our  roads

after a motor accident. We must put a stop to this by using

every  means  at our disposal. If the law is inadequate  to

meet the situation we must not shirk our responsibility  to

change  it  The  acid test of whether  a  law  is  good  or

adequate  is  whether it is effective in achieving  a  good

social  end. It should not be judged on the basis  of  some

preconceived hypothetical concepts of what is equitable  or

not.  The  crux  of the matter here is not discharging  the

burden  of  proof  in a court of law or  having  a  driving

licence  suspended, but the killing and  maiming  of  human

beings that must be prevented



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of the last three years the number of road

fatalities  hovered around 288 This means that  on  average

there were three deaths on the roads in every four days Are

the large and small vehicles equally responsible? The heavy

vehicles such as buses and trucks represented 6.7%  of  all

motorised vehicles registered in Singapore as at the end of

1976.  However.  they were involved in 35.5%  of  all  road

accidents Almost 30% of these accidents resulted in  death.

These  heavy  vehicles therefore had much more  than  their

share of accidents and fatal accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous cases of road fatalities in which the

offending driver cannot be charged in court or is acquitted

by  the court because there is no eye-witness. I would like

to mention two cases pertaining to a driver which will best

illustrate why the present proposal for change in  the  law

has been made The consequences of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



inadequacy of the law were indeed very tragic. In May  1969

a  motor  van  after  overtaking a scooter  from  the  left

callously  swerved into the scooterist's path  and  stopped

suddenly. The scooter could not stop or turn in time and as

a  result  of the collision the scooterist was killed.  The

driver  of  the van was charged in court but was  acquitted

because  there was no eye-witness. Thus the driver  of  the

larger vehicle escaped unhurt and unpunished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 3 1/2 years later in May 1972 the same driver, may I

repeat, the same driver, killed again. This time there  was

"overkill". The truck he was driving collided head-on  with

a  small car. wiping out four members of a family of  five,

including both father and mother who were in that  car  The

sole survivor of that unfortunate family was a 13-year  old

boy  who became an orphan Some hon Members will recall this

very tragic accident at Bartley Road which was published in

the  newspapers.  Fortunately there was an eye-witness  who

was  willing  to come forward to testify. The killer-driver

was  subsequently convicted in court and sentenced to  nine

months' imprisonment with 10 years of disqualification from

driving all classes of vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two cases illustrate clearly that the driver and

passengers in the vehicle of a lighter class are much  more

vulnerable  in  a  collision with a vehicle  of  a  heavier

class.  On  the  other  hand, the drivers  of  these  heavy

vehicles  like trucks. buses. oil tankers, timber  lorries,

mobile cranes and cement mixers, know that in any collision

with  a  smaller vehicle they will be quite safe  in  their

driver's  cabin a few feet from the ground. If  the  driver

and  passengers of the small vehicle are killed,  there  is

every  likelihood that he would get away scot-free if there

is   no  other  eyewitness  to  the  collision  No  wonder,

therefore,  that he suffers from the mentality that  "might

is  right" and having little courtesy and caring  less  for

other road users



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, unfortunately he is not around, in

supporting  the  sentiments expressed  by  the  Member  for

Kallang cited two hypothetical examples in which the











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



driver  of  the heavier vehicle would be unfairly penalised

under  the proposals to change the law. I am afraid he  has

not  completely  understood the changes proposed.  Let  me,

therefore,  hasten  to  assure  him  that  under  the   new

proposals  the  drivers  in his two  hypothetical  examples

would  not be penalised simply because they are not in  the

wrong.  If  the driver of the heavy vehicle is not  in  the

wrong,  he can easily rebut the presumption by telling  the

truth of what happened. The intention of the change is  not

to  put difficulties in the way of the driver of the  heavy

vehicle but to prevent him from getting away scot-free when

he is, in fact, in the wrong because there are no other eye

witnesses  to the collision except himself. With regard  to

the  proposal  to suspend the licence of the  driver  in  a

fatal  accident who is charged in court, let me  point  out

that  a  person  is charged in court for dangerous  driving

only when there is a prima facie case against him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make every effort to stop this senseless killing

and  maiming  on our roads by introducing more  discipline,

care  and courtesy among all our road users. This  will  be

done  in  the next three years by systematically  educating

our road users both young and old. and following it up with

tougher enforcement of the law. The law will be changed  if

they are found to be inadequate. Let me assure hon. Members

that the problem will be approached from all angles and  it

will  be dealt with as comprehensively as possible. It will

cover all road users. Not only bullies driving heavy trucks

and  buses  will be brought to book but also  mindless  and

reckless young scooterists, and motorcyclists who weave  in

and  out of traffic lanes and motorists who treat the roads

as race tracks will find themselves taken off the roads, by

having  their  licences suspended for their own  safety  as

well  as  of  others. To achieve this, the  Points  Demerit

System   will   be  revised  so  that  offences   such   as

inconsiderate, careless and dangerous driving  will,  carry

more penalty points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this systematic campaign has already started. A

series  of  mini campaigns through the press and  RTS  have

already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



commenced  by the traffic police since October  last  year.

Each  of  these  mini campaigns has a  theme  such  as  "No

Reckless  Overtaking",  "No Road  Hogging",  "Give  Way  to

Pedestrians", "Keep in Lane" and "How to Turn Right".  This

will  culminate  in a nationwide campaign  in  June  to  be

called  "Road Safety For You". There will be a Road  Safety

Exhibition  initially  at the Victoria  Memorial  Hall  and

subsequently at selected community centres. Publicity  will

be  given  through films and slides over  TV,  posters  and

other  material.  It  will  also cover  jaywalking.  School

children will be extensively involved in these campaigns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to another deadly business. drug

trafficking. The Member for Changi expressed the view  that

drug traffickers are not taking seriously the death penalty

which they must face if they are caught. He has asked  what

further  steps the Government intends to take against  drug

traffickers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the death penalty for drug

traffickers, nine have been sentenced to death. Another  30

persons  will face the death sentence if they are convicted

in the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full impact of the death penalty will only reach the

drug  traffickers when the first of their kind who has been

sentenced to death is actually hanged. This will take  some

time  because  of  the process of appeal  in  our  judicial

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime so long as there is a strong demand for

drugs   the  traffickers  will  still  find  the   business

attractive. The Government has worked out a new strategy to

hit  hard  at both the demand and supply sides of the  drug

problem.  The less specialised, more labour-intensive  work

of  rounding up drug abusers and drug addicts will  devolve

largely  on  the Police, the Special Constabulary  and  the

Vigilante  Corps.  The Central Narcotics Bureau  will  then

have  more  time  and  resources  to  concentrate  on  drug

traffickers   and  pushers.  The  CNB  has  established   a

Surveillance  Unit  with handpicked  officers  and  advance

radio communication equipment.









<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention at this stage that I will soon be

introducing amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act  to  give

the  necessary  powers to the enforcement agencies  and  to

remove  obstructions in dealing with drug abusers and  drug

addicts, Steps are being taken to convert some old quarters

into another Drug Rehabilitation Centre. As soon as this is

ready, "Operation Ferret" will be launched to round up drug

abusers  and  addicts on a large scale. This is  absolutely

necessary  if we are to prevent them from infecting  others

and spreading further the drug epidemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the subject of Citizenship. The Member for

Moulmein  has  called the Government to be  a  little  more

liberal in granting citizenship to more deserving cases who

are  holders of Singapore blue identity cards.  The  Member

for Kolam Ayer has called for a total review of citizenship

policy especially in respect of those holding blue identity

cards for more than 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent residents, especially if they are blue identity

card  holders and are the only members in their family  who

are   not   citizens,  are  already  being  given   special

consideration.  In 1976 this category accounted  for  about

40% of all the citizenships approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a review of citizenship policy, I wish to reassure

the  Member for Kolam Ayer that the criteria for  assessing

applications   are  reviewed  when  circumstances   change.

However, such reviews must be within the framework  of  the

tenets   which  have  been  stated  in  Parliament  before.

Briefly, these are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The granting of citizenship is not a right but a

privilege;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In considering applications for citizenship, the

economic and social problems of the Republic must be  taken

into account; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The main criterion is that every non-citizen who

becomes  a citizen must be an asset and not a liability  to

our Republic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first of all

express my gratification at the increasing economic content

of  the  speeches in this House. They come  not  only  from

leading  lights  of  the  academic, banking  and  insurance

professions in this House - we have always had, of  course,

the  benefit  of economic advice from established  Members,

such  as  my  colleague,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and

Minister of Defence, or the Member for Whampoa - but we now

have  also  among  our  numerate brethren  the  recent  and

obviously  highly stimulating additions to our  membership,

and  I  look forward to the contribution they will make  to

our  debates. However, even our non-economist Members  also

appear  to  have  become  more  economics-minded,   I   was

fascinated at the sitting two days ago by my colleague, the

Minister  for Social Affairs, and his facility  in  quoting

figures  analysing  the  cost of  the  public  subsidy  for

playing fields. and how much Government was paying for each

member  of  the small team of 11 soccer players  using  the

playing fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the business proper of answering the

questions or comments by Members. I have in my list some 20

matters for reply. They can be divided into two categories.

The  first  category  on  economic, industrial  sector  and

manpower planning which is of a general policy nature,  and

the  second, on the civil service establishment, budget and

tax  matters which are more on points of detail, and should

perhaps  be  more appropriately considered  in  the  Budget

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first category, the Member for Marine Parade

touched  on  the  economic growth rate, the  importance  of

export-led   growth   as  against  pump-priming   and   the

development of better labour statistics through  using  CPF

records.  The Member for Whampoa emphasised the  importance

of developing service industries, of trade diversification,

of  assistance  to  expansion of  existing  industries,  of

technical  supporting facilities to industry,  particularly

in











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



calibration.  The  Member for Sembawang was  interested  in

encouraging the consumption of local products. On  manpower

planning. the Member for Paya Lebar emphasised the need  to

ensure  adequate training by employers. The Member for  Nee

Soon  wanted  a  guarantee of employment for  graduates  of

institutions  of higher learning. The Member for  Alexandra

wished to encourage more female participation in the labour

force  by consulting women's organisations. And the  Member

for  Sembawang  wanted  to reduce the differential  between

professional  and  ordinary workers  in  order  to  correct

shortages  of workers and avoid employing foreign  workers.

This  is really the subject of income redistribution  which

is now in much high fashion amongst economists all over the

world.  So  the Member for Sembawang has really joined  the

list of economics-minded Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list is formidable. Before I answer them, I would like

to  begin  by first saying a word on economic planning.  We

started the first Plan in 1959 but rapidly-unfolding events

soon  overtook  this and other plans that we prepared.  The

basis  of our economic planning was upset when in  1963  we

became part of Malaysia, then in 1965 we had Separation. In

1967 we had the first intimation of the British rundown  of

the military bases. In 1969 we had the rundown accelerated.

In  1973  we  had the oil crisis. In 1974 we had  inflation

because of a 300% increase in rice prices. All these events

played  havoc with our four to five year plans. We may  now

have  come  back to more stable conditions. but it  is  too

much  to  hope, with the history of economic turbulence  we

have had. that this will last indefinitely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic plan therefore is what they call a rolling

plan  with  52 equations which we can revise at  will  with

changing  conditions. There is another plan.  The  Monetary

Authority  of Singapore has a slightly different  model  of

the economy with 22 equations which comes out with slightly

different projections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enable us, through the computer which speeds up the

calculations, to forecast



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



growth rates or requirements, for example in:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) real GDP as a whole. and in the various sectors of

manufacturing,  commerce, financial and  business  sources,

construction, transport, storage and communication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) real consumption expenditure as a whole, and by the

Government and private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) real fixed investments as a whole, and by the public

and private sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) exports as a whole, and broken down into goods and

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) imports, as a whole, and for goods and services, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the GDP deflator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must. of course, use the model and its projections

with some judgement. It depends on the data we feed in.  As

with all computer outputs, the quality varies. There is the

problem  of  what  they call GIGO or "Garbage  in.  Garbage

out."  If we feed in rubbish, we get rubbish. We are  still

testing  the  model and do not yet consider it sufficiently

satisfactory for publication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that cautionary note, perhaps I can now consider the

first  question. The Member for Marine Parade has commented

as follows: [col. 79]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Finance in his addendum to the

Presidential  Address  has  not  stated  whether  the  6-8%

expected  growth rate is real growth or growth in  monetary

terms.  I  presume  it is the former  Still.  it  would  be

interesting  to know what sort of inflation rate  has  been

allowed for.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question is that the 6-8% overall growth

rate  projected in my economic model refers to real growth.

Although it is difficult to project inflation rates for the

next few years. our model has assumed an inflation rate  of

5-6%  taking into account the average inflation rate of  7%

expected by the OECD countries over the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next suggestion was [col. 80]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not know whether the expected growth in the

country  will be export-led or generated mainly by domestic

pump-priming We know. however, that the











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>





Government  will  make  finance  for  exports  more  easily

available  .  .  Singapore has always  recorded  a  chronic

deficit in merchandise trade. This is not worrying  per  se

as we have no natural resources and must import most of the

things we need What is worrying, however. is the continuous

growth of the deficit.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the Member for Marine Parade is that in our

strategy  for growth in view of our open economy,  we  have

always  depended on exports as the source  of  growth.  Our

economy  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be  externally

oriented  not  only in trade but also in manufacturing  and

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also warned about our trade deficit growing.

Though  our  trade deficit has widened in  absolute  terms,

this is to be expected for a growing economy like Singapore

with no natural resources. However, this does not mean that

our  trade performance has not improved. Our trade  deficit

as  a  share of total exports has declined from 58% in 1970

to  38%  in 1976, Domestic exports now account for  58%  of

total  exports compared to 36% in 1968. Over the next  five

years,  my  Ministry  will continue to accord  priority  to

trade  development  demonstrating the  importance  we  will

continue  to  place  on  the development  of  the  external

sectors of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his remarks on pump-priming, it is true

that during the recession we took advantage of the slack to

step up construction activities, This was aimed at speeding

up the implementation of projects to provide Singapore with

the   infrastructure   to  enable   us   to   realise   the

opportunities with economic recovery. In future, we may not

be  able  to  keep up the same pace of construction  as  we

complete our various development programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He next suggested that labour turnover should be monitored

and  that the Central Provident Fund contribution is a good

source for labour statistics. I am pleased to say that  his

suggestion  to  use  CPF  data as  a  source  for  manpower

statistics  is already being adopted. Since 1974,  the  CPF

Board has collaborated with my Ministry to develop a series

of quarterly earnings and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



employment statistics tabulated by age, sex and  sector  of

activity,  in order to keep tab of employment  and  earning

changes,  The  cost  of obtaining the statistics  has  been

borne  by  the Government. CPF statistics have  been  found

useful   because   of   their   greater   timeliness    and

comprehensive  coverage. In addition,  labour  turnover  is

monitored  based on data collected in the bi-annual  Labour

Turnover Survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the comments by the Member for Whampoa, He

pointed  out  the  need  to  examine  the  feasibility   of

developing  other  service industries in  addition  to  the

development of manufacturing industries. I think the Member

for  Marine  Parade also spoke about warehousing  industry.

But  for  the  development of other service  industries.  I

would like to say that this has already been done. We  have

come  a  long  way  in developing our range  of  financial,

communications and tourism services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe there is good potential for Singapore to be

further   developed  into  a  centre   for   regional   and

international  warehousing  activities,  particularly   for

capital   goods   and   equipment,   The   Fiscal    Policy

Implementation Committee will consider appropriate measures

for  this, Further efforts would also be made to expand the

range  of  our financial services, The forward  market  for

foreign   exchange  will  be  developed  to  provide   more

facilities  for  trading  in  foreign  currencies.   Second

markets  in  fixed  interest securities  and  Asian  Dollar

Negotiable  Certificate of Deposits would also  be  further

encouraged. High priority would continue to be accorded  to

the  promotion of tourism, our traditional foreign exchange

earning sector. Greater attention will also be accorded  to

the promotion of convention business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa also commented on the need for

greater efforts in export promotion. I fully agree with his

comments  that  our manufacturers should  approach  markets

with  a  view  to their long-term development  rather  than

immediate  sales. Some manufacturers have stayed away  from

new markets when their first











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



contacts  did not bring about immediate results. For  those

who  have  made sustained efforts, my Ministry has provided

the  necessary support. To supplement the assistance  given

by  our  missions  in  overseas  capitals,  commercial  and

economic  secretaries have been posted to all  our  foreign

missions  in ASEAN countries. the United States, Japan  and

Germany.  More  commercial secretaries  would  be  sent  to

commercially important cities, with priority being given to

West  Asia.  With  increased  ASEAN  economic  cooperation,

greater  efforts will be made to increase the diversity  of

our  domestic  exports  to  the  region.  Export  promotion

requires  a joint effort by the private and public sectors,

and  my  Ministry  will continue to work closely  with  the

trade  and  manufacturing  bodies  in  Singapore  on  trade

missions,  participation in international trade  fairs  and

improve  upon  other  services to help develop  our  export

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has also spoken on the need to

assist   the  expansion  and  diversification  of  existing

industries. I agree with this. A wide range of services has

been   provided  to  assist.  We  have,  of   course.   the

concessionary  export  re-discount  facility  of  the   MAS

introduced  in  May  1975 and the Export  Credit  Insurance

Corporation established in September 1976. The EDB has last

year  initiated the Capital Assistance Scheme. In  November

1976,   the   Small  Industry  Finance  Scheme   was   also

introduced.  The  loans which we issued under  this  scheme

cover   investments  in  new  plant  and   buildings.   new

machinery, hire purchase schemes and working capital. Loans

ranging  from 70% to 85% of the total investment cost  have

grace  periods  ranging from two to three  years,  and  are

repayable  within  four to ten years.  Interest  rates  are

expected  to  be  about 9.5%, around two percentage  points

below commercial bank rates for such small companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member for Whampoa commented on the

technical  supporting  facilities for industry,  especially

for  calibrating equipment. The Government is aware of  the

needs   of   our   industries  for  appropriate   technical

supporting services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



Specifically, in SISIR, there are on-going programmes aimed

at   developing  and  providing  calibration  services   to

industry,   in   electrical,  mechanical  and   temperature

applications. The Government recognises that such  services

require long gestation periods, and SISIR will continue  to

review  and upgrade regularly its technical programmes  and

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Sembawang who spoke on

encouraging Singaporeans to buy more locally made products.

I  am, of course, in full agreement with the Member's  call

to  drop  their prejudice against local products.  For  the

public  sector, there is a standing order to all Government

departments  and statutory boards to support  locally  made

products,  particularly those approved by SISIR,  in  their

purchases. But Government effort must be complemented by an

equal  support from the private sector, I would, therefore,

urge  CASE  and  local consumers to give  support  to  such

locally  manufactured quality products tested and  approved

by SISIR.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to pass on to the various comments that

have  been made on manpower problems. The Member  for  Paya

Lebar  commented  on  the training at  Government  training

centres  and the possible abuse of the name of training  by

employers giving inadequate training to the workers. He can

be assured that proper checks are being made to ensure that

employers   participating  in  the  Government's   training

schemes  are giving the necessary skills to their trainees.

The 4-year Joint Industrial Training Programme organised by

the  Economic Development Board in conjunction with leading

private  sector  employers is a planned programme  for  the

training  of  precision skills. Trainees are registered  as

apprentices  with the Industrial Training Board  (ITB).  In

the first two years of training, the trainees follow a high

standard  training programme designed with  the  advice  of

expatriate  instructors who are well versed  in  industrial

training methods and manpower requirements. In the last two

years, when trainees are placed with industry, the ITB  and

EDB  training officers visit the factories at  least  once,

often twice or











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>





more  a year, to inspect the training log book and records.

In   addition,  they  check  the  training  jobs  and  hold

discussions with supervisors and trainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon spoke on Communist infiltration in

institutions  of higher learning being more  successful  if

there was great dissatisfaction , among student population.

He  suggested that to reduce this dissatisfaction  students

should   be  assured  of  employment  outlets.  While   the

Government  will try its best to ensure that there  are  as

many job opportunities as possible, I find it difficult  to

agree with the Member's suggestion that graduates should be

assured  of jobs after their graduation. It is  up  to  the

person concerned. I think. whether a university graduate, a

technician  or  school leaver, to adjust  to  the  changing

employment  demands of the economy. Graduates  are  not  an

exception  to this rule. and cannot expect, as a matter  of

right.   cushy  and  high-paying  jobs  in  air-conditioned

offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member for Alexandra spoke of women

often  stopping to work after marriage. He urged  the  need

for  more female participation. I would like to assure  him

that  the  Government  is aware of the  need  to  encourage

greater   female   participation  in  the   labour   force,

especially when labour supply is getting tighter due to our

successful  family planning programmes. We  have  supported

the  running of creches and kindergartens and in  addition,

working  women  are permitted to opt for a  special  fiscal

incentive, for example, for a separate assessment of  their

income  tax, and in respect of professional working  women,

special   tax   allowances  for  their   children.   Female

participation is also expected to rise as a result  of  our

education  policy. But in 1974, education  levels  of  non-working  women were still generally low. About 70% of  them

had  never attended school or had attended school  but  did

not  obtain any qualification. It is hoped that in time  to

come  we  will  have a new breed of female workers,  better

educated than before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to Members to learn that there has

been an 8-point increase in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



composition  of the civil service in favour of females.  In

1967, 37.1% of the civil service were women and it went  up

the following year to 37.2%. and again 33.1%, 34.3%, 36.9%,

39.5%, 42.5%, 43.8% until in 1975 it was 45.1% so that  the

male proportion was 54.9%. I would not be surprised if  the

ratio were reversed in the coming years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang suggested that the wage

differentials  between professionals and  ordinary  workers

should  be  reduced so as to correct the sectoral shortages

of  workers,  especially in the construction  industry  and

reduce  the need to import foreign workers, I am unable  to

agree with his suggestion for income redistribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a market economy like ours, wage differentials are

determined   by  market  forces.  There  is   little   that

Government   can  do  deliberately  to  narrow   the   wage

differentials  without adversely affecting  efficiency  and

incentives to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that completes the list of questions on the first

category.  I now come to the second category of matters  on

the  civil service establishment, Budget and taxation.  The

first comment was by the Member for Nee Soon who complained

of  certain  civil servants holding directorships  and.  in

particular,  their promotion even though  they  have  shown

inefficiency. I would like to say, first of all. that civil

servants are appointed to boards of companies in which  the

Government  has  an  interest  not  because  they   deserve

promotion  or  otherwise, Their duty  as  directors  is  to

ensure   that   the  companies  are  run  efficiently   and

profitably    and,   therefore,   that   the   Government's

investments  are  safeguarded. These  civil  servants  very

often assume responsibilities over and above those of their

civil service jobs proper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan (Whampoa):</b> Sometimes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I said "often". I disagree there. Our

civil servants perhaps work probably harder and beyond  the

normal  eight-hour day. As the .Minister in charge  of  the

Civil  Service. I am strongly of the opinion that at  least

in the Division I Civil Service the











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



hours  worked are much more strenuous than those by  almost

any other category of people. Certainly the amount of paper

work  has increased. Of course, whether Members regard this

as   productive   is  another  matter.  As  regards   their

efficiency,  the  performance of  these  functions  in  the

companies,  as  the  Minister  in  charge  of  Government's

investments  in  companies,  I  am  responsible   for   any

assessment  that  may  be required. I  do  not,  therefore,

understand  the Members' comment that there is  no  way  of

assessing  them.  It  is, of course, not  the  business  of

either   the  Public  Accounts  Committee  or  the   Budget

Committee to do this assessment whether the civil  servants

are  accountable  to  the two Committees  or  not.  As  the

Minister  in  charge  of investments, whether  overseas  or

elsewhere, accordingly also responsible for the purchase of

Granite  House,  I  do  not consider  that  the  Member  is

justified in the derogatory remarks that he has made on the

circumstances  surrounding this purchase. The circumstances

were  fully  explained to the Public Accounts Committee  on

25th February last year.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Member for Nee Soon also that the

appointment and promotion of civil servants are matters for

the  Public Service Commission and that their promotion and

reward  have, again, nothing to do with MPs. He  said.  "If

they  are promoted and rewarded by the Government, it would

refer  badly on MPs." The word "refer" should be "reflect".

But I have got it as "refer" here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan):</b> Point of clarification. Sir. As far as I can

remember, that was not the correct version that I said,



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> What is the correct version?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> What I actually said was that the

affairs  of  a  company owned by the Government  should  be

scrutinised by an appropriate body.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> So far as we know, it was not

scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee or  any  other

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> There are two parts of the statement. It

is a long statement. If I can read what the Member said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some civil servants hold directorships in a number of

different  companies  There is no way  of  assessing  their

efficiency as they are not accountable to either the Public

Accounts Committee or the Budget Committee.'



<br><br>That  is the part which tallies with what the Member  says.

He goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For example. the civil servant responsible for incurring a

loss  in  the purchase of Granite House in London has  been

made  a  director  of  another company.  Instead  of  being

penalised  for  his inefficiency in this purchase,  he  has

been  rewarded in a new post elsewhere. So the  performance

of  some  civil servants was not outstanding. If  they  are

promoted  and  rewarded by the Government. it  would  refer

badly on MP5.'



<br><br>I  am speaking of this last sentence. "If they are promoted

and  rewarded  by the Government, it would refer  badly  on

MPs," I see nothing to connect them with the MPs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> Sir, that was the translated version. It

has not been duly rectified yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Perhaps we will look at the record in

Hansard when it appears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And duly amended!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I now turn to other questions on the

civil   service.  The  Member  for  Anson  suggested   that

Government  officers  be allowed a further  opportunity  to

exercise their options for conversion to the CPF scheme.  I

should  like to state that when this exercise was conducted

for Divisions Ill and IV in 1973. they were given one month

to  make up their minds and also specifically told that the

options  were  irrevocable. The majority of officers  opted

for the CPF scheme. If we allow officers a second chance to

opt  for the CPF scheme, likewise to be equitable. officers

who have opted for the CPF scheme would have to be given  a

second  option  to revert to the Pension  scheme.  This  is

clearly undesirable and goes











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>





against the basic principle of irrevocability of options.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke. I think, on the use of CPF

contributions for purchase of flats. Like other members  of

the   public,  Government  officers  may  use   their   CPF

contributions  to  buy  flats  built  by  the  Housing  and

Development Board and the HUDC. Additionally, there  is  an

arrangement  whereby Government officers who are  confirmed

in  their appointments can apply for loans from the Housing

Board  to  purchase  Housing and  Development  Board  flats

without the usual down payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member made an observation on senior

officers  being bypassed in promotions. I think by  "senior

officer"  he  means officers who are senior  by  age  being

bypassed.  Of  course,  under  the  Government's  promotion

policy, seniority is taken into account, so also the  merit

qualifications and experience of the candidates. Only those

found deserving on the basis of these factors are promoted.

Seniority is only one of the factors for consideration.  Of

course, officers who have been longest in their jobs  ought

to know better and be more efficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one suggestion which relates to the revision of

the Parliamentary Pensions Act. I think this was brought up

by  the  Member for Nee Soon. As this has been answered  by

the  Prime Minister. I need not go into this other than  to

say that the Act provides for the award of a gratuity equal

to  one  year's  salary  to the dependants  of  Members  of

Parliament who die whilst in office. This is similar to the

payment  of  a death gratuity to dependants of a Government

officer who dies while in service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong spoke on the new budgetary system

and  on  the need for good inter-personal relations between

officials  of my Ministry and those of other Ministries  so

as  to  ensure  the successful implementation  of  the  new

budgetary system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new budgetary system is targetted for implementation in

the financial year 1978.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



Hon.  Members will be fully consulted and informed  through

the Estimates Committee of the changes contemplated in this

new   system.  The  new  budgetary  system  is  essentially

performance   oriented.   It   will   classify   Government

operations,  work  and expenditure by objectives.  It  will

also provide greater flexibility to Ministries in the usage

of  funds  so long as the objectives are realised and  cost

effectiveness  is maintained or improved upon.  The  Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan has put down a  Question  for  oral

answer and Members who want more information on this system

can. refer to the answer I will be giving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Member for Katong, I agree entirely

that  the success of the new budgetary system. as with  any

system,  will  depend  to  a  very  large  extent  on   the

cooperation  of the parties working it. There  have  always

been  discussions  between officials  of  the  Ministry  of

Finance  and  those  of other Ministries  on  the  latter's

budget  requirements.  These discussions  have  given  both

parties  a  better  appreciation of each other's  problems.

However,  under  the new budgetary system, there  would  be

more  definite criteria, and accordingly there will be less

subjective  evaluation  and less  room  for  dispute  among

officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to move on to the various comments on tax

matters.  I think the Member for Nee Soon desired  to  have

greater  debate on tax changes. I would like to  point  out

that  the last major tax changes were introduced in  1  968

and were prompted by the need to raise revenue for building

up  our  Armed  Forces. Since then,  there  have  been  few

changes in the tax structure. though we have found that  we

have imposed tax disincentives or given tax concessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases have been made mainly to existing taxes on

private  sector vehicles. cigarettes and tobacco  products,

liquors  and  petroleum. These revisions were made  not  so

much  to  raise additional revenue, though this  is  always

welcome,  as to alleviate traffic congestion and pollution,

to   bolster  Government's  anti-smoking  campaign  and  to

discourage consumption of non-essential











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



items.  It is quite obvious that it would be impossible  to

have prior debate in Parliament on such tax increases since

advance notice of taxes would lead to hoarding, speculation

and profiteering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless. I wish to assure the House that where none

of  these problems would arise from proposed changes to the

tax structure, if for example, we should wish to change the

tax  system from income taxation to value added tax as  has

been  suggested by the Prime Minister yesterday. then  hon.

Members would be given every opportunity for debate on  the

new tax structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to a suggestion of the Member for Thomson on

income  tax  relief. I think the Member  for  Punggol  also

suggested  that the personal relief should be increased  in

proportion  to  the increase in the cost  of  living  since

1948.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir, I did

not refer to it this time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> In that case, it would save me the burden

of  answering this particular part of the question. Without

referring  to  specific  Members  of  Parliament,   several

Members have pressed for an upward revision in the personal

allowances  for  income  tax. This  issue,  of  course,  is

perennial  before each budget session, not only by  Members

but  also  by  the  press, At the risk of  boring  the  old

incumbents  and  also  the  new Members,  may  I  take  the

opportunity  to  repeat  once again  the  reasons  for  not

Increasing   these  allowances.  First,   any   significant

increase  in  personal relief would result in a substantial

loss  in  revenue. A small increase of $1,000  in  personal

relief  would cause the Government to sacrifice $26 million

in  revenue  a year. Our revenue performance  in  the  last

financial  year and in the coming year is not so strong  as

to  permit an increase in such income tax relief.  If  such

relief  were  to be increased, a new tax or an Increase  in

other taxes may have to be imposed to make up for the  loss

in revenue. Secondly, while the cost of living has gone up,

so has the per capita income which Increases the ability of

the   taxpayer  to  pay  income  tax.  Thirdly,  the  ever-increasing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



public expenditure has to be borne by as many people as can

bear them. It is salutary for them to be reminded that  the

services provided by Government must be paid for,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Kallang. He said that "the

present  income tax rates are not conducive  to  attracting

international  operations that  neither  buy  nor  sell  in

Singapore."  He welcomed the establishment  of  the  Fiscal

Policy  Implementation Committee to consider how  best  the

tax  system cap be adjusted. He also suggested that as  tax

collectors are "notoriously conservative when it  comes  to

tax  incentives, those who are directly in  charge  of  tax

collections  should have little to do with the  formulation

of  tax  incentives." I think the Government is aware  that

the  present  tax rates are not sufficiently attractive  to

induce  the  growth  of  off-shore  trading  activities  in

Singapore and certain proposed tax concessions for business

engaged in offshore trading are now being examined  by  the

Fiscal   Policy  Implementation  Committee.   The   primary

function  of  the  Committee is to study how  to  implement

major  tax  changes which have already been  decided  as  a

matter  of policy by the Government. The tax administrators

are included in the Committee to render technical advice on

how the new tax incentives can be implemented smoothly.  In

any  case  if there is any difficulty, I think any conflict

should be resolved by the Minister for Finance who is  both

responsible   for  development  of  international   trading

centres  as  well as restrictions which the  Budget  impose

upon other tax policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to the problem of oil companies and the

adjustments  to the retail price of petrol. There  is  also

another example quoted by the Member for Moulmein about the

tax  surcharge which properly is a matter for the  Ministry

of Finance, On the unhappiness over the so-called increases

of  taxes in the form of additional duty on petrol, I would

like  to  inform Members that adjustments to the  price  of

petroleum  products inclusive of adjustments in duties  are

related  to  price  increases of  crude  supplied  by  OPEC

countries.  The  overall increase allowed is  spread  among

major











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>





price-controlled items so as. to favour industry and public

transportation. This is in line with Government  policy  to

discourage  ownership of private motor vehicles.  Consumers

as  a whole group do not face any additional cost over  and

above  what  is  necessary to compensate for  increases  in

crude  prices.  The  duty  of 1  .8  cents  per  litre  for

automotive  diesel oil was, for instance.  removed  in  the

January 1976 round of price increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the tax on PUB bills, this was first introduced in

January  1969  with  legislation of  the  Statutory  Boards

(Taxable  Services)  Act. The tax was  intended  mainly  to

defray  increased defence expenditure. The majority of  the

people  are  not really penalised by the surcharge  on  PUB

bills.  On each occasion that the PUB was obliged to  raise

either  its electricity or water tariffs, the tax structure

was  also revised accordingly to give relief to the smaller

domestic  consumers.  When the tax  was  first  imposed  in

January 1969, households whose bills were in excess of  $10

per  month  were liable to pay tax. The cut-off  point  has

since  been revised on four occasions and is now pegged  at

$35  per  month. However, we are reviewing  it  once  again

since we shall have to consider it in conjunction with what

increase  we must allow in electricity tariffs  because  of

increased oil prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I repeat what my colleague, the Minister for National

Development and Communications, has stated? On the  average

some 70.5% of the total domestic households in Singapore do

not  pay  Government tax on their PUB bills as their  bills

are  less than $35 a month. In addition a further 14.5% pay

tax  and only at 5%; and the remaining 1 5% pay at the  10%

tax  rate.  As  for the latter category of households,  the

imposition of Government tax should induce them to be  more

economical  with  regard to consumption of public  utility.

With  regard  to  the industries, the larger  consumers  of

electricity have been granted exemption from the tax.

<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not want

to  interrupt while the Minister was speaking. So may I  be

permitted to clarify a number of points?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know who drafted the Minister's replies but many

of  them were inadequate. For example, when he referred  to

the  various  schemes of Government like Export  Financing,

Capital   Assistance  Scheme,  Small  Industries  Financing

Scheme,  and  so on. he gave us no details  of  the  actual

implementation, that is, what has actually  been  achieved,

what  is the cost involved, and what is the number of firms

involved.  He  merely  gave  us  a  regurgitation  of   the

principles of those schemes. Similarly, when he referred to

the  Labour  Training Scheme. he talked in  general  terms,

describing  what those schemes are but without  telling  us

the number involved and no reference to cost effectiveness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is when he referred to the percentage of

women  in  the  civil  service and pointed  out  to  an  8%

increase in the number of women, but he did not tell us  in

what categories those women are in. If they all joined  the

Service  as  sweepers  and cleaners,  we  can,  of  course,

enlarge the number ad infinitum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point he referred to was in regard to wage

differentials   and  said  that  there  was   little   the

Government  could do. That is not true because  Government

policy  substantially  affects  demand  and  supply.   For

example, whether or not to grant more immigration  permits -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Dr Tan, we are debating a Motion

and  the Minister has got another. I am sure you will have

an opportunity to debate the details during Budget time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I am prepared to answer his point of

now?





<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Yes. The Minister referred me to various

reports  of statutory boards and government bodies.  In  my

speech  I have stated that in those very reports one  finds

glowing accounts of what goes on, not critical analyses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not quite sure

what  he  expects me to do here. Should I stand up in  this

House  and say. "I have these glowing reports from the  EDB

but  I am not very satisfied with them"? In fact, I am  not

always  satisfied  with the glowing reports,  but  does  he

expect me to come here and criticise the performance of the

Ministry under my charge? If he has any critical comment to

make of them, perhaps I could really answer; and if I agree

with  some of his comments then I will say so. But  he  can

hardly  expect me to initiate criticism of my own  Ministry

and departments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point was

simply -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, could you please come to the

point, because there seems to be no end to this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I will just take one minute.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> No, whether it is a minute or not. I am

sorry. But if you want to clarify any particular point, you

may do so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> The point that the hon. Minister

referred  to is that I could hardly expect him to criticise

the Ministry or statutory boards under his charge. My point

is,  very simply, that we hear too often of, "This is  what

we  intend  to do and this is what we have done."  But  too

little  of  "These are the mistakes that we have made"  and

"These are the corrections that we intend to make."



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, perhaps I do not understand the

duties  of  Ministers.  I criticise my  departments  and  I

criticise  my  Government servants in  the  privacy  of  my

office, and I hope I give them hell from time to time,  but

I  do  not expect to do so in the House here. If there  are

points which I should be critical of, and he suggests  that

I  take note of them. I will certainly do so. But I do  not

think I can be expected to come here and say, "I have given

them hell because of certain points and I want to tell  you

all about this."



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, there are advantages of being the last speaker on the

Government  side  but  there are  also  its  disadvantages,

especially after yesterday's marathon performance. Most  of

the points, in fact, have been covered by others and by the

Prime  Minister himself. I would like briefly to deal  with

one or two points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested by one Member that the Hawkers

Department  does  not  work very hard  against  hawkers  in

constituencies where Ministers have been elected  but  they

work  especially  hard where Members are. After  the  Prime

Minister's  speech yesterday, I think the  Member  will  be

well  aware that if I did that I would not only be  out  of

the  Ministry of the Environment but also out of the House.

But  let  us  assume that that is true, so if  he  wants  a

hawker's  licence he comes to Tanglin. Let us take  it  one

step  further. If he wants a Housing Board flat,  he  tries

Cairnhill. If he wants a ticket to the











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>





football  stadium, he goes to River Valley. If he wants  to

smoke  ganja, try MacPherson. If he does not  want  to  pay

income tax or wants a postponement, go to Havelock,  If  he

wants  his  son to be exempted from national  service,  try

Kreta  Ayer. Gentlemen, if he wants all these things rolled

into one, he knows where to go - Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one more point on the Ministry of Law. It is about

the procedure in respect of urgent bills, which was touched

upon  by  one  Member  and defended by the  Prime  Minister

yesterday.  The  Prime Minister cited some figures.  I  can

give  much  more.  It is under Standing  Order  82  that  a

Certificate  of  Urgency is required to be  signed  by  the

President before a Bill can be taken through all stages  in

this House at one go. All Ministries are fully aware of the

need  to  let  bills go through their normal process,  thus

ensuring the full benefit of Parliamentary scrutiny  before

the  final form emerges. In fact, in recent years, very few

bills have been taken through on a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last six years from 1971 to 1976, Parliament dealt

with  219  bills. Of these, only seven were  taken  through

urgently. In the last three years. 1974 to 1976, out of 107

Acts  of  Parliament, only three (one in  each  year)  were

dealt  with  as urgent bills. They were: the  Criminal  Law

(Temporary  Provisions) (Amendment) Bill,  1974.  This  was

taken  through to extend the life of the Act which was  due

to  expire.  In 1975, the Companies (Amendment) Bill.  This

was an amendment to enable an inspector appointed under the

Companies Act to inform the Minister of any matters  coming

to  his  knowledge as a result of the investigation tending

to  show that an offence has been committed. This piece  of

urgent legislation arose Out of the investigations into the

Haw   Par   affair.  Last  year  the  Financial   Procedure

(Amendment) Bill was taken through urgently in view of  the

impending  prorogation of Parliament after the  sitting  on

24th  November last year prior to the elections. There have

been,  as  far  as  I am aware, no. bills which  have  been

amended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



purely  because  of  drafting  errors.  Bills  are  amended

primarily  because  in  the  light  of  working  experience

inadequacies  are revealed. Administrators and  enforcement

officers may come up against situations not envisaged  when

the   bill  was  first  drafted  or  the  test  of   actual

enforcement   may   reveal  loopholes   which   necessitate

plugging.  Of  course,  when such a  situation  arises  the

opportunity is taken by the draftsman to make any desirable

drafting  changes  which  might  make  the  language,  more

explicit  or remove doubts which might have arisen  in  the

meantime  consequent on prosecution, litigation or judicial

review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point made by the Member for Nee Soon

about the difficulty in understanding legislation, this  is

understandable as even those trained in the  law  sometimes

have difficulty in interpreting provisions, couched as they

are,  in legal terminology. It is for this reason that  all

bills  have  attached to them explanatory statements  which

try  and set out in lay language the main provisions of the

bill.  However,  the  general point,  made  by  Members  of

Parliament  touching  on  this  subject  that  legislation,

hastily   conceived  or  pressed  for  by   administrators,

enforcement agencies, revenue and tax collectors and  those

primarily  interested in getting results  rather  than  the

means or mode of getting such results, is a valid one. This

is  particularly  so where objectives can  be  achieved  by

better  administration or education  or  a  combination  of

both.  This  debate has underlined the need  to  constantly

stress to all concerned that in the realm of legislation it

is wise to make haste slowly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before this debate began I invited Members to speak

freely and openly. They have done so. I congratulate  them.

But  in  this debate, Members and Parliamentary Secretaries

spoke first. Ministers had' the advantage of replying.  And

I have the advantage of speaking last. I am not against the

cut  and  thrust  of  debate. This is the  essence  of  any

Parliament.  But  may I say, without any  disrespect,  that

some of our big guns. when replying, went further than  was

really necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But Members will have their chance, In the

debate  on  my  colleague's budget,  they  will  have  more

opportunity to speak in the Committee of Supply. Let us see

what that debate will bring forth.



<br><br>4.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, the vital organs of our body -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Such as?



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding:</b> I presume all Members know what they

are  - we cannot do without, or we do badly without any  of

them. On the other hand, our appendix, we can do without. I

am willing to be corrected by the hon. Member for Kim Seng.

I  am  told that some surgeons remove the appendix of their

patients for free, during operation. Coming after  a  total

of  almost  a  dozen Ministerial statements, including  the

Prime Minister's yesterday, what I have to say now is  very

much in the nature of an appendix. We all can do without it

but  in  extenuation an appendix does not appear to do  any

great harm and it is only a very little thing. If you, Sir,

and  other  hon. Members will relax and make  yourself  and

themselves  comfortable, I shall try to set another  record

in this House and make this, my second speech, the shortest

speech of all the speeches delivered during this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a total of 35 Backbenchers, six

Parliamentary  Secretaries  and  one  Minister   of   State

participated in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Leader of the House for giving me the honor to

move   the   Motion  and  thank  all  Members  for   having

participated in the debate and for their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from what has been discussed that Members had

taken  to heart what the Leader of the House said to  them:

to  let their conscience be their guide and to speak freely

with open minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us in this House, the press and the public, had

looked forward with the greatest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



interest  to  what the eleven "new boys" had to  say.  They

have  not  disappointed us. They add their  experience  and

expertise to that already presented in the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House has heard wide-ranging and critical comment on

the   Government's  general  policies  as  well  as   their

implementation  at grass-roots level. These  comments  have

contributed immeasurably to public interest in  the  debate

and reassured our constituents that they truly have a voice

in  this  Parliament. Their satisfaction with  Government's

policies  as well as their dissatisfaction have  both  been

voiced  in this House. The Leader of the House has referred

to  the cut and thrust of debate, particularly in the  last

three  days. It is my impression, which he confirmed,  that

more  thrusts  were proferred by the Ministers  while  more

cuts were sustained by the Backbenchers!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to make only three observations: First, the

large  number of comments. including complaints, about  the

Housing  and  Development Board is surely an index  of  its

success.  If  only  5% instead of 50% of  our  people  were

living  in HDB flats, we would have had far fewer reference

to  the problems that the HDB generates. Backbenchers, many

of whom would not have been from the PAP, in reflecting the

needs  of their constituents. would have been demanding  in

this House that the Government build more flats rather than

better  quality  flats. This is not to  say  there  are  no

problems at all. I have my fair share of dealings with  the

HDB.  I have not always succeeded in meeting the wishes  of

my  HDB  constituents. But I have always received  courtesy

and  cooperation. And I think that most Members would  have

had the same experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second observation relates to comments and complaints

about  the civil service. I would feel sorry for the  civil

servants  except  for the fact that they  are  particularly

able  to take care of themselves. Furthermore, they have  a

stout  defender  in the Minister for Finances  I  am  truly

astonished  to  learn that he can and does give  them  hell

from  time  to  time.  However, if a bureaucrat  takes  the

initiative, he runs the











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>





risk  of  being accused of usurping the supremacy  or

sovereignty  of Parliament. But strict  adherence  to

his  Instruction  Manual does not  provide  him  with

safety either: he can be accused of being inflexible.

unimaginative, even inhuman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members in this House are ex-civil

servants.  They range from Ministers to  rat-catchers

to Backbenchers. Have we here a Mr Hyde and Dr Jekyll

transformation?  Do  inflexible,  unimaginative   and

inhuman  bureaucrats  become enterprising,  sensitive

and  warm politicians? Should we try to run our civil

servants through this House to sensitize them? If our

ex-civil  servant Members were already  sensitive  in

the  first  place,  should we have  allowed  them  to

remain in the civil service? That also does not  seem

like  a  practical  solution. I  believe  that  civil

servants  who  forget to be civil,  who  forget  that

their duty is to serve the public, should be reported

and  if found to be at fault, appropriately punished.

The machinery to do this exists, and should be used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third observation I want to make is about

national security, which occupied a good part of  the

President's  Address and which engaged the  attention

of many Members, During our debate the confessions of

G, Raman appeared and several arrests were made. They

reveal  to us the ever-present threat to our national

security, The communist danger is not a bogey. It  is

not  the  figment of a fertile imagination. In  other

countries  communists have attempted to  or  actually

succeeded in seizing power. Two of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



our  ASEAN  neighbours  have  recently  mounted  more

intensive  operations to meet the  escalating  danger

from   the   communists.  We  in   Singapore   cannot

reasonably expect to be left unmolested, seeing  that

the   Communist   Party  of  Malaya   (CPM)   regards

Peninsular  Malaysia and Singapore  as  one.  namely,

Malaya.   Subversion,  communist  as  well  as   non-communist,  is one of the facts of life. But  we  can

successfully  overcome all attempts  to  subvert  us.

provided we remain "vigilant and discriminating"  and

provided   the   PAP  continues   to   govern   "with

circumspection and moderation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion

standing in my name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put. and agreed to.
