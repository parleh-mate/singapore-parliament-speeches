<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Financial

Secretary to give -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the number of Limited Companies registered

in  Singapore and the total profits made by

them in 1955;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the number thereof who in 1955 made a

profit  exceeding  10  per  cent  of  their

capital, and the total of such profits.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, the number of private

limited companies registered in Singapore  at  the

end  of  1955  was  1,344. The  number  of  public

limited companies registered in Singapore  at  the

end of 1955 was 127.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private limited companies are not required to

submit   accounts  and  balance  sheets   to   the

Registrar  of  Companies  and  no  information  is

available  as to the profits which these companies

made   in  1955.  Public  limited  companies   are

required to submit accounts and balance sheets  to

the  Registrar  of  Companies. I regret,  however,

that shortage of time and preoccupation with other

urgent  matters has made it impossible for  me  to

collect and digest the information which the  hon.

Member  requires  about  these  companies.  If  he

wishes  to  pursue  the matter, perhaps  the  hon.

Member may care to obtain the information from the

Registrar of Companies himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, the question is one of public

importance. I would ask if the Financial Secretary

would  consider giving the answers for the  record

of this House, obtaining for the private companies

their profits from the Income Tax Department,  and

for  the  public companies their profits from  the

Registrar  of Companies, and making them  part  of

the record for the next sitting in December.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> As regards private companies, Sir, I

regret  I  can  give  no such  assurance.  Private

companies  do  submit  information  as  to   their

profits  to  the  Comptroller of Income  Tax,  but

under  section 6 of the Ordinance, the consent  of

the  Governor is required before that  information

can be divulged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the profits of public companies,

I  will endeavour to provide the hon. Member  with

the  information which he requires by the  5th  of

December.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, the Income

Tax   Ordinance   precludes  the   divulgence   of

information about individual returns.  The  public

are  entitled  to information on  a  global  scale

which would not pinpoint individual firms. I would

ask  if  the  Financial Secretary would reconsider

his  reply and give us an assurance that  he  will

look   into   the  question  of  giving   us   the

information about the profits of private companies

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Financial Secretary

whether  he is aware of the long delays caused  to

passenger trains travelling between Singapore  and

Kuala  Lumpur due to customs examination at Johore

Bahru;  and  whether  he  will  arrange  with  the

Federation  authorities  for  Federation   customs

en route.

interested  to know that the two Governments  have

already  agreed in principle that Federal  customs

officers should board trains in Singapore and make

customs  examinations en route to Johore Bahru.  A

Bill  which, amongst other things, will  authorise

this to be done is at present in draft and will be

introduced as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $386,330 for Head 1 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  just a small point of clarification. On  page

28,  sub-head  7,  replacement of an  unserviceable

tape recorder, there is no indication that Treasury

sanction  is  necessary in this  case;  but  whilst

going  through  other items in the Estimates  where

replacements  are concerned, Treasury  sanction  is

necessary. Can I know the difference, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir,

there  are  no considerations in this matter  which

would  require prior Treasury approval  before  the

money  is  spent. It is a simple matter  of  merely

replacing   a  tape  recorder  which   has   become

unserviceable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> On a matter of

clarification,  Sir,  do  I  understand  that   the

Governor will be going along for the Merdeka  talks

in London next year and is it probably Government's

intention to do away with the Governor under Head 1

and replace him with a Governor-General?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point does not arise in the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Chairman,  this is another matter of clarification.

On  page  28, sub-head 1 (21) , I notice an increase

of   $600   in   the  allowance  to   the   Officer

Administering the Government. There has  apparently

been  a  change  in the title. Could the  Financial

Secretary explain whether this increase from $1,200

to  $1,800 has been made purely to suit this change

of title?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The increase in the allowance is merely

due  to  the fact that we estimate that in 1957  we

will  have to pay rather more in the matter  of  an

allowance to the Governor's Deputy than we  had  to

pay in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $386,330 for Head 1 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 2-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 10 (1) , Administration-City

Services, on page 33 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that an increase of $24,000 for City

Services  is  rather fantastic. There  is  no  such

thing  as  an  increase of $24,000,  equivalent  to

$2,000  a month, for electrical current consumption

and  I  wonder how many units will be  consumed  in

relation to this amount.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not quite certain whether the

hon.  Member is talking about economy. Is he making

the  point  that  he wishes that certain  economies

should be effected in this vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, if I can get a clear

explanation from the Financial Secretary and  if  I

am  satisfied with his explanation, I may  withdraw

my  amendment. It is not a question of economy. The

question   is   how  this  figure - an  increase   of

$24,000 - is arrived at.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It occurs to me then that there was

no  necessity for the hon. Member to file a  motion

on  the  amendment because Standing Order  69  (11)

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On any question in the Committee of Supply

debate  shall  be  confined to the  policy  of  the

service for which the money is to be provided...".



<br><br>Therefore, if the hon. Member wished to debate  the

policy  of  the  service for  which  the  money  is

required, then, of course, his duty was to  file  a

motion  in the way of an amendment, but if  it  was

just  to get information, then the proper procedure

would have been to wait until the Main Question was

proposed and then questions could have been  asked,

as  have, in fact, been asked under Head 1. If  the

hon.  Member  will indicate whether or  not  he  is

attacking  the  policy, then,  of  course,  he  can

continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged, Mr

Chairman.  If  the explanation from  the  Financial

Secretary is satisfactory, then I will withdraw  my

amendment, as you have indicated that there  is  no

question of filing a motion; but if the explanation

is not satisfactory,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



and  I  am  not satisfied with the amount  that  is

involved,  then  I  will, as an  indication  of  my

protest, move an amendment to reduce that figure.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Under the Standing Order, I cannot

accept  the  amendment  on those  lines.  The  hon.

Member will, of course, be given the opportunity of

asking  the same question when I propose  the  Main

Question on the main Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,891,870 for Head 2 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, can I now have

an  explanation from the Financial Secretary as  to

how the figure of $24,000 is arrived at?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The explanation, Sir, is given in the

footnote. The extra funds are required to meet  the

cost  of the current required to air-condition  the

Courts. The hon. Member will no doubt remember that

in  the course of this year we took a supplementary

provision  to  meet the increased cost  of  current

consumption  arising  from the air-conditioning  of

these  Courts. It has worked out at $2,000 a month,

and   the  total  required  in  1957  is  therefore

estimated at $24,000. The extra $3,600 is  required

for other City Services.



<br><br>10.16 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, this

Assembly has notice of a question by Mr Sutherland

regarding  the appointment of further Judges.  Sir,

the  question  of  the  appointment  of  additional

Judges  has  been  a  matter of  urgency  for  some

months. In fact, this goes back to the beginning of

this year, and it is only the reluctance to appoint

Malayans  who  are qualified, available,  seasoned,

experienced  people as Judges that  is  holding  up

these  appointments. Sir, in the inter-Party  talks

for  the  purposes of the constitutional conference

in  London,  it  was  apparent  that  there  was  a

division   of   views  as  to  the   propriety   of

Malayanisation of the judiciary. I  would  like  to

say  for myself and for my Party that we are deeply

convinced  that it is a matter of vital  importance

that the security of tenure of the Judges



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

should in no way be broached. Sir, we may prefer to

have our own men who understand our ways as Judges,

but we do recognise that for decades the expatriate

officials  who have acted as Judges have maintained

a  tradition  and an integrity which have  been  an

inspiration not only to members of the Bench in the

lower Courts, not only to the Bar, but to the whole

population    who   respect   and    admire    this

administration of justice. In the circumstances, if

only  as  an  expression of our gratitude  for  the

evolution   and  maintenance  of  this  very   high

tradition, we should not in any way interfere  with

the security of tenure which they enjoy. But I must

add this, Sir: that if this colonial reluctance  to

the  appointment of local men as Judges is  pursued

by  forcing  upon  the country  further  expatriate

Judges,  then  the position may well be  endangered

and  I,  for one, would deeply regret it.  I  would

plead  with the Chief Minister to use his influence

with  the  Governor to see that the  harmony  which

exists  between the people and the judiciary should

in  no way be upset by unwise appointments which go

contrary to the feelings of the people. Our  people

are  a decent people, Sir, and their attitude is  a

simple  one,  namely, that what has been  done  has

been done. The officials appointed have done a good

job  of `work. Let us not interfere with them,  but

do not appoint more expatriates. It is time we were

given  a  chance.  If you appoint  more  expatriate

officials  with the possibility that  this  country

will  have  for the next 15 or 20 years  expatriate

Judges,  then  the question of Malayanisation  must

become an acute, a topical and a necessary one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would plead that the Governor be informed

of  the view that I believe the people of Singapore

hold - that  it  would  be  inappropriate   at   this

juncture   of   our  development  to   ignore   the

experienced, seasoned legal men we have  who  could

be   appointed   to  the  posts   of   honour   and

responsibility  of Judges, and  that  it  would  be

wrong to appoint further expatriates as Judges, not

only  because it would go contrary to  our  wishes,

which may or may not matter to the Governor, but it

would go contrary to the interests of the judiciary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



who  are now in existence. This, I have no  doubt,

is  a  matter  of considerable importance  to  the

Governor.  I  would  plead that  a  practical  and

sensible  approach  to  the  people's  wishes   be

considered and that colonial powers should lot  be

exercised  to  ride roughshod not  only  over  our

interests but over the permanent interests of  the

judiciary themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, everyone will

agree  with the expression of views given  by  the

Member for Cairnhill, but he has forgotten  to  do

one  thing. He has forgotten to put down  a  token

vote  of  $10 in the Estimates for the appointment

of a local Judge. Sir, I move that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I have to get the Governor's permission.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The Member for Cairnhill can do it now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  during  the conference in London  our  Party

also  stood firm on the question of the judiciary,

that  Judges should be accorded the respect  which

they  have  enjoyed all these years and that  they

should be independent of every political Party. We

are  convinced that no politics should be  allowed

to  influence  any  appointment to  the  judiciary

because  in the Judges are entrusted the  security

and  the  future of a country. So far we  can  say

with  pride  that our Judges have always  won  our

admiration,  and for their work we  are  grateful,

and  we should all give support to see that  there

should  be permanency of tenure for those who  are

already  on  the  Bench. But I do agree  that  the

public  at  large  and  the  Bar  are  very   much

concerned about the delay in appointing additional

Judges. I am told that some of the civil cases  in

Court  have  to wait for as long as six  to  eight

months  before  they can be heard. This  state  of

affairs  cannot be tolerated and I would urge  the

Governor  and  the  Government  to  consider   the

appointment  of additional Judges without  further

delay.  Among  our local serving officers  in  the

legal service there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



are  a  number  of very able men who  have  proved

themselves to be above temptation and fit to carry

out  the  work of High Court Judges. I would  urge

that consideration be given for the appointment of

our local legal officers as Judges.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Chairman,

there is a saying that "Justice should not only be

done but justice should also be shown to be done."

Following  this wise statement, Sir, I would  like

to  suggest that the salaries of Judges  be  taken

out of the annual Estimates and be a charge on the

revenue.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir,

the  Member  for  Paya Lebar referred  to  alleged

delays  which take place in the High Court.  I  am

sure he will have noted with satisfaction that  in

the  Estimates which are now before  us  there  is

provision  for  the appointment of  an  additional

Judge in order to bring the courts up to date with

their  work; and previously this Assembly approved

additional appointments of Court reporters so that

the  reporting side of the Courts could also  keep

pace  with the volume of work. I understand,  Sir,

that there has been a considerable improvement  in

the pace with which the Courts are keeping up with

the cases presented to them, but there is still  a

further backlog to be made up. I hope that  if  we

get  a  new judge appointed early in the new  year

there  will no longer be cause for dissatisfaction

with  the speed with which justice can be obtained

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, at the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill knows that the question

of  the judiciary was a matter for discussion with

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I see on page 36, sub-head 2 (5) , that an amount of $48,000 is provided

for  the Council of Ministers for telegrams  alone.

This  works out to be $4,000 a month for telegrams.

This  estimate of $48,000 to be spent on  telegrams

alone is either fantastic or an extravagance on the

part  of  the  Government. I wonder if this  amount

could  be  reduced. Sir, $30,000 was  provided  for

this year and with this amount we were able to cope

with   telegrams  for  the  Merdeka  talks  between

Singapore, the United Kingdom and the rest  of  the

other  places. Sir, the delegation for next  year's

Merdeka talks will be a very small one and will not

be  equivalent to the size of the delegation  which

went to London this year. I wonder why there should

be an increase of $18,000 on telegrams.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I must confess,

as  the  former  Chief Minister,  I  am  more  than

astonished  at the figure of $48,000 for telegrams.

I do not believe I spent even a thousand dollars in

more  than a year. I am told that we spent  $38,000

for  telegrams  for  the  Merdeka  mission.  I  was

shocked to the core when I read that in a newspaper

cutting  which I received in Japan. Let  me  assure

you, Sir, that as far as I was concerned, I did not

spend $100 on telegrams for the Merdeka talks,  and

I can only assume that these were telegrams sent by

the   Public  Relations  Officer  to  the  Colonial

Secretary  and  to  the Governor - long  screeds  and

reports   of   what  was  appearing  in   newspaper

editorials  in this territory which could  well  be

condensed.  The Chief Minister received  copies  of

those  telegrams  which were sent to  the  Colonial

Secretary and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Governor. But this is an  extravagance,  I

completely agree, and I do agree that this  $48,000

could be almost completely axed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Queenstown

has forgotten that we took a Supplementary Vote for

this  service  last year. Perhaps, to  refresh  his

memory, I may be allowed to read from col.  178  in

Hansard of the 7th of September:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As means of communication develop, so one tends

to  use them. The habit has grown steadily over the

years to communicate by telegram and radiogram.  It

saves  much  time  and, I think, leads  to  greater

efficiency  and the speedier despatch of Government

business.  The  practice  is  common  not  only  in

Government but also in business and other  circles.

Following    this    growing   habit,    Government

expenditure  on telegrams has tended  to  increase.

Expenditure  over the past five years has  been  as

follows:   1952,  $l2,000;  1953,  $19,000;   1954,

$23,000;  1955,  $38,000; from 1st January  to  9th

August, 1956, $32,000. The considerable increase in

1956  over 1955 figures has been due, in the  main,

to   increased   communication  on   constitutional

matters  in  the  early  part  of  this  year.  The

original   vote  has  now  been  expended   and   a

supplement  of $30,000 is asked for. This  estimate

was  made  in  early June on the basis  of  average

monthly expenditure in the first part of the  year.

There  has been a slight falling off in expenditure

since  that date but the application has been  kept

to  the  same level in order to cover all  possible

contingencies  in  the future. There  has  been  no

extravagance   in   expenditure.   Telegrams    are

despatched to all quarters of the globe  and  cover

the multifarious business of Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure at the present time is running to the

order  of  $4,850 a month and, on  that  basis,  it

would  be  necessary  to ask for  $48,000  for  the

coming  year. There will be increased communication

in  connection  with the Merdeka talks  which  will

take  place  in  February and no  doubt  afterwards

there  will  be  further  need  to  communicate  by

telegram.  Every possible effort is  made  to  send

communications to the Colonial Office  and  by  the

Colonial Office to this Government by seamail,  but

in many cases time is saved and the business of the

Government  is discharged much more efficiently  if

telegrams are used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that I have no notice of the remarks

which the Member for Cairnhill made about the  cost

of  telegrams  in connection with the last  Merdeka

talks. A considerable sum of money was spent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Public Relations Officer in sending precis

of the news items which appeared in the local Press

to  the  Chief Minister. My understanding of  the

matter was that they were sent specifically by  the

Public  Relations  Officer  to  enable  the   Chief

Minister to be fully aware of the reactions of  the

public in Singapore to the progress of the talks.

every Member of the delegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> May I raise one small point,

Sir? The Hon. the Financial Secretary said just now

that  sea-mail takes a lot of time, but may I  draw

his attention to the fact that today's air services

take  only 48 hours? Telegrams take about  6  hours

and  delayed telegrams about 12 hours. Would it not

be  wise,  in the case of not very urgent business,

that airmail be used so that money will be saved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> No, Sir. I do apologise. When I said

"seamail", I meant to include airmail as well. Bags

do  go  to the Colonial Office by courier  and  all

communications  which we can send  by  airmail  are

sent  in these bags; but the fact of the matter  is

that telegrams can arrive in the Colonial Office in

a  very  few  hours after despatch  from  here.  If

communications are sent by airmail,  perhaps  three

or four days may elapse before they arrive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, it is a real pity that my

motion to reduce this vote was not received in time

for  today's debate, and I cannot move an amendment

to  reduce  this  amount.  But  I  would  urge  the

Government or the Council of Ministers to  bear  in

mind  that  where  telegrams  are  concerned,  they

should  be as concise as possible. It is  not  like

writing an article or a story in the newspaper.  As

far  as telegrams are concerned, I do hope that the

them as short as possible.

respect of sub-head 8, Passages and Miscellaneous

Travelling Expenses, on page 53 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no explanation given as to how the

figure  of $1,600,000 is being spent and  on  whom.

Are  these passages by air or by sea; how many  are

air  passages and how many are by sea; how many  of

these are for Europeans and how many for Asians?  I

think  this  is  a colossal sum. I think  at  least

$200,000 or $300,000 could be saved if the  heaven-

born  go  by  sea instead of by air.  Sir,  because

money  is insufficient, we are to be taxed heavily,

and  the  Press reports that the Government carries

the  day  without  mentioning  with  the  help   of

official  and  nominated votes  when  it  comes  to

voting on any item. With whose votes does it  carry

the  day, Sir? With the three ex-officios and  four

nominated  Members, of course.  What  I  am  asking

here,  Sir, is: Why cannot these people go  by  sea

instead  of  by air so that a lot of money  can  be

saved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, this figure under "Passages" is a

very  large  figure indeed and I am  not  surprised

that  it  has  provoked comment from  hon.  Members

opposite. I am afraid I cannot give him a  detailed

breakdown  between the heaven-born, the  lower-born

and  the  medium-born, but I can give  him  two  or

three points which may help to explain the figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not only to provide passages for

European  officers whose passages are,  of  course,

provided  as  part of their conditions  of  service

and, speaking for the majority of those officers, I

do  not  think  they have any wish to  be  made  to

travel by air. I think they all prefer to have  the

longer holiday and travel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



by   sea,   perhaps  even  more   so   in   present

circumstances.  But  the  hard  fact  is  that  the

demands of the public service very frequently  make

it  necessary that an officer, who would prefer  to

have  a  leisurely three weeks' voyage by  sea,  be

asked to travel by air so that he may return to his

duty earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point of information that I would like to

make  is that this sum is not exclusively spent  on

expatriate   officers   enjoying   their   generous

conditions of service. A very substantial  part  of

this  money  goes  to  meet  the  cost  of  sending

officers  and  others  from  Singapore  to   attend

conferences and other occasions overseas.  I  think

hon. Members will be aware that in the last year - in

fact,  in recent years - we have more and more  taken

the    opportunity   of   sending   our   officers,

particularly our local officers, overseas to attend

conferences  and  international meetings  where  we

hope  that  not only will they profit by  attending

these  meetings  but  that  they  may  be  able  to

contribute to them. If the hon. Member would like a

more detailed breakdown, I will endeavour to get it

and provide it for him.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is a popular

misunderstanding that to travel by sea, in the case

of officers going on home leave, is cheaper than by

air.  I  remember  this question was  thrashed  out

years  back in the City Council. Sir, what actually

happens is that air passages in many cases nowadays

are much cheaper than first-class sea passages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, when you send an officer by sea,

he  takes, say, 25 days to reach the United Kingdom

and  the  same period to come back, and during  all

that  time - 50 days in all - he is being paid a salary

and  he  does not have to do any work. In  fact,  I

think  he  likes to go by sea. But  if  you  pay  a

hundred dollars or so extra to get him to travel by

air,  then you will be able to get work out of  him

for  the  number  of days that  are  saved  by  his

travelling by air.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Hon. the Chief

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $7,475,320 for Head 8 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, here is another

example of extravagance. On page 53, sub-head 12, I

see that $12,000 is provided for telephones for the

Chief  Secretary's Office. I say "Office"  and  not

"Ministry",  because this $12,000 is  required  for

telephones  within that little building in  Empress

Place.  At  $135 for a business line, it works  out

roughly  to  about 90 direct lines for  that  small

building.  It  is  really surprising  that  such  a

little  building should require 90 direct lines.  I

wonder  how  many of the officers working  in  that

building  have  a separate line for  themselves,  a

line  from  the  Exchange to  that  building  whose

telephone  number is 2403, and how many more  lines

there are in their residences. I am quite sure that

this   figure  of  $12,000  covers  the  telephones

required  for the residences as well. I would  like

the  Chief  Secretary to inform us how many  direct

lines  there are to that building, how many outside

lines there are to that exchange of 2403, how  many

internal lines from that exchange of 2403, and  how

many  telephones are provided for officers in  that

building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, the hon. Member wants a great

mass  of  detailed information which I am afraid  I

cannot  give him, but I am fully prepared to accept

his  figure that there are possibly 90 direct lines

inside the Empress Place building, and I would also

assure  him that there is a vast number of officers

inside  that building! In fact, that is one of  the

reasons  why  later on you will find  that  we  are

asking  for further office accommodation. The  vote

does, of course, include the cost of providing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



telephones  for  officers' quarters.  The  vote  is

divided   between   the   cost   of   paying    the

subscriptions  for  the  telephones  both  in   the

offices  and in the quarters, and for the  cost  of

making   trunk  calls;  and  I  myself   am   quite

unrepentant about the size of this vote.  In  fact,

my  difficulty usually is to persuade the  Treasury

to  allow  me  to  have more money for  telephones,

because  personally I am a firm believer in  making

the  utmost  possible use of the modern methods  of

doing business. It may have been all very well many

years  ago  if  you  wanted  to  communicate   with

somebody  you  called  up a  messenger  who  walked

quietly across and waited for a couple of hours and

then brought back an answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, when we have a more advanced form

of  constitution, my experience is that answers are

wanted  a  great deal more quickly; and I  have  no

doubt  at  all  that  it  does  lead  to  increased

efficiency  and  speed  of  public  business  if  a

telephone is used, and the more use is made of  the

telephone,  the quicker the business is despatched.

Nor  am  I  in the least bit apologetic for  having

telephones  in  officers' quarters.  My  experience

during  the  last year or two has been that  office

hours  mean  little indeed and that it  is  vitally

important  to  be able to get hold  of  all  senior

officers at all times of the day and, I am sorry to

say,  on  several occasions at night, and having  a

telephone  in  their quarters has  been  absolutely

necessary.  For  those officers  who  do  not  have

telephones in their quarters, my view is that  they

should  have  telephones. So I fully  support  this

vote, Sir, and I am not in the least bit apologetic

about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I brought up

this question at an informal meeting and I was told

that  I  could not move an amendment to  scrap  the

Department  of Broadcasting unless I had permission

to  move from His Excellency the Governor.  I  know

that  His Excellency will follow the advice of  the

Council  of Ministers and so I did not try  to  get

his permission to move an amendment. I think I can,

Sir,  with your permission, speak generally on  the

subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member should not

assume things.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Coming to my topic, Sir, the

Department  of  Broadcasting is a  white  elephant,

being maintained by the Government for its own use.

They  have the Public Relations Office to publicise

their  viewpoint. Sir, in 1952 I moved a motion  on

Malayanisation which was passed, and  if  note  had

been  taken of this and if the Government  had  any

wish  to malayanise the Department of Broadcasting,

they could have then and there selected a few local

born   officers   for  training.  But   they   have

completely  ignored  my motion  on  Malayanisation.

This  Department  today is full of  expatriates.  I

understand only one Asian has been appointed to  an

administrative  post,  and  that  too  he  is  only

acting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, Sir, this Department of Broadcasting in

some  Commonwealth  countries - I  name  Ceylon   and

India -   is  run  on  a  commercial  basis   as   a

corporation  and  it makes money. I  would  suggest

that  we  have  an expert to run our Department  of

Broadcasting so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



it  can  make money. Today we are spending on  this

Department  over  $3,000,000 and  we  get  back  as

revenue,   in  the  form  of  Broadcast  Listeners'

Licence fees, only $1,115,000. We may be getting  a

portion of money from the Federation, but,  on  the

whole,  we are losing a lot. Why should we lose  at

all?  The  argument of the Government  is  that  it

should come under Government control, otherwise  it

might do something which might harm Government.  If

it  is conceded Government can put in as one of the

conditions,  that if the Department  is  run  as  a

corporation by a commercial concern, as is done  in

other countries, then the Government should have  a

nominee  on  the  Board  of Directors  in  deciding

policy  and other matters. Even the Government  can

use  it  by  paying fees, which may be very  little

because  matters  of  public  importance  will   be

definitely broadcast. So it is a farce to run  this

Department on money paid by the taxpayers who  have

no voice in running it.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  quite agree with the remarks put forward  by  my

friend   the  Member  for  Telok  Ayer.  A  special

committee  should  be  set up  to  investigate  the

possibility of turning Radio Malaya into  a  public

corporation  along the same lines  as  the  British

Broadcasting  Corporation in  the  United  Kingdom.

Sir,  with your permission, I would like  to  quote

you  some figures. In 1955 we imported 101,670 sets

of  radio  receivers  and  exported  15,000  sets - a

difference of 86,670 sets. From January  to  August

1956  we  imported 89,551 sets and  exported  8,462

sets - a  difference  of 81,089 sets.  The  total  of

these  sets  comes  to 167,759  sets  and  yet  the

Broadcast Listeners' Licence fees collected in 1955

was  $895,000, and in 1956 the fees collected  came

to $1,000,000. There is a difference of $105,000 in

licence fees collected, which is equivalent - at  $12

per  annum  for  a  set - to  8,750  sets.  That   is

nonsense.    This   Department   is   inefficiently

controlled,  and  it  is  a  sham  and  should   be

scrapped.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Is the hon. Member aware that

the collection of fees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



for  broadcasting is not the work of the Department

of Broadcasting?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I feel that

we  have been a little harsh with this broadcasting

organisation.  It is true that had Government  been

sincere  about Malayanisation, the staffing problem

would  have  been different; but you  cannot  blame

Radio   Malaya  for  the  insincerity  of  colonial

officials'  assertions, that they are  desirous  of

the welfare of the colonial people and desirous  of

assisting  loyally in Malayanisation.  That  is  no

fault  of Radio Malaya and the blame should not  be

put  at  the door of those who, though expatriates,

are  seeking  to  do a good job in that  particular

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer made a sweeping

dramatic  statement  about the white  elephant  for

Government  to  ride on. Sir, I would  respectfully

suggest  to  hon.  Members that if  they  knew  the

broadcasts made from the political point  of  view,

they  must recognise that there is a very conscious

effort   at  impartiality.  There  is  no  question

whatsoever but that the Chief Secretary has control

over  what goes out over Radio Malaya that may have

a  political aspect and I have no doubt that  there

are certain directions in this matter; but I do not

think that, by and large, we can say that there  is

any  grave  abuse of that power. I am not conscious

of  such abuse at all. It is true that we may be in

a  happier  position to have an  organisation  with

such  tremendous  influence over the  public  as  a

radio under impartial control and not under control

that  might at times take a political party aspect.

Sir, that is a question that should be studied  and

it  may well be a question for a motion before  the

Assembly; but to suggest that we scrap Radio Malaya

because it is filled with expatriates or because it

is  being  used  for political party or  government

propaganda  is, I think, to exaggerate, beyond  the

realms  of  the  practical, defects that  might  be

inherent in any government organisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, when I said

"scrap  the Department of Broadcasting", I did  not

mean that there should be no broadcasting at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



What I suggested was that it should be taken out of

government  control as a Government Department  and

be  made into a corporation or a commercial concern

so  that there will be no drain on the revenues  of

the colony and will be self-supporting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am unable

to  understand the purpose of the remarks  made  by

the  Hon. the Minister for Commerce and  Industry.

The  excuse  that he gave for the shortage  of  the

collection  of licence fees gave me the  impression

that it was due to the collection not being done by

the broadcasting station. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Somebody has got to be blamed.

Somebody must assume the blame and that illustrates

the  point that broadcasting should be in the hands

of   a   public  corporation,  because  no   public

corporation  would allow the collector  of  licence

fees  to  be  so negligent. If he is negligent,  he

will be sacked. In this case broadcasting is in the

hands of a Government department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, rather hard things have been said

about  Radio  Malaya. However, on second  thoughts,

the Member for Telok Ayer felt he does not want  to

scrap  it  after all. He merely wants to alter  the

constitution  which, no doubt, will  be  very  much

more  satisfactory for those who are interested  in

the radio business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I, first of all, deal with this question of

licence  fees, Sir? It seems to have  been  blindly

assumed  that  there is a grave  shortfall  in  the

licensing of radio sets, and my impression is  that

the  House  has  been led into that belief  by  the

figures which were produced by the Member for Tiong

Bahru; but those figures were not, if I may say so,

very  sound. He gave figures of the radio  business

showing  imports and exports and led us to  believe

that   the   difference   between   those   figures

represented  unlicensed radio  sets  in  Singapore.

That is certainly the impression he gave me. I hope

hon. Members will appreciate that a great number of

radio  sets  which  remain  in  Malaya  go  to  the

Federation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



and the licence fees for the Federation are not, of

course, shown in our revenues. I do not accept  for

one  minute  that  there is this  vast  discrepancy

between  the  number of radio sets in use  and  the

number  of licence fees. I would not maintain  that

the  collection of revenue is anything like 100 per

cent, but it certainly is a great deal better  than

it  was. I certainly do not think that we need look

around  for some scapegoat who needs to be  sacked,

if I may quote the words of another hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should then like to refer to the accusation

that this Department is full of expatriate officers

who  are  there  because  of  the  insincerity   of

colonial  officials' assertions. I  do  not  accept

either of those statements, Sir. The Department  is

not full of expatriate officers. If you look at the

Department,  if  you  look at  the  Report  of  the

Malayanisation Commission, and if you will consider

the   figures   for   Malayanisation   which   this

Government will shortly put before you, you will, I

hope,   agree   that  those  criticisms   are   not

justified. A very large number of officers from the

Broadcasting   Department   have   been   sent   on

scholarships for training over the past  few  years

and  the  fruits  of  those scholarships  and  that

training  are now being reaped by this  Government.

It is quite true that there is a high percentage of

expatriate  officers in the Engineering  Branch  of

Radio  Malaya. It is a highly technical  electrical

engineering Branch and it is not easy to find local

persons  with the necessary qualifications.  Again,

we  have sent local officers for training. It takes

a  very  long  time to produce radio  engineers  of

sufficient  experience and calibre to  replace  our

existing expatriate officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Sir, I should like now to deal with

what  I think is the main question raised, and that

is,  whether  it  is  right that  Radio  Malaya  in

Singapore should remain a Government department.  I

am  very  grateful to the Member for Cairnhill  for

his  tribute to the efforts which are made by those

in  charge of the News Room to present an impartial

account of the news. They have been criticised, and

no doubt they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



do from time to time make mistakes, but I do assure

the   House  that  the  officials  responsible  for

producing  the  news  on Radio  Malaya  do  try  to

maintain an impartial and factual approach. I think

this  is  very important, because once  your  radio

loses  the reputation for being factually  correct,

then  people will not listen to its news  and  they

will  listen  to  radios from  outside  which  will

probably be far more partial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming, if I may, briefly to the main question,

which  is,  should  it remain  a  department,  hon.

Members  will  recall that in the  Address  at  the

opening of this session, the Government stated,  as

a  matter of policy, that we were considering  this

very  problem of the future of Radio Malaya. We  do

not,  at  the moment, feel that it is necessary  to

set up a committee. It is a matter on which we have

to  consult  the Federation, and that  we  are  now

doing. It is not altogether a simple problem. There

is, first of all, the question as to whether or not

we  should  continue  to have  a  joint  department

serving both territories. Secondly, the question - if

it  is  to remain a common organisation (there  are

clearly  economic  advantages in that) - then  can  we

have   a   statutory   corporation   serving   both

territories? And there is the connected question on

which I have spoken before in this House, and  that

is  the question of television. Can we integrate  a

television  organisation with an  organisation  for

Radio Malaya? As we have said in the Address,  Sir,

this is a problem to which the Government is giving

consideration, and we are about to have discussions

with our colleagues from the Federation; and I hope

it  will not be too long a time before we are  able

to  produce a paper setting out our conclusions  as

to what is the right policy. But I must, of course,

emphasise that it is not a matter which we  control

alone.  It is a matter in which we have to work  in

step  and  in  harmony with the Government  of  the

Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, I am not convinced by the

answer  given  by the Hon. the Chief Secretary.  He

did  not explain why, for the years 1955 and  1956,

out of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



a  total  of  167,759 sets, only  8,462  sets  were

licensed. In other words, licences were granted for

8,462  sets.  The answer of the Chief Secretary  to

this  is  that  a  portion of these  licences  were

issued in the Federation. But, Sir, this is a  huge

difference.  We  are  short  of  money,   and   the

Government  should make an attempt to  catch  these

evaders  who  have not paid licence  fees.  Revenue

should be collected. In this connection, what about

the  revenue collected in 1952, 1953 and 1954?  And

yet,  Sir,  year  in  and  year  out,  the  revenue

collected remains at the figure of $1,000,000. That

is nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I am sure that, with this great

co-operation  from the Member for  Tiong  Bahru,  we

shall  be  able  to  tighten  up  still  more   the

collection of our revenue, but I would not like him

to  think that I see any immediate prospect of  the

cost of our broadcasting service being balanced  by

the  collection of licence fees. This is one of the

factors  which  we  have to take  into  account.  I

think, even if we set up a corporation, the revenue

from  licence fees would still not meet  the  cost,

though  we  will, of course, endeavour  to  do  our

utmost  with  the hon. Member's kind assistance  to

step up the efficiency of our collection.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Hon. the Chief

the Engineering section.

a parallel service rendered by Rediffusion Limited,

a  loss. It is not producing programme inferior  to

Furthermore,  Sir, I am certain  that  more  people

make  use  of  Rediffusion  than  they  do  of  the

Department of Broadcasting. [Interruption.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am very glad, Sir, that a

stop is put to this rowdyism! Coming back to what I

have  just said, Sir, I think, from that  point  of

view,  there  is good reason for a  change,  and  a

change  for the better. In everything that  we  do,

Sir,  we  will  only put our best foot  forward  if

there  is competition. In the present case, whether

a  good  job is done or a not so good job is  done,

the  fact remains that there is always security for

the  worker.  But  if  the Broadcasting  Department

becomes a public corporation, then the people there

must use their energies. They have to think of  how

to improve things in order that they can get better

conditions.  Of  course,  Sir,  when  Radio  Malaya

becomes a public corporation, everybody will have a

fair  chance of making use of it and not  just  the

Government, as it is at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I remember that last year we

had  an  agreement that the Government  side  would

have  a certain amount of time allotted to it  over

the  air  on Radio Malaya and that some time  would

also  be  given to the Opposition Parties  for  the

same purpose. We have not had that opportunity yet,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, may I remind

the  hon.  Member  that  there  was,  in  fact,  no

agreement, though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



the   Government  tried  very  hard   to   allocate

proportionate time for both the Government and  the

Opposition  Parties  to go  on  the  air  on  Radio

Malaya,  and because no agreement could be reached,

no  political Party has had access to Radio  Malaya

at all, apart from election time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> May I elaborate, Sir? I had a

letter  from  the Government Whip  on  this  matter

agreeing  to  all that, and if there had  been  any

change, I should have been informed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> A short memory!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, as I

understand the Member for Serangoon, his grouse  is

not  on  the  question whether  the  Department  of

Broadcasting should become a public corporation  or

should remain under Government control, but because

the  Opposition was not given enough time. Sir, the

same  inconsistency came up yesterday when I  asked

him  whether  he  wanted to scrap  the  pan-Malayan

structure  and he said the Government  should  have

consulted  the Opposition. So the whole grouse  was

because  the  Opposition had  not  been  consulted,

otherwise everything would have been all right.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, when speaking on the subject of the

Singapore  Battalion on the Second Reading,  I  had

hoped to obtain a reply regarding Government policy

from  the  hon. Gentlemen opposite,  but  none  was

forthcoming.  I  hope today that  they  will  be  a

little  more  explicit. The fact is that  in  April

last year we were promised by the Chief Minister of

the day that the first Singapore Battalion would be

in  operational existence by April 1957.  To-date,

recruitment  has not even begun.  As  I  stated  on

Monday, only $2,500,000 has been allowed for  under

various heads in the Estimates to train, equip  and

officer the 800 men. My object, Sir, in moving this

amendment  is  not to complain that the  sum  under

this  head is too much, but rather to query whether

it  is  sufficient, if the Government is in earnest

to  have a battalion with its full complement under

training  at  the  earliest possible  moment;  what

rates of pay are to be offered; how many men are to

be  recruited and at what age; what are their terms

of service and prospects; and when will recruitment

begin?  I therefore ask this question to which  the

House has the right to a full answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I can at once give the hon.

Member  the  assurance which I think he seeks,  and

that is, that the Government does firmly intend  to

proceed with raising this Singapore Battalion,  and

we  are  still hoping to achieve that in  the  very

near  future.  I think his disquiet  partly  arises

from   the  figures  in  the  Estimates,  and   the

explanation  is this: that we were advised  by  the

military experts that we should probably need a sum

of   the  order  of  $3.6  million  for  the   pay,

maintenance and equipment of the battalion, but  it

is  quite evident that the battalion cannot  be  at

full  battalion strength at the very  beginning  of

this coming year, and we have therefore entered the

figures  which  appear  in the  Estimates - it  is  a

million  dollars under the head which  we  are  now

discussing,  I  think, and $500,000  under  another

head,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



and  there is a million dollars further back in the

Defence  Estimates.  Those  figures,  Sir,  do  not

purport to be the full cost, but they purport to be

as reasonable an estimate as we can make of what we

expect  to spend. The Treasury, financially,  I  am

sure  Members would agree, did not wish to  include

in  the  Estimates a figure which there was  little

prospect of spending, thereby upsetting the balance

of  the  Estimates. It is our intention to raise  a

battalion  and  we have put in the money  which  we

hope  to spend. If events move faster, and we would

welcome  them  to  move faster, and  we  need  more

funds,  we  shall, of course, come  here  for  more

funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I would like

to  touch  upon  the  most expensive  toy  Navy  in

history - the Royal Malayan Navy.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member speaking on the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I beg your pardon, no.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would just like to

say  that  I  consider  that a  very  disappointing

answer. If, as I understand it, it is going to cost

$3.6 million to make the battalion operational  and

only  $2� million is provided for, that means that

there  will be no Singapore battalion in  operation

until  1958 - or  more  than a year  after  what  was

promised us last April.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, much depends on the meaning of

the word "operational". If by "operational" we mean

by the end of the coming year we can have a regular

battalion  fully  trained in all  the  arts  of  an

infantry soldier, then, of course, the answer  must

be no. That would not be possible. I think it would

probably take at least two or three years to get  a

battalion  up  to  the  full standard  of  infantry

training. But if by "operational" we only mean that

by  the  end  of the year we should  have  had  our

battalion   well   established - we   hope   up    to

strength - and  completed their basic  training,  and

therefore  a  formed and disciplined  body  of  men

making good progress, then I think there is still a

prospect. In that sense we might be operational.  I

say "prospect" advisedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $11,168,390 for Head 12 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, the Imperial

Government   has   insisted   during    the    last

constitutional talks, and well before - in  fact,  it

was   conceded  freely  before  the  constitutional

talks - that it should have complete control of  the

defence  of Singapore. This was necessary, not  for

the   purposes  of  Singapore,  Sir,  but  for  the

purposes  of  the international defence commitments

of the United Kingdom. That being the case, Sir, it

seems  to me wholly inappropriate to call upon  the

people of Singapore to pay for imperial expenditure

and  imperial defence services, since those defence

services are not primarily intended for the welfare

of  the  people  of Singapore. Sir,  we  have  been

spending, and we are promised that we shall  spend,

fantastic  millions  on a toy  Navy  which  has  no

relationship to our needs and which has never  been

utilised  for  our  welfare. I have  sought,  by  a

question, to elicit information as to the policy of

the  Imperial Government, necessarily not  of  this

Government,  with  reference  to  these   matters - a

policy which could have been indicated by the Chief

Secretary - and the Financial Secretary has  avoided

the  point, the question being directed to  him  on

financial   aspects.  I  have  sought   to   obtain

information  as  to the policy which  would  govern

expenditure  for the next five years, since  I  see

that  we  are down for $15 million for, I  believe,

four  minesweepers - and not tin  minesweepers.  They

have  nothing to do with any productive effort  and

nothing  to  do  with  any topical  aspect  of  the

welfare  of  the people of Singapore. I,  for  one,

Sir,  as  a citizen of this territory, deplore  the

horrible  waste of considerable sums  of  money  on

this  toy Navy, and I call upon the Chief Secretary

to  give  this  country a full explanation  of  the

intentions of the Imperial Government, in so far as

this Government knows them, as concern our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



expenditure   on  matters  which  do  not   concern

Singapore  but concern external defence  which  the

United  Kingdom  insists  on  retaining,  and  will

continue  to  insist  on  retaining,  and  in  fact

retains.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir, I fully agree with the  Member  for

Cairnhill  who has just spoken on the Royal  Malayan

Navy.  It  has  been admitted many  times  in  this

House,  Sir,  that  Singapore is  still  a  British

colony. As such, matters of external defence should

be  borne  by Her Majesty's Government.  I  see  no

justification  that  salaries  and  allowances  for

officers  on  loan  from  the  Royal  Navy  to  the

Singapore Government should be met by the Singapore

Government and not by the British Admiralty.



<br><br>11.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am somewhat

surprised! I thought I should get much  more  of  a

thrashing  from the Member for Cairnhill  over  the

Singapore  Battalion than over  the  Royal  Malayan

Navy.  Life  is full of surprises! The hon.  Member

used  some hard words about the Royal Malayan Navy,

calling  it  "a toy Navy" and a waste of  fantastic

millions, suggesting that it is never utilised  for

our  welfare,  and  that he deplored  its  horrible

waste.   Sir,  it  can  well  be  said   that   all

expenditure on military forces is a horrible waste,

but unfortunately we still live in times when it is

necessary to spend money on those forces. While, of

course,   they  are  unproductive,  they   do   add

something, I think, to the sum of human values; and

that  is, when you create an organisation  such  as

the  Royal  Malayan  Navy and in  this  interest  a

number of young men, you do produce something  that

goes beyond the men, goes beyond the buildings, and

goes  beyond the weapons or the ships they may use.

And  the Royal Malayan Navy, in its short life, has

already produced something for which alone much  of

the expenditure would have been worthwhile. That is

a  sense of service and a sense of belonging to  an

organisation  in which you can have  pride  and  in

which I hope your country can have pride.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am asked by the Member or Cairnhill

to  state the intentions of he Imperial Government.

I  have  no brief, Sir, to speak on behalf  of  the

Imperial Government, nor indeed do I think that the

intentions  of the Imperial government really  come

into this issue at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of taking up some of your time, I

should like to put the Royal Malayan Navy into  its

proper  historical background, and  I  will  start,

Sir,  with  the time in 1939, 1940, 1941  and  1942

when  war was very close to Singapore but  not  yet

upon  us,  and when our friends were far  away  and

heavily  committed and could do little for  us.  At

that  time,  Sir, the waters of this great  seaport

were  kept safe for the ships of the world to  come

and go, for our life-blood to continue to flow,  by

a  comparatively  small number of  young  men  from

Singapore  and the Federation who were prepared  to

man  small  ships, referred to scathingly  as  "toy

ships", "tin-ships". They were not very big  ships.

But  those men performed a very vital function here

in sweeping the mines and ensuring that, regardless

of  what happened on the main battlefields  of  the

global war, Singapore's life could still go on.  It

was  very  much on the tradition of that  Singapore

Naval  Volunteer Force that a small  Malayan  naval

unit  was  formed during the war  by  a  number  of

people who had succeeded in making their escape and

who also served throughout the whole of the rest of

the  war  while  many  of  us  were  prevented   by

circumstances  from  doing anything;  and  on  that

tradition, on that small nucleus, the Royal Malayan

Navy has been built up to what it is today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background of building up the Royal Malayan

Navy was the background of an agreed policy between

the  two Governments - the Federation (or the Malayan

Union, as it may have been) and Singapore. While it

is  quite  true - I will anticipate the  point  which

will be made - that in those days the Government  was

run by the colonial officials who decided precisely

what  these  two Governments would do, (that  is  a

criticism that people can make), I do not think  it

holds any water at all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



because, in fact, moneys for these services had  to

be  voted through the Legislative Councils; and the

colonial officials, however much they might want to

"oppress" the people of Singapore, could not do  it

unless  they  were able to persuade the  unofficial

majority to vote the moneys through. Anyway, it was

decided,   as  a  matter  of  pan-Malayan   defence

organisation, that these two territories  would  do

something to contribute towards their own  defence.

It  was also decided, with the full concurrence and

agreement  of  the  then  representatives  of   the

people - some of them elected - that the most practical

and  efficient way of doing that was for Singapore,

which,  as  I  say,  had  already  this  very  fine

tradition of a Navy and which had on the island the

big  resources of the Royal Naval Base, to shoulder

the  task  of providing a Royal Malayan Navy - not  a

Singapore  Navy, but a Royal Malayan  Navy - for  the

whole of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Federation Government

undertook  to  develop the Army side.  There  again

that  seems  to  me to have been  a  very  sensible

decision.   The   Federation  had  this   wonderful

tradition of the Malay Regiment, two battalions  of

which  took  part  in  the  fighting  against   the

Japanese,  and  the  First  Battalion,   I   think,

distinguished itself then as highly  as  any  other

battalion  during  the  Malayan  campaign.  So  the

Federation had the tradition of the Malay Regiment.

They  had  the manpower, and they said  they  would

undertake to build up the infantry forces.  And  it

was  on  that  basis that the plans were  made  and

moneys were voted by the two Councils over a period

of   years  which  led  to  the  creation  of  very

considerable military forces by the Federation, and

of  this very fine little Royal Malayan Navy  which

was supported by Singapore. The whole basis of that

was  the  pooling of interests, a joint effort  for

the  common good, and it was not suggested that the

functions  and the size of the Royal  Malayan  Navy

should  be limited only by the area of water around

Singapore,  or that the military forces  raised  in

the   Federation  should  be  limited   purely   to

Federation needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now, of course, moved into a

different set of circumstances where the Federation

Government   is   rapidly   moving   towards   full

independence and we in Singapore are moving towards

an  interim stage. So the question now is  whether,

under  the  new constitutional circumstances  which

will   exist  next  year,  these  plans  and  these

arrangements  are  still sound. That  is  a  matter

which   we   are  discussing  with  the  Federation

Government,  and I think I can say  at  this  stage

that the indications are that while we in Singapore

have  already  decided that we must build  up  some

military force - at least one battalion, and possibly

two   battalions  of  soldiers  here - similarly  the

Federation  Government have come to the  conclusion

that they must build up a naval force and not leave

it entirely to Singapore. It would seem, therefore,

at  first sight that the two Governments are moving

on  lines which will complement each other in  that

the  Federation Government, I think, wish to accept

responsibility  for the naval  force,  and  to  the

extent  that they do that, we shall be relieved  of

that  part  of the pan Malayan share.  We,  on  the

other  hand,  are wishing to put our  money  rather

into  a  battalion of troops than into ships.  What

decisions we shall finally reach I cannot yet  say,

but  I hope that the conversations which we are  to

have  in  the near future will enable us  to  reach

agreement  on  broad policy; and in  the  light  of

that,  we  shall be able to consider  in  Singapore

what to do for our future naval commitments. It  is

because this problem is still under discussion  and

because  we  have not yet reached firm  conclusions

that  I  am  not able, unfortunately, to  give  the

Member for Cairnhill what he would like - which is  a

firm  statement of what we propose to  do  for  the

naval  force  of Singapore and what we  propose  to

spend on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add, I think, one last point, and

that is that in putting our minds to the problem of

building  up  a  military  force,  do  not  let  us

altogether overlook the fact that Singapore is  one

of  the major seaports of the world, that our  life

does depend on the freedom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



of ships coming and going, and that in time of war,

when  people drop mines, it is only by having  some

small  ships  which would keep your sealanes  clear

that  you will get your ships in and out.  I  think

there is a certain minimum commitment for Singapore

to  safeguard its own front door, as it were, which

should not be overlooked, viewing the Royal Malayan

Navy  through pan-Malayan eyes. I am sorry  that  I

cannot  give  a firm assurance as to  what  we  are

going  to do and I have no doubt that this question

will  come  up  again when we are  dealing  with  a

development  head  for capital expenditure,  and  I

think I will not say any more on that till we  come

to it.

impressed  by the strong nationalist feeling  shown

by  the Member for Cairnhill in connection with the

Royal  Malayan  Navy. We have also to  express  our

appreciation of the detailed explanation  from  the

Hon. the Chief Secretary on the Royal Malayan Navy.

But,  Sir,  one main question which both  sides  of

this  House have not touched is whether there is  a

possibility  of  any enemy invading  this  country.

Therefore, we must be prepared to spend  a  certain

amount  of  money on defence expenditure.  Sir,  at

this juncture, I must pay a tribute to the Hon. the

Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya when  he

decided   that  the  Federation  of   Malaya   will

definitely  not  join  the  S.E.A.T.O. pact.  Sir,

although it looks as if many people have overlooked

it, yet to me this decision of the Federation Chief

Minister  carries a very important significance  of

an independent administrative policy as regards the

future  of this territory. We have to bear in  mind

the spirit that has been brought about by the Asian-African  Conference, and the circumstances  of  the

world  today when, at this juncture, we  debate  on

whether  or not to spend our hard earned  money  on

building  up  a  Navy - as the  Chief  Secretary  has

explained,  a  minesweeper that will  protect  this

territory  or  render certain conveniences  to  our

great seaport



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Four minesweepers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> But, Sir, I am reminded that

although  our  Malayan coast was protected  by  two

great  fighting ships - the Prince of Wales  and  the

Repulse - during  the  last war, yet  this  territory

fell  into  enemy hands. Even though Singapore  and

the Federation of Malaya may pool their revenue,  I

wonder  whether  they  can  afford  to  build  many

battleships. I am sure hon. Members in  this  House

will  agree with me that we cannot afford to  build

even one. Therefore, to build up a Malayan Navy  to

defend  this  coast is, to me, not only unnecessary

but a mockery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which strikes me and all political

Parties in this colony is that the supreme power in

this   territory  still  lies  with   the   British

Government. Furthermore, in view of the  fact  that

the  constitutions of Singapore and the  Federation

are  in  the  hands of the British  Government,  we

agree that external defence should rest solely with

the   British   Government.  Therefore,   at   this

juncture,  I  do  not think it is any  use  talking

about building a Royal Malayan Navy. Sir, I wish to

put   an   alternative  suggestion  to  the   Chief

Secretary  for  his  consideration,  and  that  is,

whether it is possible to hold up this issue  until

Singapore becomes a State and not still a colony.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on this

question of film censorship, I have just one or two

comments  to make. I want to draw the attention  of

the Government to the type of films which are shown

in  the  colony. On the whole, they do not tend  to

make  people  work in the direction of obeying  law

and  order  or  of getting them to work  harder  at

their  jobs. Rather these films work in  the  wrong

direction  in  that they incite  people  to  commit

crime  where they did not know how to do it before!

I am aware of a number of films which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



show  techniques employed by gangsters and robbers.

These  techniques hitherto have not been  known  to

the people of Singapore, although probably they are

known  in Chicago. I would recommend that the Board

of  Film  Censors take note of such things so  that

any  film, which tends to lower the morals  of  the

people of Singapore or gives them a better idea  of

how to commit crimes and get away with them, should

be  censored  to a greater extent. Furthermore,  we

have  our  local  film industry coming  up  and  it

should receive more encouragement, bearing in  mind

also  the  film  import tax in  the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I very much share the views expressed

by  the Member for Serangoon, Sir, that the general

standard  of the films shown is not all that  could

be  desired. The question is how far by  censorship

we   can  improve  it.  Censorship  is  a  somewhat

difficult  subject.  The  position  in   the   Film

Censor's Office, as the hon. Member knows, is  that

we have two or three persons who view the films and

decide  whether  or not they can  be  passed.  Then

there is an Appeal Board which consists of a number

of,  I  hope, representative citizens of Singapore.

If  we  ask the Film Censor to tighten up  a  great

deal  on the ordinary run of films that come in,  I

think you will find that there will be a great many

appeals before the Appeal Board, and I am not  sure

how  far  the Appeal Board would be able to sustain

the  Film  Censor. But I am sure the remarks  which

have  been made will not be lost on those  who  are

responsible   for  taking  these   very   difficult

decisions as to what films to allow in and how  far

it  is  possible to make cuts in the  film  without

completely ruining it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $20l,040 for Head 13 ordered to stand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



Information Services, Grade F, on page  94  of  the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Lee Kuan Yew's absence, the amendment was not proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move the

amendment standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 11, Tourist Promotion, on  page

96 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since I spoke on the subject of tourist

promotion this time last year, I am glad  that  the

Government has made some progress in this matter in

the  past 12 months. A Working Party was set up  to

go into the problem of starting a tourist bureau in

Singapore, and one of its recommendations was  that

an   expert  in  tourism  be  invited  to  come  to

Singapore   and   make   an  examination   of   the

possibilities.  An expert from New Zealand  is  now

here, I believe, and he has made his report. It  is

to  be  hoped  that the Government  will  now  take

another  step forward and follow through  with  his

recommendations  in so far as they  prove  suitable

and to use his advice, while he is here, to get the

bureau started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask Members of this House to realise

that,  when talking about tourism, you are  talking

of  an  industry - the tourist industry - and Singapore

is  not  so rich as to be able to afford to neglect

any  form  of  industry which will be  of  economic

benefit.  Countries  like  Japan  and  Hawaii  have

benefited   enormously.  Japan  last  year   earned

$45,400,000 from tourists; Hawaii $16 million;  and

there  is  no reason why we should not do something

of  the same sort. Our attractions, to mention some

of the more obvious ones which our visitors comment

on,    are   our   multiracial   friendliness   and

colourfulness, our variety of foods,  our  tropical

fruits  and  fish and orchids, our housing  schemes

and our clinics. Our people must be educated to  be

tourist-conscious so that they are  more  aware  of

the  benefits  which  it  can  bring  and  so  that

visitors  can be persuaded to stay on for a  longer

period.  We have much in Singapore to be  proud  of

and much to show those who stay here, and I am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



sure  that  we always realise this fact. I  repeat,

Sir,  Singapore  has  so few indigenous  industries

that the Government must go all out to develop  the

tourist  industry and to enlist the co-operation  of

the  commercial concerns such as the shipping lines

and  the airlines and so on. I hope that the  small

amount  done in last year will be largely increased

in  the  coming year, and my object in moving  this

amendment is to draw attention to the fact that the

amount  of $20,000 under this head, although double

the  amount allotted last year, is not too much but

too  little,  and  from  the explanatory  note,  it

appears that the money is to be spent on literature

and  not  on the tourist bureau, where the tourists

start.   The  literature  put  up  by  the   Public

Relations  Office, to my mind, is not  particularly

attractive.  I would say that the visitor  is  more

likely  to  be  attracted  to  Singapore  and   the

Federation by the Straits Times Annual than by  the

Businessman's  Guide. The reason is no  doubt  that

the  Public Relations Office is not best suited  to

provide  this  type  of thing and  that  a  tourist

expert is needed to carry out this kind of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Chief Secretary will tell us what

plans  are being made for the future and will  give

us  the  assurance that the Government  intends  to

take  the tourist industry very seriously so as  to

improve and increase our national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I agree with

every  word  of what my hon. Friend the Member  for

Tanglin  has  said. I always say that  we  have  no

natural  resources and we have to develop something

which   can  give  us  more  revenue.  The  tourist

industry is one of the best forms to get revenue in

the  sense  that Singapore is the centre of  South-

East Asia. It is a very important port of call  for

steamers,   aeroplanes   and   other    means    of

communication.  The  tourist industry  is  an  idea

which  we got from E.C.A.F.E. many years ago, but

unfortunately  it has not been developed.  Although

Singapore  is a small city, we can, if we publicise

it well, keep the tourists' stay here longer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



So  can the Federation if it does the same. And the

more  days we can keep the tourists here, the  more

money  will Singapore earn. Sir, I heartily support

this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this is one occasion

where I agree entirely with the Member for Tanglin.

He  is  right in what he has said but,  of  course,

since  his  amendment proposes a reduction  in  the

vote although he would like to have it increased. I

cannot support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a conventional amendment, Mr

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I know, Sir. The hon. Member

raised  the  point that we should try to  encourage

the tourist industry. In fact, Sir, I remember that

the  Member  for Cairnhill himself gave  a  lot  of

attention  to  this matter and we are now  awaiting

the  report from the expert. If Singapore  is  well

advertised, Sir, we may be able to draw  a  lot  of

tourists  here. But, Sir, may I draw the  attention

of  a certain section of this House to the fact the

Singapore  is  being  well  advertised  in  another

way - by the riots and the troubles that we have had?

That  kind  of advertisement, Sir, is  not  to  our

credit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, it is a

delightful if somewhat foreign feeling to  be  able

to  say that I agree with everything that everybody

has  said! I do, Sir, and I would only like to  add

this  as a contribution to the debate: One  of  the

main obstacles to the development of Singapore as a

tourist  centre is the limited and expensive  hotel

accommodation. Sir, compared to any other  city  in

any other country, it is extraordinary that in this

territory  we cannot get hotel accommodation  of  a

character  demanded  by  the  tourists,  but  at  a

reasonable figure. We have hotels for the very rich

and we have hotels for the lower income groups, but

we  have  no  hotels for the type of  tourists  who

would  like  to  visit  Singapore - for  instance,  a

school  teacher  or  a clerk from  the  territories

around  us. I was looking forward to Merdeka Bridge

and  Merdeka Highway, because I was hoping  that  a

site would then be made available - and a site is now

available,  a wonderful site for a hotel.  A  large

hotel can be built on this site to accommodate  300

to 500 people on the seaside. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



is  an unusual request, Sir, but since we failed to

interest  local  capital and  foreign  capital  (an

American group) in putting up a hotel at a moderate

price,  I  would  ask whether the Government  would

consider  the  question of putting  up  a  building

which  it could then lease out to be managed  as  a

hotel at very reasonable rates per day. That would,

in  my  opinion, go a very long way towards helping

Singapore became a tourist centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Sir I have

just  one  comment  to make in reply  to  the  very

interesting  suggestion put forward by  the  Member

for  Cairnhill.  The  Nicoll  Highway  and  Merdeka

Bridge   area  is  not  suitable  for  very   large

buildings  unless you are prepared to put  in  very

long  piles and sink a great deal of money  in  the

foundations. We had 160-foot piles under  parts  of

the  bridge.  Well,  that adds enormously  to  your

capital  investment, and consequently a hotel  with

that  length of pile underneath it would require  a

very high tariff from those people who make use  of

it  and would be very much of a luxury hotel.  That

is  a matter for very careful thought. To put up  a

middle-class or a lower-middle-class hotel, I think

your site would have to be elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, Singapore

has  a  warm  climate which is very  attractive  to

people in Europe. We also have palm trees and  blue

skies,  but all these things can also be  found  in

Hawaii  and Ceylon and Djakarta and elsewhere.  But

there  are some things that Singapore can boast  of

which  other places cannot, and these are the  many

races living here and the many cultures flourishing

around us. In effect, Sir, I am suggesting that  if

we are to ask our Information Services to publicise

Singapore,  we  must  have materials  for  them  to

publicise.   We  must  build  up   some   sort   of

speciality,  which  will be a real  attraction  for

tourists.  In  Singapore we have  quite  a  lot  of

religious   and   traditional   ceremonies.   These

emanated from India and other places many years ago

but  are now no more followed in those lands.  They

are however still practised here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



We  have  also  music  of many  varieties -  Indian,

Chinese,   Malay, etc.  All  these   things   need

encouragement.  It  is not just  the  work  of  the

Information Services. They have also to  work  with

the  police, so that the latter can issue them with

the necessary permits to carry out these things. We

will   then  have  something  for  the  Information

Services   who  will  be  able  to  make  Singapore

attractive to the tourists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, naturally I am gratified to find

on  both  sides  of the House so much  support  for

industry  in  Singapore. I would just like  to  say

that we have not received the final report from the

Colombo  Plan expert who visited us, but I am  told

the  report will be ready very shortly. I  am  also

told   that   it  will  make  recommendations   for

considerably increased expenditure on  the  tourist

industry.  I  cannot yet say for what  aspects  the

money   will   be  required,  but  I   shall   have

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think

both sides of the House are aware that although the

Information  Services seems to be a new department,

it  is,  in  fact, a change in name only  from  the

Public Relations Office, and therefore we can trace

the  amount of work between the Government and  the

people, especially on the information side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out to the House that I, for one,

am  very unhappy about the duties performed by  the

then  Public Relations Office I have no doubt  that

many  officers in that Office have tried their best

to  perform an efficient service but there is still

a tendency for this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



Office to neglect its duty of informing the public.

In  particular, the non-English-speaking public  are

not provided with the information to which they are

entitled. I think this is the right and proper time

for  Government to adopt a new approach towards our

people, most of whom are illiterate and not  civic-minded.  As one of the functions of the Information

Services,  many hundreds of pictures  of  Ministers

performing   opening   ceremonies   or   delivering

speeches  have  been  circulated.  Sir,  I  am  not

opposing  this function of the Information Services

to  inform the public that such and such a Minister

is  working  very hard or that he has visited  such

and  such  a place with pictures of him circulated;

but  there are many more important functions  which

the  Information Services can perform. One of  them

is  to  inform the public of the current  state  of

affairs in Singapore of which I am sure the  public

are ill-informed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to remind the Government

to  utilise fully the facilities which they possess

in  the  Information Services, and  not  only  give

information  but,  at the same  time,  educate  the

people properly. The debate now is on taxation  but

I  wonder  how  many citizens in Singapore  realise

that  taxation is necessary if every citizen  wants

to benefit socially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month's rioting, a most regrettable

incident, will, I hope, wake the Government  up  to

the  fact that the public have been misinformed  in

many,  many things. It is very important  that  the

Government  should bear the responsibility  of  not

only  informing the public, if possible,  of  every

detail that passes but also of educating our people

and  making sure that the Information Services will

not be an instrument merely to serve the Government

and not the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I do not think that any of us on

this  side  of  the  House  would  profess  to   be

satisfied  with the extent to which our Information

Services  succeed  in reaching  the  population  of

Singapore. We are fully conscious, Sir, of the need

to do a great deal more and, in particular, of this

difficulty of reaching the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



non-English speaking sections of the population and

the  sections of the population which have had less

advantage of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall), speaking

a few days ago, rightly pointed out that one of the

basic  problems that has to be solved  here  is  to

draw   the   two   sections   of   the   population

together - those who can speak and understand English

and those who cannot. I do accept - and I am sure  my

colleagues  would wish me to accept - the  criticism

made  by  the  hon. Member that we  are  not  doing

enough. We are trying to do what we can. Perhaps  I

could  say as a slight token of what has been  done

that we have strengthened during the past year what

I  now call the Chinese-speaking staff in the  what

was  then  the  Public Relations Office.  We  were,

unfortunately,  through  other  demands,  short  of

staff  in the Public Relations Office through  most

of this year. I hope that we shall be able to bring

that  staff  back up to full strength  and  we  are

fully  conscious of the importance of strengthening

those  who can speak and read Chinese and who  will

know  how to so present material that it will reach

home to those sections of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last thing I would add, Sir, and that is

that  we  do,  at  this  very  moment,  have  under

consideration   proposals  for  strengthening   and

enlarging  this  department now to  be  called  the

Department of Information Services. It is my regret

that those proposals were not completed in time  to

be   included  in  the  Estimates  now  before  the

Assembly but it is my very earnest hope that  in  a

sitting - perhaps  our  next sitting,  if  not  then,

certainly the first sitting in February - I  hope  to

come  to  this  Assembly for  an  increase  in  the

provision   for   the   Information   Services   to

strengthen us and to do a little more than  we  are

doing  now  to  meet  the  criticism  which,  quite

rightly, has been expressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $25,373,140 for Head 16 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, whenever

the  word  "Police" is mentioned to the Public,  it

gives  them  a  picture of  a  force  that  is  not

friendly and finds fault with the people, and of  a

force that seems always to look at things the wrong

way. I am certain, Sir, that this is due mainly  to

the  arrangement of the police in  stations.  As  a

matter  of  fact, we find that in police  stations,

the   business  that  is  transacted  is  not  only

confined  to crime but also related to such  things

as registration of births and deaths, the obtaining

of  a  permit for a procession, and so on. However,

whenever  a  person  goes to register  his  child's

birth,  he is usually being given a treat also,  to

other aspects of police work. I would say that that

aspect  of  the  business  does  not  help  him  to

appreciate the work of the police too much. Lately,

I have seen some improvements in this direction and

I  have  seen  that in police stations,  they  have

tried  to  separate the two things - crime  from  the

ordinary  business  of the day - instead  of  having

everything done on a long counter. But it  has  not

been done sufficiently. I think that the separation

should be complete so that the people who go  along

on  their lawful business should feel confident  of

walking into a police station and having their work

done  in a cordial manner and in an atmosphere that

is  almost like an office. One suggestion  I  would

like  to  make, Sir, is that, instead of  having  a

policeman  in  uniform, he might very  well  be  in

mufti to deal with non-criminal matters. That would

probably  help  the  people,  who  would  be   less

reluctant to go into a police station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point, of course, Sir, is that the

trouble  today  would have been less  if  everybody

could  treat the policeman as a friend and walk  up

to  him  and  ask him to solve their  difficulties.

Then  probably, you will find that  there  will  be

less hatred. This, of course, cannot be achieved in

a day or in a few months. It will probably take one

or two years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



but  I am certain that if the Government puts up  a

scheme whereby every policeman is given a course in

which he is instructed how to help the public,  how

to  be courteous to them and how, sometimes, to  go

out of their way to help them in little matters, it

will help tremendously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerning this Head, Sir, is

regarding the policemen themselves. It seems to me,

Sir,  that police personnel are being provided with

quarters  for  which a percentage of their  pay  is

deducted. However, let us take the case, Sir, of  a

policeman  who is in Grade III. He should  live  in

Grade III quarters, but if he should be given Grade

IV  quarters,  he would still have to  pay  at  the

Grade   III  rate.  I  would  be  obliged   if   an

explanation could be given in this matter.  I  know

also,  Sir,  that if, a Grade III officer  were  to

live in Grade II quarters, he would have to pay  at

the Grade II rate. I shall be glad, Sir, to have an

explanation for this.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I rise to

support every word of what the Member for Serangoon

has just said. Despite the efficiency of our police

force,   we   must  admit  that  there   is   still

misunderstanding between the police and the  people

of  Singapore.  The non-English-speaking  and  non-Malay  group especially do not feel that the police

are  their servants or friends or protectors of law

and  order.  They  merely  treat  a  policeman   as

somebody  unapproachable. We  have  witnessed  many

changes and improvements, as mentioned by the  hon.

Member just now. We do not want to look on a police

station as a fearful place but as a place where  we

can  sit  down comfortably to do our business.  The

people in a police station only deal with those who

can  speak  English or Malay. But what about  those

who  cannot converse in those languages? Therefore,

I   suggest  that  the  Hon. the  Chief  Secretary

consider having a Chinese-speaking officer in every

police station on a 24-hour service. I also wish to

point  out to the Hon. the Chief Secretary that  we

have,   in  Singapore,  many  Chinese  plainclothes

officers   and   detectives  and  a   few   Chinese

constables in uniforms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> They will not join.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Why? The Government should go

all out to try and get them to join. Maybe it is  a

question  of  pay  or accommodation,  and  we  must

overcome this problem. Look at the Hongkong Police;

they  are all Chinese. I think there is very little

difference  between the Hongkong  Chinese  and  the

Singapore  Chinese as regards their traditions  and

mentality.  How is it that the Hongkong  Government

manages  to  have  so  many Chinese  constables  in

uniform?  We  must therefore try to encourage  more

Chinese to join our police force even to the extent

of spending more money.



<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am sorry that

hon.  Members should feel it necessary  to  stress,

after  recent  events,  any attitude  of  hostility

between  the  police force and police stations  and

members of the public. At the same time, I am  glad

to  hear  that the Member for Serangoon  did  think

that  there had been some improvement and  I  think

that the Member for Changi really put his finger on

the  basic  difficulty and it is  a  difficulty  of

language.  The  arrangements that we  have  at  the

moment  are that we always try to have one Chinese-speaking  officer in every police station but  that

does  not mean that there is always a man available

when two or three people go in one after the other.

So  we  just  cannot  invariably  have  a  Chinese-speaking  officer available and the  answer,  I  am

sure, is that we must somehow persuade more of  our

Chinese citizens to join the force. I do not  think

that there is anything wrong with the rates of pay.

I  think it is that, for many generations,  it  has

been  accepted that the police force  is  recruited

from  a  certain section of the community  and  the

other section has not yet developed a tradition  of

joining it -

exactly  what the work of these statisticians  will

be  and what assistance they will give to Singapore

as  a  whole. In fact. I move this because I  could

not  understand why there was such  a  need  for  a

large number of statisticians at this time when not

too  many  were appointed last year  and  the  year

before.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I have a fairly detailed brief on the

work  of  these  statisticians and I  am  not  sure

whether  I  shall be able to give it  all  to  hon.

Members in the very short time available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, we had four statisticians and they

dealt with the following rough spheres of work. One

dealt with routine statistics for trade, transport,

production, stocks and wholesale prices. The second

one   dealt  with  estimates  of  national  income,

capital   formation,   bonds,  payments,   banking,

insurance,  and  so on. The third  one  dealt  with

retail  prices,  budget, resurveys, sampling.  The

fourth  one dealt with vital statistics,  that  is,

births,     deaths,     population,     employment,

immigration.  They  are now  asking  for  two  more

statisticians and the first one will  be  primarily

required  to expand the gap in the national  income

statistics. Now these are very badly needed and the

Economic  Adviser  has told us that  we  must  have

better   statistics  of  our  income, businesses,

profits, C.I.F. prices, turnovers, and so  on.  The

last  sixth one we require primarily for the census

problem to help us through the census next year and

we   want   to   keep  a  nucleus  of  the   census

organisation  running through  the  years  so  that

local  censuses  of,  shall  we  say,  agriculture,

production  and  fisheries can be  undertaken  from

time  to  time. I am afraid I am going very rapidly

but I am very short of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not, up to this moment, been aware of any

unsatisfactory situation - the sort of

unsatisfactory situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



which he has suggested - existing in relation to  the

administration of charitable trusts and, of course,

if  there  were  any unsatisfactory situation  with

regard  to a particular charitable trust, it  would

be  my function, if it were brought to my notice as

Attorney-General, to take the matter up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has indicated that he thinks that

we  are too busy in my department to deal with this

type  of  matter but, in fact, I am, from  time  to

time,   represented  in  the  Courts   on   matters

affecting  charities and I would, at all times,  be

very  glad  and  indeed anxious to  hear  from  any

Member  who  is  not satisfied with regard  to  the

administration of any charitable trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think that is all I can say at this

stage,  Sir. I  am sorry I cannot  say  more  with

regard  to proposals for legislation. I think  they

would  require further consideration  and  I  shall

make it my business to look into the matter and  to

get in touch with the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $360,160 for Head 22 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 23-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 4, Commissions, Conferences and

Visits of Advisers, on page 140 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for last year was $40,000 and for

1957, $100,000 is asked for. It has not come to our

knowledge  of any special commissions,  conferences

and  visits of advisers and unless we are  told  of

some  special conference, I think the amount  asked

for is much too high. Last year, we had the Colombo

Plan  Conference here and a special vote was  asked

for and approved by this Assembly. I therefore seek

to  reduce  this sum, Sir, unless we can  get  some

very   good  information  about  these  forthcoming

visits.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the hon. Member again,

as I have reminded another hon. Member, that we are

now  debating the policy of the services for  which

money is to be provided? The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



point  raised by the hon. Member is a  point  which

can  be looked into with advantage by the Estimates

Committee of which, I think, the hon. Member  is  a

Member.  If he can develop an argument or a  debate

on  the  policy  for  which  the  money  is  to  be

provided, then, of course, he is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, as I understand it, you

can  only speak on policy by comparing the  amounts

asked for. What is the use of having estimates like

these  unless  I  am  allowed  to  point  out   the

exorbitant amounts that are asked for?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not stopping the hon. Member

from  drawing  the attention of the  House  to  any

particular item. That can always be done but what I

am  trying  to indicate is that there cannot  be  a

debate  on details. The debate must be confined  to

policy  and  the  hon. Member can always  draw  the

attention  of the Assembly to specific  items  when

the main Question is proposed; but when a motion is

moved on an amendment, that, of course, presupposes

a  debate  and  if there is to be a  debate,  then,

under  Standing  Orders, the debate  is  to  be  on

policy only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Well, Sir, I seek to ask

information on this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will do that then when we come

to the main Question. I am not proposing the

amendment because I think it is out of order on

those lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a notice of another amendment by the hon. Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir, the same point

arises and I only seek information.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $23,867,060 for Head 23 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I would like to speak

generally now. I do suggest, Sir, that in one item,

there is a large sum asked for which is two and a

half times that of last year and the other item is

a new item altogether.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



The  new  item is No. 18 under Head 23.  Unless  we

have  specific reasons for these items and we  have

knowledge of the proposed visits, then we will have

to vote against these items.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Singapore is such a small place

and  I  think such conferences and visits by  other

nations coming over here could well be handed  over

to  our  brothers in the Federation and the  colony

can thus save money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is a small contribution to this

point.  These  visits  do  bear  an  aspect  partly

especially  if  you  have  the  Colombo   Plan   or

E.C.A.F.E. or  tourist trade  and  though  we  may

provide some finance for it, you undoubtedly  would

benefit backwards from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very small point which hon. Members might

note  is  that  Singapore is a small territory  and

consequently does sometimes need to go outside  for

advice  which  you  cannot recruit  from  the  very

limited  skilled  and expert population  which  you

have here.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, in answer to the two questions

raised  by the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon

Teck),  firstly, on the vote, item 4, "Commissions,

Conferences and Visits of Advisers", the  provision

in 1956 was indeed $40,000 but the hon. Member will

recall  that  in  April this year, under  Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 18 of 1956, we obtained a supplement

of  $100,000. That was to meet the cost,  first  of

all,   of   the   Malayanisation  Commission   and,

secondly,   experts   who  visited   Singapore   in

connection with land titles, labour relations, cost

of living statistics and certain education matters.

The  actual expenditure under this vote in 1955 was

$95,000  and the expenditure up to October of  this

year  was  $121,000. What we pay from the vote  are

the fees of commissioners who are appointed locally

as  in  the  case of the Malayanisation Commission,

hotel charges, passages, subsistence allowances and

other  expenses of the people who are invited  from

other territories to come and advise us here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision in 1957 is $100,000 and takes into

account  the  probability that  we  will  have  to

employ   for   the  whole  year  an  adviser   own

transport.  I  can  think of no other  commitments

against  the  vote  other than  that  one  at  the

present  time  but I think it is prudent  to  have

$100,000  in  the Estimates to meet  all  possible

contingencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second vote, item 18. "United

Nations  Experts,  Local  Costs",  this  vote   is

provided  to meet the local costs of experts  sent

here   by  the  World  Health  Organisation,   the

International Labour Organisation,  the  Food  and

Agricultural  Organisation and the United  Nations

Economic  Social  and Cultural Organisation.  When

experts from these organisations come and serve in

Singapore,  their basic salaries are paid  by  the

organisations  but  we are responsible  for,  what

they  call,  local  costs,  that  is,  subsistence

allowance  and  travelling  allowances.  The   sum

required or estimated by the various organisations

to  be required in any particular area is given to

us  and we make arrangements on request for a  sum

to  be  paid  into the account of  the  particular

organisation in a local bank. In 1956,  we  had  a

number  of  sister  tutors from the  World  Health

Organisation: five in number altogether,  and  two

from  the  International Labour  Organisation  who

were  here for a short period. The local costs  of

these people are estimated to come to about $9,500

but  we have not yet had a request from the  World

Health Organisation to pay that amount into  their

bank  and consequently we are making provision  in

this  vote  next year for the amount of money  due

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in respect of 1957, we do intend to ask

for  and receive one senior sister tutor and three

normal  sister  tutors for the Medical  Department

and  it is estimated that their local charges will

come to about $9,000. Hence we have $20,000 in the

Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $23,867,060 for Head 23 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $100,000 the sum to be allotted in respect of sub-head 3,

Family Planning Association, on page 144 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, I objected to this sort of

contribution  for reasons which  I believe  hon.

Members  on  the  other side of  the  House  still

remember.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> I need not recapitulate

them.  Now,  I am going to add some more  reasons,

other than moral, why this contribution should not

be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Government itself is hard up.

Taxation  has been increased to cover the  deficit

for 1957 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> In order to help family planning.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I trust that hon. Members

will allow the hon. Member to continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Thank you, Sir. Mr

Chairman,  Sir, how can a beggar give charity?  In

view of Government's poverty, I do not know how it

is  going to justify that generosity for a service

which  does  not  benefit - if I may  use  the  word

"benefit" - all. For instance, we the  male  species

cannot  avail ourselves of this service. Not  only

that,  Sir,  but only a very small  percentage  of

women seek family planning and even then by way of

experimenting.  The number of  babies  born  every

week  is  not decreasing. Even during  the  recent

week  of  rioting,  the women could  not  postpone

giving birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are more pressing needs like housing

for  which Government has not the money to pay and

yet  it  sees  fit  to spend on  an  objectionable

service which is not approved by a majority of the

population.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Not true.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Sir, may I invite the Member

for Cairnhill to hold a Gallup poll?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If you will pay for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> A poor woman

may  get  the  best  of treatment  in  the  family

planning  clinic  but  this is  negatived  by  the

horrible condition of the cubicle in which she  is

living.  She stops giving birth no doubt  but  contracts tuberculosis and other dreadful diseases. I

ask,  Sir,  is limiting the size of a family  more

necessary    or   advisable   than   giving    her

accommodation  for her to live with  her  children

and be happy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are going to have a battalion of

soldiers  for  internal security. Government  does

not  seem to realise that family planning is going

to  jeopardise the safety of the country for  lack

of manpower. If one must spend, Sir, he must spend

wisely.  In  my  opinion, the  $100,000  could  be

better  used for allowances to children  as  other

countries have been doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr

Chairman,  Sir, I can but regret that  the  Member

for  Bukit  Panjang should seek to bring  about  a

further debate. He did his duty last year  and  he

was  defeated  17  to  11. It  is  true  that  the

arguments he then put forward were somewhat poor.

I  will  read  them to you, Sir. Very fortunately,

the  jewels  that  fall from the  mouths  of  hon.

Members  are  preserved in the  archives  of  this

House. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Chairman, Sir, my grand-parents were Roman

Catholics. My parents were Roman Catholics, I am  a

Roman Catholic."



<br><br>Sir,  I  should  have  hoped that  he  would  have

loyally accepted the verdict of this House and not

sought  to agonise us again by a debate on matters

on  which  I  do appreciate that many people  hold

strong  views; but there was a majority  decision.

It is still the same people in the Assembly though

there are a few empty seats. He has caused anxiety

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



dedicated  women  who are doing  wonderful  public

service, that should be the duty of the Government

to  perform.  I do not have the temerity  to  make

that  remark  on my own experience, Sir,  since  I

speak  as  a  bachelor  but  I  would,  with  your

permission, quote a very responsible authority.  I

have here a paragraph from the Report published in

1949  by  the British Royal Commission  on  Population. Paragraph 558 reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The giving of advice on contraception to

married persons who want it should be accepted  as

a duty by the National Health Service."



<br><br>All  we  seek to do is to give a little assistance

to  a  voluntary charitable organisation which  in

its  own  words seeks and is concerned  only  with

making available to the poorer people of Singapore

the  knowledge  and facilities which  are  readily

available  to  any who cannot afford  to  pay  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will permit me, I can do no better

in  presenting  this matter to the House  than  to

draw  its attention to some paragraphs of a letter

I received from this organisation in clarification

of  its principles and the procedure it adopts  in

its work. The paragraphs read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The aim of the Association is to make available

to  married  people (I repeat married people)  who

require  knowledge  of  the principles  of  family

planning  and facilities for its practice  and  to

encourage  (not the lack of manpower for Singapore

battalions)  the  production  of  healthy,   happy

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association does not seek to influence

people who do not accept these principles."

<br><br>And  that is why the Member for Bukit Panjang  has

received   no  assistance  from  the  clinics   in

question.   It  is  concerned  only  with   making

available  to  the poorer people of Singapore  the

knowledge   and  facilities  which   are   readily

available to the rich.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advising on family planning its work is

twofold.  It  shows  couples how  to  space  their

children so as to allow the mother to recover  her

strength fully between births, protecting her  own

health and that of her children and how to have as

many children as they want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is important to recognise clearly the

distinction   between  birth   control   and   contraception. Control of birth may be achieved as it

had  been  for centuries in many Eastern countries

by infanticide and abortion."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



So  the  answer to the hon. Member when  he  says,

"That activities of these clinics have not reduced

the  birth-rate", is to their credit. That is  not

the  intention. But I will ask him, "How many abortions  have their activities prevented?" Would  he

rather  than  having  family planning  to  have  a

flourishing abortion trade? Abortion is even today

resorted  to  by  patients who have  come  to  the

Family Planning Association clinic admitting  that

they  have  had  at least one and  some  seven  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contraception however is the control of birth

by  prevention of conception. This may be achieved

by  the  scientific  method we  normally  advocate

provided   there   are   no  religious   scruples.

Alternatively and less reliably, there is a method

known  as  the 'safe period' in which we  instruct

patients  whose religions forbid them the  use  of

the more scientific method."



<br><br>And,  Sir, this comes appropriate in view  of  the

reason  given by the Member for Bukit  Panjang  in

the  last  debate of November, 1955, "We endeavour

to  respect the religion of our patients, Catholic

and non-Catholic alike."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope in his discourse to the Italian

Catholic  Union of Midwives on 29th October,  1951

declared in respect of marital relations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Serious reasons often put forward on medical,

eugenic,  economic and social grounds  can  exempt

from  that  obligatory service (marital relations)

even  for a considerable period of time, even  for

the  entire  duration of the marriage. It  follows

from this that the use of the infertile period can

be lawful from the moral point of view and, in the

circumstances  which have been  mentioned,  it  is

indeed lawful."



<br><br>That,  Sir,  comes from the head of  the  Catholic

Church.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of family planning is to assist

those who are infertile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said before and, unfortunately, there are

no  new arguments - there can be none - in respect  of

basic  human  problems. This is a service  to  the

mass  of  the  people who cannot  afford  to  seek

assistance from expensive doctors. The Association

does not go out of its way to force its advice  on

anybody nor does it advise single persons. It only

advises  married couples who come  for  assistance

and some of them are advised according to Catholic

precepts in respect of the infertile period.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has spoken of the poverty of

Government and its generosity in giving  $100,000.

I  have not heard one peek out of him when it came

to  giving  more than $4 million for the recurrent

annual expenditure on the "toy" navy of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, let us recognise the fact that the

very  reason for taxation is service to the people

and this is one of the valid reasons for taxation.

This  $100,000 is perhaps the finest use of  money

that  this Budget can show because it helps  large

numbers  of very poor bewildered people  who  need

assistance  in  respect of acute  personal  family

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do plead with the hon. Member not to pursue

this  motion  and  put this  House  to  a  further

agonising debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I support the Member for

Cairnhill  who  said that this  matter  was  fully

debated  last year and was carried by  a  majority

and  I do not see why the Member for Bukit Panjang

should  bring  in this motion this  year.  As  the

Member  for  Cairnhill has said,  he  should  have

accepted  the  verdict  of this  House  which  was

carried by a majority last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subject is, in fact, controversial and I am

not  going  to speak on the merits or demerits  of

the  case itself but I am concerned with the waste

of our time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> $500 salary!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> It is not the $500. There are

more important issues than this subject and once a

verdict  has been taken last year, let  us  accept

that  verdict and not waste our time. What  I  see

now  is  that  the  Member for  Bukit  Panjang  is

flogging  a dead horse, coming in year after  year

on  the same issue. I do hope that Members of this

House  will refrain from talking too much on  this

subject  so  that we can proceed with  the  actual

business of the day rather than to repeat what was

said last year.

This is more a matter of religion and I understand

that  this is an open vote for this House. No  one

is  being whipped to vote either way and  I  think

everyone  should vote according  to  his  own  conscience.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  just  a  little while ago I  was  trying  to

control myself from losing my temper when I  heard

the Member for Queenstown say that, because he  receives   $500  a  month  as  allowance  for   an

Assemblyman, he must come here and talk and  talk.

There  is one important thing which I should point

out,  and  that is that the figure of  $85,000  as

grant  for  the  Family Planning Association  last

year  has  been raised to $100,000 this year.  The

Member for Queenstown should have the patience  to

hear  what  another  Member may  have  to  say  in

support of the amendment. I entirely disagree with

the  Member for Queenstown when he said that  this

is  a  religious subject. Although I  am  a  Roman

Catholic, I am going to support the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this amendment because of political

reasons.  We  argued yesterday  about  income  tax

being  based  on a pan-Malayan structure.  We  have

many  existing Government departments  on  a  pan-Malayan  basis  too. All Parties,  including  even

those  in  the Federation of Malaya, have promised

that  Singapore and the Federation will merge very

soon.  Therefore why should we argue all the  time

on   the  basis  of  this  small  island  with   a

population  of  just over one million  people?  We

should have the confidence to hope that very soon,

despite all the duties and tariffs imposed  on  us

by  the Federation Government, our brothers across

the  Straits of Johore will force us to merge with

them.  Therefore we must always think on the basis

that  Singapore  will  very soon  merge  with  the

Federation of Malaya and we will then be a  bigger

family.  We  are very lucky to have a  first-class

highway from Johore Bahru to Kedah and you can see

how many rubber estates, palm estates -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether

the  merger  of  the Federation and Singapore  has

anything to do with family planning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, it is very important, because we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



politically  bankrupt. We have no confidence  that

there  will  be  a merger with the  Federation  of

Malaya  and  a  critical situation  is  facing  us

today.  Our  local  industries cannot  survive  if

tariffs are placed on our products. We must  merge

with  the Federation of Malaya. Therefore we  will

need more manpower to develop our economy on a pan-Malayan  basis - and  not  for  battalions,  as  the

Member  for Bukit Panjang said. From the political

point of view, this is the time for us to show our

confidence  in  the future for a merger  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya, which is potentially  very

rich  in  agriculture  and industry  and  is  only

awaiting development. We need more manpower but we

must  not  import labour from India or  China.  We

also need technicians and specialists to help  us.

So let us admit that we need more manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are morally bankrupt. If family

planning is to be discouraged -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Not you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> - I wonder why the poor

husbands  cannot follow our former Chief  Minister

by remaining bachelors for a long time!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Not healthy!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> That is just a matter of

control  and it is very simple to do  it.  If  you

cannot afford to have more children, stop it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Stop what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> We must have courage if we

decide to get married. We must increase our income

and  be prepared to have a family. It is the  same

with  a  country.  If we have  confidence  in  the

future   of  this  country,  we  will   have   the

confidence to build more schools and hospitals  to

provide for the increase in our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise an important point which I

am sure influences quite a number of hon. Members.

It is that just because China and India believe in

birth control, so, too, must this country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  I  think  that is entirely  wrong.  We  want

political independence but, at the same  time,  we

must have ideological independence. We cannot  say

that if Mao Tse-tung supports family planning,  we

must therefore support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is he supporting it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> He is supporting it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would say that if the Family

Planning Association is really organised  and  run

by  an  ordinary citizen or a wage-earner, and  if

our  local medical services have not extended  any

assistance at all towards those people who  intend

to give advice on birth control, I will give up my

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are two questions facing us. Firstly,

I understand from the Minister for Health that all

his  hospitals  and clinics are prepared  to  give

every  assistance and advice to whoever approaches

a  Government medical officer or a nurse for  such

assistance  and advice. Secondly, all officers  of

the  Family  Planning Association - I  am  sure  the

letter  from  which the Member for  Cairnhill  was

reading    looks   like   it   came   from    this

Association - are rich, distinguished and noble, and

belong  to  the  first class  of  people  in  this

country. If they are really public-spirit  minded,

they  should not ask their husbands to buy diamond

rings  and beautiful bracelets for them.  If  each

one  could  contribute one diamond  ring  and  one

beautiful   bracelet  to  the   Association, the

$100,000 would be there. Therefore, to prove  that

the  officers  of the Family Planning  Association

are  really  public-spirited, they  should  be  on

their own, as is the case in the United States and

England,  and  raise donations from those  persons

who  support family planning: but they should  not

come to this Assembly every year to ask for

money,  as  the  Member for  Queenstown  said.  We

should   not  waste  time  on  this  controversial

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely appeal to the officers of the Family

Planning  Association to run  the  Association  on

their own efforts and not to disturb this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, we have heard quite a

number of soap-box orations in this Assembly  this

morning -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. [Interruption.]

I  think hon. Members are inclined to get  out  of

hand.   "Soap-box   orations"   is,   of   course,

unparliamentary and must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am sorry if I have used

unparliamentary language, Mr Chairman, but I  was

very  much  tempted  to do so  by  the  surprising

remarks that I have heard from both sides of  this

House;

more   surprising  still  from  the   Member   for

Queenstown who said that a further debate on  this

subject  was a waste of time. First, I would  like

to  remind  him of what he said some time  ago  in

this  House that he was paid his $500 to talk  and

that is why he does so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of

order,  Sir. I meant to talk on important  issues

and not on issues of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not a point of order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> It is a point of

clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I think all hon. Members of this House

will  agree that this is a very important  matter;

so  important, that the Government last year  left

it  to  an open vote in order to allow each person

to  speak  and  vote according to his  conscience.

This  Government has again this year for that very

reason, because it is highly controversial,  allowed  the  matter to go before the Assembly so  that

each  person  could vote again  according  to  his

conscience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Do we have changing consciences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The last speaker has the most changing

conscience that I have ever known of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the question of whether

Government should contribute

public money towards the advancement of the Family

Planning  Association  is,  as  has  already  been

pointed out, a highly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



controversial one and for that very reason, I have

said,  this Government has allowed it  to  be  put

again  to  an  open vote so that each  Member  can

speak  and vote according to his beliefs  and  his

conscience. That policy is adopted this  year  for

the  very  same  reason and I hope  that  whatever

Government is in power, it will always allow  this

controversial matter which affects the deep-rooted

convictions of certain communities to be put to an

open  vote. Members of this Assembly may come  and

go  but  whoever  are  elected  and  sit  in  this

Assembly  must speak for the communities  who  put

them into power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, at this stage, to reply to a few

remarks made by the Member for Cairnhill. He spoke

against the views which were put by the Member for

Bukit  Panjang last year. That hon.  Member  spoke

from  his heart as a Roman Catholic and he  should

never  have  been condemned for that  reason.  The

Member for Cairnhill said that it was the duty  of

Government  to  perform what this House  is  being

asked  to  conribute to. I say that if  any  woman

who, for health reasons, wishes to consult any  of

our  doctors in our hospitals, she can always  get

free  advice.  He also said - as I  understand  it,

subject to correction

- that  all  the  workers in  the  Family  Planning

Association  are  voluntary  workers.  Subject  to

correction,  I  am informed otherwise.  There  are

some  who  are  paid workers there and  paid  with

monies which this House is asked to contribute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the same hon. Member read a portion of a

letter he received, saying that these people  give

assistance  to  the poor people.  Our  domiciliary

nurses and nurses also give assistance to the poor

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Member for Cairnhill

and everyone in this House that this is not a vote

for   or  against  family  planning.  I  have  the

greatest  respect for the voluntary  workers who

devote  their time to what they think is a sincere

service  and  one  which in their  opinion  is  of

public good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main question before this House is: should the $100,000 contributed by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



the  members  of  the  public  be  used  for  that

purpose?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also read a very short

portion  of  the discourse which His Holiness  the

Pope  gave  to  midwives in respect of  the  "safe

period". It is only in very extreme cases, he  has

told  midwives, that use or knowledge of the "safe

period"  can be put to practice. Why did  not  the

hon.   Member  read  further?  I  have  the  whole

discourse of His Holiness the Pope -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Why do you not read it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> - and he will see from that that the

whole   discourse   was   against   the   use   of

contraceptives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My attitude in this question is well known and

that attitude will never change. I say now and  I

will  keep  on repeating that public funds  which

are contributed by people of all races and creeds

in this colony should not be used for any purpose

which  is contrary to the very tenets of  certain

religious  bodies and beliefs of  any  particular

community. Governments past and present  have  always  respected the religious tenets and  beliefs

of  the  various religions in our community.  For

example, Government has never enforced cremations

although it is highly desirable to conserve  land

in   this  country.  Land  is  very  useful   for

development but large plots of land are  allotted

for  burial  grounds  for those  whose  religious

beliefs are against cremation. Imagine the uproar

if  cremations were forced upon the Muslims -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Who is forcing family planning?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> You are forcing us to pay the money

for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Hon. Members are forgetting

that  we  are in Committee and if any hon.  Member

wishes  to  make a point, he will have  the  opportunity to do so later on. Let us not have so  many

interventions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Thank you, Sir. I am

surprised  at  the levity with which certain  hon.

Members take on this very serious subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also built abbatoirs for people professing the Muslim faith

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



who   can   have  their  animals  slaughtered   in

accordance with Muslim rites. Also for  that  very

reason, this House has sent the Muslims Bill to  a

Select  Committee  with the  directive  that  they

consider the introduction into the Bill of  clause

47  which  provides that every Muslim when  making

his  will  must  distribute  his property   in

accordance  with Muslim law and not in  accordance

with  the laws of the land. Now, why have we  done

this?  It  is  because each Member of  this  House

rightly   respects  the  wishes  of  the  minority

particularly when their wishes strike at the  very

fundamental beliefs and tenets of their  religion.

I  would  ask the Muslim Members of this House  to

please  remember that. But again,  I  repeat  that

this  is  not a religious issue. I made  it  clear

last  year  and I repeat this year that  the  only

issue  before this House is not whether the Family

Planning  Association be permitted  to  exist  but

whether  public funds should be used to  subsidise

this  association. I have no doubt, as I have said

just  now,  that decent public-spirited people  of

Singapore are voluntarily helping the association.

I do not say to them "discontinue your work". This

association,  whatever  good  it  claims  to   do,

should,  in  my  opinion, be run  by  a  voluntary

organisation  as  it  is in  the  United  Kingdom,

United  States, in all civilised countries  except

in  Japan and India (I have a few comments to make

about  India in a moment) and in a very few  other

countries where token votes are made. Now,  it  is

interesting  to  note  that even  in  India  where

family planning is supposed to be sponsored by the

Government,  it is very doubtful whether  this  is

accepted  by  all provincial governments.  It  has

been  reported in the Indian Press that early last

month  the  Bombay Legislature was informed  by  a

Minister there that his government did not  accept

family planning, and they were against the use  of

contraceptives and that the Minister had  informed

the  central Government in New Delhi that  he  did

not  want to accept the monetary grant offered  by

the   central  Government  to  Bombay  for  family

planning work in the state.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ascertained the views of several members

of   various   communities,  (apart   from   Roman

Catholics)  to  whom I have spoken,  and  a  large

number of them are against the principle of  their

money  being used for this purpose. They are  from

the  Muslim  community  although  there  are  some

Muslims  who have accepted the ruling that  it  is

not  against their religion, but there is a  large

number of them who are very much against

it.  The Buddhists and the Jews - yes, I repeat even

the  Jews  whom  I  have spoken to - and  Christians

strongly object to their money being used for this

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not all of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I said the Christians with whom I

have  spoken.  There  is also  a  strong  body  of

University students who have expressed one  single

united  view  against this grant.  [Interruption].

Levity again, Mr Chairman, Sir, from those  I  am

surprised to see!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, there is a great

maldistribution of wealth in society  and,  in  my

opinion,  those  who wish to cloak  the  evils  of

colonialism  and capitalism will  support  this grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Chairman, Sir, I would

like  to read just one portion of what I have said

last  year  which bears repetition.  I  said  that

alongside with wealth, there was quite a  lot  of

squalor in this country. I went on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In these areas people suffer squalor and

poverty  but, please note, not because as, normal

human  beings they desire children, and once  they

have   them  they  can  only  support  them   with

difficulty. The reason is

because, before our time, no attempt was

made  to see that the people were properly  housed

and   paid  proper  wages,  and  because  colonial

economy     did    not    allow     for     normal

industrialisation. This is the problem  now.  This

is  our  heritage from the period fortunately  now

over,  when  nominated  and  official  individuals

played  at  politics  and thought  that  so-called

family  planning could be disguised as  a  radical

social reform."



<br><br>It  would  be, in my opinion, a disgrace  to  this

country to spend this colossal sum of $100,000  of

public  money on such a project when  the  country

can ill-afford wastage of funds and when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



Government  finds  it imperative  to  impose  high

taxes  to meet deficits. Much of this money  could

be   utilised  in  paying  salaries  and  in   the

maintenance of staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have caused to be built, since I assumed the

office  of  Minister  for  Health,  a  number   of

maternity and child health clinics and outdoor dispensaries and I propose to build many more,  which

are  put on top priority, for the benefit  of  the

people  of Singapore and to bring medical services

closer  to their homes. I also sought to economise

in  the  construction  of buildings  such  as  the

Nurses  Training School and the Nurses Hostel  and

helped  to  save, comparing them with the  figures

that   were  estimated  by  previous  governments,

nearly $1� million.
