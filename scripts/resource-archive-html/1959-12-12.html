I will propose the Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the total sum to be

allocated for Head 22 be reduced by $100."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park)</b> gestured.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member had not completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I had not completed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I beg his pardon. I understood the

Member  to  say  he  had. Well, that  cancels  the

Question proposed. Mr Rajah?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I misunderstood your

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment of adjournment

yesterday, I was speaking on item (1) of sub-head

58  "Confidential Stenographer". There is a sum of

$11,700 provided for this post for the year  1960,

whereas  for  the  year  1959  provision  was  for

$7,800.  I  have  searched throughout  the  Budget

Estimates    for   the   pay   for    Confidential

Stenographers,  and I find that even  the  sum  of

$7,800 is high for a Confidential Stenographer  as

compared  with  the  pay  of  such  other  persons

throughout the various Departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a substantial increase from $7,800 to

$11,700. Could the Minister please explain why  it

is  that  the  post, which is already more  highly

paid   than   those  of  most  other  Confidential

Stenographers, needs such a substantial  increase

for 1960?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on the Head, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

"Manager,  $24,000". I understand that the  person

who  is  holding this appointment is also Chairman

of  the  Central Provident Fund Board.  Under  the

provisions  of  that  Ordinance  an  allowance  is

payable  to  the Chairman. Could the Minister  say

whether  an allowance is, in fact, now being  paid

to  the  Chairman  of the Central  Provident  Fund

Board?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I must commend the Member for Farrer

Park   on   the  assiduity  with  which   he   has

scrutinised the Estimates. What he said about  the

pay of Confidential Stenographers is substantially

correct. The post against (iii) of item (1) of sub-head  58  is at present vacant, and the  Singapore

Industrial Promotion Board has temporarily  loaned

the  services of an Executive Officer  (Secretary)

from  the  Ministry  of National  Development.  To

regularise the position in 1960, it is intended to

second  to  the  Board an Executive  Officer  with

experience  in Government procedure and accounting

to   relieve  the  Manager  of  his  more  routine

functions,  and to assist the Office Assistant  in

the  administration of his office. The  provision,

therefore,  includes the salary of this  Executive

Officer, a book-keeping allowance and his  pension

contributions  for the period of  his  secondment.

The  salary  will be about $8,000 per  annum,  the

book-keeping allowance will be $100 per month  (or

$1,200  per  annum), and the pension contributions

about $2,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his second query, the answer is yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  in  respect of what are known  as  Temporary

Staff, an Executive Officer is being brought  into

that  section as a Permanent Officer, and  because

of  his present emoluments, he has to be paid that

sum of money set out in the 1960 Budget?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of Manager-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps for the convenience

of  Members, I think we could deal first with  the

Confidential Stenographer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is it desirable to have a Permanent

Officer  in  such a place, particularly  when  the

whole  setup of this Board is in a state  of  flux

and nothing definite is known as to what the Board

is  doing  or  about  to do? When  a  manager  was

appointed  to  this  Board,  a  large  amount   of

publicity  was  given to this  appointment  and  a

statement  was made that a number of  things  were

going  to  be  done  and  achieved.  So  far,  Mr

Speaker,  we have heard nothing of the  doings  or

the  achievements of this Board. Therefore, I fail

to  see  why it is necessary to have such a highly

qualified officer, paid this salary in the Board.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Goh. On "Confidential

Stenographer".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

necessary  to  have the officer described  on  the

Board.  Members will know that it is the intention

of  Government to wind up the affairs of the Board

as  soon as the new Economic Development Board  is

established. The process of winding up will entail

a  considerable amount of work, such as finalising

of   accounts,   making  lists   of   assets   and

liabilities and, of course, there is a fair amount

of  work  still  to  be done  in  connection  with

preliminary  legislation setting up  the  Economic

Development  Board. As I said, it is not  expected

that  the  Industrial Promotion  Board  will  last

throughout  the whole of the year,  and  therefore

the  secondment of this officer to this post  will

be really for a duration of a few months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I proceed with the question on the

Manager?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Could the Minister please inform the

House  the  quantum of the allowance paid  to  the

Chairman of the Central Provident Fund Board,  and

whether  it  is desirable that he should  be  paid

these  two sums of money for the work which he  is

doing  probably  during the same working  time?  I

would  submit  to the Minister that  in  stringent

times  such  as these, and even if they  were  not

stringent times, it would not be very desirable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



to  have  him hold this post of Manager at $24,000

per  annum,  and at the same time be permitted  to

draw an allowance for some other post.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The man is really doing work

in   two   capacities  and  I  see  no   objection

whatsoever  to  his receiving the  allowances  and

remuneration  of  these  two  posts.  He  is   not

prevented  under existing legislation  from  doing

so, and the Government will not have the power  to

withhold  the allowances from him. It  is  only  a

matter  of  whether  he himself would  voluntarily

wish  to  relinquish the allowance as Chairman  of

the Central Provident Fund Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not

yet told the House what allowances he, in fact, is

drawing. Might I remind the Finance Minister  that

it  is not obligatory on the part of Government to

pay  the Chairman any sums of money by way  of  an

allowance? I believe the Ordinance says "may".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If the Member for Farrer Park

feels very strongly about it, I will look into the

position and consider his proposals on its merits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the Minister's statement,

Mr Speaker, may I be given leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 201 of the Estimates, just under sub-head

27, there appear the following words:-



<pre>

Contribution under       Approved

  section 23 of the     Estimates   Estimated

  Singapore                1959        1960

  Improvement            $850,000

  Ordinance

</pre>



<br><br>For  the  1960  Estimates, there is no  provision.

Under  section  23  of  the Singapore  Improvement

Ordinance,  it  is a statutory obligation  on  the

part   of  Government  to  provide  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust with that amount of money which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



the  Trust itself collects as an Improvement Rate.

Now, there is an item before this House which will

seek  the leave of the Assembly to levy that rate.

Could I ask the Minister why the contribution from

Government to the Singapore Improvement Trust  for

the   year  1960  is  absent  from  his  financial

proposals?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the answer is

that   in   1960   there  will  be  no   Singapore

Improvement Trust.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am surprised at

the  answer, because there is before this House  a

motion which seeks to levy an Improvement Rate  of

2 per cent on all properties throughout the Island

and to hand it over to the Trust in the year 1960.

Am  I to understand from the Minister that, at the

proper moment, the motion will be withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Trust

now  exists. An Improvement Rate must, as a matter

of  formality,  be approved by the  Assembly  this

year, if we were to levy this Rate at all. But  in

the  case of the entry in the Estimates,  this  is

another  matter.  As  I said, at  the  appropriate

time,  if  possible, we will, either  by  amending

legislation  or subsidiary legislation,  make  the

transfer of such funds to the appropriate  housing

authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have got the

information  I  was seeking. May I have  leave  to

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 25 be

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under sub-head 2 there is provision for

Contribution and Charitable Allowances to the  sum

of  $25,000 for the Ministry of Culture. Under the

main   Head,   all   charitable   allowances   and

contributions have been itemised except for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



Ministry of Culture. Will the Minister please give

some indication as to the organisations which will

enjoy the benefit of this vote under Culture?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, under Head 40 - Ministry of

Culture - on page 289 of the Estimates, there  is  a

provision  of $80,000 under sub-head  11  for  the

"Promotion of Cultural Matters". Sir, since  these

two  items  are almost the same, should not  these

two votes come under one heading?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the item is headed

"Contribution   and  Charitable  Allowances".   My

thought on the Ministry of Culture was that it was

not  interested in charitable institutions but was

formed to further culture.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Cairnhill  might,  I think,  have  drawn  the

attention  of the House to sub-head 3  under  Head

25. You will note that a number of names have been

listed.   These   refer  to  funds   and   various

organisations  which  were  to  receive  in   1959

contributions from the Government. It is  proposed

next  year  to  make  a  review  of  contributions

payable  to  societies  and associations  such  as

these, and it is thought that the most appropriate

Ministry  to  do  so  would  be  the  Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible at this stage to list in

detail  the  different organisations  which  would

qualify  for contributions, because they have  yet

to  make applications and these applications  have

yet to be assessed by the Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the wording referred to and remarked

upon  by  the Member for Farrer Park - I agree  that

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that the present

holder of this post, Comptroller of Customs, is an

expatriate officer and that he is about to proceed

on  retirement, probably on Malayanisation terms - I

do  not know - but anyway I understand he is leaving

the  service. I also understand that,  instead  of

making  provision or arrangements to have somebody

from within the Department promoted to the post of

Comptroller of Customs, a person from  the  Police

Force  has  been brought in with a view to  taking

over the duties of the Comptroller of Customs  and

subsequent confirmation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister please confirm whether my

information  is  correct, and, if it  is  correct,

whether it is desirable that somebody from outside

the   service  should  be  brought  in  and   made

Comptroller  of  Customs,  and  whether   such   a

procedure  would  not tend to  discourage  serving

officers in the Department?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The post of Comptroller of

Customs  is not due to be malayanised until  1962.

So  whatever happens to the present incumbent will

not  affect the immediate position so far as local

senior officers are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that a senior Police Officer has been

seconded to the Customs Department with a view  to

eventual promotion if he is suitable. This is  not

an easy decision either for the Government to make

or  for  the officer concerned to accept. I  would

like to explain to the Member for Farrer Park that

the  staffing position in the Customs  Department,

while at present adequate, leaves room for anxiety

as to the future. There are five local officers of

any  seniority in the Customs service,  and  their

years of experience range from four years to eight

years.  It  seems to me that, in such an important

Department  earning  by  far  the  largest  single

source  of revenue to the Government, it would  be

undesirable  to  leave matters  in  the  hands  of

relatively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



junior officers. I wish to make it clear now  that

I  am  in  no  way denigrating their ability,  and

indeed the present Comptroller of Customs has  the

highest  opinion of the local senior  officers  in

the service.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But taking into account their youth and the

comparative shortness of their experience, I  have

come  to the conclusion that it would be a prudent

move to transfer a senior police officer with many

years  of  experience in the service to understudy

the    Comptroller   of   Customs   for   eventual

Malayanisation.  I do not think  that  this  would

lead  to any frustration among the local officers,

because  by and large they are an extremely  young

group  and  the police officer concerned  is  more

than   middle-aged,  and  with  his  maturity   of

judgment  and  experience in police  investigation

methods, I think that when the time comes for  the

complete  Malayanisation of the department  (which

is due to take place two years from now) we can be

more  confident that the whole service will  stand

up  to  all  the  tests placed  upon  it.  I  have

discussed  this matter with the Treasury officials

and  the  Comptroller of Customs,  and  they  have

agreed with me on the wisdom of this move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Income Tax Department, it is now proposed

to  have a new post of Deputy Commissioner,  Grade

G,  $1,520 per month. The post of Commissioner  is

graded in Grade D, $21,240 a year. As far as I can

gather, Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been no Deputy

to  the Commissioner from the time of inauguration

of that office up till now. We see from the budget

proposals  that, so far as income tax increase  in

collections  is  concerned,  there  is  none.  The

position  is the same in this year's proposals  as

in  last  year's.  In  view  of  that,  could  the

Minister  please  explain why it is  necessary  to

have a Deputy Commissioner of this high grade?  If

the  suggestion  is that it is  intended  by  this

appointment  to  accelerate  tax  collections  and

ferret out income tax dodgers who otherwise  might

have  remained  hidden, he  has  my  whole-hearted

support.  But it would appear from the income  tax

proposals that that would not be the position.  Is

it  intended that this post should be filled  from

within  the serving ranks? Is it intended that  it

should  be advertised? Or is it intended  that  it

should  be  filled by a serving  officer  who  has

given efficient, loyal and faithful service to the

Government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Inland

Revenue  Department is the ultimate  result  of  a

reorganisation of the departments of  Income  Tax,

Stamp  Office  and Estate Duty, and  provides  for

more  efficient revenue collecting  in  a  sounder

establishment structure. It is therefore necessary

to  provide this new department with a head. As an

economy  measure, however, it was decided  not  to

create  a  new post but to re-title  the  post  of

Comptroller   of   Income   Tax.   Grade   D,   as

Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Grade D.  By  this

means  then  the  Income Tax Department  would  be

without   a   head.  There  were  four   Assistant

Commissioners  on  the  salary  scale  $1,300-40A-1,420, and the next highest post, therefore, would

be  a  Grade G post. It would be necessary,  as  I

said,  to  have  this extra post  to  provide  the

Income Tax Department with its head, although  the

present Comptroller of Income Tax, as the head  of

the  Inland Revenue Department, would have overall

control

that.  But  in  the Ministry of  Labour  and  Law,

instead of finding a reduction in conformity  with

gone up seven times. Does the Minister propose  to

do  seven  times  the amount of writing  that  the

other Ministries do?

introduction   of  the  new  Constitution,   these

obligations  have been taken over  by  the  United

Kingdom  Commissioner's Office.  The  Ministry  of

Finance  asked the various Ministries  to  make  a

scrutiny of the cost of the various correspondence

they  had  in the past sent to the Office  of  the

Council of Ministers for despatch to the Secretary

of  State.  An inquiry was made, and it was  found

that, although we did not have detailed figures on

the  actual  cost of telegrams and  correspondence

that  left our Ministry, it was estimated  that  a

provision of $1,400 would meet our needs for  next

year.  I  would  submit,  Mr  Speaker,  that  the

Ministry   of  Labour  and  Law  have   not   been

extravagant in this proposed expenditure.  If  the

Member  for Farrer Park wants a breakdown,  I  can

give it to him.

understand the situation, so far as the Office  of

Official Assignee and Public Trustee is concerned,

there is attached to it permanently an accountant.

Therefore,  I am somewhat at a loss to  understand

why  the  emoluments  of  the  Accountant  to  the

Official  Assignee  should be treated  as  special

expenditure.  I understood special expenditure  to

mean  expenditure which would be incurred for that

year  and not for subsequent years. Does  it  mean

that  the  Official Assignee will only require  an

accountant  for next year, and provision  will  be

sought for 1961 in some other form?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the person in

question  discharging the duties of Accountant  to

the  Official Assignee is, I think, an  expatriate

officer  on  contract. He has been in the  service

from the 22nd July, 1946. In 1955 he was granted a

renewal  of his contract for three years. In  1958

the  previous Government renewed his contract  for

another  three  years. His present  contract  will

expire  on  13th December, 1960.  He  has  been  a

contract officer all along, and there is  no  hope

of  his appointment being made permanent. He  will

be   helping   out  in  the  Official   Assignee's

Department for as long as he is wanted, and it  is

not  proposed to extend his contract further  than

the end of next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, as I understand the Minister, the

expenditure  incurred for the  Accountant  to  the

charge.  But as far as I can make out,  he  is  an

officer  who  has  always  been  attached  to  the

Official  Assignee's  Department.  In  fact   that

Department cannot do without an Accountant because

the work is concerned with bankruptcy, figures and

accounting.  I am not questioning the  payment  to

this officer. What I would like to know is why  it

appears as special expenditure and why it has  not

appeared under annually recurrent expenses?  I  am

not  in  any way saying that there should  not  be

such  an  officer. But what I do say is  that  the

office  is  permanent - it  might  be  held  by   an

expatriate temporarily, but it must be permanent.

this figure just to show that the youth population

is  increasing very fast. I notice that  there  is

only one Principal Youth Service Officer. There is

no  increase in that, and I believe that the youth

officers are already overburdened with work.  With

Under  the  new Government, we have to  reorganise

the   old   state   of  affairs.   The   task   of

reorganisation has fallen on us. In  view  of  the

increase  in  population,  we  must  know  how  to

organise.  Unless we do that, we cannot take  full

advantage  of our available resources.  We  should

think  of ways and means to achieve that. We  must

put  a lot of effort and resources into that work.

But we must economise. This is our present task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read every day about events concerning secret

societies  in  the newspapers. This  is  the  most

immediate  task we are faced with at  the  present

moment.  These persons were not born  to  be  like

that.  They  are the products of the old  society.

Under  the colonial rule of over one hundred years

and  under the Lim Yew Hock Government, no  notice

was taken of this problem.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. So far as I can understand,

the  hon.  Member for Mountbatten merely wants  to

know  why no further provision for Principal Youth

Service Officers has been made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

for  Bras Basah was trying to explain to the House

the need for these youth services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answering the question that was asked by the

Member for Mountbatten, I would like to point  out

to  her that, in fact, the Principal Youth Service

Officer  is  the officer who is in charge  of  the

staff who man the community recreation centres. If

you  will  turn over to page 256 of the Estimates,

you  will see under Head 1, sub-heads 38  and  39,

the  staff over which the Principal Youth  Service

Officer   exercises  supervision.  I  think   that

answers the question.

man  or  a  woman.  If it is held  by  a  man,  it

attracts a higher salary scale. If it is held by a

woman,  it  attracts  a lower  salary  scale.  The

Assistant Lady Superintendent and the woman holder

of  the post of Children's Social Centre Organiser

are  paid  the  same  pay so that  they  will  not

quarrel over pay.

modern conditions, to introduce new blood into the

Juvenile Court magistracy, which is what I  think,

and  I  think  the Members of the Opposition  will

agree  with me, should be done. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

we  have had two retired practitioners at the  Bar

giving   their  services  full-time  to   previous

Governments,  and  also  to  this  Government,  to

fulfil   the  functions  of  the  Juvenile   Court

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



a change - that we who are responsible for the young

of  Singapore should show that we are not prepared

to  continue this system any longer. Therefore  we

do  not appeal only to volunteers to assist youths

in  their  problems. Sir, It is  our  proposal  to

create  a  post for the Juvenile Court  Magistrate

next  year and we shall take steps to see that  it

is  no longer filled by people who are retired and

who  have  got nothing better to do; but we  shall

get  a  young  person,  who has  ideas  about  the

management of youths, who mixes with them, and who

is  interested in their problems to take over this

very important post.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I

see  the  point of the Minister in saying that  we

should  get someone younger to deal with  juvenile

cases. But I do not see what objection there is in

his  other point of not wanting voluntary workers.

If  people  are  civic conscious enough  to  offer

their  services, I think we should thank them.  We

should  be  grateful for it. But if they  are  the

unsuitable  type,  the  retired  type,   the   old

he plans to carry them out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I would have

to embark on a dissertation on Government's policy

with  regard  to community centres to satisfy  the

Member for Mountbatten. But I will inform her  now

that we have community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



centres  in  Upper  Serangoon, Siglap  (she  knows

quite a lot about the Siglap Community Centre; she

was  President of the Siglap Girls' Club for  some

time),  Sims Avenue Community Centre,  and  Keppel

Harbour Community Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these large community centres, including

quarters  for  the  Centre  Organisers,  cost  the

previous   Government  round  about  $150,000   to

construct.  This expenditure did not include  such

other  amenities like badminton courts, basketball

courts and indoor and outdoor lighting for each of

these community centres. It was not the policy  of

the  previous Government to build medium-sized  or

small  community centres, and it was  agreed  with

the  then  Rural Board in 1956 that the Department

of  Social Welfare should build community  centres

in  the  city  area only, leaving the rural  areas

clear  for  the  Rural  Board  to  build  its  own

community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rural Board built large and small community

centres,  but  in 1958 it decided  to  build  more

small community centres throughout the rural areas

of  Singapore. The following Rural Board Community

Centres have now been taken over by the Department

of Social Welfare:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large Community Centres - Bukit Panjang Community

Centre  (completed  in  1954),  the  Buona   Vista

Community Centre (completed in 1956). I think  all

Members  of  the  Opposition know  this  community

centre. It is a very lavish community centre  with

beautiful   parks  and  especially   designed   to

accommodate  the  middle class who  live  in  that

area.  The  Changi Community Centre (completed  in

1958), the Bukit Timah Community Centre (completed

in 1959).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rural Board, I think, appeared to have more

horse sense than the previous Government, Sir, It

did  build  a  number of adequate small  community

centres. They are to be found in the Kampong  Ayer

Gemuroh Village Hall, Changi Point Community Hall,

Ama   Keng  Community  Centre,  West  Coast   Road

Community  Centre,  Jalan Eunos Community  Centre,

Pulau Ubin Community Centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of each of the large Rural Board

Community Centres was about the same as that of  a

large  community  centre  built  by  the  previous

Government, that is, more than $150,000 each,  but

the  costs of small Rural Board community  centres

ranged  from $4,600 for a small open shed building

(an  open shed building serves as the Kampong Ayer Gemuroh  Village Hall) to $28,200 for  the  modern

brick-type building with proper doors and windows,

like the one at Jalan Eunos. The average cost of a

small  Rural  Board community centre with  windows

and doors was about $12,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual cost of running the Social Welfare

Community Centres, that is, those rented from  the

S.I.T. and those taken over from the Rural Board,

amounted to approximately $350,000, which was  the

sum voted last year by the previous Government for

this purpose. This figure includes the salaries of

staff,  cost of equipment, rent of premises,  cost

of city services, fuel and maintenance charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost had been low because all the community

centres had previously been left to the control of

Advisory  Committees,  Management  Committees   or

Community  Associations  which  raised  funds  for

running  these community centres and provided  the

additional money required from profits  made  from

film  shows,  fun fairs, etc. In  many  cases  the

funds  raised from film shows and fun  fairs  were

misappropriated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I took over as Minister the control

of  all  community centres in Singapore had passed

out  of  the  hands  of the Department  of  Social

Welfare  and appeared to have been lodged  with  a

certain  Mr  Winans,  an  employee  of  the  Asia

Foundation  with  his  headquarters  at  the   old

Kallang Airport and with a private office  in  the

Minister  for Labour and Welfare's room. You  must

remember that the Minister for Labour and  Welfare

was then an absentee overlord in his own Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realising that it was the duty of any Government

not  to  allow costly buildings built as community

centres from money provided by the taxpayer to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



come   under  the  control  of  thinly   disguised

political    associations   and   Committees    of

Management  serving  under  the  direction  of  an

employee  of  the Asia Foundation who  had  direct

access  to the former Chief Minister (who I notice

is   absent   from  this  House  this  afternoon),

Government  took immediate steps  to  bring  these

community centres under the direct control of  the

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the action proceeded many of these thinly

disguised political associations and Committees of

Management hitherto in control of these  community

centres  either  scattered or  were  dispersed  to

other less costly private dwellings.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate action was taken to stop private

organisers   from  running  film  shows   in   the

community centres for which fees were charged  and

often pocketed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the estimates for running the community

centres this year were under consideration, it was

realised  that the money voted last  year  by  the

previous  Government  was insufficient  to  enable

these  community centres to maintain their present

level of activities next year, let alone step them

up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the operation of cinema shows for profit by

private  organisers has been stopped,  from  which

some  of the community centres hitherto derived  a

portion   of   their  income,  it  was   therefore

necessary  to  budget for next year on  the  basis

that  all the money required for the expansion  of

activities  in the existing centres  and  for  the

maintenance of activities in the new Centres to be

built  would  have  to  be found  from  Government

sources.  For this reason a sum of $1 million  has

been  entered in the Social Welfare Estimates  for

next  year for the development and integration  of

Community Associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sum would be used not only for the

construction of small community centres throughout

Singapore, in addition to those built through  the

generosity   of  Shaw  Foundation  which   donated

$200,000  for the purpose this year, but also  for

the  payment of honoraria to voluntary leaders and

for  the purchase of necessary equipment which had

never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



been  provided by the Department of Social Welfare

in  community  centres.  Without  the  service  of

active voluntary leaders and an adequate supply of

equipment, no community centre can hope to reach a

satisfactory  level of activities.  This  will  be

cheaper  than employing full-time paid  staff.  In

particular, S.I.T. community centres are in  great

need of such help and they have been neglected  by

Government  in  the  past.  The  following  S.I.T.

community  centres will come under the control  of

the  Department of Social Welfare next  year  when

money is available:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Alexandra Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Redhill Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Stamford Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Kim Keat Avenue Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Guillemard Estate Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Havelock Estate Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) Balestier Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) Kampong Silat Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) Pek Kio Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) Princess Elizabeth Community Centre



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New community centres situated in the thickly

populated areas, i.e. Minto Road, Banda Street and

Joo  Chiat Road are in the course of construction.

Sites  in the New Malay Settlement, Yan Kit  Road,

King  George V Avenue, Macpherson Road, Owen Road,

Nee  Soon  Village,  Thong Hoe  Village  and  Tuas

Village  are  available for immediate construction

and more sites will be acquired to construct small

community  centres in all areas  where  there  are

heavy concentrations of population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minto Road Community Centre will serve an

area  with  a mixed population of Malays,  Chinese

and  Indians. Banda Street Community Centre is  to

be  a  medium  size  one and  will  be  the  first

community  centre  to be built  in  the  heart  of

Chinatown.   Just  imagine  that.   The   previous

Government  allowed the Rural Board to  build  the

lavish Buona



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



Vista Road Community Centre for $250,000 which  is

very  little  used  and allowed centres  of  heavy

population in the heart of Chinatown to be without

any  community centre. The thick concentration  of

population here demands that this community centre

should  be  a  medium size one. The  Banda  Street

Community  Centre would have three  classrooms,  a

large  hall,  an office and toilet facilities  and

although  it  will  cost about  $39,000,  it  will

provide pearly as much floor space as that of  the

large  size community centres formerly  built  for

the Department of Social Welfare costing more than

$150,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated costs of the three community

centres   now  in  course  of  construction   with

electricity installed and sanitation provided  are

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minto Road Community Centre estimated $10,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banda Street Community Centre estimated

$39,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joo Chiat Community Centre estimated $13,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's plan for the centralisation of

all  community centres under a single organisation

which  I  mentioned in this Assembly on  the  17th

July,  1959,  is  progressing  and  will  not   be

completed until all the existing community centres

are brought under the control of the Department of

Social Welfare, and the small and medium community

centres  planned by Government are all  completed.

Meanwhile  control of all these community  centres

must  rest  with the Department of Social  Welfare

and  will  be my direct responsibility  until  the

single organisation referred to finally emerges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth organisations such as Boys' and Girls'

Clubs  have been permitted to carry on with  their

youth activities with the Federation of Boys'  and

Girls'  Clubs  as  the  parent  bodies.  With  the

winding  up  of the Singapore Youth  Council,  the

responsibility   for   co-ordinating   all   youth

activities now rests with the Singapore Council of

Social  Service of which the Federation  of  Boys'

and  Girls'  Clubs are affiliates. Government  has

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



entered    a    vote   of   $5,000   under    Head

25 - Contributions  and Charitable Allowances - for  a

grant  to  be  made next year for the Council  and

also provides the Council with premises in Orchard

Road  from  which  it  is  now  carrying  on   its

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said about Government's future plans

for  the  development and expansion  of  community

centres  should serve as a reminder to the  Member

for  Cairnhill that whereas he was content to  use

these  community organisations merely for building

up  a  cheap political machine to fight the P.A.P.

in the last elections, we, with our base firmly in

the  masses,  are able to ignore  such  petty  and

puerile  considerations and are able to  plan  the

use  of  the existing community centres and  those

yet  to  be built to serve the purposes for  which

such community centres are designed, that is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to be the media through which the aims and

intentions   of   the   Government   can   be

communicated and explained to the people;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to be focal points for programmes of

activities  organised to promote the  welfare

and recreational needs of the people by group

participation in social, cultural, health and

educational projects on a mass basis;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to serve as a training ground for future

leaders of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that I have given the Member for

Mountbatten all the information she required.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I must

compliment the Minister for his full knowledge  of

the  community work under his charge. After he has

given  us so much information, I hope he does  not

mind if I still have one more question to ask, and

I  hope  he does not mind answering. There  was  a

plan,  I  think,  to  use  the  materials  of  the

Singapore  Constitution  Exposition  to  build  10

small  community  centres in  different  parts  of

Singapore. I believe the Jaycees, if I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



not   mistaken,   and  another  organisation   are

providing  the money. Is the Government proceeding

with that plan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Govvernment is

making full use of all the Arcron structures  that

were   used   during  the  Singapore  Constitution

Exposition.  That  has enabled Government  to  cut

down  the cost of these community centres.  As  to

the project of the Jaycees, the Government had  an

alternative scheme. They did propose to set  up  a

children's social centre in the vacant  ground  in

front  of the Ministry of Labour in Havelock Road.

Since  then, the grounds have been taken  over  by

the Ministry of National Development and have been

developed as a park for children.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> May I have your permission

to withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I obtain the views of hon.

Members  on  that  request, I  might  inform  hon.

Members that if any Member wishes to speak now  on

the  community centres as a subject, this  is  the

time  to  speak;  otherwise he will  not  have  an

opportunity  of  speaking  further  on   community

centres  as a subject. I have indicated that  when

we  come to amendment No. 12, the debate may range

over  the whole of social welfare policy  and  the

different  departments.  But  as  we  are  now  on

community  centres,  the  debate  on  it  must  be

finalised now. This is the opportunity. I trust  I

have made myself clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a request to withdraw the amendment. Is

it the pleasure of hon. Members that the amendment

be withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): No. Mr Speaker, thank you for the

explanation given on the community centres.  I  am

taking this opportunity to speak on the subject. I

was  unable  to  find out from the speech  of  the

Minister  for Labour and Law whether the community

centre at Jalan Penggaga was included therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which strikes me is that the Hon.

Minister  in his speech in English said  a  plural

number in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



Malay Settlements. How many more community centres

are going to be built in the Malay Settlements?  I

hope the Minister responsible for this matter will

enlighten me further on this subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

Member for Kampong Kembangan that in the past,  as

far  as community centres are concerned, there was

a  lot  of  neglect  in regard  to  assisting  the

predominantly Malay areas of the population. There

were  very few Malay activity instructors who were

employed.  There was also only one Malay community

centre in a predominantly Malay area, i.e. the one

in Jalan Eunos, costing round about $28,000, which

I  mentioned earlier. We have spent quite a lot of

time   touring   various  areas   in   the   Malay

Settlements  in  the State which  could  serve  as

possible  sites for community centres. We  visited

the  site  at Kaki Bukit, which could serve  as  a

site   for  a  community  centre.  We  have   also

reorganised  the children's social centre  in  the

Malay  Farm.  That site is subject to floods  and,

for  that reason, we could not reconstruct  a  new

building  on  that  particular site.  But  we  are

looking  out  for other suitable  sites  in  these

areas  for  the  erection of small type  community

centres. We are in the course of engaging a lot of

Malay activity instructors, and I am very happy to

report that, for the first time, we have been able

to  recruit  Malay  girls,  who  are  both  Malay-speaking  and  English-speaking, to assist  us  in

this work. We have gone forward in a big way and I

hope  we  will be able to produce some  very  good

results next year.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I thank

the  Minister for his explanation, but I am  still

waiting for a definite reply on a community centre

at Jalan Penggaga. I have singled this out because

this  area  is  subject  to  floods.  It  is  very

difficult  for the residents to take advantage  of

the  community centre there. I hope  the  Minister

will  state whether the community centre at  Jalan

Penggaga  is included in his development programme

or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will have to

visit the area in question. I must confess that  I

am  not yet in a position to do so, but in view of

what the Member for Kampong Kembangan has said,  I

will  take  the opportunity of visiting this  area

and seeing whether we will be able to do something

for it in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to take

this opportunity of asking the Minister for Labour

and  Law  about this. In Pulau Brani there  was  a

building erected as a community centre before  the

general elections. Until today there have been  no

activities whatsoever there, and I would  like  to

know the position in regard to this building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess I

have not noticed this community centre, but I will

make a visit in due course.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the

Minister  will permit me to ask one more  question

on  community centres. In the old plan, on the use

of  materials from the Constitution Exposition,  I

know that there was a community centre to be built

in  Jalan Ampat, the site chosen to house the fire

victims at the Old Kallang Airport. I do not  know

whether  it is to be built or not, because  I  did

not  hear  it  mentioned in the list of  community

centres the Minister had given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, we are still

concentrating  at  present  on  putting  up  these

community centres in areas where there is a  heavy

concentration of population and where there are no

community centres. There is one now being built at

Minto  Road.  It is in a place where a  number  of

houses  have collapsed and the site is vacant.  We

are  looking for such areas which will reduce  the

cost of construction. Otherwise, the money that is

allocated  for this purpose will have to  be  used

for  the  purchase  of sites and  this  would  add

considerably to the cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained earlier, the provision of

$350,000 last year would be inadequate. We are now

going to get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



control  of all the S.I.T. community centres,  and

we  would have to bear all these additional costs.

It is, therefore, not possible for us to state now

where  we  shall be putting up the other community

centres.  But  we  have these objectives:  (1)  to

build   where   there   are   concentrations    of

population;  and (2) we would also  work  this  in

with  community  centres in the rural  areas - small

ones in places where already we have Crown land.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  inform the Minister that  in  that  area

about   2,000  families  are  housed   in   S.I.T.

buildings.  I  believe there  is  Government  land

there. And in his future projects, I hope that the

Minister will bear this in mind and include in his

scheme  a  Community Centre to be put up at  Jalan

Ampat.  And  I  also hope that he will  bear  this

scheme  in  mind when planning to use  the  Arcron

materials for building community centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall take due note

of what the Member for Mountbatten said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have explained and perhaps I had

better  explain again, that now is the opportunity

for  any  Member who wishes to speak on  community

centres as a subject. Otherwise, he must for  this

Budget session keep silent in so far as this  Head

is  concerned. I have put the amendment before the

House and it cannot now be withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 37 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given reasons why I think the young

population  is growing. Based on that argument,  I

notice that provision for the purchase of food for

the  Child Feeding Scheme will be reduced for  the

year  1960.  Is Government planning to  give  them

less  food,  or  does Government  think  that  the

prices  of  food have gone down, or has Government

other channels of getting cheaper food?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not that we

are  cutting down on the food that we  provide  to

the  children. It is rather because  of  an  over-estimate  in  1958-9 that the provision  for  next

year  is  reduced. The Estimate for  provision  in

1958  was  $100,000, and in 1959  $90,000.  It  is

considered  that  these sums were  over-estimated,

and  that  we can adequately provide the  children

with all their requirements on the amount that  we

have estimated for next year.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> In view of the explanation

given,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, may I be  permitted  to

withdraw the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 37 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 16.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 16 is "Assistance to Youth and

Recreation Organisations." Sir, I have moved  this

amendment  in  order to seek information,  because

the  Estimate for 1959 is not shown and I am  just

wondering whether any provision for expansion  has

been made, or whether any increment is made in the

Estimates for 1960.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The honourable Member, I take it,

has read Note (iii).



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this provision is

utilised   to  pay  honoraria  to  club   leaders,

activity  instructors and so on,  in  our  various

youth  clubs.  As the Note says, the "Increase  is

due  to  more clubs receiving assistance". I  will

not  bore  hon. Members by giving them an itemised

list of how we arrive at the sum of $156,000. Last

year,  in  addition to this provision,  a  sum  of

$15,000  was  provided  for  the  Singapore  Youth

Council.  The  Singapore Youth Council  has  since

been  wound  up, and this additional money  brings

the  figure to $171,000 for next year. I feel that

the  money  wasted by the Youth Council  could  be

better utilised by providing more club leaders and

more  activity  instructors for our various  youth

clubs.

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 24.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument here is the same. I notice that

further  furniture and equipment for the  Havelock

Road  Girls'  Hostel, the Girls' Homecraft  Centre

and  others  listed, have not been  provided.  And

since Government have announced that they do  wish

to  expand  this  type of activities,  I  am  just

wondering  whether this has not been an oversight,

or  whether  the existing furniture and  equipment

will be sufficient for the expansion planned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the furniture and

equipment in the various hostels and centres  have

already  been purchased with the moneys voted  for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an item under sub-head 26 shows "Covent

Garden    Slums   Clearance - Rent   of    Singapore

Improvement  Trust Premises". We  all  know - and  I

think  the Minister himself knows best as  he  was

complaining just now that there were no  community

centres  for  the Chinatown area - that clearing  of

the  slums is very important. I will not dwell  on

that  because I think everybody here realises  it.

No  estimate  for  1960 is shown,  but  since  the

additional  note to that says "Rent  of  Singapore

Improvement  Trust Premises", can I take  it  that

the  Government's  promise of  a  subsidy  to  the

people  who have been cleared out of Covent Garden

has  now  come to an end; that the Government  has

fulfilled  its  promise  and  no  more  money   is

three or four times what was in my mind, and  that

is  that the subject of community centres  is  now

closed.  The  Member was given a chance  when  the

item  itself was being discussed, and I  tried  to

make  it  as clear as possible that that  was  the

arise.  If  there  is any other  topic  which  the

course,  this is the opportunity. But the  subject

of community centres is finished completely.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I suppose

debate on the running of community centres and its

methods  is also closed. So I shall not  speak  on

that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Hoe, I think, wishes to

speak, and this is her opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

the  Member  for Mountbatten has previously  asked

many  questions in connection with youth community

centres, as if she is much concerned over this. We

know all along that in the community centres-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think there must have some

difficulty in the interpretation of my remarks. We

have  completed discussing community centres.  But

if  there  is  any other aspect of youth  services

that  the  hon.  Lady wishes to discuss,  she  may

proceed, but the subject of community centres is a

closed book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Miss Fung would like to speak on juvenile

delinquency?



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now

I  touched  on  certain  questions  regarding  the

Juvenile Court. After studying the appointment  of

a Magistrate in the Juvenile Court, I discussed it

with  the  Minister.  I  did  not  make  a  proper

statement  just now and I express my  regrets  for

that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile crime is a very serious problem. I think

a  young  magistrate  will be  in  a  much  better

position to understand the ways and thinking of  a

young man than can an old magistrate. When a youth

commits  his first crime, and if we can treat  him

properly,   then   it  will  be   beneficial   and

advantageous  to  his future.  Our  view  of  this

problem  is  quite  different  from  that  of  the

previous Government. If we get a capable and  able

Magistrate to deal with this problem and, further,

if  he can understand and analyse the factors  and

reasons  for  juvenile crime,  then  I  think  the

Government will be in a better position  to  solve

this  problem.  So  if we look into  this  problem

carefully  and seriously, it will be  solved  more

satisfactorily.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in case I

have  been misunderstood, I just want to  make  it

very  clear  to  the hon. Member  that  I  am  not

against the appointment. All I ask is whether  the

post could be a voluntary one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr  Speaker,  in their discussion  today  on  the

particular  items under the Head "Social  Welfare"

Members  tend to forget the fact that, because  of

our  young  population,  the  problems  of  social

welfare in these times will not diminish but  will

increase. That is quite understandable, because we

have one of the highest population birth rates  in

the  world.  Also, many of the 300,000 people  who

have  registered  for Singapore  citizenship  came

from  other countries where originally  they  were

not  trained in any skilled work. Having  come  to

Singapore, many have now found themselves reaching

a  stage  where  they have to find some  means  of

livelihood.  May I quote an example? It  is  quite

pitiable  to  see in Queen Street many  old  women

hawking  by the sides of the road. Their  husbands

are  dead but their children must eat. So you  are

left with a class of old women who have now got to

fend  for themselves. Women have a longer span  of

life  than  men. It is just like the drones  dying

faster than the bees. But what I would like to say

is this: that social welfare covers all classes of

people and considerable assistance has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



given   to  this  class  of  people - widows   whose

husbands are not in Singapore or are dead and with

children to take care of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delinquency has lately been on the increase,

mainly  due  to  the fact that we  have  not  been

prepared  for an upsurge in the numbers  of  those

living  in Singapore and, therefore, we  have  not

been  able  to  readjust our social conditions  to

find  employment for them. It is because  of  this

reason  that  social welfare cannot be  considered

solely  in  terms of dishing out public assistance

funds.  In  this respect, the Minister for  Labour

and  Law has done very well. He has explained  his

idea   surrounding  community  centres  and  youth

service  centres. The point has been made that  we

have now appointed a full-time Magistrate for  the

Juvenile Court. Of course, it is desirable that we

should  accept  any help which  is  being  offered

voluntarily.  But, unfortunately, as the  Minister

has  pointed out, those who have come  forward  to

offer  their  services have reached a stage  where

they  fail  to  appreciate the  problems  existing

today.  And in a Juvenile Court, it is not helpful

to a young boy or girl of about 10 or 12 years old

to  have a man In his sixties or seventies quoting

to  him the analects of Confucius on how to behave

and  so  on,  when those trite sayings  are  quite

divorced from the hectic days of modern life.  For

a  young  magistrate to come forward and volunteer

his  services to serve in the Court would take  up

much  of  his  time  and, therefore,  it  is  only

correct  that  a  full-time Magistrate  should  be

employed to serve in the Juvenile Court.  We  have

no quarrel about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important point which was brought forward in

the  discussion  was  that there  were  more  male

probation  officers than lady probation  officers.

As  the  Minister has pointed out, this is because

females tend to be less delinquent than males.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, of course, poses a real problem, and I

think  the only solution to that would be for  the

Ministry of Health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



to  devise  a  method  by which  Singaporeans  can

produce  more  females! It  would  also  ease  the

problem of the Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all in all, I would say that when we talk of

social welfare assistance, we ought not to  do  so

in  the  light  that we are giving  out  dole.  We

appreciate  considerably the difficulties  of  the

Minister  for Labour and Law - that he has  a  heavy

registration of unemployed in his Ministry and, at

the  same  time,  having these claims  for  public

assistance  for the unemployed compete with  those

who  suffer from disabilities. Perhaps the  public

of  Singapore  could  ease his  problems  if  they

genuinely  seek  to  come forward,  mix  with  the

people  and try to understand their problem rather

than adopting an antagonistic attitude of:

"Why did we do this? Why did we not do that?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men have a tendency to group together. Those who

collect  stamps  come  together.  Those  who  take

photographs  group together. That is because  they

have  a  common interest. In Western countries,  I

understand, Sir, even nudists group together.  But

what  I  would like to say is this. If we wish  to

check  juvenile delinquency, if we wish the people

of Singapore to have a feeling that they belong to

a society, an opportunity must be given to them to

come  together,  and  that  opportunity  is  being

provided  for by the community centres, for  which

$1 million has been provided for in the Estimates.

The  opportunity  is also given  to  them  by  the

provision  of sports centres and also other  youth

centres. It is our hope that these centres  should

not  be abused and that they should not become the

focal  point  of gangsterism. It has come  to  our

knowledge that some of these centres have, in  the

past,  become collecting points for youthful thugs

where  they plan their operations. It is therefore

right  that the Minister for Labour and Law should

concentrate  his attention on the organisation  of

community centres.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it is quite all right if

the  Hon. the  Deputy Prime Minister  touches  on

community  centres in passing. But if he  develops

the  argument  on  community  centres,  then,   of

course, he is out of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I have just brought up the

subject of community centres in order to bring out

the ability of the Minister for Labour and Law  in

organisation  and his attention  and  devotion  to

social welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and again, Mr Speaker, it has been said

that some women are interested in household duties

and card games and in the pleasures of a leisurely

life.  But  it is my feeling that if our  Assembly

women,  including, of course, the hon. Member  for

Mountbatten,  could come forward and organise  the

women  of  Singapore, they will go a long  way  to

helping  us  stop  juvenile  delinquency.  It  has

become  public knowledge that, of late, those  who

have  been involved in thuggery have not only been

boys  but  they have also included girls,  who  in

fact  are  the leaders of the gangs.  I  will  not

pretend  to  know anything about how  these  girls

manage  to  organise the men. I am quite  sure  an

understanding of the psychology of the female  can

be better understood by our Assembly women.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree

with the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister about  the

women  of  Singapore coming out to  try  and  stop

juvenile  delinquency. He calls upon the women  in

the  Assembly, and I am glad he has  included  the

Opposition, and has asked her to come forward  and

do  some  work to prevent juvenile delinquency.  I

wish to inform him that I have been coming forward

and  have been doing this for the last six  years.

My  present plan is this. We are going up  to  the

Federation. I do not know whether the Deputy Prime

Minister  knows that in the Federation  the  women

are  very active in this type of work. They go  to

the  villages and kampongs attending to the  needs

of  the  people and the children. We in  Singapore

have  not that experience. We have arranged to  go

there  in  January. A team of women from Singapore

will go up, and I have invited two women, one from

the  Government Bench and one of the P.A.P. women

members  in the Education Department, and  I  hope

they will co-operate with us and join this team of

women  to go up to the Federation and see how  the

women social workers there work in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



villages  and kampongs. We hope to come back  here

and  adopt whatever methods we think will be  good

for Singapore. I do hope that, in view of what the

Deputy  Prime Minister has said, we will  get  the

wholehearted  support of the  Government  in  this

project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

just  now  the Member for Mountbatten  raised  one

point.  She  said  that the  youth  population  of

Singapore is increasing and, therefore, the number

of  Principal  Youth  Service Officers  should  be

increased.  I  do not mean she is wrong,  but  the

point  is  this.  The birth rate in  Singapore  is

supposed  to  be  the highest in  the  world  and,

therefore,  certainly  the  youth  population   is

increasing. To reduce the birth rate is one thing,

but  to  increase  the number of  Principal  Youth

Service Officers is quite another thing. I believe

she  is a principal of a school and she will  know

that if there are 200 pupils and one principal  in

a  school, and if the pupils are increased to 400,

it  does  not  mean that there is need  to  employ

another  principal. Therefore, I think  this  will

prove  that,  although  the  youth  population  in

Singapore  is increasing, it is not necessary  for

us   to   employ  more  Principal  Youth   Service

Officers.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the

budget  for the Ministry of Labour and Law,  I  am

taking this opportunity to put forward this  point

concerning  the  assistance given  by  the  Social

Welfare    Department - public   aid.    The    most

interesting  feature is that  concerning  a  blind

person who receives public aid. I understand  from

the  blind person himself that originally the  aid

he received from the Social Welfare Department was

adequate.  It was a sum which enabled that  person

to  satisfy his daily needs. But I am surprised to

discover  that when the new Government  came  into

power,  the  usual  aid of $25 which  he  used  to

receive was reduced to $5. This matter was brought

to  the  attention of the Minister for Labour  and

Law.  I drew his attention as to how one can  live

or  subsist on $5, if he is blind. This problem is

different  from that of other persons who  receive

aid, like the unemployed persons who may be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



to  find some other means of employment. But to  a

blind  person  who cannot see, we  must  know  the

difficulties he is facing, unless he has a special

trade  or  skill. I am told that the Minister  for

Labour  and Law has drawn up a scheme to  aid  the

blind, but until now there is no announcement that

the  scheme has been implemented, I hope  that  in

the  new scheme, the persons affected will not  be

made to suffer by receiving only $5 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, to which I would like

to  draw the attention of this House, particularly

that  of the Minister for Labour and Law, is  that

we  do  not  wish  to encourage people  to  depend

solely on public aid for their living, and we also

know  that  aid for the unemployed is  given  from

public money. Therefore, we must draw up a plan so

that the really needy cases should receive aid. In

this  matter, I should like to draw the  attention

of  the Government to those needy cases who should

receive Government aid and should be given help.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote as an example the circumstances of the

residents  in  the Southern Islands.  They  are  a

section  of  the society of Singapore,  and  their

position  is different from that of their brethren

on  the Singapore mainland. It can be said that 98

per  cent of them - excluding the residents of Pulau

Brani  and  Pulau Bukom - depend for  their  living

solely on fishing. The problem of fishing is  very

intricate  and  complex. For  that  reason,  these

islanders  cannot  find an  alternative  means  of

livelihood  except  fishing.  For  instance,  they

cannot  become hawkers because they are  isolated.

Their  means of livelihood as fishermen will  fail

if  they suffer ill-health. If they become  blind,

they  cannot go out to the sea, whether  at  night

time  or day time, because they are unable to see.

It  is  obvious  then  that  they  cannot  go  out

fishing.  In such circumstances, this will  be  an

obstacle  to  their earning a living.  Unlike  the

people  living in the City, if they are ill,  they

cannot find employment. The people in the city can

find  other  ways and means of subsistence.  As  I

said  earlier,  the  islanders  depend  solely  on

fishing for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



their   means  of  livelihood.  For  that  reason,

assistance to them is very essential. They must be

given  special  priority. They  must  be  made  an

exception to the rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

state at the outset that this Government has  been

very  generous  as  far  as public  assistance  is

concerned.  When  we came in, we  found  that  the

amount  allotted  for  public  assistance  by  the

previous  Government for this year was $5,500,000.

There  was no proper supervision kept of the funds

that  were  administered by the Public  Assistance

Section  of my Ministry in the sense that we  have

on our registers about 22,000 people who are given

public  assistance  and there are  only  about  47

investigators to look into the claims of those who

require  assistance. You can realise, Mr Speaker,

that, with such a large number involved, and  with

so  few  investigators, and because of  the  sheer

weight  of numbers, it is very hard to keep  track

of  how,  in  fact,  this  money  is  distributed.

However, we knew that to be the position,  and  we

also  knew  that  there was quite  a  considerable

amount  of poverty in the State. For that  reason,

we asked for a supplementary provision to increase

the  vote  from $5.5 million to $6.7  million  for

this  year. In spite of the demands that are  made

on  this  Government  for  money  for  development

purposes, we have nevertheless been able  to  push

the  provision for public assistance  even  higher

for  next year, so that, ever since we have formed

the  Government, the vote has increased from  $5.5

million to $6.7 million, and for next year to $7.5

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the public for

their   co-operation  in  the  matter  of   public

assistance.  We  get a numbers  of  letters  daily

complaining   that  the  sums  which   have   been

appropriated for public assistance are being  mis-spent,  and  that there are people  in  very  good

circumstances who receive this public  assistance.

A  check is made on every letter received,  and  I

would say that in 90 per cent of the cases the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



information  that we have received is quite  true.

We  get  our investigators to go round and recheck

the  position  and stop the allowances  where  the

reports are found to be true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been more and more people coming to us

for  assistance, and with the proper  distribution

of this money, I think that with the money that is

being  made  available by this Assembly  for  next

year, we will be able to carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also changed the rates of assistance. The

head  of  a  household used to get $15  per  month

previously. We have taken it up to $16 per  month.

The wife, as head of the household, used to get $8

per month. We have taken it up to $10 per month. A

dependent child, aged 16 and over, receives $8 per

month - we  have not changed that rate. A  dependent

child  under 16 years receives $5 a month - we  have

not changed that rate. The maximum allowance for a

household has gone up from $87 to $90.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for the Southern Islands said

just  now  that there were fishermen  in  indigent

circumstances in the Southern Islands.  There  was

the  case  of  a  blind man who  was  refused  any

allowance. I think his information is not correct,

because  we  have  approved an  additional  public

assistance  allowance for people who  are  totally

blind, to people who are totally deaf and dumb, to

the crippled, and to those who have lost both arms

or the right arm or lost both legs. So that people

in  those  circumstances get, in addition  to  the

public  assistance allowance at the  normal  rate,

this special disability allowance. We have stopped

sickness  allowances. It was the practice  in  the

past  for  anybody  who came to the  Ministry  for

public  assistance to get, in addition  to  public

assistance,   what  was  known   as   a   sickness

allowance.  In  order to give  them  an  increased

allowance,  the officers in this Ministry  decided

that persons making a demand for public assistance

should get this augmented allowance, an additional

allowance  of  $16 on the grounds that  they  were

sick, though there was nothing wrong with them. We

have stopped that. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



also  stopped  the grant of public  assistance  to

able-bodied  single persons. A lot of  people  who

are  able-bodied and single were receiving  public

assistance  allowances. We have stopped  this.  So

that  with the amount that we have voted for  next

year,  I think we can extend public assistance  to

an increased number of people who are in need.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I want to add some more words to the

subject  of the Juvenile Magistrate which  Members

have raised. We know that different societies have

different methods of taking care of children.  For

example,  under the past Colonial government,  the

whitecollar  class was created in order  to  serve

the  Colonialists better. In the methods of taking

care of children, they did not do much. Under  the

past  Government,  many films were  shown  in  the

cinemas  which  were detrimental to the  children.

After seeing the rock `n roll films, we have  seen

children imitating that kind of behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, someone told me that a boy of 14 years

old  was  the leader of a secret society.  I  have

since  heard that this 14-year old youth has  been

arrested  and  taken into custody  in  the  Social

Welfare  Department. The juvenile delinquent  said

that  he  did not like to come out. He  wished  to

learn something in the Department and make himself

useful in society in the future. Therefore,  in  a

different  society  under a different  Government,

there  are  different methods  of  treating  these

criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, if we have a capable magistrate

who can understand the behaviour and character  of

the  children and understand their problems,  that

magistrate  will  be  very useful  to  the  future

citizens  of this State. For example, recently  in

my  area,  during Loyalty Week, we assembled  many

organisations to take part in Loyalty  Week.  When

we  were  celebrating our Loyalty Week,  we  found

many  children taking part in our programme.  They

were  from poor families. In the past, because  of

their poverty, they were not taken care of by  the

Government. Therefore, when they were five or  six

years  of  age, their cultural standard  was  very

low, and they did not know anything. And by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



chance  they  became members of secret  societies.

When  the  P.A.P. Government took over, under  the

capable  hands  of our Minister  for  Culture  and

Minister  for Education, these children are  being

guided by the new policies of this Government. The

little   children   know  how  to   behave   well.

Therefore,  we say that if we want to tackle  this

problem,  it  is  not  enough  to  have  so-called

voluntary  service offered by retired officers  to

act  as magistrates, because their opinion is old-fashioned and would not be practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, in the Social Welfare Department,

unlike the Opposition who say that they cannot  do

better  unless they have an increase  of  money - we

have to adopt a method which is good, for example,

an  educational  method by which to  educate  them

about  the kind of society they are living in,  so

that  they  will  try  their  best  to  serve  the

society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  juvenile  delinquency  is   a

sickness  in  this  20th century.  In  many  other

countries  such  as  Japan and  America,  juvenile

delinquency  may  still  be  a  problem,  but   in

Singapore  it is not so great. We, the Government,

must  prevent  juvenile delinquency  from  getting

worse.  Although  there is  a  Juvenile  Court  in

Singapore, the magistrates presiding therein  give

their  services without pay. But they do not  know

the   problems   and  causes  of   this   juvenile

delinquency.  Therefore, at the present  time,  we

can  see  many juvenile delinquents.  So  we  must

appoint  a  magistrate who is well experienced  in

the behaviour and problems of the young criminals,

and knows what causes them to be so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Mountbatten asked why we

should   use   public  money   to   appoint   this

magistrate. Our Government is trying its  best  to

economise  in  every respect, but for  a  Juvenile

Court it is useless to have the voluntary services

of  a  magistrate.  We  must appoint  a  full-time

magistrate and pay him. Therefore, we must appoint

an  experienced magistrate. He must be well  aware

of  the  juvenile delinquents' hobbies  and  their

likes and dislikes in order to lead them into good

channels. Now, since we are able to appoint a full-time magistrate with pay, we must do so.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much has

been debated today on juvenile delinquents. But  I

noticed   everybody  was  talking   about   curing

juvenile  delinquency.  Sir,  the  problem  is  to

prevent it. That is more important than curing it.

There  will  be no need to cure that sickness,  or

disease as it was called, if it is prevented right

from  the beginning. What is the cause of juvenile

delinquents? The Minister for Labour and  Law  has

rightly    tackled    the   problem    from    one

angle - community activities and youth organisations

to  occupy their leisure hours. But I say that  is

not sufficient. I believe that the root of all  of

this    delinquency   lies    in    the    adult's

misunderstanding of the young people. A  child  is

not  born  a delinquent. He becomes one.  And  why

does  he become one? When he has no confidence  in

himself. And he cannot have confidence in  himself

if  his  own parents do not understand him.  So  I

would  say  that, apart from community  activities

and  youth  organisations, adult education  should

penetrate  into the slum areas and villages  where

parents  and  old  people only  know  one  way  of

life - that of their ancestors - and their children go

to   school  and  learn  all  sorts  of  ways   of

life - Western    ways   and   of   the    different

people's - and these children come back  with  these

ideas  which are not understood by their  parents.

Therefore,  they  cannot reconcile  their  way  of

living  with the way that their parents want  them

to  live.  If they are not confident and  have  no

confidence in their own parents,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



they  turn  to  other sources  and  sometimes,  as

usually  happens, the bad hats,  who  try  to  get

these  young people in with them, will pretend  to

understand  them. That is how these  young  people

fall into the trap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the Minister for Labour and Law has

tackled the question of catering for their leisure

hours  only,  but there is need for  understanding

from  their  parents also. I would appeal  to  the

Minister  for  Education  to  push  forward  adult

education  from the point of view of not  just  to

teach the parents reading and writing, but to make

them  understand the young people and  the  modern

way of thinking and life.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Byrne, would you like to reply

on juvenile delinquency?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I am not omniscient and I

find it difficult to reply to such matters, but  I

would like to point out to the House that it is my

duty,   amongst  others,  to  read   through   the

confessions  that are made by our young  gangsters

in  Singapore,  and  I am sad  to  find  that  the

majority of them are not children. They are grown-up  persons between the ages of 18 and 23 and most

of them, if we trace back their records, are those

who have had their early education interrupted  by

the Japanese Occupation of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking after the future of the younger

people and we are taking real and determined steps

to  organise their leisure hours for them, so that

it  will  keep them out of bad company and  enable

them to grow up as decent citizens of our State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the delinquents, they are

certainly not juvenile. We have tried to  persuade

them to correct their ways, and since that has not

been  effective enough, we have had to  use  other

methods.  The methods used are such as  to  ensure

that the community will not be in any way held  to

ransom by hooliganism. That is the most I wish  to

say on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That disposes of juvenile

includes  gratuities  payable?  And  how   is   it

intended to recruit these three legal officers?



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday when we

were discussing the judicial estimates, the Member

for  Farrer Park enquired how many officers  there

were  in  the judiciary and what their  experience

was,  and  the answer I gave then was  that  there

were  now  12 officers in the judiciary,  of  whom

there  were  four who had more than  three  years'

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the same situation obtains in

the  office  of the State Advocate-General.  There

are 10 Legal Officers there, and of these 10 three

have experience of 18 years, three have experience

of five years, one of four years, one of two years

and two of one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a very heavy

legislative programme before us, and  it  will  be

necessary for us to get legal talent to assist  us

in  implementing our legislative programme. As far

as labour legislation is concerned, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



had  to  appeal to the Australian Commissioner  in

Singapore to assist us to get a legal officer  who

is  an  expert in labour problems to come here  to

assist  us. Through his intervention we have  been

successful   in  getting  Mr  Weston,   a   legal

draftsman in the Labour Ministry in Australia,  to

be  here  to  assist  us in  drafting  new  labour

legislation  which will be introduced  later  this

year.  We  are very short of a drafting specialist

and  it is intended that one of the legal officers

to be recruited will be entrusted with the duty of

being  in  charge of the drafting section  of  the

S.A.G.'s office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also propose to recruit another experienced

legal   officer  to  be  in  charge  of   criminal

prosecutions  and  to  train  police   and   legal

officers  in undertaking prosecutions  before  the

criminal courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also hope to recruit another legal officer to

be in charge of revenue cases. I think that was  a

subject  raised  by  the Member  for  Farrer  Park

yesterday.  He wanted to know what steps  we  were

taking to enforce the income tax legislation.  One

way of enforcing it is to get an experienced legal

officer in income tax matters to assist us in that

work. These are the legal officers we require. Mr

Speaker,  we have advertised these posts  both  in

the United Kingdom and locally. So far we have not

had  any  response from our advertisement  in  the

United  Kingdom. As far as the local advertisement

is   concerned,   we  received  six  applications,

amongst  which  was one - I was surprised  to  know

this - from  the Member for Joo Chiat.  I  was  also

surprised to hear that the President of the  Legal

Commission  has reported that, in the  opinion  of

the   Legal   Commission,  none   of   the   local

applications were worthy of consideration. I  have

forgotten  the third question. May I be  reminded,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the latter part of my question

was  whether  these were intended to be  permanent

posts  or  temporary  posts; whether  the  sum  of

$2,500 - that    is,   if   they   were    temporary

posts - included  gratuities,  or  a   further   sum

provided  by  way of gratuity; and  how  long  are

these posts for?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these posts are on

an  inclusive salary of $2,500 a month, but it  is

proposed that the holders of these posts  will  be

on  contract for three years, at the end of  which

on  satisfactory  completion of  their  contracts,

they will be eligible for gratuity at the rate  of

$300 for each month of service, including approved

full-pay leave. The period of engagement is to  be

on  contract for three years. I hope that  I  have

answered the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I take it, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when

these posts have been filled and the officers have

run  their three-year course, these officers would

not  be necessary because the officers within  the

Department  itself might then be in a position  to

carry  on  the  work which has been undertaken  by

these  three  officers.  In  view  of  that,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 38 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 19.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 19 under the main head State Advocate-General, Legal Claims and Costs $20,000, and a

note  against  it - "Required  to  meet  claims  for

damages  and costs for appeal." As I see from  the

Estimates, this seems to be an entirely  new  item

which  is  being provided for, for the year  1960.

Could  the  Minister please tell  the  House  what

legal  claims and costs the State Advocate-General

expects to be called upon to pay in 1960?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is

required to meet claims for damages in respect  of

wrongful arrests and detention by police officers,

and  in  respect of injuries caused by the drivers

of  Government  vehicles.  As  Members  know,  all

Government  vehicles are not  insured,  and  costs

arise  by  way of legal representation when  there

are appeals in criminal cases to the Privy Council

where  it  is  necessary  for  Government  to   be

represented in those appeals. We have had  claims.

I   have   got  a  list  of  claims  here  against

Government  from  1958.  There  was  a  claim  for

damages in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



respect  of  a  collision between a sampan  and  a

Master   Attendant's  motor   launch   for   which

Government  was  ordered to pay damages  of  $900.

Then there was an accident in which a citizen  was

injured  by a P.W.D. lorry and the damages awarded

in that case came to $5,000. There was a case of a

citizen who was wrongfully arrested by a detective

in  Joo  Chiat Police Station. The damages awarded

were $300. And there was the famous Chew Swee  Kee

case, where the Government have had to incur costs

in  respect  of  representation on behalf  of  the

Comptroller of Income Tax in the inquiry into  Mr

Chew Swee Kee's banking account. They amounted  to

$3,040.50. In view of the fact that Mr Chew  Swee

Kee  has since renounced his citizenship and  left

this  country, I think we should make some attempt

to  get  him  to pay for those legal  costs.  Then

there  were  costs  arising  out  of  damages  for

trespass,  unlawful arrest and unlawful  detention

by a detective constable. They came to $750. There

was  a claim brought by the dependants of a P.W.D.

labourer  in  respect  of a  fatal  accident.  The

damages  awarded  were $13,000. There  were  other

small   damages  that  have  arisen  out  of   the

negligence  of the serangs in Government  launches

and the cost of an appeal to the Privy Council, so

that  the  total  amount that the  Government  has

sustained  up  to  date  by  way  of  damages   is

$25,953.05.  Hitherto it was the practice  to  pay

for  these damages, as and when they were awarded,

from  a miscellaneous vote under O.C.S.E. In  view

of  the  fact  that  this is  a  commitment  which

Government  is expected to incur annually,  it  is

proposed  that  for next year a  sum  of  $20,000

should be voted for this purpose, from which  all,

claims for damages against Government can be met.

section.  That was the reason why this  particular

post  was created. Since then, the holder  of  the

able  to find someone suitable enough to fill this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Member for Tanglin will realise

that,  unlike the previous Government, we are  not

interested in telling the people that we are  very

important people and that wherever we go we should

be  shown  respect and so on, but that we  believe

that one of the purposes of any government is  not

merely to make it popular but also to educate  and

instruct  the  electorate. And to that  extent  we

have  laid  great stress on publicity, instruction

and information; and since this Ministry is mainly

concerned with that problem, we have the Publicity

Liaison   Secretary  whose  functions   are   more

technical  than  political. It  is  a  post  which

requires  journalistic ability, and  knowledge  of

publicity methods. I am quite sure the Member  for

Tanglin  realises that if the previous  government

bad taken the precaution of appointing a Publicity

Liaison Secretary, probably many of his colleagues

who had hoped to be here would now be here.

             (2) Transport".

</pre>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when it was

indicated to me that Members of the Opposition had

a  number of amendments, I had expected that  they

would  be  very  weighty  subjects  pertaining  to

culture.  Instead,  they have descended  from  the

sublime  to the ridiculous. The Member for  Farrer

Park  has chosen to make queries not about culture

but  about  meals  and transport provided  in  the

course  of administering culture to the people  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me preface my remarks by saying that these

Civics Programmes were started in June 1957 by the

previous  government  as part  of  their  election

strategy. I quote from the Singapore Annual Report

1957, page 256:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The definite need" -



<br><br>that is for civic education of the masses -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"was created by the Singapore Citizenship Law

which  brought  the great majority  of  the  adult

population  into the political life of  Singapore,

and   the   Local  Government  Legislation   which

expanded  the  local  government  electorate   and

introduced elections for the first time into local

government in the rural areas."



<br><br>It goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the passing of legislation for the first

elected Councils in the rural areas, emphasis  was

placed at first on groups from the rural areas for

whom  the centralised administration had been  too

distant a factor."



<br><br>The  civic courses, again according to the  Annual

Report,  included  interviews with  Ministers  and

Assistant  Ministers, which probably explains  why

all   but  one  of  the  Ministers  and  Assistant

Ministers of the former government failed  to  get

re-elected.  I am not blaming them for  organising

these civic courses with the election in view, but

what I am blaming them for is for having failed to

achieve their objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957 a sum of $5,200 was voted for transport,

and  $6,500 for meals. If you remember,  Sir,  the

year 1957 was also the year when the City Council

Elections were in the offing, and it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



generally believed that the P.A.P. would stand for

election. It did and swept the polls. So in  1958,

the  amount  provided for transport was  increased

from $5,200 to $9,600, and the vote for meals  was

increased  from $6,500 to $12,400. In  1959,  with

the   general  elections  pending,  there  was   a

provision of $12,450 for transport and $12,050 for

meals. Well, that was the rather humble origin  of

the  civics programmes which we inherited  and  we

decided  that the Civics Programmes could be  used

for  different  purposes, because we  quite  agree

that  these civic courses are quite useful. It  is

necessary  that  ordinary people should  get  some

idea  of how democracy functions, how a government

works.  Where  the visitors involved are  farmers,

trishaw  riders  or hawkers, it  is  necessary  to

provide  transport to bring them  from  the  rural

areas  and to take them around and show  them  the

various  Government institutions and  other  civic

centres.   Since   we  took   over,   we   decided

temporarily  to halt these civic courses  because,

as  I  indicated,  they were  designed  for  quite

different purposes. The courses were not  so  much

instructive as primarily propagandistic in nature.

So  it is the intention of the Government to start

these courses next year along lines which we  hope

will  be  interesting and profitable to those  who

participate  in them. In fact, we do  not  believe

that  the  civic courses should consist in  press-ganging  a  few people and herding them  into  the

offices of Ministers and Assistant Ministers.  The

courses  should  be  of  a wider  scope  with  the

primary  intention of ensuring that people  get  a

clear  idea of what we mean when we say, "This  is

democracy - a  government  of  the  people,  by  the

people" - they   should  have   real   meaning   and

substance.  Such  courses should be  organised  by

people who know how to conduct civic courses,  how

to  organise publicity. Unfortunately,  under  the

previous  Government,  this  task,  I  think  very

unfairly,  was  pushed  on  to  the  shoulders  of

officers  who were not trained to conduct  civics.

With the reorganisation and the setting up of  the

Ministry  of  Culture, we hope  we  can  organise

better and more objective types of civic courses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Culture is worried why I am not interested in  his

genuinely  cultural activities. That is because  I

am  confident  that  all sorts  of  cultures  will

thrive  under his Ministry, except yellow culture,

which he will eliminate. Being so confident in his

ability  to deal with culture in all its  aspects,

we  felt  that  there was no  need  to  raise  the

question  of culture with a capital "K". But  when

the  whole  of his Ministry has been  designed  to

bring culture and propaganda throughout Singapore,

and  when  there are various items under the  sub-heads   set  out  under  his  Ministry   to   take

propaganda  to the people, it seems an  odd  thing

that in the Civics Programmes, meals and transport

should  have  crept in. He spoke  at  length,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, about the previous government. I  am

not  interested  in  what the previous  government

did. I am interested in what his Ministry is going

to  do  in the matter of Civics Programmes in  the

forthcoming  year. And I want to  know  why  these

meals  are  to be provided. He has not  given  any

satisfactory  answer. And what  is  the  need  for

transport? Does he mean to say that the people who

want  to take advantage of these civics programmes

must  be sent for either in taxis or trishaws;  or

should pool transport be sent across to fetch them

to  see  the Pasir Panjang Power Station? Is  that

the idea? I see that if the horse does not want to

go  to  the water, the Minister wants to take  the

water to the horse!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is not a question of trying to

bring  the horse to the water or the water to  the

horse.  It is a simple physical problem of how  to

bring  the  people to Government.  The  Government

organises  and provides transport in  cases  where

school  children, farmers and so on might like  to

visit  Government departments not  as  individuals

but  as groups. It is true that Government invites

people  to  come and visit these places.  In  many

other  countries, groups of people are invited  as

Government  guests  to  come  and  see   how   the

Ministries  function; in our case, we like  people

to know how the Pasir Panjang Power Station is run

and how the Opposition conducts itself during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



debates  in  this  Assembly. So there  is  nothing

sinister  or  unusual in this  sort  of  organised

tours.  In fact, one of the plans that we have  in

mind  is  to organise launch tours for people  who

have  only seen the Island from the land-ward side

and who have never seen it from the sea, which  is

our lifeblood. We want people to see how Singapore

lives  off the sea and how it looks from the  sea.

If  we are bringing large groups of people for the

whole day - because these tours do not last an  hour

or  so, they generally last a whole day - we see  no

reason why we should not provide such amenities as

food  and refreshments, since they are our  guests

and  we are their hosts. I think there is no  harm

in  extending the ordinary courtesies of providing

them  with refreshments and possibly a meal.  That

is  the reason why we have appropriated a not very

exorbitant sum to provide tours for groups  of  25

people with free lunch, tea and transport.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on the last

remark made by the Member for Farrer Park, I would

like to say that the P.A.P., unlike the Member for

Farrer  Park,  is not in the habit of  associating

the people of Singapore with horses. The only time

when  that is done is when on race days we find  a

few  people like the Member for Farrer Park  going

to Bukit Timah.

Hill!  However,  that  is beside  the  point,  Mr

Speaker.  The  idea  of the  Ministry  wishing  to

provide  hospitality and be the hospitable host - in

the same way that the Prime Minister also wants to

provide hospitality to the V.I.P.s - is a good  one,

and  touches my heart. Therefore, Mr Speaker, may

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister please indicate to the House

what type of film production is his Ministry going

in  for?  Is  he  setting up a  film  industry  in

Singapore as an additional attraction to people to

come here?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we are

going  to  make  films.  The  previous  Government

attempted  but failed to make films. In 1956,  the

Government allocated $40,000 for films  but  spent

only  $14,000 of it. In 1957, obviously they  lost

interest  in making films. The sum voted  was  cut

down  to  $25,000 and only $11,000 worth of  films

were made. In 1958, there was a sudden interest in

films when, as you will remember, Sir, there  were

rumours  of impending elections. Strangely enough,

of  the  $30,000 allocated, $27,000 was  spent  on

making  films. I may incidentally state here  that

most of these films never had a long run. They had

a  very  brief  existence and were withdrawn  very

rapidly.  The people lost interest and  the  films

are lying in the archives. I suggested to my Field

Section  whether we should not show some of  these

films  and they said, "No. Generally, one  of  the

purposes of these films used by the Film  Unit  is

to  draw  a  crowd  so that you  can,  apart  from

showing them, put over other things as well!"  And

they also said, "By showing these films, even  the

few curious onlookers who gather around the Public

Information Services' vans generally melt away."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in 1959, which again was a very significant

year, Sir, there was considerable activity in  the

film  industry. Because the money appeared  to  be

insufficient,  $7,500  was transferred  from  some

other  Head  and  another $21,000 was  transferred

under Treasury Warrant No. 178/59. In all, $58,000

was spent within the first six months of last year

when originally the vote was for $30,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government is also interested in

films  but  fortunately we have ideas, unlike  the

previous  Government  which  failed  to  influence

people and win friends primarily because the chief

actors  and  the supporting cast and the  scenario

were  not such as would make a hit or a box-office

draw. Sir, we have made three films within the six

months that we have been in office. I do not  know

whether   the   Members  of  the  Opposition   are

interested in films to the extent of going to  see

them or they are just asking questions but if they

had gone to the theatres during Loyalty Week, they

would  have seen a film entitled Forward With  The

People.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of deference to modesty, I shall quote a

review in the Straits Times of this film. It said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A film produced by the Ministry of Culture,

which is different from previous films designed to

show  the  Government at work, was given  a  Press

preview today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward With The People...is aptly named, for it

brings  the Government before the people and  puts

the   people  very  much  in  picture   with   the

Government."



<br><br>And it goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While past films of this nature had been focused

on  the VIP's who ran the Government, Forward With

The  People  is  filled with  scenes  of  ordinary

citizens - the masses who cheered the Government  at

their  first post-election appearance on the  City

Hall  steps,  with thousands who  changkolled  and

moved  earth, shoulder to shoulder with  Ministers

to   help  build  a  new  promenade  along  Nicoll

Highway,  and  the  mothers  and  babies  at   the

hospital  being  attended to  with  a  minimum  of

waiting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very much a film about how a large part of

Singapore lives, of the problems they have and the

active  roles  they are playing in  helping  solve

these problems."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Minister give the date?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. 2nd December, 1959. So,

Mr Speaker, Sir, we therefore intend to make more

films  because we believe that films are important

media  of  information  and instruction  and  that

democratic institutions can be sustained only by a

well-informed  and  inspired public  opinion.  The

film  is,  therefore,  a  powerful  ally  in  this

respect and that is why we have allocated a sum of

$100,000  for  next year. This  is  a  modest  sum

compared   with  what  the  Federation  Government

spends  on films - it is about a tenth of  what  the

Federation Government spends on films - and  is  not

far  below what the last Government spent  in  the

first  half  of 1959. But unlike our predecessors,

we  intend  to  make full use of the  $100,000  to

ensure  that the people will have an understanding

of  what democracy is, what good government is. If

the  Opposition  Members are interested,  we  have

also  commissioned a film in colour to  cover  the

historic events of Loyalty Week, and when we  have

our  preview  I  shall  take  the  precaution   of

inviting Members of the Opposition to come and see

the film.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, to continue with the speech

made by the Minister for Culture, I would like  to

say  that  the  Field Section of the  Ministry  of

Culture has shown three or four films every  night

in   several  areas  throughout  the  Island.  Mr

Speaker,  I  feel that the amount  provided  under

this  sub-head  is  less than  what  is  required.

However, the Minister for Culture is aware that we

cannot  get all that we want, because we all  know

that  there  is  a shortage of funds  due  to  our

having been bequeathed by the past Government with

an empty coffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The films shown by the Field Section of the

Ministry  of  Culture form a greater part  of  the

films  bought from the Malayan Film Unit and  also

loans   from   other  departments  in   Singapore.

Certainly, Mr Speaker, such films are not of good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



quality from the educational and nationalist point

of  view.  Therefore,  the  Singapore  Government,

particularly the Ministry of Culture,  propose  to

make  more  commentary films or documentary  films

with a Malayan outlook which will be shown to  the

whole population in Singapore.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of the Minister for Culture, the

Ministry  has made several films, and one  of  the

films has been shown lately. The support has  been

tremendous.  If  the Opposition Members  will  see

that  film,  they will be able to  understand  the

aspirations and hopes of the people which the  new

Government helps to co-ordinate and further  bring

the  people  of Singapore to the Government  which

they themselves have elected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder why the

Minister  for Culture is on the defensive.  He  is

defending  himself even before I  have  opened  up

against  him. I do not intend to open  up  against

him  if I can get a satisfactory answer. I am  not

saying that the Government should not go for  this

sort  of thing. What I am asking is a very  simple

question.  Does the Minister intend to  set  up  a

film  producing  unit? I am not saying  he  should

not.  But he has not answered my question yet.  If

he  had  answered me, I would have asked  him  how

many  films  does he intend to produce next  year,

and  if so, the type and nature of those films.  I

have still not got an answer, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, it always pays to be

first  on the defensive - just in case. Now  coming

to  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  who  took  the

precaution of disarming himself before questioning

me, I shall now give a direct answer to his direct

question.  $100,000 is not sufficient  to  set  up

even a fraction of a film unit. In the Federation,

the   capital  outlay  itself,  apart   from   the

recurrent charges, is in the region of $2 million.

But   we   have,   when  we  come  to   discussing

Development Estimates, some ideas about how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



we  should be able to produce our own films.  This

is  purely  for  the  purpose of  producing  films

through  commissioning  local  film  producers  to

produce the kind of films we want. The $100,000 is

not  part of a scheme to set up a film unit.  That

is  money  which  is necessary to  get  commercial

organisations to produce films for us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister

also  tell  the  House how many of such  films  he

hopes to be able to produce out of this allocation

of  $100,000, or has he not yet got any clear  set

ideas on it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, we can produce one

very good film for $100,000 or we can produce  two

good  films at $50,000 each. But normally the kind

of  films which we produce will cost in the region

of  $12,000  to $15,000 for a ten-minute  film.  I

cannot   say  offhand  how  many  films  will   be

produced.  All  I can say is that  we  will  spend

$100,000 on films.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the explanation, Sir, and

in  view of the fact that the Minister himself  at

the moment is not quite clear as to how many films

he  is  going to produce, there will not  be  much

point in my pressing him. May I therefore be given

leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I request the Minister for Culture

straightaway  not  to get on to the  defensive?  I

merely want some information - Promotion of Cultural

Matters,  $80,000. May I know what he  intends  to

promote  with  the $80,000 and how he  intends  to

spend the money?

the  $80,000  to be provided for the promotion  of

culture - how this $80,000 is to be spent.  I  think

he  should  be  able to understand  the  work  our

Ministry  has  done during the  past  few  months.

Perhaps  he is not interested in cultural matters.

Or perhaps he thinks that culture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



means  just  putting on a coat and  tie  and  then

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I have already

really completely out of order, and they must  not

be  raised except on a substantive motion. I  have

allowed passing remarks on personalities, just for

the passing moment. But when it is persisted in so

deliberately as all this, I must call a halt.  The

question is quite simple.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, actually I

would prefer to give a straightforward reply. I do

not understand why the Member for Farrer Park does

not  understand why we want to make  use  of  this

$80,000.  He must understand that in the past  few

months  we  have brought culture and arts  to  the

masses. There have been many "Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat"

shows. Hundreds and thousands of people have  been

given  the  opportunity to see these  shows.  This

$80,000  is  not going to be spent wholly  on  the

people's   shows.   These   people's   shows   are

refreshing.  They are able to promote  and  foster

the arts and culture of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is amazing, Mr Speaker, Sir, how a

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very difficult

to  be in the Opposition. I asked the Minister for

Culture  a simple question. Promotion of culture - $80,000 -  it is a block vote. Surely the  House  is

entitled to know how this is going to be spent? It

is  I  think a fair question and may we expect  an

answer? Can we have an answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Farrer Park is now on the  defensive.

Yes,  the $80,000 is a reduction from the $100,000

which was voted by the previous government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



for  cultural activities. Most of this money  will

be  spent  on  open-air  concerts  which  will  be

stepped  up. Initially we started with  about  one

open-air concert a week. Our intention is to build

enough  small  theatres - apart  from  the  National

Theatre we have in mind - all over the island and be

able  to encourage concerts to be produced locally

in certain areas. We can not only bring troupes or

performers to particular areas, but we also  hope,

as   a  result  of  that,  that  people  will   be

stimulated  enough to set up their own  shows,  of

which  we  have  had  a very good  example  during

National  Loyalty Week. We requested  schools  and

community centres to provide their own shows,  and

something  like 200 concerts were put  up.  During

that  one  week, it was shown that, if  given  the

necessary    encouragement,    stimulation     and

facilities,   people   would   spend   more   time

cultivating culture, if you like, and so  much  of

this money would be spent on open-air concerts and

providing facilities for people who might want  to

put up a show. For example, a school might want to

put  on  a show for our open-air concert and  they

might  say: "We can put up a nice show but  we  do

not  have  enough money to make uniforms".  So  we

might assist them in that direction. That will  be

the  principal  function  of  this  promotion   of

culture.  It  will  also be  spent  on,  we  hope,

sponsorship  of  cultural  programmes,   such   as

courses of lectures over the Radio and so  on.  We

hope  to  organise perhaps an arts  festival  from

time  to  time  and to help disseminate  books  by

providing   little   libraries   all   over    the

place - providing  books and manuscripts  for  them.

The  items  cannot be foreseen in any detail.  But

this  is  the general line of expenditure  of  the

$80,000  provided  for the promotion  of  cultural

matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I thank the Minister, Mr Speaker,

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

merely want to make a suggestion. The Minister for

Culture just now said that they intended to  build

little  theatres in different parts of  Singapore.

May  I  suggest that that project be put  together

with  community  centres  so  that  the  community

centres will benefit by having a theatre? It  will

be  of  more use than if the theatre is built  for

the sake of having a theatre on its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing he mentioned was the giving of

money to schools and associations, or whatever  it

is,  to  make  costumes. Could I  suggest  to  the

Minister  for  Culture that, just as the  Ministry

have  a  department for films, the Ministry should

also have a department for costumes? The making of

costumes is a very costly affair. It is a waste of

money  to  give  the  money away  to  schools  and

associations to make costumes if they do not  have

the  proper facilities for looking after them.  If

the  Ministry  of Culture could have a  department

for   costumes,   it   will   help   schools   and

associations,  for  they will be  able  to  borrow

expensive and well-looked after costumes from  the

Ministry of Culture. That is all I wish to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the

suggestion is sensible and we might even also  set

up  a  sewing class! I thank the hon.  Member  for

Mountbatten  for her suggestion, and I  will  bear

that in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 40 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Ministry of Culture has

also   under  its  wing  the  old  Department   of

Information  and Public Relations,  and  therefore

has close connections with the Press. The Minister

for  Culture  doubtless is aware  that  since  the

elections  a  Saturday weekly paper,  printed  and

published   in   the   Federation,   has    become

increasingly popular in Singapore. The  impression

is going round



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore,  Sir, that because  this  paper  is

printed  and  published in the Federation,  it  is

therefore capable of expressing a more independent

view  than  the  local Press.  Now  that  kind  of

impression is damaging to Singapore, and I believe

the  sooner  we  can clear that up the  better.  I

wonder whether the Minister for Culture can inform

us   whether   any  directive,  instructions,   or

suggestions,  verbal or written,  have  ever  been

conveyed  to  members  of  the  local  Press,   to

editors,  reporters or management, which could  be

regarded  by them as curtailing their  freedom  to

express   any  independent  views  on   Government

affairs. If so, could the House be informed of the

nature   of   the   directive,   suggestions    or

instructions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I have no doubt that

the paper that the Member for Tanglin mentions  is

getting  very popular. Of the 38,000 readers  that

the paper claims, the Member for Tanglin obviously

is   one  of  its  most  enthusiastic  supporters,

because  sometimes  he echoes precisely  the  same

sentiments that find their way into the  pages  of

this particular paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not responsible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Well, he has been espousing its

cause. As far as Singapore is concerned, any paper

is  free  to publish, write and print anything  it

likes  within the framework of the law. Where  the

newspaper exceeds the bounds of fair criticism and

verges  on  sedition, then it must bear  the  full

consequences of the Jaw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not know whether the hon. Member meant to

say  that  the newspapers are under a  threat  and

that the Minister for Culture summons editors from

time  to time, cracks the whip, twists their  arms

and  sends  them  back to the editorial  chair  to

write as he dictates they should write. I am quite

sure,  Sir,  that if - I do not know whether  it  is

permissible - the Member for Tanglin  would  cast  a

quick glance up the gallery, he would see that the

Press  are  quite  happy!  They  are  taking  down

everything  I am saying and I am quite  sure  that

before 10



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



or  11  o'clock  tonight they will not  receive  a

single  telephone call from me.  They  will  write

their report as they think fit, both of what I say

and  what  the Member for Tanglin has  said.  They

will  select those portions which they  think  are

worth  printing  from  both  our  statements   and

publish them. Certainly, it is part of the duty of

my  Ministry to make contacts with the Press. Very

often, as I can quite well remember when I  was  a

newspaperman,  various  politicians  ring  up  the

Press to plead for a particular cause, or ask  the

journalists whether they could either play  up  or

play down an item. In the same way, the Government

is perfectly entitled to lodge a complaint against

any  newspaper, to make a plea to any  journalist,

or  even  commend him for having written something

which has caught the fancy of the Government or an

individual. In that sense - and almost daily I  meet

journalists and editors - I do raise objections if I

feel  that a particular report is not fair or  the

relevant  part of the sentence has been left  out.

To  that  extent I certainly do make my objections

quite  plain to any reporter or newspaper  editor.

Freedom  of speech includes the freedom to express

your views on any matter about the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Tanglin was

trying  to insinuate that there is restriction  on

the freedom of the Press, which was, if I remember

correctly,  one  of the lines  taken  by  him  and

certainly  by  many of his colleagues  before  the

elections,  with the result that one newspaper  in

premature anxiety fled across the causeway, but is

now, I think, not quite sure whether it should not

have  stayed in Singapore in the first  place.  So

the  Member for Tanglin should bring out  specific

instances  instead of just fishing around  in  the

hope  that  I might say something which  could  be

construed as interference with the freedom of  the

Press.  As  far  as  I know, I  have  pleaded  and

intervened with the Press on behalf of Government,

but  I have certainly never gone to the extent  of

intimidating  or threatening the Press  with  dire

consequences,   unless   they   themselves    have

transgressed  the law. I have drawn the  attention

of the Press



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



that  if  they indulge in sedition or  subversion,

then   they  will  certainly  fall  foul  of   the

Government and the law.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

information,  may  I  ask the Member  for  Tanglin

which  Saturday paper he reads? Is  it  the  Week-Ender?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

information of Members on the Government  side,  I

wish  to  say that after my first reading  of  the

Week-Ender,  I decided not to read it after  that,

and  I  instructed my pupils not to  read  such  a

paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad of the assurance given by the

Minister,  and I suggest that it should  be  given

publicity because it is necessary, as Singapore is

now independent, that there should be even greater

freedom  of  the Press than in the Colonial  days.

Therefore I take it that if any newspaper wants to

print and publish a paper in Singapore, it can  be

guaranteed freedom of the Press so long as it does

not infringe the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the assurance given, Sir, I beg leave

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

I  wish to thank both the Minister for Culture and

his Parliamentary Secretary for their information.

Sir,  there are many matters on which I would like

explanations, because the budget for the  Ministry

of  Culture is big. There are two or three matters

which should receive attention; whether they  come

under the purview of the Ministry of Education, it

is up to the Minister for Culture to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to congratulate the Minister

for  Culture,  who  has worked hard  to  create  a

Malayan  culture and a Malayan nation - a matter  on

which  the  Minister and I myself can  compromise,

because  when we eat we use our hands. Of  course,

there are matters which cannot be included here so

that we shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



create  something which will be acceptable to  all

the  people.  I  do  not  wish  to  say  that  the

administration  of Radio Singapore  is  not  going

well.  I can say that the administration has  been

going  on smoothly. But what I am doubtful  of  is

the  question  of  the Malay language  which  will

become the national language in our country. After

each  Assembly sitting, a report is given  in  the

Malay  language. I notice the language as used  by

members  of  the  staff of Radio  Singapore  is  a

little unusual. I hope the Minister concerned will

give  this  his consideration. I do not  say  that

there is anything wrong with the language.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, there are many

programmes for the creation of culture,  which  is

our  objective. I am not quite sure whether it  is

the  policy of the Ministry of Culture that we  do

not  like anything Western, and therefore  at  the

moment  we wish to create a culture free from  any

foreign  influence whatsoever. I hope,  therefore,

that  if  it is so, the Minister for Culture  will

clarify where it is to be found in his programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the subject of creating a Malayan

culture,  especially  on  the  subject  of  `Malay

language', `History of Singapore' and so  on  over

Radio  Singapore, is there any plan to explain  to

listeners  what  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has

explained  clearly,  that his  Ministry  does  not

agree  wih the Communist policy? If there  is  any

programme about the Government attitude being anti-Communist, I hope this will be explained fully  in

the  broadcasts  of  the Malay  section  of  Radio

Singapore.  We  are really longing for  a  culture

that is truly Malayan.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, my

apologies  first of all to the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan because I am unable to follow the  trend

of  what is intended by him. But, inter alia,  the

Member  said that he felt concerned, or  something

like  that,  because on the subject of culture  he

said the vote allocated was too much. The vote for

the Ministry of Culture was not too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



high. Secondly, he is prepared to compromise  with

the  Minister  for  Culture  on  the  question  of

creating   a  culture  with  a  Malayan   outlook.

Further,  he said he was most concerned  with  the

Malay  language, as used when the news  items  are

read over Radio Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I wish to tell him that the vote

provided  in  this  budget  for  the  Ministry  of

Culture,  as I said earlier on, is not sufficient.

With  this limited provision we cannot fulfil  our

programme 100 per cent for the people, in order to

develop  and  promote culture  as  we  would  have

liked.  But we must be thankful because the P.A.P.

aims  to  restore culture which has  been  extinct

over  140  years of Colonial rule and to create  a

new  culture  which will be Malayan  in  form  and

outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, concerning the news items mentioned by the Member for Kampong Kembangan, I am quite

sure  that  Radio  Singapore  reporters  and  news

editors - including   Malay,  Tamil,   English   and

Chinese - compile   the   news   which    is    then

disseminated and the translation is  done  by  the

announcers themselves who read the news  items.  I

feel  the language spoken in the Malay Section  is

Malay  language. Here, I wish to ask other Members

of  the  Opposition, or the Member who spoke  just

now,  whether  he  understood  what  is  the  real

meaning  of  culture? Why is it necessary  that  a

common culture should be created in the view of  a

country which is heading for progress? What is the

result if the culture is not nurtured with healthy

elements? I think, Mr Speaker, some of  them  did

not know the answers to these questions. Why I say

they do not understand is because it did not occur

to  the past Government at all that culture was  a

vital  element  for the people  in  a  progressive

country.  If  culture is allowed  to  deteriorate,

thus  making  it possible for damaging  influences

such  as  `yellow' dances and rock-n-roll to  gain

full sway, then the result is that the moral well-being of the people will suffer. If our moral well-being   is  damaged,  then  peace  will  also   be

disturbed,  which  will result eventually  in  the

Government being weakened and lead consequently to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



Ministers  and  Members of the  Assembly  becoming

robbers and gangsters. It is the aim of the P.A.P.

to avoid the incidents which I mentioned just now.

Therefore this Government is determined to set  up

a  Ministry  of  Culture whose aim is  to  restore

original  cultural  values and  a  more  important

factor  is  to  unite the peoples of  this  multi-racial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other programmes for the Ministry

of  Culture, but these will take time to implement

because  of  limited votes and an  empty  treasury

which was bequeathed to us by the past Government.

One  of  our  programmes is to unite  the  various

communities by the creation of a language. I  need

not  dwell  further on the ways and  means  to  be

implemented.  I think it will be better  if  these

details  are given by the Minister himself.  Also,

Mr Speaker, during the six months that the P.A.P.

has   come   into   power,  we  have   made   many

improvements as far as culture is concerned  which

has  been  neglected by the past  Government.  For

instance,  we  have inaugurated  the  Aneka  Ragam

Ra'ayat  in  an effort to try to unite the  people

through  the radio and other media. I  think  this

will  satisfactorily answer the queries  asked  by

the Member for Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Radio Singapore, I am sure the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan  is  not  following

closely  its broadcasts. However, I would like  to

say  for  the  benefit of the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  that  the  Chinese  Section  of   Radio

Singapore has started a special programme on Malay

lessons,  on  Malayan culture, on  definitions  in

Malay,  and  I  have personally listened  to  this

programme. Similarly, in the Tamil section,  there

is  a  special programme set aside for  the  items

which  I  mentioned just now, with the  object  of

establishing a Malayan nation. I hope I have  been

able  to  give some explanation to the Member  for

Kampong Kembangan and that he now understands  the

steps that we have taken in that direction and the

means at our disposal.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to emphasise to the Member  for

Anson that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



I  did  not say that I did not agree to the  Malay

Section programmes of Radio Singapore. What I said

in  this  House  regarding  the  news  from  Radio

Singapore  in  Malay  concerns  sittings  of   the

Legislative Assembly. That is what I was directing

my  query  to. It seems that the Member for  Anson

went  beating about the bush and went astray  from

Tanjong Pagar to Changi! I say here that I did not

wish  to  make  a hue and cry about this.  He  has

accused me of not having listened to the radio.  I

have one radio and I cannot tune to all programmes

at  once.  So  I  cannot listen to  all  the  four

languages  at one time. I am sure the  Member  for

Anson has got many radios, so he can listen to all

the  sections at the same time. I hope what I have

expressed just now on the news of the sittings  of

the  Assembly is understood. That does not  matter

to  me. But what I expect is a true report of  the

Legislative Assembly proceedings broadcast in  the

Malay programmes. It is hoped that my constituents

in  Kampong  Kembangan are not given to understand

that  Opposition  Members  are  attacked  by   the

Members  of the Government to such an extent  that

we  are  unable to reply. It is hoped that a  true

account of what is actually happening can be given

in  the broadcast of reports of proceedings in the

Legislative Assembly. I am afraid that  distortion

of  facts  has taken place. This will be confusing

and  misleading.  So  if we  return  home  at  ten

o'clock  and  hear  from the radio  an  inaccurate

report  about our being attacked in the  Assembly,

the next day when we come back to this House I  am

sure  our faces will be red. Members of the public

listen  in  to  the wireless and I hope  that  the

Government will bear this in mind.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also said that Government

has no money. I am not suggesting that the present

Government  can  find ways and  means  of  raising

money.  I  have  not yet received confirmation  of

Government's  big programmes. I do not  know  what

the  Government  has  in mind about  creating  one

culture. We have no liking for yellow culture, and

therefore we kill it. But what are the programmes,

what must be done towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



achieving  a culture which we wish to  create,  so

that it will be acceptable? Today, I have not  yet

received a reply to such questions. Members of the

Opposition will co-operate with the Government  if

programmes are carried out to put into effect what

the  Deputy  Prime Minister has explained  in  the

House  concerning  the  anti-Communist  policy  in

order  to  help the Federation of Malaya.  If  the

Government  has any such programmes, I hope  these

programmes  will be announced over the  radio.  To

create  a culture which will be acceptable to  all

would   need  support;  and  if  we  are  invited,

particularly U.M.N.O., to give our support to such

a policy, we will co-operate. We know that this is

the  policy  of  the Government  and  it  has,  on

several  occasions, been explained in this  House.

That  is what I tried to bring home to the  Member

for  Anson who alleged that I have never tuned  in

to   Radio  Singapore  broadcasts  in  all   other

languages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Tan Kia Gan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the National Loyalty  Week  lasting

between 3rd December, 1959 and 9th December,  1959

has   ended  triumphantly.  It  was  a  grand  and

glorious  celebration, and a great  movement  that

marks a new era culturally and politically in  the

history of the State of Singapore. It was an event

of which the people of Singapore could be proud.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the cheers of the National Week have

died  down, what remains to be done is  the  heavy

cumbersome  task  of nation building;  work  which

calls  for  patient  and zealous  dealing  by  all

Members of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the Colonial rule in the past 140 years,

most  of  the  people have lost their self-respect

and, through Colonial education, the people lack a

proper understanding of their country. We are  now

having  self-rule. First and foremost, we have  to

instil  a  national  feeling and  a  love  of  the

country  into the people to enable them to realise

the importance of active participation in national

construction work. The P.A.P. Government has,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



in  the  past  six  months,  put  the  anti-yellow

movement  into practice, made Malay  its  national

language, introduced an overall improvement in the

Educational   policy,   and  established   special

training  courses  for civil servants.  All  these

steps  have been taken with a view to freeing  our

people from Colonial ways and thoughts, and with a

hope that we will produce thousands upon thousands

of  right-thinking political workers to serve  the

country. This thought struggle is a long-term one.

It  requires our continued efforts to achieve  the

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Members from the Opposition will

support   the   Ministry  of   Culture   and   its

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, the P.A.P. Government has full confidence

in  constructing a bright future for the State. We

fervently  hope that all the people  of  Singapore

will  fully  co-operate  and  march  forward.   We

further  hope that all the fellow Members of  this

House,  irrespective  of party  affiliation,  will

with  one  accord  shoulder this  mission  of  the

epoch.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

can  only elaborate on what has been said  by  the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan  on  the  aims  and

objectives of the Government to create one culture

for  Singapore. The Member for Anson said that the

Opposition Members have no culture or do not  know

about culture. So, perhaps, such a remark is meant

to  indicate  that only the individual  who  talks

about  culture is able to understand it.  When  we

talk  about  culture, it is  not  meant  only  for

people  who  are up to date with ideas.  Even  the

aborigines have their own culture. I would like to

say that we from U.M.N.O., as an organisation, are

anti-Communist.  As far as we  are  concerned,  we

will  not hesitate to say, in all frankness,  that

our  stand  is anti-Communist. Therefore,  towards

the  creation  of  a  common culture,  it  is  our

responsibility to know and understand exactly what

is the kind of culture that we are going to create

in  the  future. I do not wish to talk  about  the

dangers  of  a  Communist  form  of  culture.  The

reasons why we oppose Communism is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



because  their  tactics and  ideology  have  scant

regard  for  humanitarian feelings and principles.

One of the most extraordinary things why we cannot

accept  it is that the Communist ideology  has  no

consideration for self-respect for those  who  are

against  them. This is all I wish to add  to  what

has  been  mentioned  by the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  on  the  subject commented  on  by  the

Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Ministry  of Culture was created after the  P.A.P.

took  office.  In  my opinion to  talk  about  the

people's  culture in Singapore or good culture  is

very  difficult.  Why is there  no  such  culture?

Because  during  the past 100  years  of  Colonial

rule, there was no good culture for Singapore. The

culture was colonial culture and communal culture.

You  can see for yourself, Mr Speaker, that after

the  P.A.P. took office we have had to try to turn

this  bad culture into good culture. That is  very

difficult. In Singapore it is desirable to have  a

good  culture.  In  our  Five-Year  Plan  we  have

clearly  shown  to  the  people,  especially   the

Opposition,  that  what  we  want  is  a  people's

culture and a non-communal culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we cannot say the expenditure on the Ministry of Culture is either too much or too

little.  We  do not know. The Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  says that it is too much. There  is  no

foundation for this statement because, during this

transitional period, we do not know what  we  want

to expand, especially on educating the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the Communist ideology

or culture. Our Prime Minister has said many times

that  the  P.A.P. is a non-Communist,  democratic,

socialist Government. Since we are a non-Communist

Government  we  do not foster Communist  ideas  or

culture,  because we have already told the  people

that  we do not want a Communist culture. When  we

say non-Communist, it does not mean that we cannot

import  Communist books. We mean that we will  not

have Communist propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel

it  is  my  responsibility to answer  the  queries

raised by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Kampong Kembangan and also  the  views

expressed by the Member for the Southern  Islands.

Firstly,  I  would say that among  the  Opposition

Members - not  all of them - certain Members  have  no

culture.  What  is the meaning  and  what  is  the

proof,  Mr Speaker? Culture has been ignored  for

100 years.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Minister for Culture elected by the

people.  This is clear to the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan and the Member for the Southern Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point: our culture has been corrupted by

Western  influences, one of which is the  rock  `n

roll. We aim to improve and develop and foster one

common culture. Let me tell the Member for Kampong

Kembangan and the Member for the Southern  Islands

that  what we wish to create is a Malayan culture.

But the basis for a Malayan culture has yet to  be

gone into thoroughly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the question of a Communist culture,

communist this and communist that. This  does  not

arise whatsoever. We should not be carried away by

emotion  and sentiments. The question of Communism

has  been  explained by my colleague and now  does

not arise at all. I have heard just now the Member

for  Kampong Kembangan say that the news broadcast

is  different from the summary of reports  on  the

proceedings of the Legislative Assembly. I say the

news and the summary of reports on the proceedings

actually cover what happens here from 2.30 p.m. to

8  p.m.  That is all, Mr Speaker, and I hope  the

allegations levelled at me are not true.  I  would

say  again  here, not all, but certain Members  of

the Opposition have no culture.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether the Member

for  Anson said that Members of the Opposition had

no culture! I do not suppose that was really meant

in that sense.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it was not my intention

originally  to  have  a say in  this  matter,  but

because  so  many cultural experts in  this  House

have spoken, I am forced to say something in spite

of the fact that I am not an expert on culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was born into this world, it was only

today   that   I  heard  things  like   `Communist

culture'; probably in future there will be Liberal-Socialist  culture,  Islamic  culture  and   other

cultures   according  to  the  various   political

ideologies  of the Parties. As far as I  know,  in

Malaya      there      are     many      political

ideologies - socialism, Islamism, democracy and many

others. If each of these political Parties has its

own culture, it means that in Singapore and Malaya

there  will be many cultures. But in fact  I  know

that  culture  is the property of  the  nation - one

nation  with  one  culture; it  is  not  based  on

political  ideologies. Communism  is  a  political

ideology,  not a culture. Islamism is a  political

ideology,  not a culture. This has been  expressed

by cultural experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would like to explain the meaning

of  culture.  Perhaps the Opposition Members  will

know what is meant by culture. Culture, as defined

by  the  Indonesian Cultural Congress in 1952,  is

the  result of a struggle fought for by  a  nation

and  practised  every day. If this  definition  is

acceptable,  then automatically  in  Malaya  today

Malaya  is  practising  a  culture  that  we  call

Malayan.  From the way the Opposition Members  and

Government Members are dressed, perhaps we can say

that  we  already have a Malayan cultural outlook.

They  put  on  trousers and  coats  which  are  of

Western  origin  and songkok  which  is  Malay  in

origin. Thus, as a result of assimilation, we have

a dress which is Malayan in outlook. If we enter a

house  from  the front, we may find  furniture  of

western  style  and origin, and we may  be  served

with  `Tauhu'  of  Chinese origin  or  curry  from

India.  We  are  right  at the  moment  practising

Malayan culture in our daily life, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



Speaker. There are many who have talked on culture

today.  I am not an authority on culture.  Mention

was  made  just now about `Communist culture'  and

later  probably about `Liberal-Socialist culture.'

It  is possible that next time if another Party is

in  power, there will be a new `culture' emerging.

This  is wrong, I think. Let me emphasise  to  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan who said that we  are

against  `Western  culture'; we  are  not  against

`Western  culture'.  What we are  opposed  to,  is

`Yellow culture'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the summary of the reports of the

proceedings of the Legislative Assembly over Radio

Singapore,  I  think  this  is  a  bit  difficult.

Indirectly, the Opposition Members have accused it

to  be  something  near  to distortion  of  facts.

Indirectly  they say that only the Opposition  has

been  attacked. If it is true and if such a  state

of affairs exists here in the Assembly, then after

this sitting, if there is a commentary or a report

on  it  to the effect that the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  is attacked constantly, is  the  Member

for  Kampong Kembangan going to move a  resolution

in   the  Assembly,  condemning  the  Ministry  of

Culture  for the report, and so on and  so  forth?

Then  another  request that arises  is  for  Radio

Singapore to widen the scope of its work so that a

special  programme  of broadcasts  that  is  anti-Communist  in nature is put on, just  because  the

Deputy  Chairman of the P.A.P. has  announced  its

anti-Communist  policy. If the  Member  wishes  to

study  the policy of the P.A.P., I recommend  that

he reads the booklet issued by the P.A.P. entitled

the  "Five-Year Plan". The P.A.P. is  a  political

Party  based on social democracy; it is  not  pro-Communist  but  is  non-Communist.  That  is   our

policy,  we  do not need to expound  it  over  the

radio.  What we have always emphasised is that  we

are  opposed  to  undesirable  elements,  but  our

definition  of  undesirable  elements   does   not

concern  such elements from one bloc only.  It  is

irrespective of Where they come from - East or West.

So long as such subversive elements are considered

to  be `anti' this Government, then we are opposed

to  them.  But we want all the people of Singapore

to  strive for the interests of this country. This

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



our  stand  as  regards  undesirable  elements  or

subversives. If hon. Members of the Opposition say

that U.M.N.O. is prepared to study our theories, I

think  it is not necessary that it should be  over

Radio Singapore. I can suggest to them a course on

the  policy  of the P.A.P. merely by  reading  the

"Five-Year Plan", a souvenir booklet of the P.A.P.

I  remember that previously at a sitting  of  this

Assembly, this booklet was produced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, back to the question of culture; we

are heading for and are practising Malayan culture

right  at the moment. Ideal or otherwise, we  are,

nevertheless, at the moment practising  a  Malayan

form of culture whether from the point of view  of

dress,  food or way of living. Therefore,  I  hope

that  from my brief resume, the Opposition Members

will  understand that we are in  the  midst  of  a

Malayan  culture  and, indeed,  are  practising  a

Malayan culture.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish

to  bring  home to the Member who has just  spoken

that  U.M.N.O. has its own policy in its struggle.

We  will not toe the policy of any other political

Party.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we are embarking on

a debate on political policies. That is completely

remote from culture, I should imagine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

am  especially  happy today that,  after  so  many

months  of  effort  exerted  by  the  Ministry  of

Culture  and  seeing the good  response  from  the

people,   the  Members  of  the  Opposition   feel

interested  in  culture. I remember  the  previous

Government  in its 1958 Budget made  provision  of

$100,000 for the promotion of cultural activities.

But  that  was all in words and was not  put  into

practice.  They did nothing. They  did  not  spend

even  a  single  cent.  This  is  proof  that  the

previous  Government  had  no  concern   for   the

promotion of culture of the various races. In  the

Budget  they planned to engage cultural  officers,

but  there  were  no cultural officers  whatsoever

until a leakage of examination papers in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of  Education caused an  officer  to  be

transferred  to  be a temporary Cultural  Officer.

This $100,000 was put into the Treasury up to  the

time   the  P.A.P. took  office.  The  Government

transferred  a  portion  of  the  sum  to  promote

cultural matters.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the previous Government not concern

itself with culture? They were concerned only with

the  $250,000  over  the  Victoria  Memorial  Hall

Theatre.  Therefore,  if you  want  to  understand

culture, you must, according to the definition, go

to  the Victoria Memorial Hall Theatre. Those  who

are unable to understand healthy culture are those

living  in the tower ivory. Another point is  that

they   followed   the  policy  of   the   colonial

government,   that   is   they   followed   yellow

culture - unhealthy culture to intoxicate our  young

people,  to make them forget their duty of nation-building.  All day long they encouraged the  young

people  to  dance rock `n roll. We have  seen  all

this ourselves. Furthermore they did not encourage

the  promotion  of  healthy culture.  Under  these

circumstances, the people of the upper class  were

living  in  the  tower ivory.  When  there  was  a

performance in the Victoria Memorial Hall Theatre,

they rushed to see it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the P.A.P. Government took office, our

first  task has been to introduce healthy  culture

to  the masses of the people. The first purpose of

our  open-air  concerts is  to  introduce  healthy

culture  to  the masses of the people.  Under  140

years of colonial rule, we can ask ourselves,  was

there  any  opportunity to foster the cultures  of

all races? Was there any secondary Malay school in

Singapore?  Was  there a music  teacher  in  Malay

schools?  Is  that  not  proof  to  destroy  Malay

culture? Since the P.A.P. Government took  office,

we  introduce the cultures of the various races in

our open-air concerts and in the midst of them  we

encourage the Chinese to appreciate Malay culture,

and  the  Malays to appreciate Chinese culture  or

Indian Culture. This is our first step. After  the

people  understand  one  another,  we  will   then

integrate all the good points of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



the  various cultures into a Malayan culture.  You

can  see for yourselves that during Loyalty  Week,

the  Chung  Cheng High School put up a performance

entitled "Unity". This is an example. In the  past

we never saw a Peking Opera. The first time that a

Peking  Opera  has been "malayanised"  was  during

Loyalty Week. This is only the beginning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first step, we must, first of all,

understand one another. The next step is  that  we

will  discuss  through  mutual  studies  and  then

create a Malayan culture. In the meantime, I  want

to  thank the cultural institutions, including the

Malay cultural institutions and the Tamil cultural

institutions for offering their co-operation  with

the  Government.  This is the first  time  in  the

history  of  Singapore that they meet one  another

and  study  from one another to promote a  Malayan

culture.  This is a good beginning. We  hope  that

next  year those people with artistic talents will

work  harder  with a new spirit, to  be  loyal  to

Singapore,  so as to create a Malayan culture.  In

the  past, circumstances did not allow such things

to   happen,  because  mutual  study  and   mutual

understanding of the various races was detrimental

to   the  policies  of  the  past  Government.  To

stimulate and to cultivate the ideal of  a  nation

was to destroy the colonial rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government do not require $2.5 million

to  build a Victoria Memorial Hall Theatre because

we  have confidence in the people. The people have

responded   well   to   our   open-air   concerts.

Therefore, we dare to encourage the people to make

contributions  to  the National  Theatre.  Through

this  theatre  we  can build  a  culture  full  of

Malayan  ideas.  The promotion of culture  is  not

confined to a small portion of the people.  It  is

directed to the masses. Therefore, we request  the

Members  of  the  Opposition, if they  really  are

interested  in culture, to give up their  communal

ideas  and co-operate with us to create  a  bright

Malayan culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I congratulate the Minister  for

Culture, with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



capital  "C"  and  not  a  capital  "K",  as   was

suggested by the Member for Farrer Park,  for  the

unexpectedly   lengthy,  but   at   times   lively

discussion  which has taken place as a  result  of

the  debate  on  the  policy of  the  Ministry  of

Culture?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess that when we had to settle the

nomenclature  of the various Ministries  which  we

were  setting  up,  the  natural  English-educated

reluctance to accept the idea of culture as  other

than   that   which  is  abnormal,   the   natural

reluctance  to  talk  of  a  Ministry  of  Culture

because  of its association with ideas and  ideals

which are supposed to be intolerant and illiberal,

conflicted  with  the  basic  realities   of   our

position.  What was significant in this debate,  I

think,   is  that  the  whole  approach   of   the

Opposition is quite clearly different in that  the

English-educated middle class wing, as represented

by  the Member for Farrer Park, was quite distinct

from  the Malay-educated wing represented  by  the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan and the Member  for

the Southern Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did right in facing the issue and calling a

spade  a  spade. In the long run,  if  we  are  to

survive,  we  must find some basis of the  highest

common  denominator amongst all our races and  all

our linguistic and cultural groups. If we fail  to

do  that,  then  whenever we talk  about  national

unity,  we  are  in fact talking  about  temporary

compromises  and temporary balances of  power.  It

would  be  foolish for us in Singapore to  pretend

that  the  difference  in  cultural  vitality  and

cultural  patterns of conduct is not  a  political

force.  It would be stupid for us not to recognise

that language and culture is a stronger force that

motivates   human   beings   than   political   or

ideological ideals. That being so, it helps if  we

openly  bring  these issues to the  forefront,  so

that   people   can  get  away  from  hypocritical

attitudes  which existed at a time  when  cultural

and linguistic urges were muted as a result of the

ruling  hierarchy being the colonial  power  which

nurtured  an English-educated middle class  to  be

its assistants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the whole of South-East Asia, we have

seen what has happened when the colonial power  is

removed  from  the  arena.  India  was  completely

united against the British. You remove the British

and  you get the Dravidian Movement. You have  all

other  kinds  of  separatist  movements  based  on

language  and  culture,  because  these  two   are

inextricably  bound. And throughout the  whole  of

South-East  Asia,  ranging from  Ceylon - where  the

Member for Farrer Park's ancestors came - to Malaya,

Indonesia,  Thailand,  the  Philippines,   Saigon,

Vietnam,  we  see manifestations of  what  happens

when  races  moving at different cultural  momenta

have  to co-exist in one economic society.  If  we

only  thought of Singapore alone, then  I  say  we

could  well  afford it. If we only  calculated  in

terms  of  the  immediate future,  we  could  well

afford  to  ignore the explosive forces which  are

around us and within us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to pay a tribute to the Minister for

Culture for the enthusiasm with which he has  gone

into   his   job   of  building   up   a   Malayan

consciousness, and his belief that it is possible,

desirable and attainable. That faith has sustained

him where lesser souls might well have flagged  in

their  enthusiasm. It is pressure-cooking. We  are

the first to admit it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also the first to say that pressure-cooking, if we had other alternatives, would

probably not be the best way of doing it. But  the

plain  fact  of the matter is that  there  are  no

other  alternatives. If we do not do it and  begin

to  produce  the  first results in  the  immediate

future,  then I say that the forces that  are  let

loose and are already around us will overtake us.
