the   Malayan  Exchange  Banks  Association   that

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allotted for Head 26 be

reduced  by  $100,000  in respect  of  subhead  3,

Family Planning Association, appearing on page 144

<br><br>10.06 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Chairman,  I  think at the outset I ought  to  say

that   I   appreciate  your  timely   halting   of

yesterday's  debate at the moment of interruption,

when emotions and feelings were running high owing

to  taunts  being hurled at me as I was addressing

the Committee on what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>

is to me a serious subject. If in a moment of heat

I  said anything unseemly, I wish to apologise  to

hon.  Members  and particularly to my  ministerial

colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the adjournment yesterday, Mr Chairman, I was

explaining to hon. Members that I had been  trying

as  much  as  possible  to reduce  expenditure  on

medical buildings without lowering standards,  and

I  said  that  construction of  the  new  Training

School, the Nurses Hostel and several clinics  and

outdoor  dispensaries, which the former Government

had  estimated  to be built at $80,000  each,  had

cost  $50,000  each, a saving of $30,000  each.  I

have nothing more to add to what I said yesterday,

Mr  Chairman, except this: that with the  sum  of

$100,000,  the Government can build two more  such

clinics  or outdoor dispensaries in such parts  of

the  island as may need them, and they would  give

much  better service to the country than does  the

Family  Planning Association which, in my opinion,

should be a voluntary organisation and should  not

be subsidised by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to draw hon. Members'

attention  to Head 26, page 145, and see  some  of

the   other  charitable  grants  which  have  been

provided for in the Budget:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After-Care Association - only $10,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Sisters of the Poor (a most deserving

cause) - only $4,800.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School for the Deaf (another very deserving

cause) - only $6,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Youth Council - only $15,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see all these grants increased

rather  than to see $100,000 voted for the  Family

Planning Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned home last night, I received this

so-called interesting pamphlet which was  sent  to

me   by   the  members  of  the  Family   Planning

Association and which was alluded to by the member

for Tanglin yesterday.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



In  the  Encyclical of Pope Pius XI  on  Christian

Marriage His Holiness declared:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in

such a way that the act is deliberately frustrated

in  its  natural  power to  generate  life  is  an

offence against the law of God and of nature,  and

those  who  indulge in such are branded  with  the

guilt of a grave sin."



<br><br>If  hon.  Members are interested and wish to  read

the Encyclical of His Holiness I shall supply them

with a copy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this comment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As regard the evil use of matrimony - to pass over

the   arguments   which  are   shameful   ones - not

infrequently - others that are false and exaggerated

are  put  forward.  Holy Mother Church  very  well

understands  and clearly appreciates all  that  is

said  regarding the health of the mother  and  the

danger  to  her life; and who would not grieve  to

think of these things?".



<br><br>In  the discourse to midwives it was accepted that

in  very serious cases of ill-health or where  the

mother's life is in danger, the use of the "safety

period" is permissible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman and hon. Members, I have nothing

further to add to what I have said except to  urge

you,  with  all  the force at my command,  not  to

agree  that this colossal sum of $100,000 be given

to   this  Association  when  that  money  can  be

utilised for very much more useful purposes.

<br><br>10.11 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in view of the

number of Members who wish to speak on other items

under  this Head, I think it is important that  we

should  exercise  not  birth  control  but  speech

control, and I shall therefore make mine as  short

as I can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two points to which I wish to

refer.  The first is a practical point of national

implication  in this amendment. The  Minister  for

Health has conceded that the information given  by

the  Family  Planning Association can properly  be

given  in Government clinics where it is required,

and  it  seems clear to me that if we deprive  the

Association  of financial support, it will  either

have  to reduce its work very considerably or will

have to wind itself up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



There  will then be an increased burden thrown  on

to  the public revenue by people having to  go  to

the  Government clinics for advice there,  and  we

shall  merely  be transferring the load  from  the

Charitable  Allowances  and  Grants  Head  to  the

Ministry of Health Head. I have no doubt  that  in

the  transfer  the amount of money  involved  will

very  considerably increase, because you will have

removed  the  voluntary unpaid  element  which  at

present  is  very considerable. The  final  effect

will be a much heavier burden on the funds of  the

country.  Incidentally, that, of course,  disposes

also of the argument that Catholics should not  be

forced  to  contribute  to family  planning  work,

because  the  government funds  are  derived  from

Catholics  as  well  as from others,  and  if  the

Ministry  of  Health  is going  to  provide  these

services,  then  the  Catholics  must   still   be

contributing  in so far as they are good  citizens

and pay their income tax and other taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other argument put up which I feel

deserves  a moment of time. It was suggested  that

if  the Family Planning Association continued  its

work, we should suffer from a lack of manpower for

our    Singapore    Battalion   and    pan-Malayan

development  work.  This is a very  long-term  view

indeed. During the immediate future, all you would

get  would be an increase in baby-power, and I  do

not think baby-power is very significant either in

soldiering  or in working. If you take the  period

from the time of conception to the time the living

soul  becomes  effective  from  a  working  or   a

soldiering point of view, say, 18 years, and  stop

family  planning, it could not possibly  have  any

significant  effect  until about  1975,  which  is

indeed a long-term view. By 1975 some 400,000 boys

and  girls now already alive, and many of them  in

school,  will  have been added  to  the  effective

labour  force.  I do not think we  need  fear  any

absence of manpower in those circumstances. It  is

a  most ill-conceived argument based, I am afraid,

on  a  complete failure to distinguish between  an

infant in arms and a worker at his lathe.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, I think we

should all look on this subject of family planning

from  an objective viewpoint and we should not  be

influenced  by our beliefs or outside forces.  The

only consideration that we should put before us is

whether  this expenditure of $100,000 will benefit

Singapore or whether it will do us no good at all.

To  my  mind, we have the examples of China, India

and  Japan  whose governments have adopted  family

planning and they do so not because they  want  it

but   because  of  necessity,  because  of   over-population  and  the  impossibility  to  food  and

clothe  all  the  children  being  born  in  those

territories. These countries will not adopt family

planning unless it is vitally necessary and we  in

Singapore  are coming to that stage. We  have  now

over  20,000  people unemployed and their  numbers

are increasing, and this has been confirmed by the

Minister  for  Commerce and Industry.  On  top  of

that,  we  have those people who are  now  leaving

school  and  trying to find employment  and  their

numbers  will  be  increased.  I  can  assure  the

Members  of  this  House  that  the  question   of

unemployment is very serious. There can be no more

rubber  packing  in Singapore because  it  is  not

economical to pack here due to the rise in  wages,

and you have over a thousand people unemployed  on

that   account  alone.  In  my  opinion,   if   an

expenditure  of $100,000 can save  a  thousand  or

even  a  few hundred people from the embarrassment

and  worry of having to meet confinement  expenses

and  the  support of a new mouth in the family,  I

think  the money is well spent. If we can  save  a

few  hundred women from the worry of an  unplanned

confinement  and going through the  sufferings  of

ill-health  and having to visit quack  doctors  in

order  to obtain abortion, which may injure  their

health  and  possibly cause their death,  then  we

shall have spent this money well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask Members of this House to view

this  expenditure of $100,000 objectively, and  if

we  are  not influenced by our beliefs and outside

forces, our common sense will tell us that  it  is

money worth spending.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr

Chairman,   Sir,  I  also  will  exercise   speech

control.  I would just like to touch on one  angle

of  this  debate. Last year several people outside

the  Assembly accused us of treating this  subject

with the utmost levity. Some of the remarks passed

in   this  Committee  may  have  bordered  on  the

salacious, but much of what was said was said with

conviction and sincerity. In any case, what is  so

terrible  about  having a dig or  a  jest  at  the

expense  of family planning? The birth of a  human

being  may  be the greatest of all mysteries,  but

there is no mystery about contraception, or should

not  be!  One  member said he was  surprised  that

there  should  be  joking  about  such  a  serious

subject. That seems to me to be bordering  on  the

sanctimonious. We have had laughter in this House,

Sir,  on  many  occasions  and  sometimes  it  has

relieved  tension. At times it has taken place  in

discussions far more serious than this one. My own

view  is  that I refuse to regard the  subject  of

family plan, fling as holy ground. I believe  that

the  Family  Planning Association  consists  of  a

group  of  people  who are absolutely  sincere  in

their    convictions   and   are   of   impeccable

reputation. I think the work they are doing, which

is   largely  voluntary,  is  in  the  very   best

tradition  of voluntary workers in that  they  are

devoting their time to the relief of sufferers and

to  the  poor. As such, I think they are deserving

of government assistance. That I believe, Sir, and

I  have  heard no argument so far which will  ever

shake that belief.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Chairman, Sir, someone has said that speech,  like

pregnancy,  is  easy  to  conceive  but  hard   to

deliver.   That  is  why  there  have  been   some

unplanned   speeches   and   certain   ill-advised

deliveries!   Sir,  last  year  the  subject   was

thoroughly debated and this year I find that  most

of  the speakers who took part in the debate  last

year   find   it   unnecessary   to   repeat   the

performance. But I do see, Sir, that the  Minister

for Health still maintains that planned parenthood

is  unhealthy. I am very happy, too, to  see  that

the  Minister for Communications and Works,  while

not maintaining that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>

there should be more communications and less work,

still makes out a case for planned parenthood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have asked for the figures since 1950 of

the  amounts  of  contribution or grants  to  this

Association. It began in 1950 with $5,000  and  it

kept  on mounting up - 1951, $10,000; 1952, $20,000; 1953, $30,000; 1954, $45,000; 1955, $60,000; 1956, $85,000; and next year, $100,000. Every year  when

this vote was being debated in the Assembly, there

had  been  opposition. It would appear, Sir,  that

opposition  to  the  Family  Planning  Association

makes it more thriving and makes it more worthy of

support. We are proposing to increase the grant by

$15,000  in 1957, and in 1958, with the record  of

service  that they have rendered to the people  of

Singapore,  I  should  not  be  surprised  if  the

$100,000 is exceeded. Sir, the F.P.A. is rendering

a  service  which  my Ministry,  the  Ministry  of

Labour  and  Welfare, while looking  after  labour

still  has  to  look after its welfare,  maintains

that it is a sum worth spending.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, yesterday I

said  that this was an unfortunate and unnecessary

amendment. I hope the voting on it will  prove  it

unnecessary, and I think it has been amply  proved

that  the debate has been unfortunate. The subject

seems  to  exacerbate  feelings  deeply  held  and

produces  an  emotional  incapacity  for   logical

thought   and   an  excitement  as  indicated   in

yesterday's  wild attack on me personally  by  the

Minister for Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the lack of logic in the approach, I

would  draw  your  attention to the  Minister  for

Health's  statement  made  proudly  that   he   is

building  several maternity clinics and hospitals,

and  in those maternity clinics and hospitals  for

which  we obtain money from the public by  tax  in

order  to support them, family planning advice  is

given.  Sir,  if  this Government  can  use  money

obtained  by  tax for the support of  clinics  and

hospitals  which,  as  part of  their  work,  give

advice  on  family planning, where  is  this  evil

which he sees in -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No, Sir. Where is this evil which

is  alleged to exist in the utilisation  of  money

directed  to  an organisation whose integrity  and

whose approach to this human problem has not  been

challenged either in this House or outside?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was one other matter brought up by the

Member for Changi to which I would like to reply.

He said that these dedicated ladies in the Family

Planning Association have very rich husbands, so

let them go and sell their jewellery -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Sure, sure!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I would say this, Sir. I know the

Member  for Changi is a sincere social  worker.  I

have  seen him go into court. I have seen him bail

prisoners. I have seen him do quiet work  for  the

public.  But I say this to him. Would he give  his

all  for  any one particular aspect of the  social

services in which he is interested? Is it not good

that  there are people who do come forward to give

not  merely money but of their time to  serve  the

people? Let us remember that the $100,000 is but a

part   of   the  budget  of  the  Family  Planning

Association  and  that the  persons  to  whom  the

Member  for Changi has referred do, in fact,  give

their voluntary donations to the extent that  they

can,  but  they  do appeal to the public  and  the

public   does   support   this   Family   Planning

Association. So I say, with respect to the  Member

for  Changi  whom  I  have  always  regarded  very

highly, that that jibe was uncalled for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only hope, Sir, that the absence of many of

the  supporters of family planning who voted  last

year  will in no way affect a matter which gravely

affects  an  important  social  service  for  this

territory, and that some who abstained  last  year

will take courage to support a very worthy cause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to correct a

statement   that  was  made  by  the  Member   for

Cairnhill just now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



Subject to correction, Sir, I do not think that  I

ever  said that free advice on family planning  is

given in the maternity clinics and hospitals; what

I  did  say was that if any woman, for reasons  of

health, requires advice on matters of that nature -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Family planning?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Not necessarily family planning, but

advice  on  matters of health. She  can  get  that

advice in the maternity clinics and hospitals, but

as  far as I know, these centres do not give  such

advice  on  family  planning as advocated  by  the

Family Planning Association. [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> crossed the Floor of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member is

completely  out  of  order in crossing  the  floor

unnecessarily.   Will  he   please   return   that

document?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, Sir. I apologise for

crossing  the Floor, Mr Chairman. Please  forgive

me for taking that particular document. The reason

is that I wish to refer to it and answer back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech yesterday I did not advise those

office  bearers in the Family Planning Association

to  sell  their jewellery. I advised them to  save

that  money  and not to spend it on diamond  rings

and beautiful dresses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must thank the Member for Cairnhill for his

nice  compliment on my social service  activities.

Sir,  as  a social worker, I have had occasion  to

attend   many  social  functions.  Sir,  I  wonder

whether or not the Little Sisters of the Poor  can

be classified as an institution which has rendered

a great service to this country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Sure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, but when I looked

through  the Budget, I failed to find  the  Little

Sisters  of  the Poor applying for any  government

grant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of information, Sir. The Member for Changi will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



find  there  is a grant for the Little Sisters  of

the  Poor at page 145, Head 26, subhead 24 of  the

Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir.

Because  the  debate has been  so  heated  and  so

sensational, I failed to observe this.  I  thought

it was the Blue Cross Charitable Institution. Sir,

the Blue Cross is a recognised institution and  is

run  by public donations. If the House will  allow

me,  I  will  organise more social  functions  and

render  greater service to this country without  a

government donation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> On a point of

order,  Sir.  Has the Member for Changi  indicated

the  length of time he requires to speak  on  this

subject, Sir, and has he used up all that time?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. I

have  allotted 100 minutes for the whole  of  Head

26.  I  take it that hon. Members are aware of  it

and  that they are also aware that there  are  two

more  amendments  put down for debate.  There  are

just over 30 minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you, Mr Chairman, Sir.

Besides  the  two  points  which  I  pointed   out

yesterday,  I  wish  to  add another  point - public

spirit. We are most appreciative of the work  done

by  these  energetic and devoted  ladies  for  the

Family   Planning  Association.  I  am   wondering

whether they cannot take another step forward  and

also  direct  their attention to  the  Blue  Cross

Charitable Institution which is run on a voluntary

basis. I believe the money spent on the Blue Cross

Charitable  Institution is  much  less  than  that

spent  on  the  Family Planning  Association.  The

relief done by the Blue Cross is an indication  of

its public spirit. So I wish the office bearers of

the  Family  Planning  Association  would  try  to

understand  my point of view and give  it  careful

consideration if they wish to run the  Association

on a voluntary basis. If the advice that they give

is  not only to be confined to family planning but

also  to  other matters, then I am in  support  of

this grant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $5,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect   of  sub-head  18,  Grant  to  Automobile

Association  of  Singapore, on  page  144  of  the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that under the "Remarks" column

this  grant requires Treasury sanction  and  I  do

hope that such sanction will not be approved. This

Association is a private body and is affiliated to

all the other motoring associations in the British

Commonwealth. I do not see why we should provide a

grant   to   a  private  association.  $5,000   is

required, Sir, and from the reasons given,  I  see

that this sum is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



assist  the  Association to replace existing  road

signs with new ones. Road signs are, in fact,  the

responsibility  of the Government or  the  highway

authority,  which is the City Council.  It  should

not be the responsibility of a private association

to  provide road signs. I am told that  such  road

signs  are  put  up  for the  purpose  of  guiding

motorists to different places of interest.  It  is

more  or  less in the nature of tourist propaganda

and  it should therefore be the responsibility  of

the Government and not of private association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Automobile Association of Singapore is

maintained  by  the members. I am  myself  a  life

member  of the Association and, as such, I  should

have  been  very  happy to see  that  a  grant  is

provided  for  it. But it is a principle  that  is

involved, Sir. It is not the question of  a  grant

that  is coming to my Association. I am very  much

against  the  principle of granting money  out  of

public  funds  to  a private association.  As  the

Minister for Health has indicated in his speech on

family  planning, it is the policy  of  the  money

that  is  involved. I hope that Treasury  sanction

will  not be given and I trust that the House will

support my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The explanation is very simple, Mr

Chairman,  Sir. If the hon. Member  will  look  at

page  418  of the Estimates, he will see a  rather

fuller explanation of what it is proposed that the

Association  should  do. A  distinction  is  drawn

between  the signs which give orders, say,  "Stop"

or "Keep left" - which are definite orders - and those

which  give  useful information such as  the  fact

that  there  is a narrow bridge ahead or  you  are

coming to a double bend and that kind of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant in this case is a dollar-for-dollar

grant  and,  in  fact, if the Association  is  not

given the grant and it does not put the signs  up,

then  the  burden  will  be  transferred  to   the

Government. The advocates of less taxation,  I  am

sure, will support this grant which will cost only

$5,000 from the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



funds,  whereas if the Association is not  allowed

to co-operate with the Government, then presumably

the  whole  amount will have to be paid  from  the

public  funds, or will not be provided, with  less

improvement consequently in the traffic situation.

There   is   undoubtedly  very  great   need   for

improvements of all sorts in the safety and  rapid

flow  of  traffic in Singapore, and anything  that

can  be  done  should be done. If  the  Government

organisation has to be extended to deal with these

things  that  will, of course,  involve  not  only

expenditure on signs but expenditure on additional

officials to go round and see where the signs  are

to be put up. There is very often a real saving to

be  achieved by using a voluntary organisation  to

do  work  which the Government could do but  which

would  be  costly  and elaborate and  which  would

perhaps  be slower because everything  has  to  go

through the government machine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add perhaps that the Traffic Branch of

the  Police, who, after all, are experts  on  this

problem, strongly support this vote, and that  the

signs   to   be   erected  will  be   erected   in

consultation with the Traffic Branch  both  as  to

types  and  location.  I hope  my  explanation  is

sufficient, Sir, for us to pass on to other items.

It  is, in fact, a saving of money and probably an

increase in efficiency will be derived from making

this  grant to a voluntary organisation which  can

do useful work in the public service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, it is really

surprising   to   hear  from  the   Minister   for

Communications  and Works that if the  road  signs

were   to   become  the  responsibility   of   the

Government,  the  expenditure  involved  would  be

more.  There was the opinion frequently  expressed

yesterday  that  broadcasting  should  come  under

private   enterprise.   Is   it   the   Minister's

contention  that  whatever is  undertaken  by  the

Government  will  cost far  more  than  if  it  is

undertaken by private enterprise? If that is so, I

am very much surprised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of road signs, Sir, I am fully

aware, as I have indicated in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



my  speech,  that it is not a question  of  "Stop,

look,  go",  but it is a question of  "Major  road

ahead"  or  "Sharp  bend"  as  indicated  by   the

Minister. All the way up to the Federation, Sir, I

do  find such signs and it is my opinion that they

should  be provided by the Government rather  than

by  a  private  organisation, if  the  Automobile

Association  of  Singapore  is  trying   to   help

motorists,  it should apply for a grant  from  the

Commonwealth Headquarters Association to which  it

is affiliated, rather than from the Assembly. I do

not  think it is right for the Government to grant

a  dollar for a dollar, a dollar for a dollar,  to

all  kinds of organisation. I shall be coming back

to  this dollar for dollar basis on another  issue

at  a later stage. I think this is entirely wrong.

As  the  Member for Changi has indicated  earlier,

because the Blue Cross is doing charitable work in

place  of the Government, and if that organisation

is  going to apply for a dollar for dollar  grant,

then  the  Government  will  be  committed  to   a

colossal sum of money. As it stands today, Sir, we

are  committed  to  $1,078,520  just  for  charity

alone, and if more associations come to Government

for  dollar for dollar grants, where will it land?

We  are faced with a deficit of $36 million,  Sir,

and  out  of  that  the Member for  Cairnhill  has

indicated  that  $14 million  or  $15  million  is

provided  for  four  minesweepers.  Out  of   that

charity,  another $16 million to $20  million  may

have  to  be  provided in time to come.  Can  this

Government afford that, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> if it please you, Sir, I must

confess  that I fail to understand the Member  for

Queenstown.   Surely   he  does   not   discourage

voluntary  organisations of  citizens  seeking  to

serve  their fellow citizens? This is a  voluntary

organisation. It is recognised that  it  is  doing

very  useful  work. It is recognised that  it  has

inadequate  funds to do this work competently  and

fully  unless  it receives assistance.  Therefore,

rather than take over the work which would deprive

citizens  of,  for one thing, the  opportunity  to

serve the country and which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



would   also  increase  the  cost  to  Government,

Government has very wisely said, "We will give you

half  of  what  it  costs for a  service  that  is

essential  to the country." If the hon. Member  is

complaining  about a million dollars  to  charity,

all I can say, for my part, is "Not enough."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see, Sir, for example, since the

Minister  for Communications and Works  has  shown

the  interest of his department in the welfare  of

the  road  user, that there should  be  a  greater

grant to the Safety First Council to enable it  to

reorganise itself on an efficient basis. It is  no

use  giving  a  little. You  cannot  get  much  in

return;  but if you give adequately, then you  can

assist   the  voluntary  organisations  to  better

efforts and to far greater returns than the outlay

which is indicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should not, as a matter of principle,

take  over all charitable organisations. Voluntary

charitable organisations are a very valuable asset

to the people of the country and to those who have

an  opportunity to serve. For myself, Sir, I would

like  to  say  this:  I will  never  be  chary  in

supporting Government in all legitimate  measures,

even   generous  measures,  to  assist  charitable

organisations to discharge the functions they seek

to discharge to the maximum possible efficiency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown

claims  to  be a business man, and I am unable  to

understand  why  he cannot see the mathematics  of

this  case. Surely the saving is not only a dollar

for   a  dollar,  but  the  time  that  Government

officers would take to design and put up all these

sign posts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $l25,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  sub-head 31. Grant to  Young  Women's

Christian   Association,  on  page  145   of   the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I must point out

very clearly that I am in no way against the Young

Women's  Christian  Association  or  its  members;

especially where women are concerned, it is rather

dangerous! Sir, I am fully aware



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



of the activities of this Association in providing

all  sorts of amenities for young girls and  women

and  I think it is doing a very good job. But what

I  am  concerned with, as I have said earlier,  is

the  principle  of voting such a  grant.  It  will

create  a  precedent if we are to grant  money  to

organisations year after year. There are two other

organisations with similar objects, and there  may

be  more.  These two organisations are, if  I  may

quote, the Y.M.C.A. and the Chinese Y.M.C.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory is correct, Sir, in 1953 the Social

Welfare Department intended to rebuild the  Prince

Edward  Hostel at Prince Edward Road. Subsequently

they  came  to  know  that  the  Chinese  Y.M.C.A.

intended  to put up a building there. In order  to

save  Government expenditure, the Director of  the

Social    Welfare   Department,   Mr    Cromwell,

negotiated  with  the  officials  of  the  Chinese

Y.M.C.A. and offered a grant of $150,000  to  this

Association in putting up that building - but on one

condition. That condition was that a part  of  the

building should be allotted to the hostel so  that

the  boys  from  the  existing  hostel  could   be

transferred  to  that  building.  It   is   rather

surprising,  Sir, that when the vote came  up,  it

was  turned  down. Sir, when a grant of  $150,000,

which  was  negotiated  by  an  official  of   the

Government with an organisation with similar  aims

was turned down by the Government, why then should

we  now  approve  a grant of $125,000  to  another

organisation with similar aims?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> It is not the same government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I see! It is clear now! I

think  that was the reason why it was turned down!

Then  it was a colonial government, but now it  is

the Labour Front Coalition Government! But what  I

feel  is  this, Sir: there seems to be  a  bit  of

discrimination  when giving grants  to  charitable

organisations. From the list of charitable  grants

I  see  that the Girl Guides Movement is  given  a

grant;  the Girls' Life Brigade is given a  grant;

the Boy Scouts' Association is given a grant. But,

Sir,  there is a youth movement in Singapore which

is doing just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



as  good service as all these movements, and  that

is  the  Boys'  Brigade  Battalion.  I  am  really

surprised  that I do not find this movement  being

given   a  grant.  I  think  the  Government   has

discriminated when giving grants this time  and  I

hope that when the question of giving grants comes

up  again next time, the Government will not  show

any  discrimination which casts  a  reflection  on

some other organisations. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

it  is  very  interesting to see that a  religious

organisation  has been given a  grant  of  such  a

large sum of money when it is known full well that

this  colony has no official religion. Sir,  since

Singapore has so many religions and so many races,

why  do  we not declare it to be a secular  State?

Possibly  a  Muslim State, because  Singapore  was

originally  a  Muslim village? Possibly  is  it  a

Communist State, because Singapore has no official

religion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been supporting the Young Women's

Christian Association for 35 years. It  is  on  my

donation  list yearly and I will go on  supporting

it.  Sir,  this world-wide organisation  is  doing

wonderful  work,  but if such  an  association  is

given  a  grant on a dollar for dollar  basis  for

building  work, then I do not see any  reason  why

other  associations with similar aims  should  not

also be given grants. For example, the Ramakrishna

Mission  is also doing wonderful work irrespective

of  caste  or creed but it has not been  given  a

grant. The Young Men's Muslim Association has  not

been  given a grant. The Muslim Missionary Society

has  been  given no grant. Sir, has the Government

decided to give a grant to all these organisations

which are doing wonderful work for the welfare  of

the public? I would like to seek an assurance from

the Financial Secretary on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I understand

the  approach usually is that Government seeks  to

assist  charitable associations  which  do  public

service irrespective of race or creed, and I think

that has been true when I was Chief Minister;  and

I believe that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



Ramakrishna Mission, although religious in aspect,

does  assist without reference to race  or  creed,

did receive assistance from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would draw the attention of the House to what I

know the Member for Telok Ayer is fully aware  of,

and  that is that the Y.W.C.A., though a Christian

Association, has, in fact, in its many years  work

in  the  colony, made no distinction between  race

and religion in Singapore in assisting the people;

and I think the House should know for what purpose

the  present  sum is required. Sir,  the  Y.W.C.A.

has,  through  the generosity of  the  Government,

received  land  totalling 66,000  square  feet  in

Outram  Road. They have enough money to build  one

wing and they need more money to complete it.  The

main  purpose  of  that  building,  Sir,  is   the

education  and  provision of training  classes  in

sewing,  cooking, laundry work and crafts  of  all

kinds for women of all races. It is not a question

of accommodation for a particular Christian group.

The  work which they do is wholly irrespective  of

the  religions of the persons they seek to assist,

and   surely  we  would  wish  to  support   whole

heartedly  the  efforts of  this  organisation  in

giving   provision   for   simple   education   in

worthwhile  crafts to the poorer sections  of  the

population.  I feel sure, Sir, that if  the  House

knew  fully the facts of the case, there would  be

no  question  of any criticism of this  worthwhile

grant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, perhaps I might elaborate on

what  has  been said by the Member for  Cairnhill.

The  Y.W.C.A, since 1933 has been running  evening

schools  for under-privileged girls,  and  at  the

moment  there  are  600 of these  girls  attending

classes in three centres - one at the Havelock  Road

Children   Centre;  one  at  the  Prinsep   Street

Children  Centre; and one at the  Cantonment  Road

School.  For the benefit of hon. Members,  I  will

name the courses provided:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning they have nursery and

kindergarten; classes in home-craft and  languages

and  hand-work.  The languages  include  Mandarin,

Malay and English.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon the classes are in commercial

subjects  and  also  include  child-care,   health

education, sewing, tailoring, cooking and training

of amahs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening there are schools run for the

under-privileged girls who work in  the  factories

and for other girls in other jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this money is well spent. If we do

not  spend  it,  it  might be more  expensive  for

Government   to  look  after  all   these   under-privileged children and illiterate women who  seek

to better their lot in life.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I support the amendment moved by

never  appeared before in the Budget. Let me  draw

your  attention to the footnote numbered  (iv)   at

page   145 - "Grant  towards  cost  of  building   a

centre". As far as I know, Sir, there is already a

centre at Fort Canning. If the representatives  of

the  Young Men's Muslim Association go to  see  my

hon.  Friend  the  Minister for Local  Government,

Lands   and   Housing,  and - I  hope   I   am   not

same  sum  as  is  granted to  the  Young  Women's

can  the  Minister  give us a guarantee  that  the

policy  to  institute a drive for educational  and

social services for under-privileged children  not

at  present within the influence of existing youth

organisations.  This  grant  would   more   likely

achieve  better  results at less  cost  than  most

page 147 of the Estimates,"



<br><br>will  he confine his remarks to a question on that

item,  unless he is speaking on the policy of  the

whole department?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in

fact, I intended to ask the Financial Secretary to

explain  this vote of $300,000. Last year in  this

House  he  did  mention that  this  sum  would  be

reduced  this  year  because quarters  were  being

built  for expatriate officers who had to live  in

hotels because there were not enough quarters  for

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> I think

hon.  Members  are aware that the  object  of  the

money in this vote is to assist officers, who must

live in hotels while waiting for quarters, to  pay

hotel  bills, the cost of living in a hotel  being

very much more costly than living in a house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payments of hotel allowances are governed by

a series of circulars which have been in operation

since  very  shortly after the war.  The  gist  of

these  circulars is that, in the case of a  single

officer, Government pays that part of a hotel bill

for  board and lodging which exceeds $600. In  the

case   of  a  married  officer,  Government   pays

anything in excess of $1,100. Definite limits are,

of  course, placed on the expenditure which can be

incurred on hotels. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



figures of $600 and $1,100 per mensem are the sums

which  it  is  estimated a single  officer  and  a

married officer would have to pay respectively  on

board and lodging if they were living in their own

quarters.  These  circulars  apply  not  only   to

expatriate officers but also to local officers who

return from study courses overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that some 35 officers would be

eligible  for hotel allowances in 1957.  There  is

still a waiting list for government quarters,  and

there are some contract officers who are here  for

only  a  short time and whom we find it not  worth

while to set up in quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300,000 has been provided, that being the figure

which  was provided last year, and, as the  Member

for  Sembawang  has rightly pointed  out,  in  all

probability  the  whole sum may not  be  required.

Expenditure to-date this year has been running  to

the order of $180,000 to the end of October and  I

should think expenditure next year will be of  the

same order.

When  speaking  on  the  Second  Reading  of   the

Appropriation Bill on Monday, 19th November, 1956,

I   made   reference  to  the  1,800  non-resident

dividends  paid by limited companies,  or  whether

the  net was thrown wider to include other sources

such as income from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



rents  and  partnerships and so on.  Possibly  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, this House must

recognise  that  there  is  considerable   concern

throughout the country at what is believed  to  be

the inefficiency of the Income Tax Department, and

this has been highlighted when we learned for  the

first  time  the appalling news that  there  is  a

tradition  of swindling the Income Tax  Department

every  week, every month and every year,  and  the

smug  complacency  of  the Income  Tax  Department

towards  this tradition. Sir, it is  more  than  a

little surprising that this information has  never

been  divulged to the public and that there should

have been no genuine effort, in so far as one  can

ascertain from the figures, to meet it, apart from

the  fact  that  the figures this year  seem  much

lower  than  heretofore.  We  are  told  that  the

persons  cannot  be pursued in the United  Kingdom

because  of private international law.  There  has

been no suggestion of any effort to have a special

arrangement  with  the  United  Kingdom   on   the

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a complete lack of recognition of

one  of the basic facts of life in Singapore,  and

that  is  that  the  business  community,  to   an

important   extent,   are   transients,   and   in

Singapore, more than in any other country  in  the

world,  we  need  adequate  regulations  for   the

protection  of  our revenue and the prevention  of

this   tradition  of  swindling  the  Income   Tax

Department  after  having got all  they  could  in

other ways. There have been 1,800 odd swindlers in

nine  years,  making it four every week,  and  the

Income  Tax  Department has  been  silent  on  the

subject  in so far as the public of Singapore  are

concerned. When the Financial Secretary is pressed

for a reply, Sir, we are informed that nothing can

be  done  but since we insist, the matter will  be

taken  up with the Federation. The whole principle

of it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



is   wrong,   Sir. It  seems  to  me   that   the

administrative approach to the problem of  income-tax  gathering is wholly inadequate,  and  I  call

upon the Government and the Financial Secretary to

take  radical  measures to transform  the  present

Income    Tax   Department   into   an   efficient

organisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, I cannot agree

more  with the sentiments expressed by the  Member

for  Cairnhill. It was indeed a great shock to the

public  when it learned that Singapore  was  being

swindled  of  millions of dollars by these  income

tax  evaders. Sir, I think it is high time for the

Financial Secretary to set up machinery  to  check

this terrible practice of swindling the Income Tax

Department.   Sir,   although   the   Income   Tax

Department  is  a pan-Malayan organisation,  I  am

sure  the Federation of Malaya will be pleased  to

receive  a  lead  from  Singapore  to  check  this

reprehensible practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these days we have been debating on how

to  save government expenditure and how to collect

more  revenue.  But  now,  faced  with  political,

social and educational advancement, more money  is

needed  to  keep pace with this advancement.  Sir,

the  burden  of  taxation is being placed  on  the

lower  income group and yet in other ways we  have

been  losing millions of dollars. I therefore wish

the Financial Secretary to take note of this point

more seriously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The Member for Cairnhill, Sir, called

upon me to take radical measures to reorganise the

administration  of the Income Tax Department,  but

he did not suggest what radical measures he had in

mind.  He  also  made reference to "the  appalling

news"  that  a fantastic amount of money  had  not

been  collected  as  a result  of  people  leaving

Singapore without paying their income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I draw attention once more to the fact that,

over  nine years, 1,700 people have left Singapore

owing  tax to the tune of $1.1 million. The Member

for  Cairnhill made no reference to the fact  that

during  the  last  two years  a  very  significant

decrease has been achieved. I cannot say  what  is

the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



people who actually fled the country in 1955,  but,

again speaking from memory -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of correction, Sir, that

is  a very unfair statement. I did refer to the very

great difference n this year's collection. My hon.

Friend's memory is at fault.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> No, Sir, I am sure my memory is not at

fault.  The  Member for Cairnhill said that  there

was  a  great improvement in this year's  figures.

The  improvement was most marked in  the  previous

year's  figures. In other words, during  the  last

two years the Income Tax Department has been doing

a particularly good job in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, I will approach the

Federation  of  Malaya to see whether  they  would

join  with  us  in taking some action  to  prevent

people  fleeing  the country without  paying  tax.

Whether  or  not  I will be successful  in  my  approach, I cannot say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid, Sir, I cannot accept the criticisms

which   have  been  levelled  at  the  Income   Tax

Department.  On  the  contrary,  I  consider   the

Department has done and is doing a splendid job in

the  face  of  many difficulties.  In  considering

income  tax  in Malaya, one has to remember  that,

firstly,  the Income Tax Department has only  been

in  existence since 1948. There is a  tendency  to

compare  the Income Tax Department with the  Board

of Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom (which, to

the  best  of my knowledge, has been in  existence

for  over  a  hundred years)  in  respect  of  the

success or otherwise that has been achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Income Tax Department has been in

existence for only eight years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Income Tax Department was

established  in  the  face  of  the  most   bitter

opposition  front all sections of  the  community,

and  antagonism has coloured the approach  of  all

sections of the community towards the work done by

the  Department  and the results achieved  by  the

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it had to start completely from scratch

with  only  a  very  few  officers  who  had   any

knowledge  whatsoever of income  tax  law  or  the

collection



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



of  income  tax, and staff, of course, had  to  be

recruited   and   trained  for  the   purpose   of

collection of tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as a result of delay in bringing the

Ordinance  into force, the Department started  off

with  a legacy of one year's income tax assessment

in arrears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it had to build up from scratch the

sources of information without which no Income Tax

Department can function efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, whenever it has wanted to take some new

action  which  might  lead  to  a  more  efficient

collection of tax and detection of evasion, it has

met  with  a storm of protest and, on the majority

of occasions, has eventually been hamstrung by the

reactions of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, ever since it started, it has suffered

from a chronic shortage of staff which has not yet

been  overcome. We have had to go to every country

in  the  world, to obtain recruits for the  Income

Tax Department and, as I see it in the future,  we

will  still  have to go to every  country  in  the

world to obtain recruits for the Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, Sir, far from being

inefficient,  I think the Department  has  done  a

remarkably  good job. In the years since  it  came

into  operation, it has, in fact,  collected  $459

million for Singapore. That was a considerable sum

and   a  very  significant  contribution  to   the

revenues of the country. This does not mean,  Sir,

that  the  efficiency of the Department cannot  be

improved. It can be improved and is being improved

as  more  staff become qualified by experience  to

fill the higher jobs and as their places are taken

by promising new recruits. Efficiency is largely a

matter of having an adequate supply of experienced

staff.  As  I  have said, this staff is  extremely

difficult  to obtain. There is a chronic  shortage

of  good income tax officers throughout the world.

In  our  efforts  to train officers  to  the  high

standard of knowledge and experience necessary  to

hold  their  own with professional men  with  whom

they  have to deal, we have been trying to  obtain

the  services  of a training officer.  This  is  a

highly specialised job and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



good  officers are few and far between and are  in

great  demand.  Our  efforts  have  so  far   been

unsuccessful, but I am happy to say that  we  have

managed  to arrange for a highly qualified  member

of   the  Comptroller-General's  Office  in  Kuala

Lumpur to undertake the job until we can obtain  a

training officer of our own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hears from time to time that the Department

is  not  aware  of  many  taxpayers  who  are  not

enmeshed  in  its  net. I doubt this  myself.  The

Department's information branch taps  a  multitude

of sources which are unknown to the general public

in  order  to  bring  all  taxpayers  to  account.

Recently,  in connection with the suggestion  that

many  people were evading tax, the Department made

a  street  survey  of selected business  areas  in

Singapore.  The  idea was to  test  the  truth  or

otherwise  of  the  suggestion  that  many   small

business men were escaping. The results confirmed

the belief of the Comptroller that he had most  of

the potential taxpayers on his books. Very few new

taxpayers were found in these busy areas and  only

a few appeared to be paying less than they should.

There is, of course, some evasion of tax. That  is

inevitable. Even in Britain where, as I have said,

income tax collection has been in force for over a

hundred  years, there is evasion, sometimes  on  a

very   substantial  scale.  But  I  doubt  whether

evasion here is as bad as many people suggest.  In

any case, we now have an investigation team going.

It  will be strengthened and, as I said the  other

day,  it has over the past three years managed  to

bring  in  $5  million worth of  tax  which  would

otherwise have been lost.



<br><br>11.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Deputy

Chairman,  Sir,  I  would like  to  speak  on  the

general  policy of income tax and I wish  to  draw

the  attention of the Government to a few  of  the

complaints  generally voiced by the taxpayers.  In

the  case  of  a  single man, the  tax  relief  is

$3,000,  and  this is the same in the  case  of  a

single woman.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



However, when a man gets married, it seems that the

income   tax  law  operate  to  his  disadvantage,

because he is made to pay not on the amount of the

income  that he has earned after his marriage  but

on the total income of his wife and himself on the

year  before  they were married. I would  ask  the

Government to look into this matter and  see  that

no  undue  hardship is inflicted on newly  married

couples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of relief, Sir, I know that in

England widowed mothers and unemployed parents are

given  relief. I know that the relief  amounts  to

slightly  over $500. In Singapore we do  not  have

this in operation. We in Singapore always say that

we  copy whatever is good in England, but this  is

an  instance where it is practised in England  and

not  practised in Singapore. I have  said  before

that the people here support their parents and, in

doing  so,  make their parents less of a liability

on  the  social welfare institutions. If they  can

help  Government in such a manner, I think  it  is

only  fair  that they should be given relief  when

they  are  supporting their parents  who  are  not

gainfully  employed. I would  like  Government  to

give  this  point  serious consideration  and,  if

possible,  introduce a Bill before  this  Assembly

giving  this  sort  of benefit to  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, I

rise  to support the proposal put forward  by  the

Member  for  Serangoon to increase the tax  relief

allowance  in  order  to make  provision  for  the

parents.  Sir, in oriental tradition, the  parents

hold  an important status in the family. They  are

more important than the wife and the children. But

the  existing  income tax law makes provision  for

the  wife and children and leaves out the parents.

We  in  Singapore  are marching towards  political

independence, but at the same time I  should  like

to  urge  the  people  to  fight  for  ideological

independence.  It  is high time  for  the  elected

Government  to  give  a  lead  to  the  people  of

Singapore and prove that it is different from  the

previous colonial Government, and one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



wise  step in this direction is to amend he Income

Tax  Ordinance by including parents in the  relief

allowance.



<br><br>11.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,

speaking in support of the last two speakers, I  do

not  think it is necessary for me to elaborate  on

this  issue. Much has been said that the  personal

relief  allowance should include the parents.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill, speaking on  this  subject

when  the  Income Tax Bill was debated,  indicated

that  the Labour Front Government was fully  aware

of  the Asian way of life and had taken this  fact

into  consideration; but it is a  surprise  to  me

that  after  18 months in office the Labour  Front

Government has never thought fit to legislate  for

personal relief to be given to parents. As I  have

said  again  and again, the parents take  priority

over  the  wife and children. Without our parents,

we   would  never  exist.  Since  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  has  indicated that  the  Labour  Front

Government is fully aware of this fact, I do  hope

that within a matter of two or three months a Bill

will   be   introduced  into  this  House   making

provision for personal relief also to be given  to

parents rather than to the wife and children only,

and  I  am  sure that this Bill will  receive  the

approval  of every Member here except, maybe,  the

expatriates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bachelor earning $3,000 a year may have to

support  his  parents  and possibly  five  younger

brothers  and  sisters,  and  to  grant   him   an

allowance of $3,000 only - which is $250 a month - is

to make it impossible for him to maintain that big

family  which,  according  to  Western  eyes,   is

actually  not  his family. That  is  his  father's

family.  The  younger brothers and sisters  solely

depend  on the wage-earning member of the  family,

irrespective of whether or not he is  married.  If

the  wage-earning  member  is  married,  then,  of

course,  his burden would be far heavier  because,

in  addition  to his own family, he will  have  to

support  his parents and his younger brothers  and

sisters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A personal relief allowance of $5,000 is given to

a  family man. That $5,000 works out at about $416

a month. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck) has

said  that I am not good at mathematics. Now, with

this $416 to maintain a wife without children  but

with  the  parents and a few younger brothers  and

sisters  depending  on him, I doubt  whether  this

amount is sufficient with the present high cost of

living.   Sir,   there  are   more   Asians   than

expatriates  in  the Council of  Ministers  and  I

sincerely  hope that we will not copy the  Western

way  of life. I know that the existing Income  Tax

Ordinance is copied from the United Kingdom. As we

are  on the way to merdeka, we should change  this

Ordinance  to suit our country and not the  United

Kingdom. Once again I express the hope that a Bill

will  shortly  come  before this  Assembly  giving

relief to parents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, we may be on the way to merdeka

but  I  do not think we are on the way to complete

freedom  from taxation! I have heard a great  deal

in the course of the last few days about the habit

of  the  population of Singapore to support  their

relatives - their  fathers and  mothers,  and  their

brothers  and  sisters - but they are not  alone  in

that.  In  every country in the world, it  is  the

privilege  of sons and daughters to support  their

aged  parents, and that is done in countries  like

Great  Britain  and  other  continental  countries

where  the  rates of personal allowance  are  very

much lower than they are here in Singapore. In any

case, it would seem that the families in Singapore

appear to be rather larger than in other countries

of the world and no doubt the burden of supporting

parents is cast over a very much wider field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of allowances, having regard to

the amount of the personal allowances which are in

existence  at  the  moment,  I  can  hold  out  no

prospect whatsoever of being able to add to  them.

Our  need for revenue is such that if there is  to

be  any change in the allowances in the future, it

must inevitably be to reduce them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for

Serangoon, it is a fundamental principle of income

tax  policy throughout the world that the  incomes

of  husband and wife should be lumped together for

the purposes of assessment of tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



While I have a certain amount of sympathy for him

on the point which he raised, I can offer no

prospect whatsoever of being able to meet it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, I

should  like some points to be clarified. On  page

161  of the Estimates, against items (11) and (13)

of  sub-head 1, I see that the personal emoluments

given  for  the  same appointment  are  different.

Against  item  (11)   we  find  that  the  personal

emolument  of the "Personal Assistant to Minister"

is  $630  rising annually by $25 to $755;  whereas

against item (13)  it says "Personal Assistant  (to

whom it is not indicated) $705".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to refer you to page 227, items

(13)  and (14)  of sub-head 1. Against item (13)   it

says  "Personal  Assistant to Permanent  Secretary

=$730-25A-880"; whereas against item (14)  it  says

"Personal Assistant to Minister=$630-25A-755".  In

this latter case, Sir, I cannot understand why the

Personal  Assistant to a Minister is  in  a  lower

salary  scale than the Personal Assistant  to  the

Permanent  Secretary to a Minister. How are  these

figures   arrived  at,  Sir?  Can   the   Minister

concerned or the Financial Secretary clarify  this

position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> The hon. Member has raised a very

pertinent  question and I think the only  reply  I

can  give is that we have inherited today  what  I

have   frequently  described  as   a   jungle   of

individual salary scales varying by small  amounts

for  no particular reason; and the reason that  we

have inherited this tangle is, I think, due to the

fact  that  over  the past years  we  have  had  a

multiplicity of revisions of salaries in  which  a

multiplicity  of  sectional  interests  have  been

represented  and have reaped sectional  advantage.

It is one of the major operations which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



must  be  carried  out, namely, to  simplify  this

complicated salary structure and try and get  down

to  a  limited number of simple scales  which  are

intelligible to all of us. We are now  engaged  in

the    operation   of   carrying   out   such    a

rationalisation  of scales in Division  IV  and  I

hope  that, in due course, you will find that your

salary  scales  are not subject to  peculiar,  and

often very difficult to justify, variations.

called  in  order to go through the Budget,  would

have  drawn  attention to the fact  that  his  own

Personal Assistant was receiving less pay than the

$705. He may be a senior officer who has come to a

level where he is fixed. In the case, however,  of

the  Personal Assistant to the Minister, he starts

at  $630 and rises up to a higher figure than  the

Personal  Assistant  to the  Permanent  Secretary,

that  is,  up to $755. At the rate he  is  drawing

now,  his total salary for the year will  come  to

$8,510,  whereas  the other officer's  salary  will

come  to  $8,460; but he can rise further up  than

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, as the

Assistants  in my Ministry, I would  like  to  say

that,  as  far  as  my  own  knowledge  goes,  the

Personal  Assistant to the Permanent Secretary  is

one  of  the  oldest members on the  staff  and  I

believe  has  been promoted because  of  his  long

service  up  to  the scale-grade of  $730-25A-880,

whereas my Personal Assistant is a very young  man

and has not been long in the service.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,

when  we  come  to  the Ministry of  Commerce  and

Industry,  I  think we are on the  most  important

Ministry  in the Government. This is the  Ministry

that  is  either  going to bring us  a  prosperous

Singapore  or a Singapore that is poor and  unable

to hold its own against other territories. For the

last few months there has always been a thought in

my  mind that the future of Singapore is going  to

be  bleak. The future of Singapore is not going to

be as rosy as we all like it to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to this, Sir, Singapore enjoyed the

status of a big entrepot. It supplied the needs of

Indonesia,   Siam,   Indo-China,   Hongkong,   the

Federation  of Malaya and Burma. This was  in  the

days  when  most  of  these territories,  such  as

Burma, Indonesia and French Indo-China, were still

colonies. The position today, however, has changed

and  now  we  have the independent territories  of

Burma,  Vietnam,  Vietminh, Indonesia,  India  and

Ceylon, and  by  next year we will  have  another

independent  country coming up, and that  will  be

the  Federation of Malaya. It is a fact, Sir, that

as soon as a country attains independence, it will

try its very best to do what it thinks is best for

itself. We find today that Indonesia is trying  to

trade  directly with the West. Indonesia is trying

to  replace Singapore with Djakarta. In  the  same

way, we find our nearest neighbour, the Federation

of  Malaya, imposing tariffs on all goods imported

into it. All these measures, Sir, -







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Chairman (Mr R. C. H. Lim)</b>: Order,

please.  May  I  ask  the hon. Member  to  confine

himself  to  Head  31, Ministry  of  Commerce  and

Industry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Absolutely, Sir. I am coming

to  the  policy  of the Ministry of  Commerce  and

Industry and what I have said is just a preamble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Time is limited!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I have ten minutes to my

credit,  Sir! Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, all  these

things  will  mean  that the  entrepot  status  of

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



will be lowered and, in all probability, Singapore

will just be a port of call. We have plans to make

Singapore an industrial centre like Hongkong,  but

again,  Sir, for reasons which I have just  given,

progress in this direction may not be as rapid  as

we  would  like  it to be; and I  would  like  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry to inform us as

to  how  we can maintain Singapore as a prosperous

city. It is important that it must be so, Sir, and

there  are only a few ways in which this could  be

done. One of them would be expansion into the sea,

that is, expanding the fisheries industry. Sir,  I

will  be speaking on that aspect when it comes  up

for debate under the appropriate Head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, I would

like  to ask the Minister whether his Ministry  is

considering  the establishment of an  organisation

to  assist the Malay population to play their full

part  in  the economic life of Singapore.  Sir,  I

believe  wholeheartedly in the principle of  equal

justice   for   all  races.  In  this   particular

instance, I would draw attention to the fact  that

the Malay educational policy of the past was of  a

character  which  had  checked  them  and  acutely

depressed part of the population economically, and

they  do  need  special  assistance  in  order  to

integrate them into modern economic life.  I  know

that  the  Ministry of Commerce and  Industry  has

been   keenly   interested  in  the  question   of

education in methods of fishery, and there  was  a

scheme, Sir, early this year of whose fate I  have

learnt nothing more; but apart from that, I  would

like  to  know  if  there is in  contemplation  an

organisation  to  assist in their  integration  in

commerce and industry.



<br><br>11.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, we are

now  discussing the Head "Ministry of Commerce and

Industry".   Sir,   we   have   acknowledged   the

importance of Singapore as a commercial port. This

Ministry is therefore most important. Despite  the

integrity  and  sincerity  of  the  Minister   for

Commerce  and  Industry in trying to  promote  and

encourage  more  trade and industry,  let  us  ask

ourselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



whether  anything has been done in this direction.

For  myself,  I say "No". In fact, we are  sliding

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon has mentioned that South-East Asia has entirely changed; so many

independent   countries  have   been   born.   The

countries  surrounding Singapore  have  had  their

former  colonial economic system  changed  into  a

nationalist  economic system. Singapore  today  is

very  much  less important than it was before.  We

are facing a critical position. The Federation  of

Malaya is going to achieve merdeka very soon. Sir,

there  is  one thing which I regret.  Despite  the

fact  that  we  have many pan-Malayan departments,

the  two  Governments have never yet come together

to  consider  whether or not to have  pan-Malayan

economic   development.  The  new  import   duties

imposed by the Federation of Malaya are not only a

serious  setback to our local industries,  but  it

might  well  be  the end of our local  industries.

Based  on  these facts, therefore, I do not  think

the  Ministry  is  entitled  to  call  itself  the

Ministry of Commerce and Industry. It is no use at

all  to have the word "Industry" if the Federation

is   not   sympathetic  to  our  industrialisation

policy. I would remind the Government that  it  is

high  time  to consider formulation of pan-Malayan

development  plans.  Unemployment  is  facing   us

today,  and if nothing is done, it will  mean  the

end  of  Singapore  as  an entrepot  centre.  Many

factories  will have to close down.  Sir,  despite

the  fact  that  there has been a  great  deal  of

smuggling of Indonesian rubber, many rubber  mills

have  had to close down. If the Minister wants  to

keep  the word "Industry" in his Ministry, he must

do something at once to bring this about.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,

first  I  must thank the Member for Serangoon  for

his  remark that my Ministry is the most important

Ministry  in the Government. Evidently  he  thinks

so,  but some members of the Press do not, because

normally you do not find them giving much space to

my  warnings of the economic future of  Singapore.

Sir, I am glad that the Mem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



bers  of  this  House are now  slowly  realising,

after  repeated  warnings given  by  me  from  the

September  sittings  onwards,  that  our  economic

future  is not as bright as we had hoped it  would

be  Sir,  during the September sittings, where  we

debated the Governor's Address, I warned the House

that  we would be lucky if we could manage to keep

up  our entrepot trade to the same level as we are

doing now. There are many people in Singapore who,

unfortunately, cannot see the writing on the wall.

They  are still complacent about it and they still

think that we will survive somehow. They say,  "We

have  survived for the last hundred years. So  why

should we not survive now?" But Sir, they fail  to

note  the changing conditions in the world  today.

They  fail  to realise that as each Asian  country

gains  its independence, it wishes to develop  its

economy for the benefit of its own people and  not

for  the  benefit of some other middle  man,  like

Singapore,  and naturally you cannot quarrel  with

them  over  that. Sir, I am glad that  Members  of

this  House  have now realised the true  state  of

affairs and have shown their concern over  the  future of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what does the Government intend to do about

it? Frankly, Sir, the Government can only try, but

it  cannot  be  a hundred per cent sure  that  our

economic  future  will  be sound,  because  a  lot

depends on the attitude of other countries towards

us.  Therefore, as I have always stressed,  it  is

politics that will be the ultimate solution to our

problems   and  not  economy.  The   position   of

Singapore  is  viewed not from the economic  angle

but from the political angle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given warnings about our entrepot trade

and  I have laid stress on the development of  our

secondary industries. At the 7th November  sitting

I  outlined a programme whereby we could encourage

industries,  but there again I must  warn  Members

that a lot depends on whether we could realise the

results  that  we hope would be achieved,  on  the

attitude  of  the  Federation.  Sir,  the   duties

imposed by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



federation at its last Budget sittings on a lot of

manufactures are going to affect greatly  some  of

our industries, and I am not only disturbed but  I

am  also,  frankly, Sir, worried about it,  and  I

think  every  responsible person in  Singapore  is

worried  about it. I have done my best to indicate

to  the  Federation Government that Singapore  and

the  Federation  should  be  looked  upon  as  one

economic  unit,  though  politically  we  may   be

separated, but again, Sir, it is politics that  is

today directing economy, and so far a solution has

not  yet  been reached. I do hope that we  may  be

able  to  reach  a  solution of  viewing  our  two

economic  systems  on a single unit  basis  rather

than on a separate unit basis. I have not given up

hope, Sir, in this direction but, frankly, I would

be misleading this House if I said that I am over-optimistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Serangoon has pointed to the

right  direction  when  he  said  that  we  should

develop  our  fisheries to  a  greater  extent.  I

entirely  agree  with him, Sir. I have  given  the

problem  of fisheries development a great deal  of

thought in the last few months because, as  I  see

it, we are an island surrounded by waters from two

of  the greatest oceans of the world, and I  think

we  could look towards the sea to support us more.

However, the development of fisheries would take a

lot  of time. There is a schedule in the Estimates

which  shows a summary of expenditure incurred  by

the  Fisheries Department. This has been  steadily

expanding since 1946. In 1946 it started  with  an

expenditure of $37,000 only, going up  to  $41,000

in  1947, dropping to $14,000 in 1948 and  $37,000

in 1949, then going up again to $163,000 in 1950,

$143,000  in  1951, $268,000 in 1952, $311,000  in

1953,  and I believe it is $500,000 this year  and

more  next year. From these figures, Sir, you will

see   that  the  Fisheries  Department  has   been

expanding steadily. In the very little time that I

have  left to hold office as Minister for Commerce

and  Industry before the elections come along next

year,  I  will  do  whatever  I  can  to  set  the

Fisheries Department on the right course  so  that

it may be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



to  expand.  Sir, I will speak in more  detail  on

this   subject  when  we  come  to  the  Fisheries

Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,

stress by me always has been laid on commerce  and

industry  as the lifeblood of Singapore's  income.

Entrepot   trade  and  industry  come  under   the

Ministry of Commerce and Industry. "Industry" does

not  only  mean, as the Member for Cairnhill  said

yesterday,  produce. Produce is an important  item

of  entrepot trade and entails importing,  grading

and  re-exporting. Singapore has been  handling  a

lot  of  manufactured goods in importing  and  re-exporting.  Sir,  entreport trade means  middle men

handling  commodities between different countries;

in  other  words,  it  is a sort  of  transhipment

centre. An entrepot centre can only thrive if  its

handling  charges  are cheap, its  port  dues  are

competitive,  so  that other countries  will  send

their  goods;  or  the merchants in  the  entrepot

centre   import   goods  and  re-ship   to   other

countries. That is called entrepot trade. In other

words,  you have to compete, and the only  way  to

keep  our entrepot trade is to bring down the cost

of  living  and  keep  down expenditure.  How  can

entrepot  trade be preserved if expenditure  keeps

mounting  up? Naturally the wage-earner, in  order

to  exist, must demand wage increases. In the face

of  all  this, the entrepot trade will vanish.  So

the  only  way to meet the situation is  to  bring

down  expenditure bring down the cost  of  living,

and make the handling charges competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second point - industry and

manufacturing. We have no materials of our own. So

from what are we going to manufacture? We have  to

import everything from other countries in order to

manufacture our goods. Then again we have  to  pay

high labour charges. Sir, everyone knows that even

England  is unable to compete with countries  like

Germany  and  Japan. Anyone can find in  the  book

"Trade   Commission's  Report  of  1932/33"   that

Japanese  shirts were sold in the  London  market.

Then again, Sir, because we have no materials with

which  to manufacture goods, when our charges  are

so high, how can we compete with others?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



It  is  impossible to compete with countries which

can   mass-produce  goods  and  where  the  people

contribute  their  bit towards the  upliftment  of

their  own  country.  Even the shipping  companies

there  are subsidised by the Government. But  here

everyone  is  out to get the maximum  out  of  the

country for oneself and in such circumstances  you

cannot have thriving industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stress has been laid on the Federation and on the

politics of the Federation. At this stage when the

Federation is on the way to merdeka, I  would  not

like to touch on this subject. Our future is still

undecided  and there is a lot of time to  talk  on

that  topic.  Therefore, Sir,  if  the  future  of

Singapore    is    dark,   it   is    Government's

responsibility to do something about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,

there  are  only  two points to which  I  wish  to

reply.  Costs,  of course, have a bearing  on  the

entrepot trade, but the present situation is  such

that  some  countries do not give  due  regard  to

costs. They can buy goods cheaper in Singapore but

they refuse to do so. They prefer to buy them from

the  country  of origin, even though they  may  be

dearer,  because  of political considerations.  We

have had personal experience of that in talks with

other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Sir, that we have no raw materials of

our  own,  but England, although she  has  no  raw

materials  of  her  own, is  one  of  the  leading

manufacturing countries in the world. Sir,  if  we

can  get capital, if we have the know-how, and  if

we  have people with a will to work, I am sure  we

can  build up our industries. Even though we might

have  to face tariff barriers across the causeway,

we can still compete in other parts of the world.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, the Minister for

Commerce   and  Industry  has  not   answered   my

question, and that is, whether it is possible  now

development.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> My answer is that I also

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, although

the  money in this category is just slightly  over

$100,000,  the Minister for Commerce and  Industry

declared,  at  the  last Agricultural  Show,  that

through  agricultural  products  we  had  obtained

millions  of  dollars worth of  revenue  for  this

country. Despite the great success achieved by the

Agricultural  Show last September.  I  wonder  how

many  hon.  Members in this House  really  believe

that   our  agricultural  plans  have  made   much

improvement.  My  personal  experience  with   the

farmers  is to the contrary. At present  they  are

facing  a  most critical situation. Their poultry,

pigs and vegetables fetch very low prices. Feeding

stuffs  have to be purchased at a very high price.

Many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



Farmers  have  been making representations  to  me

saying that they cannot carry on with the state of

affairs  at  present. I would like  to  take  this

opportunity to request the Government to find  out

whether  the  livestock of  the  country  and  the

farmers' income are increasing or decreasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we have in this territory a certain

institution  established to study how  to  improve

our  agricultural activities or developments,  and

yet  I  know very little of how the Government  is

going  to utilise fully the research work done  by

this institution, directly or indirectly, for  the

benefit of the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish the Government would take

steps to impart the technical knowledge gained  to

the  farmers so that they can make full use of the

limited farmland at their disposal.



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr

Chairman, Sir, I have just discovered this morning

that  the  Agricultural units  are  giving  visual

demonstrations at the Yio Chu Kang  and  Sembawang

stations  in  the  use  of  cheap  fertilisers  or

chemical  fertilisers and local waste products.  I

just wonder why this has not been done in the case

of Lim Chu Kang Experimental Station? I think, Mr

Chairman, Sir, this matter of demonstration is not

generally known to the farmers and I suggest  that

action  should be taken to publicise this. I  have

in  mind  the Rural News which I hope can help  to

assimilate this information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing, Sir, is about the tracks and

roads leading to farmlands. They are generally  in

a  very  bad  state  of repair  and  this  is  not

something that can be dealt with lightly  as  this

is  an  urgent matter for it is a matter of profit

or loss to the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which is very important is that I

think  the  Government should make  loans  to  co-operative  societies so that they can  help  their

members  to  buy the necessary things like  tools,

implements,  apparatus and  all  other  things  as

advised by the department. Then only I think will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



they feel that they are not a neglected community.

Indeed,  Sir,  they  do  feel  that  they  are   a

neglected community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> That is why, Sir, the last

their  saviour. I have no quarrel with the figures

here,   Mr  Chairman.  I  only  hope   that   the

Government will do more for the farmers so that it

will raise their standard of living.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman. Sir, the time

is  very brief in my hands and I will just  answer

the  points. The Member for Changi (Mr  Lim  Cher

Kheng)  raised the point that the farmers were  in

difficulties  because  they  had  to  buy   dearer

feeding stuffs. Well, that matter is being  looked

after  now. If Members had read the newspapers  of

last  Monday,  they would have seen that,  at  the

opening  of the co-operative conference, I  made  a

statement  that the Government will be willing  to

support as much as possible the farmers and that I

will  consider  granting them loans provided  they

band    themselves   together   into   co-operative

societies. There has only been one approach  made,

Sir, to my Ministry for the granting of loans  and

we are trying to work that one out now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be glad to hear that I am personally

visiting as many kampongs as possible to interview

the farmers personally to talk to them about their

difficulties  and I hope that I will  be  able  to

grasp the facts more thoroughly than at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, the emphasis in Singapore is not

so  much on agriculture as on poultry-rearing  and

pig-breeding.  We  are  very  short  of  land  and

therefore we cannot have agriculture to a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



great extent. But what we want is that with the

small bits of land the farmers should be

encouraged to rear as much poultry as possible and

rear as many pigs as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $695,330 for Head 35 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in my speech on the

Second  Reading  of  the  Appropriation  Bill,   I

pointed  out that money must not only be spent  on

social  services but also for productive  purposes

to  provide  employment and increase  the  general

wealth of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, due to our lack of raw materials, we are

extremely  limited in the number of what  I  would

call indigenous industries. There seem to be three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



main  ones: that of agriculture which, of  course,

is extremely limited by area; there is the tourist

industry of which I have already spoken and  there

is  the fisheries industry. Fisheries seems to  me

to   have  the  greatest  potentialities  but  the

production  of  fish  is  not  nearly   equal   to

Singapore's requirements - about 40 per cent  if  I

am  not mistaken - and fish has to be imported  from

the  Federation  and from Indonesia  although  the

wide  seas are open to us as much as they are open

to  our  neighbours.  There  are  three  types  of

fishing  possible: the inshore fishing  round  our

own   coasts;  the  outshore  fishing  to  distant

waters, and pond-fishing both fresh water and  sea

water.  I  believe  I am correct  in  saying  that

inshore  fishing has been exploited to the fullest

extent and not much increase can be expected. But,

Sir,  much  more can be done and must be  done  to

fish in more distant waters with the use of larger

motor  vessels and more modern equipment.  Whether

private  industry can be encouraged to  invest  in

such ships and gear to a large enough extent, I am

not  competent  to  say, but  I  am  certain  that

private  enterprise will not come  forward  unless

better  fish  landing  facilities  and  a  central

wholesale  market are set up. I believe that  this

is a project that has been under consideration for

many  years  and  I would like to  know  from  the

Minister  why  it is being delayed?  If  the  only

reason is one of finance, then is it not the  case

of fisheries being regarded as a poor relation? My

own  view is that the Government may have to  show

the  by  building  their own powered  vessels  and

training  our  people to man them  and  getting  a

return  on  their investment through the increased

sales of fish in a central wholesale market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the third type of fishing, namely,

pond-fishing. The Economic Mission in their Report

made specific reference to the mangrove swamp area

of Singapore, stating as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There are about 900 acres of such ponds and a

potentially  available area  of  several  thousand

acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh Water and brackish water facilities and

operations,  particularly the ponds, are  capable

of very considerable expansion..."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if we turn to the 1955 Report of the

Ministry  of Commerce and Industry, page  185,  we

find the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the field of brackish water fisheries, two

experimental  prawn ponds were built  towards  the

end  of 1954 (that is before the coming in of  the

present Government) with a view to encouraging the

utilisation  of the extensive swamps of  Singapore

Island.  The  cost of building the  bunds,  sluice

gates  and huts was $12,840. ...During 1955 the total

catch  of fish, prawns and crabs amounted to 8,614

katties   and  realised  $8,194.  This  experiment

demonstrated  conclusively  that  a  small  family

would be able to operate such ponds on an economic

basis  provided  capital  was  available  for  the

building of bunds and gates."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to the question for Written Answer put to

the  Minister  on the catch so far  this  year,  I

received the reply that for the period January  to

October 1956, the total catch was 6,638 katis  and

the  sum realised therefrom was $7,802. The Answer

went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1955, the ponds were operated at the maximum

level  of  production in order to determine  basic

data.  It is not expected that the catch for  that

year  will be exceeded in 1956 because experiments

during the current year are being conducted on the

basis  of  fewer  operations with  the  object  of

reducing  labour  costs  and  obtaining   a   more

economical yield."



<br><br>Fair   enough,  but  the  figures  are  sufficient

confirmation  that  there are great  opportunities

for the development of this type of fishing and  I

have  no  doubt  that, through more  research,  it

should be possible to increase the yield of prawns

per  acre;  thus  increasing  the  return  to  the

fishermen  and,  at  the same time,  reducing  the

market price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is this: The Government has

established that a small family can operate  these

ponds  on an economic basis, provided the  capital

of  less than $6,500 per pond is advanced for  the

building of bunds and gates. Why delay one  moment

from  putting  this into action  so  that  we  can

provide  more  employment and  increase  our  fish

supplies?  I am sure that if the work was  put  in

hand on a large scale by the Government numbers of

families  would  come  forward  to  learn  how  to

operate the ponds and, if done on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



large  scale, the costs might even be reduced.  As

it  is,  the  number of fishermen engaged  in  the

prawn  pond industry dropped from 182 in  1954  to

165 in 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, from an examination of the Estimates, I

charge  the  Government with  giving  insufficient

thought  and money to an important and  productive

industry  which  is urgently needing  development.

The Minister, a few days ago, talked vaguely about

a  phased programme covering some years.  What  we

want  to  know is, what is the programme for  1957

and  is it adequate? Perhaps, Sir, the trouble  is

due to the inadequacy of the Research Station, for

I  am not convinced that the money being spent  on

this Research Station is at present justified. You

will notice from the Estimates that the amount  is

being   increased  this  year  from  $148,000   to

$253,750 of which $217,500 is to be paid  by  this

Government.  Even the Minister in  his  speech  on

Monday implied that it was working on a long  term

basis and that he was going to change it. What  we

want  is not pure research but practical research;

not  more  books  and articles on fish,  but  more

fish.  Is  this not the policy of the  Government?

Will  the  Minister  tell us  what  this  Research

Station  has contributed to this practical problem

so far to justify the money we are spending on it,

why he is dissatisfied with the present policy and

what changes he proposes to make and as this is  a

pan-Malayan enterprise, would he state whether the

other  Governments involved are also  dissatisfied

and if they are in agreement in making a change?



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Briefly, Mr Chairman, Sir, there is

one  aspect of this prawn-ponding and fish-ponding

which  my  Ministry has had to take note  of.  We

have  had our Chief Drainage Engineer dealing with

the flooding problems of Singapore and one part of

the  cause  of  flooding in  some  places  is  the

building  of dams or bunds either in a  valley  or

perhaps  in an estuary or in the swamp  lands  for

the purpose of impounding water and creating fish-ponds, either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



fresh  or  salt. We therefore have been consulting

with  both the Ministry of Lands and the  Ministry

of  Commerce  and Industry on the  possibility  of

more  economic layouts for fish-ponds through  the

use  of  planned heavy earth-moving equipment  and

that  kind of thing so as to get the whole estuary

planned first and then I presume that it would  be

possible  to sublet it so that individual families

or,  if you like, companies - however it works  out

best - could  operate  the  ponds  once  they   were

prepared.  I  think that there would  probably  be

benefits though I have not yet got a report on the

details of all the possibilities. It will be worth

considering in due course as to whether  it  would

not  be  better  to do the whole construction  job

first  on a large scale and then to sublet  rather

than  to hand out small sums of capital to  people

who can not easily control, and may contribute to,

flooding by putting a dam in the wrong place;  or,

of course, their dam may break and they lose their

fish.



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am sure

that both sides of the House must be grateful  for

the  clear picture painted to us about our fishing

industry by the Member for Tanglin. He has made it

very  clear  that the fishing industry is  divided

into  three  categories:  inshore,  deep-sea   and

rearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will touch on inshore fishing which is not

only  very  little developed but I would  like  to

add, from my personal experience of the fishing at

Padang  Terbakar and Mata Ikan, that  the  inshore

fishing industry is slowly dying. Although we  see

many kelongs along our sea coast, the catches  are

so poor that the proprietors running them are near

to bankruptcy. I am sure the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry  knows  about  this  better  than  I

myself. The identity cards of these fishermen show

that their occupation is fishing, but actually you

can  term  them as being unemployed. The fishermen

who  stay  in  the so-called fishing villages  who

rely on inshore fishing are practically unemployed

because their income is so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



low - about $100 a month - and they have big  families

to   support.  Therefore  I  wish  to  take   this

opportunity to urge the Government to  take  stock

of  the serious situation facing us. I would  like

to  ask  a  question: since we  proclaim  that  we

believe in Socialism, then I think it is high time

for   us   to   encourage   the   development   of

co-operatives.    The    Co-operative    Development

Department  in the past has merely  served  in  an

advisory  capacity. If the Government  believe  in

Socialism,  they  should take an  active  part  to

encourage  more  co-operative societies  especially

among  the fishing villages which would  cut  down

the   middlemen's   chances  of   exploiting   the

fishermen's  hard-earned money and,  at  the  same

time, the Government can render direct aid by  way

of  imparting technical knowledge to the fishermen

so  that the inshore fishing industry can be saved

in  time.  Deep-sea fishing should also  be  fully

encouraged. We should not wait for the  report  of

the  research in the fishery industry. We must  do

something about it at once. It is a shame that  an

island like Singapore can only, as the Member  for

Tanglin  said,  supply 40  per  cent  of  its  own

consumption  of  fish, the balance  having  to  be

imported from our neighbours.



<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, arising out

of the complaint of the last hon. speaker that the

catch  of  the  inshore fishing is dwindling  very

rapidly,  may  I  enquire from  the  Minister  for

Commerce  and Industry whether he would  consider,

by legislation, to control the size of the mesh of

nets  used  for catching fish round the shores  of

Singapore? I have often seen pukat boats with  the

men  pulling in the nets and the mesh is  so  fine

that  not even the smallest spawn has a chance  to

escape. Naturally, such a procedure which goes  on

year  after year is bound to affect the  catch  of

the  fish  in  the inshore waters. I think  nearly

every  country  in Europe has a law ensuring  that

the  size of the mesh of nets should not  be  less

than an inch or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



something  to that effect and, possibly,  if  this

measure  were  taken  in  time,  the  catch  might

improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to congratulate the Minister

for  Communications and Works on the plan  of  the

Public  Works Department to proceed as rapidly  as

possible  to  build bunds so that not  only  would

they  help the flow of flood waters but also  they

would  be  used  for  making ponds  for  fish  and

prawns.   That,   I  think,  is  a   very   useful

suggestion.  Not only will it save money  for  the

people  who wish to rear prawns but it  will  also

help in the economy of Singapore.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am

particularly attracted by the idea of the Minister

for  Communications  and Works  wanting  to  build

prawn  ponds for these fishermen. This is  a  very

novel  idea. It will help them a great  deal,  but

one point arises: if we are going to encourage the

prawn pond industry, two departments will have  to

decide on it, that is, the Fisheries Department as

well  as the Land Office. Land must be granted  by

the Land Office and then sanctioned for fishing by

the  Fisheries Department. As far  as  I  know,  a

great  deal  of our marshland is still  not  being

made  use of, and most of such land is being given

under   Temporary  Occupation  Licences  or  other

licences for the purpose of agriculture. When  the

marshland is brackish in nature, very little  will

grow there except mangroves, and I think that  the

department  concerned should  reconsider  granting

such land for purposes of fishing as this has been

considered  as most important by so many  Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of flooding of land by these prawn

ponds, I think that there is some confusion there,

because  once fresh water comes into  these  prawn

ponds,  they  will  not be very productive.  Prawn

pond  owners usually want to preserve their  bunds

from being destroyed by torrents of water, and let

out water even before the rains come so that there

is not much danger of blocking up of drainage. The

most  important thing, Sir, is that  in  order  to

encourage fishing, the fishermen must be  able  to

realise a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



decent income, and in order to do  so, they should

be  able to market their fish easily. We now  come

to  the  question  of a central  market  which  is

really  overdue.  I  remember that  I  asked  that

question of the Minister for Commerce and Industry

some time ago in a debate in this House, and since

time  is getting short, I will not repeat  it.  If

the Minister would refer to what I have spoken and

act  on it, I think it will be very beneficial  to

the  people here. At that stage, I mentioned  also

about  deep-sea  fishing and I  consider  that  if

people  are  willing to invest money  in  deep-sea

fishing  on  their own without any charge  to  the

Government  and  seeing that the only  thing  that

deep-sea fishing will ever do is to bring in  more

fish,  I  see  no  reason  for  limiting  such  an

industry.  If there is a greater supply  of  fish,

then  it  will  give  rise  to  another  industry,

probably that of fish-canning.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on the

question  of  why  was the wholesale  fish  market

delayed,  I  explained at the Assembly sitting  in

September  that we had difficulties  to  find  the

proper   site  for  it.  In  fact,  we  had   five

successive  sites  and each  of  them  was  either

wanted  by  the Army or the Navy or someone  else.

The  last  site was at the side of Merdeka  Bridge

but  it was found that the land there was too soft

and  required  heavy piling with a great  deal  of

unnecessary cost. We have now discovered a site at

the end of the old Kallang airport runway. We have

not  acquired the site yet but we are working  out

figures  to  find out how much it will  cost.  The

jetty alone might cost over a million dollars  and

probably the whole market might cost in the region

of $4 million as far as I know but, of course, the

figures are still being worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which was raised was: why do we

not build our own powered vessels and train people

for  offshore fishing? The offshore fishing,  Sir,

in  the southern portion of the China Sea is  very

poor and you will not get much fish there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of encouragement of co-operatives

amongst the fishermen, Members will have read that

the  Government  gave  a loan  of  $4,000  to  the

Ponggol Co-operative Society of Fishermen and  that

seems to be a great success. I have said that that

was  a pilot scheme. Basing on the results of that

scheme, Government will consider further grants of

necessary loans to other fishing villages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of controlling the size of mesh of

the  nets,  I will have to consult with  my  Chief

Fisheries  Officer  because that  is  a  technical

thing  that  I  do  not know much  about.  I  must

confess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the fish ponds, the question was: why

do  we  not increase the number of fish ponds?  We

are   now,  Sir,  working  on  it  and,  in  fact,

experiments  are proceeding but they are  not  yet

finished.  There has been objection from fishermen

in  Johore Straits who have been affected  by  the

curfew  and they are not keen to let any ponds  be

opened  up in their areas because their livelihood

has  been  limited due to the curfew. We  are  now

working  with  the  Chief  Drainage  Engineer   to

utilise all the swamp land on a co-operative basis.

There  is  not  much  of swamp land.  The  present

haphazard  development  has  caused  flooding  and

therefore we have to have the co-operation  of  the

Public Works Department on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to the Fisheries Research

Station.  At  one  time, I myself considered  that

this  was  a  white elephant and I still  consider

that,  on the basis on which it is run, it is  not

going  to  be  of  much use  to  us.  The  present

arrangement  is that the Colonial Development  and

Welfare  Fund met the total capital  cost  and  is

meeting  50 per cent of the recurrent expenditure.

The  rest  of  the 50 per cent is  shared  by  the

Federation, Singapore, Sarawak, North  Borneo  and

Brunei. The Federation has now indicated that they

are  not  interested  in  keeping  up  with  their

contribution  and therefore it is  a  question  of

whether  we are to close down the Research Station

entirely  or whether we have to shoulder  more  of

the contributions ourselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



My  own intention is that we should carry on  with

the Research Station because we are still not sure

whether  it will not, in the end, prove beneficial

to us and since so much money has been spent on it

and  work is half done; but we should carry it  on

on  a  different basis. At present,  the  Research

Station  is directing its attention to fundamental

research and that is long-term research.  It  goes

into   detailed   studies  of   hydrological   and

biological conditions influencing the breeding  of

fish and the habits of fish, and so on. We have  a

vessel  Manihine of 213 tons. We  are  at  present

discussing with the various Governments  concerned

and  the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund  on

the change that we desire in this Station. My idea

is  that  we should direct the activities of  this

Station  to obtaining more tangible and  immediate

results.  There has, of course to be a  change  in

the  ratio of contributions because the Federation

is  withdrawing from it and it is possible that we

may  have to bear a greater part than what we have

been paying now and I hope that if that comes  up,

hon.  Members on the Opposition will give me their

support.   It  is  proposed  that  the   Fisheries

Division  should  take over the administration  of

this Station. Those are my new proposals which are

still  being  worked out: some of  the  expatriate

scientists should be replaced by U.N.O. or Colombo

Plan or local scientists and staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the question of fisheries

generally,  we have 5,500 fishermen  in  Singapore

out of whom 4,500 are inshore fishermen and out of

the  remaining  1,000  only  600  are  working  in

offshore   units.  They  are  very  reluctant   to

undertake   training  in  navigating   ocean-going

fishing   vessels.  Most  of  our  fishermen   are

reluctant  to go into offshore fishing because  of

the  long  delays  away  from  home.  That  is   a

difficulty  that we have got to persuade  them  to

overcome.  But  the  position  regarding  fish  is

generally  that the inshore fishing  grounds  have

been  fished to the limit. The offshore  areas  in

the  south portion of the South China Sea are  not

sufficiently rich for economic operation. We  have

therefore to meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



increased  demands by imports but we have  got  to

see  that our imports are not of such size  as  to

upset the livelihood of these 4,500 fishermen  who

are  depending for their livelihood on the inshore

fishing because otherwise we will create a  social

problem.  That is why we have got to  balance  the

two:  the  imports against the reduction in  price

which  may be due to imports and which may  affect

the  livelihood of these fishermen. Otherwise what

will  happen  is  that we will have  to  subsidise

these fishermen and that will be a strain again on

the Colony's finances. But I am trying now to work

out  a  scheme  in which it might be  possible  to

subsidise   these  inshore  fishermen   from   the

industry  itself. As I said earlier this  morning,

the  Fisheries Department is working now on a plan

to expand the fishing industry and we hope that we

will  not  only be able to concentrate on offshore

fishing  but also on deep-sea or oceanic  fishing.

If we can succeed in this, then we can hope to get

secondary  fishing industries in the  Colony  too.

The  advantages,  of  course,  will  not  only  be

secondary industries but it will also mean that we

will  be  able to expand our exports of salt-fish.

If  we can go for whale-fishing, we might be  able

to  manufacture  whale oil and blachan  and  other

sorts of salt-fish.

<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, yesterday I said that

broadcasting should be scrapped. What I meant  was

that  it  be turned into a corporation and  I  say

again  that the Broadcasting Department should  be

entirely  scrapped  now and  immediately  in  that

sense.  It  is  the  same with the  Department  of

Supplies.  This  Department  is  a  drain  on  the

finances  of the Colony. It has outlived  its  own

usefulness. The staff can be absorbed  into  other

departments. I understand that this Department  is

kept simply for the stockpiling of rice. Formerly,

it  included sugar and flour too. This  Department

was very essential after the British re-occupation

of  this  Colony,  that is,  1945  to  1947,  when

supplies were short. Various countries were buying

on  a  percentage basis from the  few  sources  of

supply.  Today,  the position is quite  different,

Sir. It has been very different since the last two

to  three  years. Sugar has been decontrolled  and

only  rice is controlled. I hope to move a  motion

for  the decontrol of rice at the next sitting  of

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only argument in favour has been - and I

think  possibly  so  now - that this  stockpile  is

maintained for the purpose of emergency. Well,  it

has  been  ten years since the last war ended.  We

have  a lot of competition from the rice-producing

countries to sell their rice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



to  us - Siam  and Burma: we will forget  the  extra

that we import from Communist China. Now, what  is

this  question of emergency? Is it a  shortage  of

supply?  That  is  not  so. There  are  plenty  of

supplies available. There is competition to  sell.

The only other emergency that may arise is war. If

war  is expected in this area, I do not know  from

whom  and by whom. For many, many years, I do  not

think that there will be a war in this part of the

world. Certainly not! Who is going to attack?  Our

neighbours are peace-loving countries and  besides

we  have  the  influence  of  the  United  Nations

Organisation. So it is useless that on mere  fear,

you  should maintain this Department. It  will  he

surprising  from figures given to  know  how  much

money has been lost on this stockpile, wastage  of

rice,  etc.  Of  course, that will be  a  question

which I will be asking at the next sitting of this

Assembly:  how much money the Colony has  lost  in

the   trading   of  rice  alone,   excluding   the

maintenance of this Department? In addition,  Sir,

this  is  stopping the free movement of trade.  We

have  heard  a  lot of complaints  from  the  rice

dealers'  associations. Of course,  I  will  bring

this  up  in  a  motion later in the coming  month

after  getting some answers to my queries which  I

will  be  putting up very soon. I ask this further

question: is it necessary now to maintain  another

"white elephant" and our revenues drained away  in

salaries, emoluments, and so on?



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, on the question of

maintaining this Department, may I refer the  hon.

Member  to  page 19 of the Estimates? There  is  a

note at the bottom which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(iv) The cost of the Supplies Department is

borne  on  the  Colony's Estimates and  Government

advances the capital required for the purchase  of

on   this   capital,  the  cost  of  the  Supplies

Department  and part of the cost of staff  of  the

Department  of Commerce and Industry  which  deals

with Supplies Department matters."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the stockpile, I am

that we have got to take to maintain supplies  for

the Colony in case of an emergency.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to raise one

matter  under this Head. On the Land Office  falls

the brunt of the work connected with resettlement,

development, and eviction from land which  is  the

inevitable story of our expanding Singapore.  Now,

this  movement is going on the whole time  and  it

entails  a great deal of hardship and anxiety  for

our  rural  and farmer population. I believe  that

much  of  this  anxiety could be reduced  if  more

foresight   and  understanding  of  the   people's

difficulties  were exercised. I have  come  across

numerous  instances where the  rural  people  have

become,  so to speak, the victims of this or  that

development,  and  they have  been  put  to  great

straits because they have not been told what their

future is, whether they can stay put, whether they

are to move, whether they are to get compensation,

and  so  on. I have brought cases to the attention

of  the  Minister in the past. Another recent  one

the Hon. the Chief Secretary knows about which has

caused great difficulty and embarrassment and  two

more  cases,  where  a lack of  consideration  was

shown, were brought to me only last week, which  I

will pass on to the Minister to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it should be Government policy,

whatever  Party is in power, in this very delicate

matter  of moving and resettling families, to  see

that the approach is a humane approach, if the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



support  of the rural population is to be won.  It

has   also  to  be  a  swift  approach,  so   that

unscrupulous people have no time to  jump  in  and

exploit the situation. I discovered only the other

day   that  a  certain  association,  run  by  the

People's   Action  Party,  which  has   now   been

dissolved, was measuring the assets of a group  of

farmers due to be resettled and telling them  that

the areas of their houses, sheds and outhouses  on

which  they would receive compensation were double

what they really were. I do not wish to impugn the

Land Office unduly in this whole matter. Theirs is

a  difficult and heavy task and their officers are

only  carrying out instructions. But I  would  ask

the  Minister to see what can be done, in  advance

of the development plan, to ensure that the people

know  what is going on and what is going to happen

to them? Government departments tend to be inhuman

and soulless; sometimes perhaps they have to be if

they  are  to  be  impartial but  if  the  Chinese

speaking  rural population is to be  won  over  to

feel that they belong to Singapore, much more  has

got to be done to appreciate their difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, the question of evictions and resettlement of

squatters in Singapore is a very huge problem  and

I  am sure that hon. Members of this Assembly will

realise  that  it  is a problem  which  cannot  be

easily   overcome.  When  we  first  took  office,

resettlement  and  evictions  in  the  island   of

Singapore  were  done haphazardly;  there  was  no

proper  system, although I must say that officials

of the Land Office tried to do their best in order

to  see  that the resettlement and evictions  were

carried  out  according to the law. But  since  we

came  into  office, particularly since  late  last

year,  as  Members will probably  be  aware,  too,

Government  has appointed a working  party  to  go

into  this  whole question of land  clearance  and

resettlement  and,  as  a  result  of  the  report

submitted   by  this  particular  working   party,

Government has adopted the recommendations of this

party  in  forming the authority called  the  Land

Clearance and Resettlement Authority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in this Report too, Sir, recommendations

have  been made with regard to compensation  which

should  be paid to squatters and you will  see  in

this  Report that compensation is even being  paid

for  fish-ponds, banana trees, coconut trees, pig-sties,  and so on. It is possible that during  the

course of their work by the officials of the  Land

Office, occasions may arise where it is almost  an

impossibility to measure a particular  pond  right

up  to  a particular square inch. I do admit  that

these  anomalies will arise but then  I  must  say

that  the officials of the Land Office are  really

devoted to this kind of work. As from the  1st  of

January   next  year,  this  Land  Clearance   and

Resettlement   Authority  is   being   transferred

temporarily to the Singapore Improvement Trust  to

be  a  body  which will work in close  co-operation

with  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  because,

firstly,  it has been recommended by this  working

party and, secondly, on questions of evictions and

resettlement    in   Singapore,   the    Singapore

Improvement Trust is mostly concerned because they

are  the  people who would require  more  land  in

Singapore for the building of houses in Singapore.

I  said  temporarily, Sir, because as you probably

know,  we are now in the process of forming a  new

Housing  Authority which will eventually eliminate

the  Singapore Improvement Trust as an  agent  for

Government in the building of houses in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in view of what I

have  said  and other Members have  said  in  this

House  regarding the need to expand our  education

system,  it  would,  I  think,  be  difficult   to

criticise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



general  line  of the Government's  programme  for

1957  and I do not propose to deal with this today.

Further, I do not think that it will be helpful to

refer  to the problems of Chinese schools at  this

juncture except to express admiration for the  way

in which the Minister is tackling a most difficult

problem  with  firmness and, I  hope,  ultimately,

with success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to initiate a debate on another

aspect of education which, at the moment, seems to

be receiving inadequate consideration, namely, the

encouragement  of games and the  use  of  playing-fields  in our schools. That the Government wishes

to  see  the younger generation playing  games  is

evident  from the support that they have given  to

the  Youth Sports Centre but is enough being  done

in our schools? It perturbs me considerably to see

so  many  Government  school playing-fields  lying

vacant and unused in the evenings. I believe  that

if  one  were  to make a survey of the  number  of

games  being  played on Saturdays and  Sundays  on

school  playing-fields throughout the  island,  it

would  be very small. The schools are shut and  so

the  fields must be too, seems to be the argument.

I  submit, Sir, that this is absolutely wrong.  If

every playing-field in Singapore is fully occupied

every  evening in the week, so far as weather  and

ground conditions allow, by our young people, this

country  will be a healthier place in every  sense

of  that  word.  I know it will be said  that  the

students  live long distances from their  schools,

that  they go home in the middle of the  day,  and

the  expense of transport to and fro is  involved,

but  young  people are going to the  Youth  Sports

Centre in hundreds. When you are young and you are

keen enough, you will cycle miles to get a game. I

know  I  did.  I  will go further, Sir.  A  school

playing-field should not necessarily  be  reserved

for the use of the students of that school. If the

students  do not wish to utilise it every  day  of

the  week, let the old boys of the school  have  a

chance.  If  they do not want it,  let  youngsters

living  in  the vicinity get a game or  the  local

boys'  club. I know that this sort of thing  needs

organisation and enthusiasm, but it  is  not  more

than  a corollary of what we have all endorsed  in

the Youth Sports Centre. Difficulties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



exist but they could be overcome and should be.  I

hope that the Government will see what can be done

to  get  the fullest use out of the limited number

of  playing-fields  at our disposal.  I  hope  the

prejudice and red tape regarding their use will be

swept  to  one  side. If more of our young  people

played  more games on more days of the  week  than

they  do  now, we would be building up  a  better,

fitter  and  healthier generation to supplant  the

paunch, under-exercised old gentlemen who  sit  in

this Assembly.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I support

what  the  Member for Tanglin said about  playing-fields  being allowed to be used, if  not  by  the

school  boys or the old boys, by boys who are  not

in schools, especially boys' clubs. I have noticed

quite  a  few playing-fields not used on  Sundays.

Government   could  make  arrangements   that   on

Sundays, playing-fields of schools which  are  not

used should be made available for boys' clubs.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I would like to add my voice in

support of this, Mr Chairman. The school of which

in happier days I was lucky enough to be a member,

and to which I hope to return some time, did allow

and had always, as a matter of policy, allowed its

fields  to  be used by anybody around  that  area,

provided, of course, if the school team  turns  up

to  play, then others have to get out of the  way.

We  had hoped to get boys' clubs organised in  the

area  but  then I was swept away into a  different

sphere  of  activity.  They are  still  frequently

using  it,  though it does mean that  occasionally

gangsters  get on as well. We had a boy jumped  on

by  a party of gangsters. He had done something to

annoy  them and so they whistled up the  gang  and

they jumped on him. They knocked the breath out of

his  body  but  they  ran  away  as  soon  as  the

authorities  appeared on the scene. Otherwise,  no

difficulty has occurred as far as I know.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. It

seems  to  be  a question of more games  and  less

gangsters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, as regards

playing-fields, I wish to inform  the  House  that

already  we  have  a committee looking  into  this

question.  Our  instructors on physical  education

have conducted a survey but due to the end of  the

year,  they  have to conduct examinations  and  do

some  other work and that survey has been  dropped

temporarily.  I endorse the opinions expressed  by

the  Member for Tanglin and the hon. Mr R. C.  H.

Lim about making use of playing-fields on Sundays.

I  have, in fact, invited many schools, especially

Chinese schools without playing-fields, to let  me

or  my officials know the number of days in a week

they  would like to make use of our playing-fields

and I have extended many invitations of such kind.

I  am glad to say that some schools did come to us

and we have given them time in our playing-fields.

In addition to this, I would also like to say that

Government  is  making a survey  of  other  public

fields  where  we can convert them  into  playing-fields not only for school boys but also for young

children  and  youths working in conjunction  with

the Youth Sports Centre and other youth clubs.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I should

like  to  recommend very strongly an investigation

into  those  Chinese  schools  not  having  enough

playing-fields. Playing-fields for youths are most

essential. Youths have so much energy and  if  the

energy  could be discharged on playing-fields,  we

shall, to some extent, solve some of our problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $31,522,760 for Head 49 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, on page 227 of the

Estimates, we see three appointments two of  which

are  for  Assistant Director of  Medical  Services

(Hospitals)  and  Assistant  Director  of  Medical

Services   (Health)  and  we  also   see   a   new

appointment of Assistant Director of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



Medical Services (Tuberculosis). Now the Assistant

Director  for Hospitals covers the Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital and the Assistant Director for Health can

cover the prevention side of tuberculosis. Why  is

it necessary then to have a new third appointment?

It  seems  to  us  that this is top-heavy  in  the

administration of "Medical and Health".  While  we

like  to  see more doctors and more hospitals,  we

think  that  their duties should  be  confined  to

medical work itself instead of administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also another appointment on page 247, a

new  appointment of Medical Superintendent,  Grade

E. Now if the Assistant Director for Hospitals has

a  Medical Superintendent (General Hospital) under

him,  then he should have plenty of time  to  look

after  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital and T.B. Clinic.

In  other  words,  there may  be  an  argument  to

support  one  new appointment but not two.  Again,

the  Ministry appears to be setting up a whole new

department called "Tuberculosis Control  Unit"  at

page 235 of the Estimates which shows a whole  new

list  of appointments. Not only is there to  be  a

new  Registrar under this Head, item 1  (106)   but

two  new Senior Registrars are required under "Tan

Tock  Seng Hospital and T.B. Clinic" which appears

in  item 68 (140) . Why is it necessary to have all

these Registrars and other new appointments partly

under  Tuberculosis Control Unit and partly  under

Tan Tock Seng Hospital and T.B. Clinic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ministry has in mind a new policy in

connection  with tuberculosis, then  the  Minister

should give the House full details of it so as  to

justify  this extra expenditure. Again finally,  I

would   like   to  ask  whether  all   these   new

appointments  will  be filled  through  promotions

and,  if  so,  whether  they  will  be  filled  by

Malayans?



<br><br>4.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think there has

been  some confusion of thought by the Member  for

Paya  Lebar  because, if I heard him  rightly,  he

said  that  the  Medical  Superintendent  of   the

General  Hospital  (when he was referring  to  the

page on the General Hospital) could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



look  after the Tan Tock Seng Hospital as well  as

do  the  administrative work. I was quite prepared

to   answer  the  motions  which  were  originally

intended  to be put before the House individually,

but  the  hon.  Member  has now  coupled  all  his

amendments  together.  I therefore  think  that  I

might explain to the House the reasons for the new

appointments  and  the  new  Tuberculosis  Control

Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, the Chief Medical Officer has been

combining  the  duties  of Medical  Superintendent

(General   Hospital)  with  those  of  the   Chief

Administrative Medical Officer for  all  hospitals

and   out-patients  services  in  Singapore.   The

expansion  of  this service has been considerable,

fantastically so, over the last few  years  and  I

will,  in  a moment, illustrate that by  giving  a

short table of the overall increases in our 4 main

Hospitals from 1938. In 1938, the in-patients were

25,913  and the out-patients were 87,447.  I  will

skip  over a few years because each year shows  us

an increase. In 1951, the in-patients increased to

40,833  and the out-patients increased to 612,095.

In  1952,  that went up to 48,550 in-patients  and

726,310  out-patients. In 1954, it  jumped  up  to

58,859 in-patients and 1,169,689 out-patients  and

in   1955  it  rose  to  62,024  in-patients   and

1,271,165 out-patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, since the beginning of 1955, 522 hospital

beds  had been added to existing institutions  and

the  buildings now under construction will produce

another 672 beds before the end of 1956: that  is,

by  that time, there will be 1,194 hospital  beds.

Besides   that,  there  are  three   new   outdoor

dispensaries  which have also been  added  to  the

hospitals and during the coming year, a start will

be  made  on a new 500-bed acute general  hospital

and  on  a  chronic hospital for 200 beds.  It  is

hoped   also  to  establish  two  new  out-patient

clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If administration and supervision is to be

efficient,   a  post  for  another  administrative

medical officer must be created. The Chief Medical

Officer's  post  is  now to be  renamed  Assistant

Director of Medical Services (Hospitals)  and  his

office  will  be  transferred to the  Ministry  of

Health. Now the newly created post,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



that   of   the  Medical  Superintendent  (General

Hospital)  is to administer a hospital at  present

of 1,005 beds which will shortly increase to 1,250

beds.  So there is a need for a full-time  Medical

Superintendent  for  that hospital  alone  and  to

illustrate the necessity, I will give the table of

the  General  Hospital. In 1947,  the  in-patients

were 15,021 and the out-patients were 160,388.  In

1952,  that  increased to 23,421  in-patients  and

358,769  out-patients. That went up  fantastically

until  1955  when the in-patients were 28,222  and

the  out-patients were 691,064. As I  have  pointed

out,  it  is absolutely necessary to have a  full-time officer as the Medical Superintendent of  the

General  Hospital  and  an Assistant  Director  of

Medical  Services  in respect of co-ordinating  all

the  hospitals. He will now be transferred to  the

offices of the Ministry of Health. I would like to

inform  hon.  Members  that  a  local  officer  is

available for consideration for promotion  to  the

post of Medical Superintendent (General Hospital),

Grade  E  and I have no doubts in my mind that  he

will be so accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on tuberculosis, I will answer the query

raised  by the hon. Member on the Grade E post  at

page 227. That tuberculosis is a serious menace in

Singapore  is  well  known.  This  appointment  of

Assistant    Director    of    Medical    Services

(Tuberculosis)  appearing at page  227  is  a  new

appointment. For some years, an effective  control

organisation  has  been  under  consideration.  In

1954,  a  request was made for expert advice  from

Australia and in May 1955, after I assumed office,

Sir  Harry Wunderly, the Director of the  Division

of  Tuberculosis  of  the Australian  Commonwealth

Department of Health came to Singapore  to  assess

the  problem.  After  a  preliminary  survey,   he

recommended  that  we  should  set  up  a  control

organisation  to trace, register  and  keep  under

surveillance  all proved cases of tuberculosis  so

that  we  can ensure that all these patients  will

continue  under  treatment until  the  disease  is

arrested. Secondly, he advised that once such an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



organisation  was established, it would  be  worth

while  commencing  a  short-term  intensive  case-finding survey with the help of Australian experts

and  that  after  they  had withdrawn,  we  should

maintain   the   organisation   and   case-finding

programme  to the greatest extent possible  within

our    own    resources.    I    referred    these

recommendations  to the Medical  Advisory  Council

and after their approval, this was accepted by the

Council  of Ministers. Government has now  decided

that as we have now sufficient beds, it is time to

start  the campaign with the unit set out at  page

235,  that  is, the unit to which the  Member  for

Paya   Lebar   referred.  It  is  now   considered

necessary  to  have  an  experienced  officer   to

organise this campaign and to co-ordinate  all  the

anti-tuberculosis work in Singapore so that we can

ensure  that  infective cases of tuberculosis  are

properly  provided for and looked after either  by

Government services or by S.A.T.A. (who will  work

in  co-operation with Government)  or  by  private

practitioners. Here again I would like  to  inform

hon.   Members  of  this  House  that  a   locally

domiciled  officer,  a very  experienced  man,  is

available for this important post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might also be of interest to hon. Members to

know  that Government gave S.A.T.A. a hundred  per

cent  capital grant to build a hospital  home  for

chronic  infectious cases. The Government believes

that,  in  co-operation  with  S.A.T.A. and  with

general   practitioners,  an  effective   campaign

against  tuberculosis can be successfully launched

by this proposed organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now the post of Registrar which the hon.

Member  also  referred to. This  officer  will  be

responsible  for maintaining a highly confidential

register  of known cases of tuberculosis  and  for

liaison with private practitioners and S.A.T.A. to

ensure  that such patients are maintaining regular

treatments. This is a highly confidential post and

the  person holding it must be able to  deal  with

private   practitioners  and  voluntary   agencies

amicably   and  helpfully.  A  man  of  integrity,

personality and experience is essential. It is not

merely a clerical post. It is important to have  a

complete record of all known cases of

tuberculosis and I am sure that hon. Members of

the House will appreciate that that record is

highly confidential.
