part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir, I am ready to answer  the  request

made  by  the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon

Teck) in his motion yesterday. He intimated to  me

after  the adjournment that he would like a little

more  information  about the  tuberculosis  scheme

which  we intend to carry out in our Ministry.  It

is  intended  that all known cases of tuberculosis

be  followed up so that we can be sure  that  they

are  obtaining  adequate treatment either  as  in-patients  or as out-patients. As soon as  such  an

organisation which I explained yesterday has  been

established,  then it is worth while  intensifying

in   Singapore   our   case  findings.   Effective

tuberculosis control is likely to be an  expensive

undertaking,  and  for  this  reason  it  is  most

important  that  we should have a clearly  defined

estimate of the extent of the problem which  faces

us,  and this is where Australian assistance comes

in.  We  have  asked for a team  of  experts  with

equipment   for  mass  miniature  radiography   to

undertake  a  short-term  survey  to  cover  about

50,000  persons.  Subject to further  consultation

with  the  Australian experts, it is  proposed  to

select three sample areas in Singapore - two in  the

city area and one in the rural area. Such a survey

of  complete  groups to a total of 50,000  persons

will take at least six months and the results will

give  us a very much clearer knowledge of the real

incidence  of tuberculosis in a densely  populated

and   less  densely  populated  area.  When   this

intensive  survey is over, the Australian  experts

will  withdraw,  leaving their equipment  for  our

future use. Thereafter we shall continue with  the

case-finding  programme,  inevitably  at  a   much

slower pace but as quickly as available staff  and

funds  will  permit.  There  is  no  intention  to

nationalise  tuberculosis. We  shall  welcome  and

need all the help we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



can   get   from   S.A.T.A. and   from   private

practitioners,  and  there  is  no  intention   to

dictate or interfere with treatment being given by

non-government  practitioners.  We  wish  only  to

ensure  that if a person has tuberculosis,  he  is

given  treatment  and to ensure  also,  if  he  is

infective,   that   the  public   are   adequately

safeguarded from his spreading the infection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that a study group on

tuberculosis control sponsored by the World Health

Organisation met at the end of November 1955.  The

technical  report of their findings has just  been

published.  In  that study group were  represented

experts  from  ten countries, and in their  report

they  stated,  inter alia, that "The establishment

in each country of a Central Tuberculosis Register

covering notified and re-notified cases will be of

great  value for the study of the epidemiology  of

the   disease."   and  that  "Complete   pulmonary

examinations  of  sample groups are  necessary  to

obtain  a   reliable index for the  prevalence  of

tuberculosis." It is also interesting to note that

their  recommendations  represent,  in  fact,  the

programme   which  we  have  now   formulated   in

Singapore.  I think, Mr Chairman, I have  covered

all  the  points which the Member for  Paya  Lebar

wishes to know.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Chairman, Sir, I look at page 227, sub-head 1  (4)

and I see there the post of Assistant Director  of

Medical  Services. Previously this title  was  the

Chief  Medical Officer, General Hospital. The  job

is still the same, that is, that the Chief Medical

Officer  of the General Hospital looks  after  all

the  hospitals  in Singapore. Sir, the  Government

has   created   a   new   post   called   "Medical

Superintendent". You can see this at page 247, sub-head  68 (1) . What is the idea of having this  new

appointment,  Sir,  when the  work  of  the  Chief

Medical  Officer,  General Hospital,  is  to  look

after  all the hospitals in Singapore?  I  see  no

reason    why   there   should   be   a    Medical

Superintendent to take over part of the duties  of

the   former   Chief   Medical  Officer,   General

Hospital. I hope the Minister can explain this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, the Member for Sembawang

was  probably not in the House yesterday or he was

not  paying  attention, but I  gave  a  very  full

explanation  of  the reasons  why,  owing  to  the

fantastic  amount  of  work,  we  have  found   it

necessary  to have a full-time Medical Officer  in

charge  of  the General Hospital and  a  full-time

Administrative Officer to co-operate the  work  of

all the hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, may I

seek  one  point of information from the Minister?

Will the persons to be X-rayed in the sampling  of

the  three  areas  to which mention  was  made  be

selected, or will they be asked to come forward on

a  voluntary  basis, or how will the  sampling  be

done?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I think the Member for Tanglin is

fully  conversant with the arrangements that  have

been  made.  I  would  only  remind  him  of   the

conference  which he and Mr Garlick  of  S.A.T.A.

had  in my Ministry. It is, in fact, our intention

to  give  free X-rays on miniature radiography  in

these  three  areas. Option will be given  to  the

people in these areas to be either X-rayed  by  us

or  by  S.A.T.A.  X-rays will be  on  a  voluntary

basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I am sorry the Minister

has   not  understood  my  question.  I  was   not

referring to any conference which has taken place.

That  point was not made clear to me at that time.

What I want to know is: I think there are going to

be  three  areas in which about 15,000 people  are

going to be X-rayed. Now is that going to be  done

on a voluntary basis as far as the persons who are

going  to be X-rayed are concerned? Are they going

to  be invited to come forward, and is it going to

be done through propaganda; or have they got to be

X-rayed; or how is it going to be done?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Yes, we hope to do it successfully on

a voluntary basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $31,522,760 for Head 49 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 50-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $29,990 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of sub-head 1 (1) , Minister, on page  269

of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I hope that it

will  not  be construed that I am trying  to  take

away the salary of the Minister. The Minister  for

Labour and Welfare is also concurrently the  Chief

Minister, and as the salary of the Chief  Minister

is far higher than that of the Minister for Labour

and Welfare, I am sure that he prefers to draw the

salary  of the Chief Minister rather than that  of

the Minister for Labour and Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer you, Sir, to page 161, the

"Remarks" column against subhead 1 (1)  which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No provision entered for 1956 as the Chief

Minister  then was also Minister for Commerce  and

Industry."



<br><br>Sir,  the  Member for Cairnhill  then  was  Chief

Minister  and  concurrently Minister for  Commerce

and Industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this case, as the Budget shows a deficit,

I  do  not  think it is fair to put the figure  of

$30,000,  shown against sub-head 1 (1) ,  Minister,

on  page  269,  in the Estimates because  it  will

misguide  us. However, rather than take away  that

vote altogether, I would much prefer

to  put  in  a  token vote of $10  in  its  place,

because  the  Assistant Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare may be promoted to the post of Minister if

there is a vacancy in due course. If that happens,

we  can,  without  any difficulty,  re-insert  the

figure  of  $30,000 against the post of  Minister.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy(Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

the  Chief Minister has been good enough  to  take

over the portfolio of the Minister for Labour  and

Welfare.  This  has  saved the  Colony  a  lot  of

money - a      Minister's     salary,     allowance,

entertainment  expenses,  etc.  The  former  Chief

Minister, the Member for Cairnhill, also did  the

same  thing  in  the beginning when  he  held  the

portfolio  of  Commerce and Industry.  His  was  a

difficult  task  when he began  to  work  the  new

Constitution. I remember his words  at,  I  think,

the first Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



sitting - that  there was not even an ink-pot  or  a

sheet  of  note-paper, or even an office  for  the

Chief Minister. I also remember that he had to try

and  wrest  power  from the  ex-officios.  I  also

remember  that he had to put up a fight  with  the

Colonial  Office. The first Chief Minister's  task

was difficult, with the result that he had to give

up  later  on  the portfolio of the Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry. But now things  are  well

under  way,  and  we are grateful to  the  present

Chief  Minister for taking up both this  portfolio

and  that  of the Minister for Labour and Welfare,

thereby saving the revenue of the Colony. He might

be  able  to give us information why this post  of

Minister for Labour and Welfare is kept open.  The

fact is that he has to go to London, and his is  a

minority   Government.  I  wonder  whether   other

parties  will co-operate with him when he goes  to

London, or whether the Colonial Office will accept

what  a  minority Government says. Sir, I  believe

there  is  something in the minds of  the  present

Coalition  Government  or in  that  of  the  Chief

Minister,  and I would like to hear why this  post

of  Minister of Labour and Welfare is kept  open.

If  the  vote is reduced to a token $10,  he  will

still  have  the same chance, but  it  is  no  use

carrying  such  a big item in the Budget.  Sir,  I

would  like to have an explanation from the  Chief

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  the  Member  for  Queenstown  has

rightly  said that I am not drawing salaries  from

two  Ministries. The reason why this vote  remains

in  the Estimates is because I am not so sure what

is going to transpire in February. As hon. Members

know,  if  this  time we go again and  we  do  not

succeed  in  our mission, Singapore will  have  to

find a new Minister for Labour and Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also referred to the

Member  for  Cairnhill  when  he  was  the   Chief

Minister  and  at  the  same  time  Minister   for

Commerce  and Industry. In his case, Sir,  I  would

like to point out to the Assembly that, under  the

then  Rendel Constitution, the Chief Minister  had

to hold a portfolio.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



So   he  became  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry,  who is also the chief of all the  other

Ministers. But as a result of his talks  with  the

Secretary  of State last December, his  Government

was able to get a concession, that, in view of the

heavy  responsibilities of the Chief Minister,  he

should  not  be loaded with another Ministry.  His

Ministry  of  Commerce and Industry was  therefore

separated  from  him  and  so  the  portfolio   of

Minister  for  Commerce and Industry was  created.

Now when I accepted the Chief Ministership, I said

that my spiritual home was in the Labour Ministry,

and  it still is. I will not give that up. But one

must not forget that although I may not want to do

it, I might be forced to do it, may be in February

when I come back from London. Or I might be forced

to  do it earlier, may be on account of reasons of

health.  But I can say that, as long as  there  is

life  in  me, and as long as I am allowed to  hold

it, I will hold it. But the amendment proposed  by

the Member for Queenstown, Sir, means nothing. The

vote is still there. What the hon. Member wants is

to  see a reduction of a comparatively few dollars

in the Estimates. It is just $29,990 - it is nothing

in  an  Estimate  of  millions  upon  millions  of

dollars.  Sir, we cannot accept the  amendment  on

this  side  because  of  the  uncertainty  of  the

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I think this side of the

House  should  be  satisfied with the  explanation

given. The position, of course, appears to be very

uncertain, as the Chief Minister has pointed  out,

and  I  think we should remain contented  for  the

time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do fully

appreciate  what the Chief Minister  has  in  mind

where  his appointment is concerned, that  someone

should  be  there,  whether  he  himself  or   the

Assistant Minister if and when he is promoted. But

the  fact is that in my amendment I am not  trying

to  take  away the vote altogether. Where a  token

vote  is  concerned,  if it is  passed,  it  gives

authority  for  the money to be spent.  But  if  a

token   vote   is  taken  away  altogether,   then

authority has to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



be   sought  for.  And  when  the  Chief  Minister

appoints a new Minister for Labour and Welfare  or

appoints a new Minister, he may have got to go  to

the Governor in Council or Council of Ministers to

seek  approval for that appointment. I feel,  Sir,

that  where  an  estimate is  concerned,  I  would

prefer  a  token  vote rather than an  imaginative

figure.  When  such  time as the  appointment  has

actually been filled, we could then easily release

that  token  vote  where  the  actual  amount   is

concerned. But since the Member for Telok Ayer has

said  that he is prepared to overlook it,  and  in

order to save time, may I have your permission and

that of hon. Members to withdraw my amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of the

page   270,  sub-head  1  (5) ,  "Deputy  Assistant

Controllers of Immigration, 29," - may the  Minister

inform us what is, first, the vacancy position  at

appointments have been filled?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I must have

notice of that question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

question  of immigration is causing grave  concern

amongst the Chinese population in Singapore. As  a

matter  of  fact, it is more of a puzzle,  because

the  man in the street is not fully aware  of  the

actual functions of this Department or what is the

system of application for entry into this country.

Sir, I have known of cases where applications  for

entry  for  wives or aged parents met  with  great

difficulty  as  compared to the  ease  with  which

strip-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



teasers and singers can enter this colony. It  is,

of  course,  a  fact that these  stripteasers  and

singers  come  here for a very short period,  say,

six months or so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another surprise is that the application for

extension of the visas of these entertainers meets

with  no  difficulty. I have known of cases  where

singers  in  night-clubs have been here  for  more

than   three  years.  I  wonder  how  they  manage

this - may be they are females! I think that is  why

the  immigration authorities take such  a  lenient

view!  But I have known of cases where technicians

have  found much difficulty in applying for  entry

visas for even a short stay here. I have known  of

a   permanent   wave   expert - a   man,   in   this

instance! - who was quite prepared to come  down  to

Singapore  and  give the benefit of his  knowledge

and  experience to our local people. He has tried,

but  without success, to get an entry visa. If the

Minister for Labour and Welfare desires it, I  can

one day bring this case to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Chinese custom is that we prefer to have

our  wives  and aged parents stay  with  us  as  a

family unit rather than that they live apart  from

us.  Where  immigration is concerned, there  is  a

proviso   that  a  marriage  photograph  must   be

produced.  Sir,  in  olden  times,  there  was  no

question of a marriage photograph because the  man

and  his wife were too shy of each other and  more

so  of  exposing themselves to the public. I think

this  proviso  should be relaxed  in  such  cases.

There  are  also cases of aged parents wishing  to

come to Singapore to join their sons or daughters,

but  the reply from the Immigration Department  is

always  the same - they are not within the  category

to be considered. I wonder what are the categories

to   be  considered,  Sir,  because  it  is   very

difficult to say the actual categories. Now a  son

may  have a well-established business here and  is

able  to  maintain his parents, but they  are  not

staying with him, and it will naturally be a cause

of much sorrow to them all if they are kept apart,

instead of living together as a happy family. This

son,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  who  is a business man, is also prepared  to

give  a  guarantee  to  the  Government  that  his

parents, if they are allowed to enter the  colony,

would  not  be  a burden to the State.  There  are

cases, Sir, where the applicants have estates  and

certainly in their position they are in a position

to   maintain  their  parents.  I  hope  that  the

Government will be prepared to let the public know

what   are  the  categories  which  they  consider

immigrants  should  come  into  before  they   are

allowed  to enter here, because as far as I  know,

it  is only the wives who are considered and  they

are only subject to the production of documents of

family photographs. But what about aged parents? I

may  get a reply from the Minister that above  the

age of 60 -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> Hundreds are coming in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I do agree with that. Even

thousands  are coming in! It really surprises  me,

Sir, that in some cases they are considered and in

other  cases they are not. What is the  difference

then?  I can tell you, Sir, that although the  age

of  entry  for  children is 12, I  have  known  of

children  15  or  16 years old  coming  into  this

colony.  How did they manage it? I wonder  if  the

Minister for Labour and Welfare, who is in  charge

of  the Immigration Department, can explain  this.

At one time I went into a shop and I was surprised

to  see a boy of this height [Indicating.] who told

me  that  he  came  from China  only  a  few  days

previously and I asked him how old he was and  how

he came into the colony. To my surprise he replied

that  his  age, by Chinese reckoning, was  16.  To

account for the difference between 16 and 12 years

of age is beyond me. Is it not surprising then how

a boy of 16 was allowed to come in? As I have said

earlier,  it is a puzzle - in some cases,  they  are

allowed  in  and in other cases they  are  not.  I

think  there should be a change of system  in  the

Immigration  Department.  I  wonder  whether   the

Minister for Labour and Welfare could institute an

investigation into the functions of that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



Department   so  that  there  will  be   no   more

discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also point out in the Member for Cairnhill

that  it is not hundreds or even thousands of aged

parents  who  have come in. Millions of  wives,  I

should  say,  have  come in through  some  way  or

other! So I do hope that the Minister could set up

a  committee  to investigate into the workings  of

that Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Chairman, Sir, as the Minister for

Labour  and Welfare but not drawing the salary  of

the  Minister for Labour and Welfare,  may  I  now

attempt to justify or give an answer to the attack

on  the  Immigration Department?  The  Member  for

Queenstown   seems  to  be  concerned   with   the

immigration policy. He asks for information, which

he   could   easily   get  from  the   Immigration

Ordinance,  of  the categories of people  who  are

permitted  entry into the colony.  Sir,  before  I

became Minister for Labour and Welfare, I had been

toiling and toiling for the people of Singapore in

so   far   as  their  immigration  problems   were

concerned. This was ever since 1948, and so  if  I

claim to know a lot about that Department, I  hope

hon.  Members will understand that it is  a  claim

based on personal knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member says that marriage photographs

are  insisted before entry is permitted.  I  think

his   information   is   incorrect.   A   marriage

photograph  is not insisted upon. It was  insisted

upon  in  1948,  1949, 1950, 1951 I  think,  1952

maybe, so much so that if a marriage photograph is

asked for and if the sponsor of the immigrant  has

it,  it  will help to substantiate his application

for entry; but if there is no marriage photograph,

it  does  not  mean  that his case  is  that  much

weaker.  I  would say that it was because  of  the

insistence    of    marriage   photographs    that

photographers in Singapore made a lot of money  by

imposing one photograph upon another, so  much  so

that when the sponsor (meaning the husband or  the

wife;  the  applicant is the  person  who  desires

entry)   was  asked,  "Why  did  you  forge   this

photograph?", he replied, "I do not know. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



was told that I must produce a marriage photograph

and  so  I produce a marriage photograph!" It  was

because  of that that the production of a marriage

photograph  is  no longer insisted  upon.  If  the

sponsor  can produce one, it will help  his  case;

but if he cannot, well, that is that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,024,280 for Head 52 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think it

is  a  wellknown fact that labour is the economic

backbone of this colony and it also plays a  vital

role  in  the  stability of this country.  Without

labour,  industry would not be able  to  progress.

Government, I believe, is trying to see that there

is  less  unemployment. It is trying its  best  to

ensure  that  there  is  no unemployment  in  this

colony, and that is why a labour exchange has been

created.  But, Sir, in my opinion, the  system  of

operation  in  that  labour  exchange  is   rather

unsatisfactory.  I  have known  cases  where  long

queues  have  stood  alongside the  Havelock  Road

building waiting either to be registered  or  sent

to  employers or firms which require  labour.  The

coordination between the employers and the  labour

exchange  is not very satisfactory. There  may  be

cases  of a firm which requires a large number  of

carpenters  but the labour exchange is  unable  to

supply them; whereas, in fact, there are thousands

of  unemployed carpenters who are not prepared  to

register or have not registered themselves at  the

labour exchange. So this is the reason why  I  say

the  system is not satisfactory. It is either  the

employers  or  the unemployed who are  not  making

much use of the labour exchange. I presume they do

not  know the benefits to be derived from the  use

of  that  exchange. Or it may be  that  the  staff

there is inadequate so that they are unable to set

up   a  new  system  whereby  the  employers,  the

unemployed    and   the   exchange   could    have

co-ordination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



The answer to this problem, if I may say so again,

is to appoint a committee to go into the functions

of  the  labour  exchange with a  view  to  making

recommendations for improvement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is again the Member

for  Queenstown  who speaks and the  Minister  for

Labour  who labours for no reward! Sir, he brought

up   the  question  of  the  work  of  the  labour

exchange.  I  agree that the work  of  the  labour

exchange  is not as satisfactory as I should  have

liked  to  see, but I am sure he himself  realises

the  limitations  under which the labour  exchange

has to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, there is no compulsion on

employers  to seek to fill vacancies  through  the

labour exchange. In the second place, there are  a

number of private employment agencies, about  whom

I  have  already  asked for more information,  who

appear  to be able to do better business  in  this

particular line. It has been reported to me,  Sir,

that  more and more people would like to make  use

of  these  agencies  because,  through  their  own

organisations within the offices, they are able to

know  in advance of any vacancy that may arise  in

any  particular office. In some cases, it has been

reported to the Labour Department that there  have

been  a good number of illegal practices going  on

in these so-called private employment agencies and

I  have  therefore, as I have said earlier,  asked

for further information about them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown asked for a committee

to  be  set up to look into and improve  upon  the

work  of  the  labour exchange. I  would  like  to

inform  him,  Sir, that there is already  a  small

committee on the job and I hope they will be  able

to  make  recommendations to me which will improve

the working of the labour exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the long queues of people waiting at

the  labour exchange for registration, perhaps the

Member for Queenstown has confused them with  the

long  queues  waiting  for relief  at  the  Social

Welfare  Department. The labour exchange  and  the

Social  Welfare Department are on the same  floor,

Sir,  and  the  queues could  have  been  enlarged

because there is only one entrance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am glad

that  the Minister is calling for a report on  the

working  of  these private employment agencies.  I

think  the  Government  should  take  very  strong

action  against  them.  To  my  knowledge,   these

agencies  are,  in  fact, exploiting  the  workers

rather than assisting them. A registration fee  is

levied  whether you get employment or not; and  as

soon  as employment is found for persons who  have

registered with them, a certain percentage of  the

first month's salary has to be paid to them.  This

is   nothing   but  corruption  and  exploitation.

Unemployed persons are trying to find work and  in

the process a certain fee has first to be paid.  I

do  not  think  that  is fair.  These  unfortunate

people want work to keep themselves alive and  yet

a  certain amount of money is extracted from them.

I  hope  the  Minister will ask Government  to  be

quick  about the action to be taken against  these

agencies  and  see that they are  not  allowed  to

exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,024,280 for Head 52 order to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 53-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (46) , Community Centre

Organisers, on page 281 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I must draw the

attention  of the House to the fact that Community

Centre  Organisers  are new  innovations  in  this

Budget. They have been here for only a few  years.

May I suggest to the House, Sir, that this type of

employment is not necessary? It gives me  a  queer

feeling  to  have  that  title  "Community  Centre

Organisers" put into the Budget. It gives  me  the

idea  that  people in Singapore must be organised.

It   gives  me  the  feeling  that  people  cannot

organise  themselves before; but, Sir, nothing  is

further  from  the  truth. In  fact,  people  have

always  organised  themselves  and  will  organise

themselves  when they want to. But they  will  not

want to organise themselves if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



they  are  forced into it. Sir, we  find  that  in

every  locality  in Singapore little  associations

have  come  up. We have little guilds  coming  up.

People   have   formed  themselves   into   sports

associations,   benevolent   associations,    clan

associations and associations to promote a certain

type  of welfare activity or social activity;  and

in   all  such  cases  they  have  never  had  any

prompting  from  anybody.  In  fact,  it  is   the

interest in these people which causes them to band

themselves into whatever organisations they  want.

Now  it  may  be said by the Department  concerned

that this can only apply to many decades ago, say,

before  the  second world war, when everybody  was

staying in a fixed place for a very long time; but

after  the war, we have the growth of new  estates

and  the  coming of this event has brought  people

from  all  parts  of Singapore to  stay  together.

Then, of course, there will be problems which  are

common  to them and which they want to solve,  but

because  of  the shortness of time, they  are  not

able to come together; so we must have somebody to

look  after such things for them. But, Sir, I  say

this  is  not  true. In this case of new  estates,

where  the  people  have  common  problems,   they

usually organise themselves into community centres

to  fight  their own battle. They need  no  urging

from the Department concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now look at the work of these

community  centre organisers during the  past  few

years.  I  happen to be pretty familiar  with  the

work  which  they are doing and in  most  cases  I

think   they   have  nothing  much  to   recommend

themselves  for the maintenance of their  jobs.  A

community centre is built in a place which is  not

conspicuous  enough to attract  attention  and  in

such   a  way  that  people  will  find  it  quite

inconvenient  to make use of it. In  such  centres

there will be a few types of activities - boys' club

activities, girls' club activities - and there  will

be a little library in the corner and occasionally

the  members  will meet there for a lecture  or  a

short talk. But invariably, Sir, these centres are

empty - empty  for the most part of the  month,  for

the  most part of the week, and for the most  part

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



day. You can say, "Yes, we have a centre and it is

catering  for the needs of the young children.  We

run  classes." Yes, these centres run classes, but

classes  for  about 20 or 30 or 40 people  and  no

more;  and if you can call them community centres,

when  they  are being made use of by only  a  very

small number of people, then I wonder if there  is

not  something wrong with the title. However, even

if  we  confine  ourselves to the subject  of  the

centre  being  made use of by these young  people,

let  us  see how the work is being done. Sometimes

an association will come in and ask for the use of

the  place,  and in one case that I know  of,  the

organiser  said,  "You  will  have  to  write   in

officially."  I  quite agree, Sir, that  community

centres  deal with all sorts of people,  and  such

people will also include those who are illiterate,

and   to   ask  illiterate  people  to  write   in

officially  is, I think, the height of  folly.  Or

you  may have an organisation asking, "You are not

going  to  use this place for a few days.  Let  us

have  it for the purposes of weight-lifting." This

organisation  is  prepared to guarantee  that  the

building  will not be spoiled, the floor will  not

be  chipped,  and  should  there  be  damage,  the

association  is  prepared to compensate  for  such

damage.  But  even  then the  association  is  not

allowed  to  make use of that centre. A  community

centre,  according  to  that  type  of  organiser,

should  be  kept as a white elephant, white-washed

and cleanly swept, nobody making use of it because

it will then not be dirty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out another fact. Invariably we find

that  organisers  are sent into a community  about

which  they  know nothing. I put it to  you,  Sir,

that  if  you  are sent in to organise  a  certain

community - in   fact,  they  do   not   need   your

assistance  at  all - then the very least  that  you

must  know is that you should know the people  and

the  conditions there. If you do not, then you can

do no work at all. In fact, the work that has been

done has nothing to recommend itself. I have known

of  one  centre  where, instead of the  organisers

making  everybody happy to go into  it  and  drink

coffee,  talk  together, read the papers,  discuss

the  day's  work, these people have  divided  them

into factions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



The  organisers  in this case did  not  bring  the

people  together, but had split them into  various

camps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I must say one very interesting thing.

It is said that in community centres there must be

no politics, absolutely no politics. We agree with

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Do you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes. In fact, there was a

case  where  a group of people were interested  in

forming  a  community centre, but  the  Department

concerned  said, "No, you cannot form a  community

centre.  We  do not agree with you because  it  is

political." Then the organisers had to  produce  a

list  in which they said, "We have so many  people

coming  into this project; there are so many  from

one  Party,  and so many from another."  In  fact,

many  of  the Parties were represented,  including

quite  a  number of people who had no  Parties  at

all.  That  was actually the case. They came  from

all sorts of Parties. I should even say, they have

people  coming from the Labour Front! Let  us  say

now that we agree that there should be no politics

in  community centres. We agree with that,  but  I

would ask the Government to read an article  by  a

journalist  writing under the name of  Aster  Gunasekera  who  gave  prominence to  an  event  which

happened  in one of the community centres.  It  is

not  my  opinion,  but it is  the  opinion  of  an

independent  observer. He says, "If  that  is  not

politics, what is it?". Here, Sir, is a case where

what  the  Government  can do,  the  other  people

cannot do. I think that is absolutely wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also other instances where people

want to form community centres but instead of  the

Department sending along organisers to  help  them

in a positive way, they have done so in a negative

way.  Take  the case of the Tiong Bahru  community

centre.  Some  people wanted to form  a  community

centre  there. They had interests there  and  they

wanted  to come out and do work for the community,

but  I  doubt whether there was any positive  help

given to them. Take another case, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



Serangoon Garden Estate. There is a community

centre there and it came into existence to fight

the Estate Department who was levying dues or

charges which the community thought were unjust

and should be classified as -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I want the hon. Member to remember

the question of time -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a point of order? The

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In fairness to other hon. Members,

I think I must indicate that 35 minutes has been

minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> To continue, Sir, it was the

same  case with the Serangoon Garden Estate.  That

community  centre  organisation received  no  help

whatsoever from the Department concerned. I should

like the House to know exactly how this Department

is carrying out its work. Instead of helping those

people who are interested in community work, which

should,  in  fact,  be the most  logical  way,  an

organiser  is  posted to a place.  This  organiser

then  uses  his  discretion  and  goes  round  and

invites  people  whom he thinks  fit  to  form  an

advisory  committee. This advisory committee  will

then advise the Department as to what is good  and

what  is  bad.  There is, however,  one  point  to

remember about this, Sir. In a place where  people

do  not  want  advisory committees, then  advisory

committees must be done away with. In a place



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



where  the  people wish to call a meeting  of  the

whole district to elect democratically those  whom

they  wish to run their community centre, I  think

the Government should give way to the popular wish

of the people. I am certain, Sir, that in a matter

like  this, where there is still a denial  by  the

Government to accept the principle that the people

must  be trained at the lowest level so that  they

may  know  what is the meaning of an election  and

how  to select the best men to represent them,  it

is  something  that  I  think  should  never  have

occurred. I say to this Assembly, Sir, that should

any hon. Member require further facts, I shall  be

always   willing  to  give  him  real  and   solid

examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir, I have only two very small points to make  to

the  address by the Member for Serangoon who seems

to  have emptied his own side of the House. It  is

the  policy,  I  understand, of community  centres

that  no  public meeting of a political  character

can  be  held in them, and that, I understand,  is

also true of schools. Sir, the concept of polities

has  been  something unclean.  It  is  a  Colonial

Office concept in respect of colonial territories.

It  is  not a healthy concept in a territory which

seeks  democratic development, and  I  would  urge

upon  Government  to reconsider  the  question  of

permitting political meetings in community centres

and  in  schools with a fair apportionment to  the

various political Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry (Mr M. P. D. Nair): Sir, I hold no brief

for  the Department of Social Welfare, but I  must

correct  some  of the misapprehensions  which  the

Member   for  Serangoon  has  expressed   to   the

Assembly.  As  a  Member of the Assembly  who  has

taken  pains  to  organise one of these  community

centres,  I  must refute every word  of  what  the

Member for Serangoon said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, community development went the wrong way as

early as 1950.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



These   centres  were  then  used  for   political

purposes and there were difficulties arising as  a

result  of this. But a year or two back, Sir,  the

Department realised the position and, as a result,

they  have tried to obtain trained and experienced

staff  as  community centre organisers.  They  are

doing a very good job, Sir, as far as my place  is

concerned. I have every praise for their  work.  I

think  community development has been considerably

misunderstood  by the Member for  Serangoon,  Sir,

and  I  hope that the Department of Social Welfare

will publish some material for the information  of

all  concerned which will be of immense  help  not

only  to Members of the Assembly but also  to  the

population as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, with due

respect  to  the Member for Serangoon - I understand

he  is  a youth leader - I am afraid I cannot  agree

with him that community centre organisers are  not

necessary. I believe that he was referring to  the

Government-sponsored community  centres -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Exactly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - rather than the community

centres that have been set up in S.I.T. estates by

the residents themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Confined to Government only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> These centres are set up, as a

matter  of fact, for the co-ordination of residents

within  the estate and to assist them in  case  of

need;  but the officials of such community centres

are  treating  these centres more as  associations

than  as community centres. That is why I  do  not

agree  when  the  Member for Serangoon  says  that

community centre organisers are not required.  The

community centres should have wardens to guide the

officials,  and,  as  such,  it  should   be   the

responsibility of the Government to  provide  such

wardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that Government has established

within  the  Social  Welfare Department  a  little

section  called the Community Development  Section

under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



the  Assistant Director for Community Centres, but

what I would like to say is this: that the liaison

between this section and the community centres  is

unsatisfactory.  This section  within  the  Social

Welfare Department waits for the community centres

to  come  to  it for advice rather  than  that  it

should  go  to  the centres and give them  advice.

These  centres  are, in fact,  in  great  need  of

financial help. The only concession that  they  do

get is not from the Government but from the S.I.T.

who gives a special rate of $20 rental for a shop-house at the premises of the centre. The rental of

that shop-house may be $160 to $200. I think it is

the  duty  of the Government to go round to  these

centres - the privately established ones and not the

Government-sponsored  ones - to  find  out  what  is

required.  Most  of  them,  I  may  say,  live  on

cinemas. In each of the different estates you will

find  an  open-air  cinema  set  up  charging   an

entrance  fee of ten cents. Without such  cinemas,

the  community  centres would have to  close  down

long ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary

(Mr  M.  P.  D. Nair) has said that in  1950  the

question  of community development was  raised.  I

remember  that sometime in that year or  the  year

after   that  a  committee  called  the  Community

Development Committee was set up and  on  it  were

represented members of public bodies like the City

Council,  the  Legislative Council and  the  Rural

Board. That committee must have wound up because I

have  never heard of it again. I would urge,  Sir,

that  Government  revive this committee,  but  the

representation on this committee should not be  on

the  basis  of  Government or local organisations.

Privately established community centres should  be

asked  to come on to this committee so that  there

could   be  an  exchange  of  views  on  community

development.   They   could   easily    ask    two

representatives from each community centre to  sit

on  this committee. There has been no trouble with

Government-sponsored  community  centres,  as  the

Member for Serangoon has alleged. In Yio Chu  Kang

there  is a beautiful and well-established  centre

which will be opened



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



tomorrow  by  the Labour Minister. It  is  not  the

Government-sponsored centres that we  should  look

after;  it  is  the privately-established  centres

that  we  should look after. I hope the Government

will  bear  my  suggestion in mind to  revive  the

Community Development Committee so that  a  chance

could be given to private community centres to air

their views and their needs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I see that the Member for

Queenstown is very committee-minded! For the three

departments in my Ministry - Immigration, Labour and

Welfare - he has been suggesting one committee after

another!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon started his speech by

saying  that  he  objected to the  appointment  of

community  centre organisers. He said  that  there

was  a  sinister meaning given to organisers  when

they are officers of the Government; but later  on

in  his speech he told us that his dissatisfaction

arose  out  of  the  alleged inefficiency  of  the

organisers  themselves  rather  than  because  the

centre organisers were there. Sir, I would like to

say  that  community  centre organisers  are  very

necessary to help and advise in the management  of

centres.  They  are trained people and  experience

has  shown  that without a competent  professional

staff  the premises tend to be put to insufficient

use and government money is therefore wasted. Sir,

it  is  Government's policy to  provide  community

centres and children's social centres within them,

and  to  appoint advisory committees to run  them,

and  to  appoint members of the general public  to

serve  on  these committees, with  the  object  of

establishing  at  the earliest possible  moment  a

community  association formed by persons  who  use

these centres. In this way, Sir, the management of

all  appropriate functions of the  centre  can  be

undertaken  by  a  committee  and  this  could  be

separated from the Social Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon and the Member for

Cairnhill  have  touched on the use  of  community

centres for political meetings. Political meetings

in  community centres and in schools  are  allowed

during  election  time, and in  community  centres

they will be allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



when  more than one Party is represented. It could

not  be  given to any political Party at  any  one

time,  but  if there is a joint political  meeting

organised  by more than one Party on a  matter  of

general interest to the community, permission will

be granted to hold such a meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

to  a  considerable number of people, and that  is

the  Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance; but before  I

do  so, Sir, I would ask whether the Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare has any information  that  he

would  like  to  add  to  our  knowledge  of   the

implementation of this legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, I am sure the

it  is  proposed that Part I of the Legal Aid  and

Advice  Ordinance will come into operation without

any  further delay. The Director of Legal Aid  can

then  be  appointed and an office set up.  Sir,  I

propose  to hold further discussions with the  Bar

Committee  as  soon as possible.  The  discussions

which I have already had with them indicated to me

that  the  Government  can  be  assured  of  their

co-operation,  and in the operation  of  this  law,

Sir,  it  is  most  necessary  that  we  have  the

co-operation of the Bar Committee in order to  give

the utmost benefit to those desiring legal aid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir, indeed I think all sides of the House welcome

the  announcement of the Minister of the immediate

implementation  of  Part I of the  Legal  Aid  and

Advice Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points which I would like to make,

Sir.  First,  I  see no provision  to  cover  this

implementation in the Budget, Sir. Do  I  take  it

that  the  House  will be asked for  supplementary

provision at a very early date? Secondly, Sir,  on

the question of the necessity of co-operation from

the Bar. I think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



Minister  is fully aware that this was  completely

thrashed out among themselves at the time prior to

the introduction of the Bill and that though it is

recognised that the co-operation of the  Bar  would

be  most helpful, the Bill is so framed that it is

not essential.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, an

application  for supplementary provision  will  be

tabled early next month.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think I

should   now  give  credit  and  thanks   to   the

Government  in  having  a section  called  "Public

Assistance". Without this section, I am afraid the

number  of  beggars on the streets will  increase;

but  what  I would like to say is this, Sir,  that

the  amount  of  money given by  this  section  is

inadequate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> More tax!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> More tax. On the other hand, I

feel  that  this  section should be  decentralised

rather than that it should all be concentrated  in

the  Havelock  Road  building.  The  Minister  for

Labour and Welfare said earlier that I might  have

mistaken  the  people who go to that building  for

public  assistance for people who want to register

themselves for employment. Sir, that is the reason

why  I  am now referring to the men and women  who

sit  on the doorsteps of that building waiting for

their  turn  to receive public assistance.  People

coming  from  Queenstown,  Alexandra,  Changi  and

Pasir Panjang to town have to cover about five  to

eight  miles, and to do that and receive only  $15

to  $25  as assistance from the Department  is,  I

think, a waste of time and transport.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member is now

embarking on a debate on the policy of the  Public

Assistance Section. If he wished for a  debate  on

that particular section, he ought to have moved  a

conventional reduction of the vote.  All  that  he

can do now is just to ventilate what he wishes  to

ventilate, but he should not enter into a debate.

the Government in regard to public assistance.  As

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is exactly what I am asking

Distinguished  Visitors,  on  page  296   of   the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find that this vote is required "for

refreshment  supplied in the V.I.P.  Room".  I  am

rather   puzzled  as  to  who  are  "Distinguished

Visitors" and who are V. I. P. 's. I thought

V.  I. P.'s cover everybody of importance, but now

I  find that out of that category of persons there

is  a  new  classification  called  "Distinguished

Visitors",  and these may be people  who  come  to

Singapore  either on some urgent  business  or  on

consular business.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people going into the V.I.P. room are

only  in transit. They make use of the room  while

waiting for their planes. The room itself is not a

canteen  where drinks are supplied, and it  should

not  be  made  into a canteen. Because  there  are

"Distinguished Visitors" and there are  V.  I.  P.'s,  there  will be discrimination against  V.  I.

P.'s if this vote is passed. But if the vote is to

cover all V. I. P.'s, then $1,000 is not enough. I

do not know who are actually V. I. P.'s. I presume

every Member of this Assembly is a V.I.P.

V.I.P. room than in the C.P.A. room! I trust  the

Government will be more careful about such  things

and not turn a room for passengers in transit into

a  canteen. A canteen is entirely different. There

is  a restaurant at the airport, and if V. I. P.'s

want  a  drink,  they can easily have  it  at  the

restaurant rather than in the V.I.P. room. Sir, I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this item, Sir, the sum of $45,000 is asked

for building Division I quarters. To my mind, this

is  a high figure, unless some explanation can  be

given  to  us why the cost is so high. I  have  in

mind  particularly those houses built by the Ideal

Homes  in Whitley Road. There are about 200 houses

there  and they were sold to the public at $30,000

per house -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have, in fact, drawn the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On any question in the Committee of Supply

debate  shall  be confined to the  policy  of  the

<br><br>The  point raised by the hon. Member will be quite

relevant  when I come to propose the  Question  on

the  Main Head, but if he can develop a debate  on

policy on his amendment, then he is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I was coming to the

is  so  short, I think I will not proceed with  my

amendment but will speak on the Main Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $64,000 for Head D 9 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I just want to point out

that  all  these houses were sold at $30,000  each

and  they included 10,000 square feet of  land  in

town, making of roads and provision for sanitation

and  septic  tanks, and to my mind $45,000  for  a

bungalow  alone is fantastic. I would  invite  the

authorities to go and see this house and  have  an

estimate made later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Very briefly, Mr Chairman, Sir,

these  are  standard Division I quarters providing

for   two  bedrooms,  a  lounge,  a  dining  room,

servants  quarters, W.C, sanitation and a  garage,

and are of very simple construction using 4� inch

walls  of hollow concrete blocks, and if you built

the  house by itself, it would cost about $28,000.

But the cost, in fact, includes $10,000 to $12,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



extra   for  water  and  electricity  supply   and

sewerage  disposal. There is  also  the  cost  for

furniture   included   in  the   $45,000 - that   is

$3,500 - and  supervision charges  for  a  clerk  of

works  at  the site. You will realise,  Sir,  that

Jurong is a remote area where one has not got  all

the  services and you have to put on the ancillary

costs  which are a very large element in the total

cost  of the house. A similar house completed only

six  months  ago  worked out to a  little  over  a

dollar  a  foot cube and a similar house at  Mount

Pleasant was built at a cost of $38,000, that  is,

a  saving of $7,000. There is not enough time, Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  to give a much longer  speech  on

building  costs, but I hope to do so  as  soon  as

sufficiently long time is allotted to this Head.

has consented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, unlike the Member for

Cairnhill, who objects to the provision  made  for

the  Royal Malayan Navy in this Budget, I strongly

support  the  retention of this fine body  of  men

who,  I  am sure, will carry on the fine tradition

handed  down  by those who saw action  during  the

last  war. We have already spent many millions  of

dollars to create that force. It will indeed be  a

tragic  waste of public money to disband  it  now.

When  we achieve independence and self-government,

surely a country like ours, surrounded by the sea,

must  have a navy of our own, no matter how small?

Rather than have two infantry battalions and scrap

the  Royal Malayan Navy, I would have one infantry

battalion and the Royal Malayan Navy, because  the

Navy,  besides patrolling the seas around us,  can

always come to the assistance of the Government in

case  of  any threat to internal security.  I  do,

however,  agree  with the view of the  Member  for

Cairnhill   regarding   what   he   contemptuously

described  as a "toy Navy" for which we are  asked

to  provide  $15  million, but for very  different

reasons. Sir, I think $15 million is a very,  very

large  sum  to spend at this time on a  method  of

warfare  which,  to my mind, will  never  be  used

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the development of atomic energy,

warfare  is  moving into another stage altogether.

With  guided missiles, atomic war-heads and, in  a

few years' time, aeroplanes and warships propelled

by  nuclear  energy,  we must think  of  different

types of warfare. To my mind, minesweeping will be

out  of the picture, for in any big conflict,  the

nation that controls the air will control the  sea

and hardly any ship will be able to move. Besides,

I  can  think  of  other ways  of  removing  mines

instead



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



of  using these cumbersome minesweepers which were

developed  before the last war. Sir, we  now  have

helicopters which are being used by the  Army  for

detecting land mines. There is no reason  why  two

helicopters  cannot, between  them,  pull  a  mine

detector  over  the sea for the purposes  of  mine

detection.  Then again these helicopters  can  use

those  devices which at present are being used  by

ships  for  spotting  shoals  of  fish,  and   the

discovery  of any mine by the helicopters  can  be

left  to  "frogmen" to dispose  of.  What  I  have

suggested may seem to be a bit silly, but many  of

these suggestions have been adopted in warfare and

have proved to be completely effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if my surmises are incorrect, the

sweeping  of  mines  will be principally  for  the

benefit of the Commonwealth nations, and I see  no

reason why they should not assist us by lending us

minesweepers, now lying idle, for training our men

and supplying us with minesweepers in time of war.

I   think  we  should  use  obsolete  vessels  for

obsolescent  warfare instead of  having  to  build

warships which may be useless by the time they are

completed. This $15 million can then be  allocated

for the benefit of the social services or even  to

prevent  an  increase of income tax on  the  lower

income  groups  in the years to come,  instead  of

spending  it on the Royal Malayan Navy.  The  Hon.

the  Chief  Secretary has informed us that  it  is

possible that the Federation, on her attainment of

independence,  will take over this  responsibility

now assumed by us. Until that question is settled,

we must record our objection to this expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Deputy

Chairman,  Sir, when one defends the undefendable,

the   proper  technique  which  has  always   been

recognised is to indulge in platitudes with  one's

hand  on one's heart. We have heard from the Chief

Secretary,  in  tones of ringing emotion,  of  the

wonderful  work being done to build the spirit  of

these  men  in  accordance with the  tradition  of

those who did so magnificently during the war. The

Chief Secretary did not,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



of  course,  point out that the  men  who  did  so

magnificently  during the war were not  the  Royal

Malayan Navy but the Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer

Reserve;  nor  did he point out  that  I  did  not

criticise  the  allocation for the  Malayan  Royal

Naval  Volunteer Reserve of $744,710 but, in fact,

voted with the rest in accepting it without demur.

Those  are  the  men who did good service  and  it

might well be a valuable service for local needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Malayan Navy, Sir, is another kettle of

fish.  The Chief Secretary did not also  tell  you

that  85 per cent of the personnel, who are  small

in number, come from the Federation, and it is for

these  that  we have to spend $4 million  annually

recurrent and $15 million for these minesweepers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary also told you of the

wonderful  work which was done during the  war  in

minesweeping. I am not aware, Sir, and perhaps  he

will  term  me ignorant, of any enemy power  which

dropped any mines in any territory connected  with

the  Federation or Singapore. It is true that  the

Royal  Navy  planted mines in  the  approaches  to

Singapore,  and  I suppose it will be  anticipated

that mines will be planted in future wars; but let

us  recognise  the fact, Sir, that  this  enormous

expenditure is a horrible waste of money  with  no

relation  to the needs of this territory;  because

it  is said we are surrounded by water, we need  a

Navy for internal security. I do not know if it is

going  to  go  up  Kallang River to  subdue  Bukit

Timah.  Is  the Navy small enough  to  go  up  the

canal?  I  do not know the type of work which  the

Member  for  Paya Lebar has in mind in  suggesting

that  these little boats can be used for  internal

security,  but let the voice of experience  speak,

Sir.  They have been of no value to this territory

in  that  matter. In respect of customs,  we  have

very   expensive  programme  of  ships  to  assist

against  smuggling and they can, in time of  need,

be  turned very rapidly for offensive purposes.  I

cannot understand how any Member in this House can

complacently view this great expenditure  annually

recurrent and this provision which calls  upon  us

to   accept   it   as  a  matter  of  principle - an

expenditure  of  $15 million for four  very  small

ships to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



sweep mines. Sir, I would much rather see this $15

million  used to sweep poverty, which has existed,

instead  of  imaginary mines which never  did  and

cannot exist. What kind of war do you think,  Sir,

will  ever  occur in which the provision  of  four

minesweepers  by this territory could  be  of  any

value to itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally let us not forget the basic principle.

The   United   Kingdom  has  insisted,   and   its

insistence has been acceded to, on the control  of

external  defence  of  this  territory.  It  wants

complete, absolute and unquestioned control and it

has  got it, and it will get it again if there  is

any  merdeka at all. So long as that is true, Sir,

is  it  fair  to  call  upon the  people  of  this

territory to give a substantial part of the public

revenue  to  purposes  over  which  they  have  no

control?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, there seems to be some conflict

of  opinion between the two hon. Members who  have

spoken.   One   clearly  supports  the   continued

existence  of  the Royal Malayan  Navy,  which  is

consistent,  of  course, with the  line  that  was

taken  by the previous Government. The other,  the

Member for Cairnhill, obviously does not like  the

Royal Malayan Navy or to have anything to do  with

it.  I have not the time to answer in detail, Sir,

but I would like to make one or two quick points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is whether or not it is quite a

waste  of money to have any vessels to sweep mines

here. It may be that people will not drop mines in

a  future  war.  It may be that  it  will  not  be

necessary  to  lay  a defensive  minefield  around

Singapore.  But  if  it  is  necessary  to  lay  a

minefield,  or if enemies do drop mines  from  the

air, then you will have to have minesweepers, just

as minesweepers had been used right up to the last

day  of  the  recent hostilities. I  rather  doubt

whether it is possible to use an aircraft to  drop

frogmen. I also -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,873,000 for Head D 16 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the amendments filed by

me  under this Development Head are mainly for the

purpose   of   getting   information   from    the

departments   concerned   and   criticising    any

unnecessary expenditure if we can spot it. I  have

therefore  asked  to  speak on  the  general  Head

instead  of  on the different items, but  I  shall

come down to the items themselves later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of expenditure for building, I

spoke  quite a lot about it last year, but then  I

was  still a greenhorn and my experience regarding

methods of building was rather limited, but during

the  present year I have taken pains  to  go  into

costs and I think I can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



now speak with more authority. It is gratifying to

me  to  know  that  in certain  aspects  costs  of

building   by   the   Public   Works   Department,

particularly where primary schools are  concerned,

have come down a great deal, more particularly  so

when I found that the expenditure for converting a

boys'  hostel  into flats for nurses was  $100,000

instead  of  $200,000,  after  repeated  arguments

between the Minister for Communications and  Works

and myself in this Chamber last year. While I will

admit that costs have come down, I still say  that

there  is room for further reduction. The  debates

that  we have during this week have shown  us  how

tight  money  is  going to be and how  pressed  we

shall be for finances to be able to carry out  the

programme for our schools and hospitals and  other

social work. I must therefore keep on hammering at

this  House  and  insist on  the  most  economical

method of building for the public services, taking

away  all the trimmings if necessary. We have come

to  a  stage  where  we must, I think,  build  for

utility and not as a monument for posterity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come now to the items on which I wish to

speak. The first one is the $100,000 that is being

asked  for garages for radio vehicles. This  seems

to  me  to  be  a very large sum for garages.  The

second item is $700,000 being asked for to provide

new  Divisional  Headquarters for Queenstown.  For

this sum I visualise a rather sumptuous office and

I  should like to know some of the costs for  this

building.  Then  we come to the super  building - $2

million  for  the new Headquarters of the  Special

Branch.  If  we were to spend millions of  dollars

for  all these items, I am afraid the finances  of

the  colony will not be able to stand  it,  and  I

would  like to have some explanation of the  money

asked for under this Head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I will try and answer the queries of

the Member for Paya Lebar as quickly as I can, Mr

Deputy  Chairman, Sir. I had better  try  and  put

this  in  perspective first by  referring  to  the

Public  Works Department's Report of a  comparable

territory where I find they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



have  done  the equivalent of about (Malayan)  $62

million worth of work, and personal emoluments and

similar  overheads  amounted to  $18�  million - in

other   words,   14.9  per  cent  of   the   total

expenditure. Sir, Singapore is only  6  per  cent.

So, in regard to that particular territory, we are

very  much more economical in personal emoluments,

which  is an important factor, of course,  in  the

final  cost of the building. Just as a  matter  of

interest, the expatriate staff in that territory's

building  works totalled 176 persons, at  a  total

expenditure  equivalent to (Malayan) $62  million,

compared  to (Malayan) $48 million here  where  we

are  using  only 28 expatriates, which is  a  very

considerable  difference. In other words,  we  are

doing  80  per cent as much work and we are  using

only  16 per cent of expatriate staff. In fact,  I

think half the -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Could we know the name of this territory?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is Hongkong. Sir, I think this

reflects  well  on the progress of  Malayanisation

achieved so far in this territory and also on  the

general efficiency of the department. I must  pass

on as quickly as I can, Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out that I have given details in

the  past  of  the machinery by which  we  try  to

effect our policy of economy and austerity - we have

various committees at different levels - and I have

also  given details of the achievements  which  we

have   made   in   economy,  and   very   handsome

achievements  they  are. I  will  not  waste  time

repeating them. I just wish to point out  that  we

do  control the designs of our buildings,  but  we

cannot  control the prices, which  depend  on  the

tenders  offered. There is a suggestion  that  the

quarters  may be too lavish. I have  with  me  the

agreed   scale  of  quarters  for  medical  staff:

housemen get 310 square feet per person at a  cost

of  $13,000; matrons in charge get 825 square feet

per  person  at a cost of $24,500; student  nurses

get 80 square feet per person at a cost of $4,500.

But  whatever  we  agree as  to  the  standard  of

building, the price will still depend on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



what the building trade is able to produce in  the

way  of tenders which are competitive; and in that

connection must remark that the building trade  is

not  at the moment producing as man tenders as  it

used to in the past. In fact, for one large job no

tenders were received and we had to put it out for

tender again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs are also rising, partly as a result of the

current  Suez crisis, and whilst I will give  some

figures in a minute, I cannot guarantee that  they

will be figures which will exist when the next lot

of  tenders come in, because the situation is  too

fluid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pass on to some more figures for

buildings. Let us take hospitals again. You divide

them  into three categories - A, B and C. That  part

of  the  hospital  which has  to  be  scrupulously

aseptic,   with  a  high  standard  of   finishes,

operating  theatres, and so  on,  category  A,  we

build at a cost of $1.41 a cubic foot. In category

B, mostly wards in major hospitals, where you have

to  make sure that they are clean and where you do

not  want  to  spend  money  on  cleaning  and  on

maintenance  which you have saved on building,  we

build  at  $1.05 a cubic foot; and for the  places

where   you   can  omit  the  expensive  finishes,

category  C, we get the cost down to  84  cents  a

cubic   foot.   We  can  vary  our  standards   in

accordance with what we can get the department  to

accept. That is one variable factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another variable factor is, of course, that we

cannot  necessarily choose our sites and say,  "We

will   choose   a   site  where   we   can   build

economically." We may have to put a  school  or  a

hospital where it will serve the public needs, and

the only site we can get may be a difficult one. I

will  refer  to  the  piled foundation  costs  for

schools -

the rehabilitation of those areas to make them fit

thoroughly  the  immediate acquisition  of  a  few

kampongs  purchased from the owners of  the  land,

and  to  provide roads, sanitation and  water  and

realign  the houses in these areas. Sir,  in  that

field   lies  the  most  fruitful  endeavour   for

assistance of the under-privileged and to meet the

threat which we all fear can only come through the

Member for Cairnhill - why  is  it that the provision for the acquisition

and  development of sites for resettlement is less

for  1957  than  it was for 1956 - the  position  is

this: that although for 1956 the sum of $4,800,000

was  voted  by  this Assembly, it is not  expected

that  that amount will be expended by the  end  of

this year; so the amount asked for - $4,000,000 - for

1957 is the probable amount that would be expended

by   the  Land  Office  for  the  acquisition  and

development of sites for resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised by the Member for

in  Singapore in order to rehabilitate the  people

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 6 (3), Primary Schools - Group

D, on page 379 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in response to my written question for

information  on the cost of building a  school  in

1955  and 1956, I have received a detailed  answer

which provides a number of interesting facts.  The

cost  of schools finished in 1956 ranges from  the

Tanjong  Katong  Secondary  Technical  School   at

$1,047,229 to a group of three primary schools  at

Bukit  Merah  which average $236,000 each.  It  is

notable  that  $185,000 was  spent  on  the  piled

foundation for the Tanjong Katong and $26,000  for

the  three  Bukit Merah schools. The  former  site

seems to have been somewhat ill chosen. Taking the

average  for  the 21 primary schools completed  in

1956,  $30,000 per school was spent on piling  and

$190,000  per  school on the  building,  that  is,

omitting the cost of the sites and the expenditure

on  grounds, fencing, drainage roads  and  so  on.

Piling  has become expensive because of the three-storey construction which is now fashionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the bringing down of costs, the

Minister for Communications and Works said that he

would welcome suggestions, and I have a suggestion

to  make regarding schools in the rural areas.  In

Ulu  Pandan  the  new barracks for  the  Singapore

Battalion   are   being   erected   as   temporary

buildings.  These  are  cheaply  built  one-storey

buildings   with  walls  made  of  some  specially

treated   hardboard,  but  they  look  solid   and

serviceable.  I have no doubt that in  ten  years'

time  they will still be standing, they will still

be  serviceable,  and they will  still  be  called

temporary. The advantage is that they can be built

with  the minimum of site clearance and they  need

not  be built on a large piece of flat ground, and

no  piling  is required. I know that the  Minister

for  Communications  and Works  will  look  at  me

rather  sadly and repeat that I have not  done  my

home-work,  and like the painstaking school-master

that  he  is, he is going to tell me about  higher

maintenance costs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



all  over  again. But, Sir, I think there  is  too

much  of this fetish of erecting buildings to last

for  a century. In this rapidly changing world and

this   rapidly   changing  Singapore,   there   is

something  to  be  said for planning  for  ten  to

fifteen  years  instead of the next generation  or

two  in  certain  types  of building  for  certain

purposes.  Building  techniques  change.  Teaching

requirements in a certain area can change,  and  I

can see no harm in allowing for them and in trying

to  use cheaper materials on an experimental basis

for  some of our schools. What is good enough  for

the  Singapore Battalion should be good enough  to

try in our schools, bearing in mind that it is the

character  and  the ability of the  teacher  which

matter in education and not the material that  the

walls  are made of. This is not to say that  I  am

not   appreciative  of  the  economy   of   school

building. The Minister gave us facts about it  the

other day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also mindful of the enormous changes which

have  come  over Singapore in ten years since  the

war.  The  changes  in  the next  decade  will  be

equally enormous, probably even more so. Sometimes

I think that we are caught too much in the grip of

expert  planners who wish to plan our future  much

further  ahead than we ourselves can see. I  know,

Sir,  that for expressing these awful heresies,  I

should  probably  go down to  the  bottom  of  the

class,  but nevertheless I hope that the  Minister

for  Education  and his educational  experts  will

remember  that many students on this island  today

are being taught quite successfully in schools not

made or bricks and mortar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I want to refer to one small matter on

page 379 of the Estimates - the point on which I  am

moving  this amendment. It seems to me a  question

of   primary  school  mathematics.  Under   "Group

D - fifteen  schools",  there  is  an  estimate   of

$4,680,000;   whereas  under   "Group   C - eighteen

schools", there is provision for a similar amount.

It  would  seem  to  me,  therefore,  that  it  is

proposed  to spend more per school under  Group  D

than Group C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, as

regards  the same provision for Group C and  Group

D, perhaps I can explain to the Member for Tanglin

that  the  15  primary  schools  in  Group  D  are

designed to accommodate as many pupils as  the  18

schools in Group C. By reducing the dimensions and

simplifying  the  structure, it  was  the  aim  to

reduce  the total cost of the schools in Group  D.

Each  of  the new type schools in Group D  has  18

classrooms and the cost is expected to be  reduced

by  a  considerable amount at least, but the costs

of material and labour have remained unchanged. In

fact, in certain respects, costs have increased by

16   per   cent.  The  Suez  crisis   has   caused

contractors  to  be  somewhat  nervous  about  the

prices   of  steel  and  cement  and  also   other

important building materials. Moreover,  the  best

sites  have been used up and I think future  sites

will  cost  even  more, especially  in  regard  to

piling, levelling and filling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that cheaper buildings be built

has been gone into by my Ministry and the Ministry

of  Communications and Works.  We  have  not  lost

sight   of  it.  We  have,  in  fact,  a  building

committee meeting very frequently to deliberate on

the  question.  Some people have advocated  to  me

that,  in the interests of economy, wood and attap

buildings  be  put  up. When  we  went  into  this

question, it was found to be more uneconomical, as

both  wood and attap have to be imported from  the

Federation  of Malaya, our nearest neighbour,  and

they would therefore cost us more than they do the

Federation. Vacant land is also scarce and we have

to build three - or four-storey schools and plan for

the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also to take into consideration the

Master   Plan.  New  satellite  towns  are   being

planned.  Areas  have  been ear-marked  for  green

belts  and  open space, and we have  to  plan  our

schools  accordingly. Instead of putting up  cheap

wooden  huts  or  attap  buildings,  we  have  now

planned  to  put up cheap smaller schools  in  the

rural  areas,  so that they can last  for  ten  to

twenty  years,  by which time, of course,  we  may

plan  for bigger buildings if the demand justifies

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should also like to mention that bricks

and tiles are manufactured in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



Singapore, and if we build schools with bricks and

tiles,  we  are  actually  giving  employment   to

thousands of people. However, I wish to assure the

Member  for Tanglin and the House in general  that

we  are always trying to reduce our costs but,  at

the  same time, taking into consideration the cost

of maintenance, sites, and other questions related

to the building.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Will the Minister for Education take

into  consideration the building of the  Singapore

will be used for several years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 46-(Continued)



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on Head D 46.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lim Koon Teck -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 13, Singapore Polytechnic, on

page 379 of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I wish to withdraw this

motion and speak under the general Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $17,020,140 for Head D 46 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are now 25 minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, when we were informed

that the Polytechnic was going to cost at least

three times as much as budgeted for, in the first

instance, a great deal of agitation was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



shown  by  every Member of this Assembly  and  the

public of Singapore. Since then, we have been told

that  most of the cost is due to the expansion  or

to the more ambitious planning and not so much due

to  the cost of the building itself. All the same,

I  think  that we have to go into detail  and  see

that  this vast expenditure of nearly $10  miIlion

should be carefully used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest item of the Polytechnic is the six-storey teaching block which will cost round about

$3  million,  working out at about  $20  a  square

foot.  The  Minister for Communications and  Works

has  given us an indication of the cost  of  round

about  $13  a  square  foot for  the  three-storey

primary schools. I think personally that the  cost

of  this  Polytechnic for the six-storey  building

can  be brought more or less in line with the cost

of  these primary schools. We know very well  that

the main cost of the building is the finishing. It

can cost as much as the structure itself. I do not

propose that any alteration should be made to this

structure  because I understand that  the  job  is

ready  for tender and part of it is already  being

built  but  I do submit that we and the  Estimates

Committee  of which I am a Member should  go  into

great detail and see what cost we can cut down  in

the ornaments of this building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item which attracted our attention was

the  very,  very big provision for the architect's

fee.  If  the job were competed as visualised  now

costing  $8  million for the buildings  alone,  we

would  have to pay the architect $800,000. This  I

submit, Sir, is a stupendous amount. In the Budget

today, the programme is cut down and we are  asked

to  budget for $5� million for which we will have

to  pay  the  architect just over half  a  million

dollars.  When  we went into the question  of  why

such a big fee has to be paid, we found that under

the   Architects  Ordinance,  there  is  provision

whereby  the flat fee of 7� per cent  was  to  be

charged and the architects' stand is that they are

bound  by that scale of fees and they cannot  give

us  any reduction. This scale of fees was approved

by  this  Assembly only last June when I was  away

but Members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



this  Assembly have told me that had they realised

that  this  amounted to 7� per cent  plus  2� per

cent  for quantity survey, making it ten per  cent

in all and had they been informed of this enormous

sum of half a million dollars, they would not have

agreed to this scale of fees. In fact, so many  of

them are so agitated that there is a definite move

to  repeal  section 4 of the Architects  Ordinance

whereby   the   power  that  was  given   to   the

Architects'  Board to fix the fee  will  be  taken

away  from  them. I think this is rather  a  hasty

move.  I have consulted many architects and  I  am

told  that  the  position of architects  is  quite

different from that of other people. They are more

or  less like the lawyers in that, if there is any

defect in the building or should the building fall

down,  they have to make good. They have to  carry

that   responsibility  simply  because  the   City

Council  and  the  Government do not  have  enough

supervisors  to watch the progress of a  building.

Therefore the responsibility is passed over to the

architects  for which it is quite reasonable  that

he  should be sufficiently remunerated but at this

scale,  when  $10  million  of  public  money   is

involved and, in about two years, an architect can

earn  between half a million dollars to  $800,000,

then  I  think  that all Members will  agree  with

me - in  fact, many of them are insisting - that  this

scale  should  be  sent  back  to  the  Board   of

Architects  with  a  request  that  it  should  be

revised  so  that there is a reducing  scale  say:

after  the  first  half  a million  dollars  or  a

million  dollars, if you like, there should  be  a

reducing  scale and make this whole fee reasonable

and acceptable to us. This revised scale -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it that the hon.

Member  is  still on the subject of the  Singapore

Polytechnic?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir, because this is

connected with the half a million dollars  payable

by  us.  The  suggestion that I make is  that  the

whole  scale should be referred back to  them  and

then it should come back for approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a similar scale of fees charged by the

solicitors in Singapore for conveyancing and their

scale runs from 4� per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



cent  for the first thousand dollars to about half

per  cent  for  any  amount over  half  a  million

dollars. I am not suggesting that the same amounts

should apply.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I

very  much  regret that there is  no  contribution

made  under this Head or items to the Dewan Bahasa

dan  Pustaka (which means the Institute  of  Malay

Language  and  Literature).  This  body,  Sir,  is

sponsored  primarily by the Federation  Government

and  is  aimed  at making the Malay  language  the

truly national language of the country. I am sure,

Sir, that this is in line with our aspirations for

a united Malaya in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I remember rightly, the Assistant

Minister for Education was present at the  opening

of  the  Language and Literary Congress in  Johore

Bahru on the 18th of September, 1956, representing

the Minister for Education. He said in his speech,

Sir,  "The Congress will be given every assistance

from the Singapore Government to the learning  and

teaching  of  the Malay language," and  yet,  Sir,

only the Federation Government is subsidising  the

Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. What can be better proof

of  this  Government's sincerity to the  statement

made  by the Assistant Minister for Education than

to   join  the  Federation  in  subsidising   this

Institute? Certainly, Sir, $l25,000 spent on  this

Institute  would have brought much greater  result

to  a  greater number of people than the  $125,000

given to the Young Women's Christian Association.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I

rise  to  endorse the statement just made  by  the

Member for Paya Lebar regarding the criticisms  on

the  Polytechnic.  I  will  also  practise  speech

control,  and I wish only to add that the Minister

for   Education  should  carefully  consider  this

widely  criticised  project, and  make  sure  that

every  cent allocated to it by the Education Board

is  well  spent,  because this is our  hard-earned

money and we are in very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



great  need  of  it to implement  our  educational

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to touch upon the subject of grants-in-aid. I am very happy indeed to see the size of

the  capital  grant  given to vernacular  schools,

especially  the  increase grant  to  help  Chinese

schools,  but I wish the Government will not  stop

at  doing only that. More money should be given to

expand vernacular education in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I do not know whether I am correct or

not,  but  I  remember  it was  mentioned  in  the

Governor's   Address  regarding  the   educational

policy that the Government was looking forward  to

helping  Nanyang University but I am surprised  to

find  in these Development Estimates no indication

of Government's intention to do so.



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, before I say anything on this subject, I wish

to  make it clear that I realise how important the

Polytechnic  is to Singapore and that  no  expense

should  be  spared  in making this  the  best  one

possible but, at the same time, I cannot  see  the

necessity   for  a  luxurious  building.   As   an

architect,  Sir,  I am unable  even  to  allow  my

imagination  to stretch to whatever extent  I  may

that  the  Government should ask for $5�  million

for the Polytechnic whereas the Nanyang University

which has three Faculties, a library, hostels  for

about  600 students, a sewerage purification plant

and about a couple of miles of road could be built

for less than $3� million. Since the announcement

of  the  revised cost, strong criticism  has  been

made  by  Members of this House  as  well  as  the

public  and  the Press of the high cost.  In  this

respect, Sir, I am grateful to the Government  for

sending  me a memorandum giving an explanation  of

how  this cost is arrived at. I have gone  through

the  memorandum thoroughly and I for  one  am  not

convinced  with  the  explanation  at   all.   For

instance,  $30 per square foot has been  given  as

the  estimate of the cost of a square foot of  the

Polytechnic whereas the hotel now being built by a

Class A P.W.D. contractor in Orchard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



Road  includes shops downstairs, a restaurant  and

140  bed-rooms  upstairs, each  with  a  bath-room

attached  complete  with all  fittings,  including

piling  which  goes down to 70 feet  and  it  only

costs $12.50 a square foot. If piling is excluded,

it  will  come down to $11 a square foot.  Another

instance  is  the Nanyang Girls' School  which  is

also   being  built  by  another  Class  A  P.W.D.

contractor and which works out at less than $8 per

square foot complete. Numerous instances could  be

quoted  in  comparison, if desired. Even  allowing

for  foundation  for  heavy  machinery  and  extra

heights of rooms, I think that the $30 per  square

foot quoted is still fantastic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with the Member for Paya Lebar that

the   question  of  architects'  fees  should   be

reconsidered. As an architect, Sir, I  do  welcome

such protection but as a Member of this House  who

has   to  protect  the  public,  I  must  ask  the

Government to have this vote amended at  an  early

date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Well said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Another point put up by the

Government   in  the  memorandum   is   that   the

Government could not do it cheaper than a  private

architect  because  they  would  have  to   engage

quantity surveyors of whom they have none  or,  at

least,  none available yet. Are quantities  really

required  for  a  building like  the  Polytechnic?

Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of buildings

have been constructed by the Singapore Improvement

Trust and private architects in the past few years

and  none of them had quantities. No such practice

is  adopted  in America. In fact, some years  ago,

the Singapore Improvement Trust put up two tenders

for  some  flats  on  exactly the  same  plan  and

specification: one with quantities and  the  other

without.  The  tender for the one with  quantities

came  out  eight  per  cent higher  than  the  one

without quantities. In cutting out quantities, the

Government will not only save on the fees  of  the

quantity  surveyor but it will also  save  on  the

price of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



tender  because  I  know of many  instances  where

contractors  have had to wait for  months  to  get

paid  as  the  quantity surveyor  engaged  by  the

Government was overwhelmed with work. If  one  has

to  wait  so  long  for his money,  one  naturally

increases his price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government seems to have a tendency of

spending lavishly on buildings, if left unchecked.

They do not seem to realise the value of money  at

all. For instance, I know of a case where they put

a  $3  per square foot floor finish for some flats

at  Leonie  Hill which are only meant  for  junior

officers.  I  myself  have  designed  houses   for

millionaires and luxurious flats and  at  no  time

has  the floor finish cost exceeded $2 per  square

foot.  Another instance is the recently  completed

Nurses  Hostel.  I  remember distinctly  that  the

Minister for Communications and Works said at  its

opening  that the Government had brought down  the

cost  from $6,000 per unit to $4,000 per  unit.  I

think  that  the  Minister  concerned  should   be

congratulated for his good work. If the Government

could make a saving in this case, why did not  the

Government make it in previous cases?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, hon. Members can see that if

Government  takes  the trouble to  scrutinise  the

cost carefully, savings could be made. I therefore

plead with Government to appoint a committee to go

into the matter thoroughly thereby hoping that the

cost might be reduced by one-third or more as  the

Nurses Hostel which opened lately.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir,

recently  there  has  been a very  great  deal  of

uninformed  criticism  about  the  cost   of   the

Polytechnic  and  I  would  like  to   take   this

opportunity of stating the facts clearly once  and

for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report issued by the Dobby Committee, the

first  Committee  to go into the question  of  the

Polytechnic,  stated  that the  estimated  capital

cost  of the Polytechnic would be $8 million.  The

Report did not, however, go into details as to how

this figure was made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



up.   When  Mr  Gibson  came  out  to   make   an

investigation  into the question  of  establishing

the  Polytechnic, he did, in fact, make  a  rough

estimate  of  cost  and that  is  broken  down  as

follows:  Buildings  $3.7 million;  Furniture  and

Fittings  for  the Buildings $47  million;  Heavy

Equipment  $1.01  million,  making  a   total   of

$5,196,000. This figure was accepted by Government

until  such  time  as  plans could  be  drawn  and

accurate  estimates  of cost  made.  Planning  did

proceed   thereafter  and  a   firm   of   private

architects  was employed on the recommendation  of

the  Executive  Council with the  consent  of  the

Finance Committee of the then Legislative Council.

When  their plans were completed, they  were  sent

home to the Secretary of State's Board of Advisers

on  Technical  Colleges.  This  Board  immediately

condemned the plans in so far as only seven  acres

of  land were used and the area, having regard  to

the  buildings which would be placed in it and the

functions which they would have to serve, would be

too   congested.   Subsequently,  therefore,   the

architects were asked to re-draw their  plans  and

they did so. The estimate of cost of the new plans

is   as   follows:  Site  preparation  will   take

$150,000. The workshop and navigation block, which

Mr  Gibson  left out of his estimate, will  total

$986,000. The six-storey teaching block, which  is

the  main  part  of  the  Polytechnic,  will  cost

$956,000.  The administrative block,  library  and

lecture  rooms  above the administration  building

will cost $766,000. The architects' fees will come

to  $504,000;  making a total  of  $5,362,884.  In

addition,  it had been suggested that a  gymnasium

and  students'  union  costing  $253,000  and   an

auditorium and canteen costing $1,689,000,  making

a  total  of  $1,942,000 should be undertaken.  In

addition also, heavy equipment for the Polytechnic

including furniture and fittings is estimated  now

to cost $2,500,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these estimates came to me in my capacity as

Financial  Secretary,  I  immediately  asked   the

Director  of Public Works to examine them  with  a

tine tooth-comb to see that they were accurate  in

all respects. Then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



Director  of Works in answer to my request  turned

them over to the Chief Architect of the Government

who  examined them and found that they were in all

respects reasonable minimum estimates of the  cost

of  the  amount of work which had to be  done.  At

that  stage,  I  held a meeting  with  all  people

connected  with  the  Polytechnic,  and   it   was

decided, and subsequently confirmed by the Council

of  Ministers, that we would go ahead for the time

being with work amounting to $5.5 million and,  of

course, with the purchase of equipment to the tune

of  $2,500,000, leaving the other work -  gymnasium

and students' union, auditorium and canteen - to  be

undertaken  at  some  future date  if  money  were

available.  It was made clear that no  undertaking

could  be  given to the Board of Trustees  of  the

Polytechnic  that  this  additional   work   would

subsequently be undertaken. In the opinion of  the

Committee  which sat on the matter in  my  office,

this  work  was not regarded as essential  to  the

successful operation of the Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at the moment, Government's total

commitment in respect of the Polytechnic  is  $5.5

million  in  respect  of capital  works  and  $2.5

million in respect of equipment, making a total of

$8  million  altogether. The  other  work  on  the

gymnasium, students' union, auditorium and canteen

will  be left until very much later and will  then

depend upon whether funds are available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other items which I should mention: a request from the Board of Trustees of the

Polytechnic  for  the provision of  playing-fields

which  was  estimated  to cost  $500,000  and  the

provision of $1 million for houses. Both of  these

requests  have been turned down. It is hoped  that

accommodation  for  expatriate officers  who  will

have  to  be employed by the Polytechnic  will  be

found amongst existing Government quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the cost of the building in

page 383 of the Estimates.



<br><br>I  do  so,  Sir, because I see that the  estimated

$3,200,000 as at first budgeted. I would  like  to

know the policy of Government on this matter:  Why

is  it  necessary  to  double  the  cost  of  this

particular hospital?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.01p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the first estimate

of   $3.2  million  was  based  on  a  pure  paper

calculation  of  the  cubic  measurement  of   the

schedule  of accommodation for a 400-bed  hospital

without  provision  of residential  accommodation.

That  estimate was also made without any knowledge

of the site to be chosen. The new estimate of $6.5

million  includes  $2  million  for  quarters  for

residential    staff,   Medical    Superintendent,

sisters,  nurses and servants. It also allows  for

the   provision  of  450  beds.  Fifty  additional

maternity beds have been added, making a total  of

100  because  of  the  very  evident  pressure  on

Kandang  Kerbau  Hospital where accommodation  has

reached saturation point and where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



overcrowding constitutes now a real danger to  the

new-born. It was also made with knowledge  of  the

site.  I think that, at the last sitting here,  in

answer  to  the  same hon. gentleman,  I  gave  an

account to the House of the cause of the delay  on

the  final  choice  of the site. A  multi-storeyed

building is envisaged on the land which is  to  be

acquired  on East Coast Road, at the end of  Tanah

Merah  Ketchil  Road. A pavilion hospital  of  450

beds  is  not  an  economic proposition,  because,

firstly,  it would require 40 acres of  flat  land

instead of 18 acres at present envisaged. It would

not  be  cheaper  to  build  because  foundations,

roofs,  sewage pipes, water distribution, electric

distribution, piping of steam and oxygen,  and  so

forth,  would  be  far more extensive  than  in  a

compact   multi-storeyed  building.   Furthermore,

recurrent costs would be higher because  a  larger

supervisory  and subordinate staff is required  to

make  up  for  the  time wasted  in  walking  long

distances between wards and departments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Telephone.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I regard what the hon. Minister said as completely unsatisfactory.

The  changes in Government's policy regarding this

hospital  require  a great deal  more  explanation

than we have so far been given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will remember that last year,

we  were  informed that the original choice  of  a

site  for  this  hospital was at Katong  somewhere

near  the  Sea  View Hotel and that it  was  being

scrapped  in  favour  of a  site  at  the  Kallang

airport.  Sir,  last year, I spoke as  follows  on

this  very  subject; if I may have your permission

to  quote,  from what I said, column 1335  of  our

Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I can readily believe that most of the old

airfield  area is not suitable for heavy buildings

because  of  piling problems on reclaimed  land... Is

the  new district hospital then to cost more  than

it  need  because it is going to be  built  on  an

unsuitable  site? Is a great deal of piling  going

to  put  up the cost per bed of this hospital?  Is

the  Minister satisfied that this is not only  the

best  site  geographically but also  the  cheapest

from the taxpayers' point of view? I hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



hon. Members opposite will not feel that these are

destructive, sterile questions. What we want is to

be convinced that the right decisions have been

made in the public interests."



<br><br>Sir,   in   reply  to  that,  the   Minister   for

Communications and Works came to the rescue of his

colleague and stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps I can help him out on some technical

details  about  that one. The first  non-technical

detail,  of  course, is that  the  site  there  is

already  Government property. We have not  got  to

pay  very high prices for it. In that respect,  of

course, the site is eminently eligible because  it

is  free. Secondly, it is eligible because  it  is

very  well  situated from a demographic  point  of

view  because the population around is both  heavy

and poor and it is therefore a very suitable place

for a hospital to be where the poor people can get

into it easily."



<br><br>Now, Sir, one year later, the choice of a new site

is made in the Bedok area which is a less populous

area  and  the cost is to be doubled. We are  told

that  the estimate of $3,200,000 was done  without

knowledge  of the site to be chosen and I  submit,

Sir,  therefore, that the figures given last  year

were, in some respects, bogus.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot allow the word

"bogus".



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I withdraw that word, Sir, and I will

use the word "inaccurate".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like also, if I may, to refer to column 1342 in the same debate in which the Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the sum of $3,200,000 is for a 450-bed hospital

with all the equipment and conveniences."



<br><br>Why  this  change of thought? Why this  change  of

plan?  Why the doubling of this estimate? It seems

to  me  a  monstrous waste of time and a monstrous

waste of public money.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I thought that I

gave  a  full  explanation of  that  at  the  last

sitting.  I  do  not know whether the  Member  for

Tanglin was paying sufficient attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kallang site was originally chosen because it

was  an  ideal  spot;  and  as  the  Minister  for

Communications and Works pointed out, it was in  a

thickly populated area. When we got down to  basic

facts, we found that piling there would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



be considerably more expensive than was originally

anticipated.  Taking  this into  consideration  we

still  felt  that it would be an ideal  spot,  but

finally we discovered that it was right in the air

funnel, that is to say, it would be in the  direct

line  of  all planes landing and taking  off  from

Singapore,  a  line from the new  airport  to  St.

John's Island.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Why was that not discovered before?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That is a thing which I cannot answer

the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Who can?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> When it was discovered that this was

right  in  the  air funnel, I placed the  question

before our Medical Advisory Council to seek  their

advice  whether that would in any way  affect  the

health  of  the  patients  in  the  hospital.  The

majority  opinion of the Medical Advisory  Council

was that it would, much to my disappointment. Then

we sought other sites. I think I also informed the

House that I had also in view a site near the  Sea

View  Hotel  and  that  when  we  went  into   the

question, it was ascertained the land belonged  to

a  building  society and that plans  for  building

purposes were completed. Finally, we inspected two

sites in the Bedok area and chose the one which is

immediately behind the Fisheries Research  Station

which   we   now  find  to  be  an   ideal   site.

Incidentally,  I  might mention that  the  outdoor

patients  clinic at the old site  of  the  Malayan

Airways  canteen  is  now  under  construction  or

undergoing additions and alterations. When our new

hospital     is    ready,    anybody     requiring

hospitalisation will be sent there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $10,546,490 for Head D 49 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am only

taking up this matter on the question of the  cost

mainly,  in  this  case, of the accommodation  for

housemen  and sisters. You will notice here  that

for  all  the quarters, the estimate for  each  of

which I shall deal with, there is already provided

a  sum  of $1,400,000 for Ancillary Services which

means  that when we come to calculate the cost  of

each  quarter, we shall have to take  out  of  our

consideration  the  roads, the water  supply,  the

electric supply and the sanitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point that I am dealing with is sub-head 13 (4) at page 383 of the Development

Estimates  and  there  is  $1,250,000  asked   for

accommodation for 78 sisters which  works  out  at

about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



$16,000 per flat. That, I submit, Sir, is still  a

high figure and I think that $12,000 per flat  for

a sister would be suitable accommodation because I

know  for a fact that many private architects  are

building  very  comfortable flats  with  two  bed-rooms,  a sitting-room, and a dining-room complete

around $12,000 each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sub-head that I would like to speak on

is   14   (2)   at  page  383  of  the  Development

Estimates.  There we have $450,000  asked  for  to

provide  accommodation for  12  medical  officers.

This  is an increase over last year's estimate  of

50  per cent and it works out at $37,000 per flat.

Now  I  know that we have paid sums like this  for

accommodating previous officers and professors  in

the  University but I think we have come to a time

when  we  must be more realistic and cut down  the

cost of accommodation for our officers. Every  one

of  us,  big  or  small, is  asked  to  contribute

towards  income tax and our taxes  are  rising  by

leaps  and bounds. I am quite sure that when these

officers,  who  will  in the future  occupy  these

flats, are asked to give their opinion, they  will

agree with us in that they are prepared to live in

a less luxurious manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sub-head that I wish to touch on is 14

(4) ,  Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital. There  we

have   "Additions  and  Alterations  to   existing

Hospital Buildings" and the sum is $2 million.  It

seems to be a lot of money for alterations alone!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sub-head that I wish to comment on is 15

(4)   on  page  384  of the Development  Estimates,

Students Nurses Hostel and Training School. There,

the  estimated cost of $1,200,000 asked  for  last

year  is  now  revised  at  $2  million.  Why  the

increase?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would like to draw the attention of this

House  to sub-head 15 (5) . Here, the amount  asked

for  is $750,000 for Quarters for 40 Sisters which

works out at nearly $20,000 a flat. That, again, I

submit,  Sir,  is  a standard of living  which  we

cannot afford today.



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on the question of

quarters for housemen, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



was   a  statutory  provision  that  all  medical,

graduates   must  have  a  first-year  residential

housemanship before registration and  the  working

party  of the medical building has agreed  on  the

standard  scale of accommodation for  the  medical

staff  who  may  be required to live  in  quarters

within  the  hospital  compound.  The  provisional

estimate of the cost per unit of accommodation has

been  worked out as follows: Houseman, 310 square

feet  which works out at $13,000 cost per  quarter

for a normal site, including furniture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform hon. Members of the House

that  all  buildings  on the Kandang  Kerbau  site

require piling. On the flats for medical officers,

the  original estimate of $300,000 was  for  eight

medical  officers. Now this has been increased  to

accommodation  for  twelve medical  officers.  The

amount  of $36,000 from that sum will be  required

for  piling  and that reduces it to about  $34,000

per flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of additions and alterations to

the  buildings, sub-head 14 (4) , page 383  of  the

Development Estimates, it is already evident  that

the estimate of $2 million for the work needed  at

the  Kandang  Kerbau Hospital will  be  sufficient

only to cover the cost of the gynaecological unit.

Essential  alterations to this  teaching  hospital

will  be  needed in future years and new provision

will  have to be made when the time comes. I would

like  you  to  appreciate that the Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital is a teaching hospital and as such has to

keep up with certain standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sub-head 15 (4), Student Nurses Hostel and

Training School, this will be the main centre  for

the  training of assistant nurses and it  must  be

noted  that  the $2 million is only a  provisional

estimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sub-head 15 (5), Quarters for forty Sisters,

it  is  doubtful  whether  this  project  will  be

proceeded  with.  It is expected  that  sufficient

accommodation   for  unmarried  sisters   may   be

available at the new general hospital building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered the question of costs on

sub-head 14 (3), Ancillary Ser-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



vices. The explanation is given on page 436 of the

Estimates which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provision has been made for roads, water,

electricity   supplies  and   sewerage   for   new

buildings."



<br><br>Provision  for  ancillary services  is  only  made

under  a  separate item in the  case  of  a  large

project  where  services are  shared  between  the

various buildings included in the project.  It  is

not  possible  exactly to apportion  the  cost  of

joint services between the various buildings being

supplied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have not covered all of the points raised, I

would  like  my  attention  drawn  at  this  stage

because I propose going on to something else  with

your  permission, Mr Chairman, as I feel that  it

is  my  duty to inform hon. Members of  the  House

something about the chronic hospital which  is  to

be built -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Hon. Minister is

departing  from  the  present debate.  Perhaps  he

could  consider making a ministerial statement  at

an  appropriate time. There has not been a  debate

on   that  particular  subject;  perhaps  he  will

consider that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Thank you, Mr Chairman, but the

position is that I have to point out to the  House

that on the question of costing, there might be an

amendment to the figures. It is going to  be  much

higher  than  it was originally. May I  have  your

permission, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I would like to draw the attention of

hon.  Members  to  sub-head 9, page  383,  of  the

Development Estimates. The revised estimated  cost

is   shown   at  $2.9  million  and  the  previous

estimated cost was $1.5 million. I have to explain

that the estimate of $1.5 million was made without

knowledge of the exact size and on a "diagrammatic

line  drawing" of the cheapest possible  envisaged

pavilion-type  hospital of 200 beds.  Since  then,

available Crown land at Thomson Road was  surveyed

and we decided that a pavilion-type hospital meant

an  extravagant  use  of land.  It  was  therefore

decided  to use plans already drawn and  available

for a multi-storeyed building. The use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



existing  plans would save 12 to 18 months'  delay

and  enable work to start early in 1957  and  when

estimating  the  $2.9  million,  it  was  only  to

provide a hospital of 180 beds. Now in the process

of  detailed planning, it was found that it  would

be  cheaper  in  the long run to build  a  396-bed

hospital on a single site rather than to build one

180-bed hospital now at a cost of $2.9 million and

another  at  a  later date at the same  cost.  The

estimate  therefore for a 396-bed  hospital  using

existing  plans is $4.65 million. In other  words,

we  can provide 396 beds in one hospital for  $1.5

million   less  than  we  can  build  two  180-bed

hospitals.   Again  studying  the  necessity   for

relieving the General Hospital of beds blocked  by

chronic  or  incurable  patients,  we  find   that

approximately  300  beds  are  constantly  blocked

there  so  that  the figure of 396  beds  for  the

chronic sick is not excessive. The Government  now

therefore proposes to go forward with the  396-bed

project as an economic figure in the long  run  so

that the figure should now read $4,650,000 instead

of $2,900,000. Doubling the size of the project is

now much less than double the cost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, with your

permission,  I would like to ask the Minister  for

Health  whether he is aware of the  great  service

rendered  to  the poor, especially  in  the  rural

areas,  by the travelling dispensary unit? I  have

looked through the Development Estimates and it is

surprising  that this unit has not had any  chance

to  expand  its activities. I have approached  the

Ministry of Health and have asked them to increase

the  visits  of the travelling dispensary  to  the

poor  living in the congested kampongs and in  the

rural  areas  and to send, if possible,  a  doctor

along  with this travelling dispensary. I am  sure

we  are  aware that the really poor sick  patients

have  not got the bus fare or the means to  enable

them  to  go  to the hospitals and the  only  help

which   they   can  get  is  from  the  travelling

dispensary.  Therefore I would like  the  Minister

for Health to inform us whether or not it is still

his intention to develop such facilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, for the information

of the Member for Changi, there are six travelling

dispensaries and three mobile dental clinics  with

trailers  and  generators and  these  visit  rural

areas   regularly  with  a  medical   officer   in

attendance. If the hon. Member can point  out  any

particular  rural area which he complains  is  not

being properly attended to, I will be glad to take

the matter in hand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I would like to say a word, Mr

Chairman, about the suggestion that we might  call

on  our officers to accept smaller quarters. There

is this factor to bear in mind. We have heard many

statements in here about the very heavy burden  of

dependants  which  Asians have to  carry  in  this

country  and  which expatriates  do  not  have  to

carry.  This  was, of course, thought  of  by  the

Public  Works  Department quite a  long  time  ago

because  it  is  in  fact  true  that  the  normal

expatriate does send his children back to England.

He  has young children around and he does not have

boys  of  15, 16, 17, and 20 years old  having  to

live  in the same house with him but they  are  at

home   in   England  attending  a  school   or   a

university. Here if a doctor has children and they

are  going  to live with him, they will remain  in

the  house with him until they themselves  set  up

families  and, no doubt, he will go and live  with

them  when  he  retires. But there  is  a  genuine

aspect, to my mind, that if you leave the quarters

as  they are, you will, in fact, be providing less

accommodation  because there will be  more  people

having  to  live in them, if the Asian  custom  is

followed.  That  is one point. To give  a  further

deduction would be a double deduction. You see the

point  and  I  do  not  wish to  elaborate  on  it

further. It is a simple arithmetical point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out that the figures for

quarters do include furniture and that must not be

overlooked  when you are taking into  account  the

overall costs. I would just like to refer to  some

notes  I got from Nigeria which is not necessarily

a  wholly comparable territory where one's general

standard is rather low but there, in the new block

for  sisters, each sister gets a flatlet, that  is

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



say, living space, bed-room, kitchenette and bath-room.  In  other  words, she has  a  little  self-contained  flat  of  her  own.  That  is  not  yet

necessary in Singapore but if we are going to  get

people  into  the nursing service  and  the  other

services in the Government, then they have got  to

be given positions which are attractive to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just run through as far as I can see the

whole of the departments in my Ministry. There was

a  motion  to  cut out the grant  for  the  senior

quantity  surveyor, a most ill-judged  motion.  We

had  to  put  it  in  because  it  was  absolutely

necessary to put that senior quantity surveyor  in

and  it  should  be a career which  would  attract

people into the service. You had a vacancy  for  a

year;  it was advertised locally and there was  no

applicant.  It  was also advertised  overseas  and

there  was no applicant. Luckily, we got two young

men  in  the  pipe  line coming out  for  training

shortly: one will be in the next year, I hope, and

we shall not increase our vacancies. But if we are

going to get young men or young women to come into

the  service and to stay in, you have to give them

attractive  conditions  which,  in  Singapore,  is

likely to mean giving them quarters because it  is

very hard to get proper housing in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just make these points because I do not think

that  the  Government should be accused  of  undue

lavishness in the treatment of its officers.  They

do a very good job of work and if you are going to

retain  them,  you must recognise their  qualities

and   their   services  by  giving   them   proper

conditions to live under.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I just

want  to  ask the Minister whether the 60 housemen

to  be  provided for are people who are quite  old

and   have  many  children?  I  believe  that  the

housemen   are  probably  people  who  have   just

graduated and they might be single or married but,

I  do not think that they can produce children  at

the  rate as alleged by the Minister. Again on the

matter  of sisters and matrons, I think  they  are

usually  confined to single ones and if  they  are

married,  probably  the  husbands  will  have   to

provide the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



quarters. Facts like these should be presented  to

the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> If I can just enlighten the hon.

Member,  I  think he misunderstood me.  I  am  not

suggesting that the houseman is going to  breed  a

family in the course of the two years that he  has

to  perform in a hospital. I am saying the general

principle  is  that you have to  provide  adequate

quarters -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Family Planning Association!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The fact that the houseman may be

practising  or  teaching family  planning  is  not

really  the  point. The point is that if  you  are

providing  for married couples with children,  you

must  provide them with adequate quarters.  For  a

houseman,  I  think the figure of 310 square  feet

quoted   earlier  today - I  cannot  recollect   for

certain - is  not  an  excessive  allowance  for  a

qualified professional man living as a bachelor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am very

glad  that  the  Minister for  Communications  and

Works  confirmed  that a houseman  only  gets  310

square feet. That will mean one sitting-room,  one

bed-room  and a lavatory. Now at 310  square  feet

for  a flat of $13,000, the cost for that flat  is

$40  a  square  foot which is really  a  fantastic

costing. No doubt, it includes furniture but I  do

not  think  that  the  cost  of  furniture  for  a

houseman's  flat would come to more  than  $3,000.

The cost for a flat in a residential area is $12 a

square  foot. I think it comes to about that  much

for  a  fairly  luxurious  flat  at  Orchard  Road

opposite  the  Prince's being built  on  a  burial

ground  and  I frankly can not see why  we  cannot

come down to that standard.

<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $130,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1, Community Centres, on  page

387 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I am not totally against the building

of  community  centres, I find  that,  invariably,

community centres have been built in such a manner

that  they  earn no more than the name  "community

centres". My idea of a community centre is that it

should  be readily available to the people and  it

should serve a great multiplicity of functions  to

the  community living around it. The  present  day

type  of  community centre, Sir, serves a somewhat

unorganised  population, and probably only  girls'

or  boys'  clubs with perhaps one or two  meetings

rarely of other organisations far in between.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look at the way in which the community

of Singapore carry on with their work. I will just

point out one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



instance.  In one locality, invariably,  you  will

find  that  there are people who are  not  of  the

Christian  faith  but  who  like  to  run   public

wayangs.  I find that one section of the community

will  go around and build a stage, run the  wayang

for  about  two days for the public and then  pull

down  the stage and after two days, another  party

will stage another wayang there. In one particular

locality, you might have seven repeat performances

in  a month and for each performance, it incurs an

expenditure  of  nearly $1,000.  So  if  community

centres  are  going  to serve  the  public,  these

points must be taken into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, community centres obviously must help the

public  in all sorts of functions. Probably  these

centres have not been publicised or no attempt has

been  made in that direction. Very few people know

where  community centres are and probably they  do

not  know how to apply for the use of them so that

even  in  the  locality where there are  community

centres,  we  find  that many  people  still  hold

functions in their houses which are too small  for

the  occasion.  So all in all,  I  find  that  the

community centres which have been built  have  not

been  serving the public as they should. They have

only  been white elephants, and if they are  going

to  remain as white elephants, we should expend no

more  money on them. One reason for that is  this.

When a community centre is to be built, the people

around  the area are not consulted or if they  are

consulted,  the opinion given must have  been  the

opinion  of a few who do not know much  about  the

area. A community centre built right behind a  row

of  shophouses half a mile from a village  is  no

attraction to the people but it should be  central

to  that locality, just like the Victoria Memorial

Hall.  From my experience of community centres,  I

think  they  are  a waste of public  funds  unless

steps  are  taken to rectify all that I have  said

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member

for Serangoon keeps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



on attacking community centres to make one feel as

if  he has a great hatred for community centres or

that  some  community centres must have  hurt  him

quite deeply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not at all. Let him prove it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the sum of $130,000 asked

for  in  the  Estimates is required to complete  a

community  centre which was started this  year  at

Seah  Im  Road. The amount of $110,000 is required

to  complete this work and the $20,000 which  will

be  left  over  out of the $130,000 is  meant  for

another  community centre, the site of  which  has

not yet been finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon said that the community

centres are white elephants. I would like to  tell

him, Sir, that he is not saying the right thing -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I know it myself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> - because as far as we know in

the Social Welfare Department, and from reports  I

have  received, community centres are  doing  very

good  work  and  are  necessary  to  build  up   a

community spirit in the areas concerned.

away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I believe that if there

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, we see here according to

the  Estimates, the revised cost for the Permanent

Terminal  Building  will be $8  million.  We  want

information,  Sir,  on what  this  sum  is  to  be

expended,  on  the  type  of  buildings  that  are

planned and whether it includes a lot of luxurious

items  like  a  cinema - I heard  something  like  a

cinema but I am not sure.



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do agree, Mr Chairman, Sir, that

it is not much use in this Assembly going into too

much  detail on costs and arguing to and  fro  the

contentions. The best thing is to leave it to  the

Estimates  Committee. If they can show where  they

can  make savings, I shall personally be delighted

and  I  think that we should all agree that  where

savings can be made, they should be made.  I  have

brought along drawings. I am afraid that they  are

so  stiff that it is no use tabling them.  Perhaps

Members would like to see them in the Commonwealth

Parliamentary Association room.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general points that I would like to make

about the Terminal Building are - I think I made

them already in an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



earlier  part  of the debate; if  I  have  not,  I

intend  to,  Sir - that  we  do  need  to  have   in

Singapore,  if  we  are  to maintain  our  present

position  as  a  main  link in  the  international

network   of  travel,  a  really  attractive   and

satisfactory Terminal Building. We are  not  in  a

position where people are compelled to come to us.

There  are alternative airports to which they  can

fly  if  the other ones are more attractive,  more

efficient and more convenient. We have a very good

position  for  an airport and, other things  being

equal, we shall probably get the trade but we have

competitors in the business and it is up to us  to

be competitive in every way and one aspect is that

if you are going to attract the type of people who

travel by air, you have got to give them the  sort

of  surroundings that they are used to. If you put

them  into  a  barn and herd them along  on  to  a

wooden  bench and give them a dusty cup of  coffee

with coffee stains all around the edge of the cup,

they will say, "Singapore is a dirty place and  we

do  not  want  to come here again." There  can  be

quite considerable side-effects because in the end

they  will  not  come here and you  will  not  get

investments -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $960,000 for Head D 58 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I see under Head D 58

that $1� million is asked for New P.W.D. Workshops.

There  is  also an item for $150,000 required  for

Transfer  of  Airport Quarry Plant to Bukit  Timah

Quarry.  The sum of $150,000 seems to be  quite  a

lot  of  money.  I  would like  to  know  what  is

intended  to  be  carried out  and  what  type  of

workshops  are going to be built which require  $1� million?



<br><br>3.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, it is rather a lump sum

contract.  The  position about the  workshops  is,

first of all, the present site is intolerably over-crowded  and  is  bounded by  the  Kandang  Kerbau

Maternity  Hospital, the Post Office, Farrer  Park

and the Bukit Timah Canal expansion. The degree of

over-crowding  is  shocking  and   we   are   also

continually   expanding  the  service   with   the

expanding use of mechanism, especially heavy earth-moving  equipment,  and  the  site  on  which  the

present  workshop  stands  is  required  for   the

expansion  of Kandang Kerbau Hospital.  Therefore,

it  is desirable that the workshop should be moved

to   a  new  site  and  a  very  suitable  and  an

appropriate  site  is available at  Kallang  where

part  of the old hangar can form the basis of  the

workshop and where it will be possible to work the

Marine  sub-branch in with the rest of the  senior

mechanical engineer's works, so that you can  take

a  launch on to the slipway, put a mobile crane to

work  and take the engine out for repairs and thus

streamline the work a bit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the move includes the equipment of

the new workshops which will include machine tools

which  are  a costly item. I cannot tell  you  the

precise  nature of the machine tools but I  expect

that   hon.   Members  can  visualise   them   for

themselves.  I  think it is worth mentioning  that

another  aspect of the advantage of  the  move  is

that  it  will  enable the Stores  Branch  of  the

Public Works



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



Department  to  do  a bit of necessary  expansion.

There  again,  there is considerable over-crowding

on this small site and it is also inconvenient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I withdraw these

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $2,845,310 for Head D 61 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, at page 396 of the

Development  Estimates,  there  is  an   item   of

$100,000  for  Canteens at Government  Offices.  I

have no objection to a good canteen being provided

for  Government servants but $100,000, to my mind,

does  conjure some very luxurious rooms which  are

air-conditioned  and I would like  information  on

that point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other item is No. 13 for which we are asked

to  spend  $1 million on Modernisation of Division

IV  Quarters -  First  Programme.  The  explanation

given  on  page 440 is not very helpful.  It  only

reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most Division IV quarters constructed pre-war

have   inadequate  latrine,  bathing  and  kitchen

facilities. These quarters require Improvement  by

the construction of kitchens and bathrooms."



<br><br>It  does  not  give the number of quarters  to  be

attended  to and I think that we should have  some

information  as to how that money is going  to  be

spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last item, we come to $5 million for the

New Government Offices. I think that this side  of

the  House  will  want to know whether  Government

intends to spend this $5 million and the style  of

building that we are going to get; whether we  are

going  to  get  something horrible like  the  Post

Office building or something really useful for the

future.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I cannot help feeling that the

Member  for Paya Lebar has forgotten the socialist

side of his Party since two of the items which  he

questioned  in  a  somewhat critical  way  are  to

facilitate  very much the more humble  members  of

the Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the canteens, I can assure him that

the  $100,000  is  not intended  to  put  up  some

chromium-plated  air-conditioned  building  for  a

limited  number of people. We already  have  in  a

number  of  different Government  offices  over  a

dozen canteens which are running; some of them are

running very much in spite of being sited  in  the

most unsuitable corners. For example, one is in  a

basement  in Fullerton Building and the conditions

there  are  such  that the health authorities  are

likely to condemn it. We have a number of canteens

running and we have at least half a dozen new ones

projected. This $100,000 will be spent on a  great

number  of  comparatively small items: $1,000  for

tiling  and  introducing  hygienic  conditions  in

existing   canteens;   in  another   instance,   a

considerably  larger sum of $5,000 or  $8,000,  in

order  to  construct a canteen in  some  available

space in an existing office. I can assure the hon.

Member  that  these  canteens will  serve  a  most

useful purpose. They are an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



amenity  to people working in Government  offices;

they  help to reduce the demand for hawkers;  they

help  to  keep people off the streets  during  the

crowded lunch-time hours and they enable people to

get  a  decent meal at a cheap price and  get  the

maximum of rest in their lunch hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the next item to which he referred, the

Modernisation of Division IV Quarters,  I  am,  of

course,  a colonial official but, Sir, I  have  to

admit  that  some  of these Division  IV  quarters

which we inherit from the colonial regime are such

as  we certainly cannot be proud of today, and  it

is  in  order to try and bring a large  number  of

those quarters up to a standard more in conformity

with  present-day conditions, to give them  proper

latrines   and  kitchens,  that  this   money   is

required. It is a large vote and there is a  large

number  of  quarters to be modernised,  one  after

another. If the hon. Member really wants to have a

full  list  of all the various quarters which  are

going  to be tackled and how much is going  to  be

spent on each, I dare say that it could be got out

but it would take quite a considerable time and  I

really  doubt whether it would profit him or  this

House  to have it. If he wishes it, he can  put  a

Question down and I will, of course, do my best to

get the figures for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the last item in which he raised a

question  on the New Government Offices,  he  will

see, from the Explanatory Notes at the back of the

Estimates, that the present intention  is  to  use

Crown  land which is available on Shenton Way  and

to  put up a building in conformity with the  type

of building which is required on Shenton Way. This

sum  voted is by no means based on firm plans but,

at  the moment, we do know that we require a great

deal of new office accommodation and attention has

already  been drawn in this House to the state  of

the office accommodation of, I think, the Registry

of  Marriages.  There has been  a  great  deal  of

pressure  in  this House that the Assembly  should

have more elbow-room in this present building  and

there  are  a  number  of offices  which  must  be

notorious to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



Members  of  this House for being quite inadequate

to  modern conditions. We have had a survey to see

how  much  extra space is required  under  present

conditions  and the total demand is a  very  large

figure;  it  is  greater than the existing  office

accommodation inside Fullerton Building but I have

no  doubt myself that the time has come when  this

Government will have to spend a larger sum on  new

office  accommodation  and I  certainly  recommend

that it should be spent on one good building which

will  serve for many years in future, rather  than

that we should continue to mend and patch and  put

up   some  shoddy  and  inferior  building.   This

estimate is only a round figure at this stage  but

the intention is to put up a fine office block  on

Shenton  Way  and  that is  how  the  estimate  is

arrived at.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, am I to understand from

the Hon. the Chief Secretary that if this building

were not put up on Shenton Way to conform with the

standard required in that area, the building could

then be brought in more cheaply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No, Sir. I would not like the hon.

Member  to  go  away with any such  understanding.

What  I  said  was that we had land  available  on

Shenton  Way, that we need a building of the  size

of the buildings which are appropriate for Shenton

Way  and  that we propose therefore to  build  the

building  in accordance with the standard  set  in

Shenton Way. It is obviously necessary that a  big

office building should be centred in the heart  of

the  City where it can do its business and  while,

of  course,  piling costs may be high  in  Shenton

Way,  if  we  try  to purchase  an  area  of  land

anywhere in the City to use an alternative site, I

should  think that it would come to  at  least  as

much.  But  the point is that we have vacant  land

available to us on Shenton Way and I think that we

should encourage development on Shenton Way. I  do

not  think that expenditure on a Shenton Way  type

of  building will be out of proportion to the need

we have for a decent block of Government offices.
