<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, when we rose yesterday, I was dealing

with  a  matter  concerning  the  equality  between

duties  and rights. In other words, people  working

in  the  same place should be governed by the  same

rules  and regulations. When duties and rights  are

not   properly   equated,   especially   under   an

enlightened Government like ours, they can be  said

to be an oversight on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



Government's part. For example, on the question  of

the  retirement  age for Chinese  school  teachers,

there  are two different kinds of ruling. According

to  the regulations, those who were employed before

1st  July, 1956, have to retire at 55 years,  while

those employed after this date can retire at 60. We

feel that this regulation is unreasonable. I wonder

why such a regulation should be adopted and why  it

is  still  being  implemented by  the  Ministry  of

Education.  I  said  yesterday that  the  Singapore

Chinese  School Teachers' Association had submitted

memorandum  after  memorandum to  the  Ministry  of

Education,  all  of  which  had  been  shelved  and

forgotten.  There  was no reply  to  the  memoranda

submitted  so  far.  Sir,  we  have  made  repeated

submissions,  but  they have been  simply  ignored.

This is a matter for regret. It is not my intention

to  take  up so much time of this House in  dealing

with  this  small matter. However, I strongly  feel

that the implementation of the regulations which  I

have   described   is   causing   discontent    and

dissatisfaction  among  the  teachers  in   Chinese

schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have always said that

teachers  in our Republic should inculcate  in  our

children  a  sense  of national  consciousness  and

patriotism. But the Ministry of Education  has  not

looked   after  the  interests  of  our   patriotic

teachers.  On  the contrary, it is  giving  special

treatment to those who are not patriotic and  whose

loyalty is, in fact, in doubt. You will recall that

in  1959  when  the present Government  first  took

office  with  a  mandate from the  people,  it  was

decided  that in order to save our national coffers

and  our economic resources, there should be a  pay

cut  in the public service. As a result of the  pay

cut,  the teachers suffered. In addition, they  had

to  carry a greater work load. They had to teach in

the adult education classes. Teachers in Government-aided  schools also suffered the pay cut. When  the

pay  cut  order was made, some of the teachers  who

had   no  backbone  and  who  were  not  loyal  and

patriotic  took to their heels and went across  the

Causeway  to offer their services there.  In  other

words, they left the Singapore education service to

work elsewhere. Three or four years later, when our

national economy took a turn for the better,  these

people  came back to Singapore because the pay  cut

was  restored. However, these people, who left  and

returned,  were  classified  as  teachers  employed

after 1st July, 1956, and are therefore allowed  to

carry on teaching happily until they reach the  age

of  60.  Those  who did not leave the service  then

have  to  retire at 55 under the same  regulations.

Are  we  to encourage patriotic feeling by  looking

after  the interests of the determined lot  of  the

teachers who did not take to their heels? Or are we

to  give  better treatment to those  who  left  the

service in the face of difficult times? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  is a question we have to consider  very

seriously. We should not allow opportunists to  get

a better deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken up the question of the retirement

age  in order to draw the attention of the Minister

for  Education to this anomaly so that  it  can  be

rectified. I hope to hear from the new Minister for

Education, the Minister of State,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



or  the Parliamentary Secretary, declaring that the

retiring  age  for teachers in Singapore  would  be

unified.  I  am  still far away  from  the  age  of

retirement. Therefore, I am not speaking for my own

personal  interest,  but on  behalf  of  the  other

teachers.   I   come  under  the   regulation   for

retirement at 60. Let us forget these asides  which

are  unnecessary. When I took up this matter I  did

so  in the hope that the memoranda submitted by the

Singapore   Chinese  School  Teachers'  Association

would receive due consideration from the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise concerns educative

travel.  In the President's address, it was  stated

that  grants from the Education Fund would be given

for   educative  travel  to  enable  teachers   and

students  to see the neighbouring countries.  This,

of  course, is a matter for rejoice because it will

be of benefit to our teachers and students. It will

be an encouragement to our teachers and students to

learn by actual experience instead of by rote. What

I  fail  to under-stand, however, is this. Recently

the  Singapore Chinese School Teachers' Association

sent  a team of teachers to' attend the Fifth Asian

Conference  of  the Congress of the World  Teaching

Profession  in Tokyo. The Singapore Chinese  School

Teachers'  Association had to' raise its own  funds

to  pay  for  the passage. They did not  receive  a

single cent from the Government. At the end of  the

conference   they   were  invited   to   tour   the

neighbouring  countries. They therefore  spent  six

extra days overseas. What was most exasperating was

that for some reason, the Ministry of Education  or

the  Ministry of Finance cut six days of their pay.

Instead   of  receiving, a  grant,  the   teachers

suffered  a  pay  cut.  Perhaps  the  Ministry   of

Education  and the Ministry of Finance  should  get

together  to  find  out  whether  educative  travel

should  be  encouraged by allowing  full-pay  leave

[Interruption]. If teachers are sent to  Taiwan  to

learn  the Chinese language, it is not a  bad  idea

because  they  are not allowed to  go  to  mainland

China.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, please continue with what you

want to say, instead of arguing with Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was  speaking on educative travel. The point I want

to stress here is that since it has become a matter

of  policy to encourage educative travel,  teachers

should  be given every opportunity to make  use  of

their  annual  leave for this purpose.  Why  should

teachers  suffer  a  pay  cut  while  they  are  on

educative  travel? Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  my  hope

that since educative travel is being encouraged, as

mentioned in the President's address, the officials

in  the  Ministry of Education or the  Ministry  of

Finance will take note of this policy and implement

it   accordingly,  instead  of  treating  this   as

propaganda material. Sir, we are certainly grateful

to  the President for making it a Government policy

to  encourage  educative travel among the  teachers

and  students.  This  will  certainly  widen  their

horizon.  I fully endorse this policy.  As  to  the

details of its implementation, we can discuss them

at the proper time.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to associate

myself with the sentiments already expressed by  my

honourable colleagues in thanking the President for

his  many  timely and thought-provoking  statements

contained in his Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said "timely" because the President has

very  ably  outlined in his Address the  change  of

circumstances  that prevail in our Republic  today,

circumstances which not only differ from  those  of

five  years  ago but also necessitate a  change  of

planning and action to enable us to face the  tasks

ahead.  The  President's Address provides  us  with

many  guidelines  for  the  future  development  of

Singapore  and  which very correctly underline  the

social  principle governing our society,  i.e, the

principle  of  sustained collective  endeavour  and

quality participation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, more than ever, we must evolve social

policies which will ensure the full utilisation  of

our manpower resources, particularly to resolve the

shortage   of  labour  in  the  present  employment

situation.  There is no doubt that,  in  the  years

ahead,   we  must  consciously  strive  to   create

conditions  in  which social dislocations  will  be

minimised  and the widest opportunity for community

participation and individual fulfilment in work  or

in recreation, is afforded to all our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As emphasised in the President's speech,

Singaporeans  must avoid the pattern  of  thinking,

the  welfare state syndrome, where everyone expects

others,  not himself, to work harder to  carry  the

burden  of  providing services and amenities  which

everyone wants. It must be recognised that there is

a  limit  to what the State can provide. In  social

services,  clearly  it is not possible  nor  is  it

desirable for the Government to do everything. Much

could  be  said about the danger that lurks  within

the  apparently innocent philosophy  of  "something

for nothing", and it is true that in the context of

our  circumstances in Singapore today this  selfish

and seemingly harmless philosophy of "something for

nothing"  could turn out to be disastrous,  if  not

fatal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social affairs, I would be the

first  to  endorse the statement of  the  President

that "no one should get away with enjoying services

subsidised through the hard work of others, without

making  his  own contribution, to the best  of  his

ability  and  capacity." That is why, of  late,  my

Ministry  has been reviewing its policies,  and  is

considering new schemes whereby those who can work,

though  with  limitations,  should  be  encouraged,

trained  and helped along to work. For example,  in

our Public Assistance Scheme, my officers have been

scanning and sieving the lists of public assistance

recipients  who, on account of their age,  physical

abilities or circumstances, are believed to be able

to do at least some work; and the main guideline in

our  new policy will be that such public assistance

recipients



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



who  can  work will be offered suitable  employment

or,  if they are untrained, will be put on training

schemes  to  help  them take up gainful  employment

eventually.  We have now reached the  stage  where,

unless valid reasons are given by recipients as  to

why  they  cannot  accept the job or  the  training

offered, their public assistance allowance will  be

discontinued  if they should turn  down  offers  of

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, we are also looking into the

intensive and extensive training of the handicapped

adults   of  Singapore.  While  training   of   the

handicapped   by  the  various  voluntary   welfare

organisations  in  Singapore  has   so   far   been

concentrated  on  the children and teenage  groups,

not  much  has  been done for the training  of  the

handicapped adults who, for one reason or  another,

are  not  able  to obtain employment due  to  their

being untrained and handicapped. The Social Welfare

Department   is  at  the  moment  considering   all

possible  measures to provide useful  and  suitable

training for the handicapped adults of Singapore in

order  to  enable  them  to  be  well-equipped  for

employment and to obtain suitable employment.  This

is  a significant step in the rehabilitation of the

handicapped people of Singapore, closely  following

the  policy  that  even the handicapped  today  are

expected  to  make  their own contribution  towards

society to the best of their ability and capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I wish to make it clear that

there is no intention whatsoever on the part of the

Government to reduce or cease welfare aid to  those

who  are  really incapable and who, on account  .of

their  old  age or severe handicap, are  unable  to

make  any  contribution to  the  society.  We  will

continue  to provide assistance to such unfortunate

and  genuinely  needy citizens, but certainly  this

"something  for  nothing"  business  will  not   be

applied  to the able-bodied and the unemployed  who

due  to  their sheer laziness or inertia  have  not

been trying to work and who have sought the easiest

way  out by merely relying on welfare aid. To these

people,  gone  are  the days when  they  could  get

something for nothing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have over the years evolved a pattern of

social services based on the participation of  both

the  Government and the voluntary sectors.  It  is

intended  to  restructure and strengthen  community

participation  in welfare services by  reorganising

the  various  services which  have  been  developed

rather  haphazardly, depending more  on  individual

initiative and effort, into systematic and  planned

operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already taken steps to

strengthen the Research and Training Section of the

Social Welfare Department, and one of the functions

of  this  Section,  apart  from  its  research  and

training roles, is to engage in systematic planning

for  the  improvement of welfare  services  in  the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More sophisticated techniques will be used in the

rehabilitation process not only for  the  residents

of  welfare  homes but also for juvenile  offenders

placed  on  probation. A psychologist  has  already

been  recruited  to launch a Psychological  Service

and to provide consultancy and referral services in

the  adjustment programme which in the near  future

will  involve  greater participation  by  voluntary

welfare workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to express

my appreciation for the concern shown by the Member

for  Kuo Chuan regarding the working of the Women's

Charter.  I  would like to assure the  Member  that

from time to time my Ministry makes a study of  the

problems and the issues posed in the implementation

of  the Women's Charter. I would like to point  out

that  the  Women's  Charter is only  a  legislative

measure to prevent abuse, and it has already proven

its   usefulness  by  enhancing  the   status   and

promoting the welfare of women and families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to correct the impression

created by the Member when he said that the divorce

rates  had soared to unmanageable heights. In fact,

the  number of divorce petitions over the last five

years has been within the region of 200 to 300  per

year,  as compared to the number of marriages which

is between 10,000 to 13,000 per year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



The Member may also wish to know that from 1960  to

1971 there were only 2,036 applications made to the

High  Court for divorces, and only 1,411  of  these

were approved, giving an average of only 128 actual

divorce  cases  per year. Although this  figure  is

higher  than  that  for  1960,  i.e.,  before   the

introduction   of   the  Women's   Charter,   where

approximately  80 divorces per year were  recorded,

it  must  be  recognised that in  those  days  most

marriages, including polygamous marriages, were not

registered  and,  hence  divorce  was   by   mutual

consent, the figures for which were not included in

statistics given by the High Court. I would like to

dispel  the impression that divorce can  easily  be

obtained. The provisions for divorce in the Women's

Charter   are  fairly  restrictive.  It   is   also

interesting to note that the social stigma attached

to divorces has now diminished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that due to rapid

urbanisation  and  modernisation,  the  stabilising

forces  in  our  Asian  culture,  which  have  kept

families  together,  have  been  weakened  to  some

extent.  There are also many other factors  in  our

social  situation that have brought about conflicts

and  tensions affecting family life. To  counteract

these  trends  and  tendencies,  social  education,

either in the home or within the school setting, is

most important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Member's suggestion for a review of

the  Women's Charter. But for such a review  to  be

fruitful,  considerable sociological research  into

the factors affecting family life is necessary.  It

is  for  this  reason that a Research and  Training

Section  has  been  set up in  the  Social  Welfare

Department,  and  it  is  hoped  that  through  the

various  projects, which have already been planned,

it  may  be possible to know more about the various

social phenomena which the Member has pointed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sports, we have a two-fold objective. Firstly,

we  must make sport the way of life for our people.

Sports can build body and mind, and it is vital to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



social  peace. The Government has already laid  the

foundations  and indicated the direction  for  mass

participation   in   sports   and   games.   Inter-constituency sports is promising, and every  effort

must be made by one and all to sustain it, and  the

necessary  organisation and funds must be  obtained

to    provide   a   more   varied   programme   and

comprehensive range of facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, we must aim at excellence in

sports.   This  can  only  be  achieved  with   the

necessary  organisation, funds and support  in  the

way  of  staff, expertise, availability of training

time  and  adequate facilities. There is  no  doubt

that  we  can succeed, considering that within  the

short  space  of  one  and  a  half  years  of  the

establishment  of  the  National  Sports  Promotion

Board,  we  have not only paved the  way  for  mass

participation  in sports but also  established  the

framework for the development of sports talents for

both national and international competitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime next year the National Stadium will be

the  venue  for the Seventh SEAP Games,  the  first

time  a major international meet of such importance

is   being   organised  here.   We   have   already

successfully bidden for the next Asian Games to  be

held  in  Singapore in 1978. The task of developing

the  necessary  organisation and infrastructure  to

make Singapore an important centre for sports is  a

challenging  one,  but  judging  from  the  present

leadership, enthusiasm and dedication shown  by  so

many people involved in the organization of sports,

I  have every confidence that what we have set  out

to do in sports will soon be realised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan) (in Mandarin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is the First Session of  the

Third  Parliament  since our independence.  As  our

President has pointed out in his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We meet today under circumstances vastly

different  from  those  prevailing  when  the  last

Parliament was convened on 6th May, 1968.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our past era can be reviewed in two

stages.  The  first  stage  is  the  period   after

independence,  which was quite  a  tumultuous  one.

During that period Singapore became a Republic  and

there  were  many  problems  to  be  resolved   and

tackled.  The second stage is the five-year  period

when we were in office. During this time we had  to

solve  many  difficulties and problems  which  were

more  harsh  and  real, such as  economy,  defence,

unemployment  and the problem of redundancy  caused

by  the British military withdrawal. However, under

our  judicious  leadership with the right  policies

and   with  the  co-operation  and  effort  of  our

diligent  people, we managed to solve all of  them,

each and every one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are entering into the third stage, in

which  we  strive for quality, and on the basis  of

our  past successful experience, I believe  we  can

achieve  results. The central theme of this message

of  the President is that, in addition to achieving

higher standards of education, business management,

and work ethic, there are two conditions to be met.

One  is  the establishment of the small  family  to

ensure  a  better  quality and an  improved  living

standard.  This will enable the next generation  to

look  after  themselves  better,  without  being  a

burden  to  the  society or the nation.  The  other

condition  is  the  abuse of  free  social  welfare

services. We should remember that everybody  has  a

duty to put in his share of work, either physically

or  mentally, in return for what he wants.  In  any

society,  there should be no such thing as  getting

something  for  free. Otherwise that  country  will

become either weaker or poorer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has emerged from a period of

difficulties, and marching into its eighth year  of

independence  at  a steady pace. Through  our  past

efforts in overcoming difficulties, we have  gained

rich   and  varied  experience,  and  our  people's

confidence  in building a better society  has  been

strengthened.  In not too short  a  time,  we  have

overcome many difficult problems which, in the eyes

of outsiders, were impossible to solve. All this is

due to the determination and drive of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



people,  which have consolidated the foundation  of

nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We managed to overcome the difficulties

encountered in the past because most of  our  adult

population  had  gone through the  mill  and  lived

through  different social systems.  They  had  gone

through  suppression  by  colonial  rule  and   the

persecution  by  the Japanese warlords  during  the

second  World War. And finally they had  also  gone

through  the  relentless treatment of  the  corrupt

government  of  the early days of a  self-governing

state.  In short, they had gone through trials  and

tribulations and emerged from the baptism of  fire.

With  all  these experiences and efforts they  have

made sacrifices and struggle to build up their  own

country  and  an ideal society. After independence,

the   people  have  become  masters  of  their  own

destiny.   This   fact   has   strengthened   their

patriotism, and because of this they have discarded

the  feeling  of  being birds of  passage  and  the

attitudes  of  immigrants. So on this concept  they

are   able  to  build  a  further  prosperous   and

progressive society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique quality about the people of Singapore

is that, unlike those of other countries, they have

not taken to the belief that just because Singapore

is independent they can sit down and enjoy life. If

we  look at the developing countries around us,  we

will  see  that  instead of making any  advancement

they  are on the way down. That we have been  able'

to  progress from time to time and become more  and

more  prosperous is all due to the good quality  of

our  people  who  know that independence  does  not

necessarily bring with it prosperity and  progress.

The  people realise that concerted efforts and hard

work  on  the part of the people will make possible

nation  building.  They do  not  take  chances  but

instead participate actively in the task of  nation

building.  So long as this patriotic spirit  exists

among  these seasoned adults of Singapore, it  will

be very difficult for foreign interests to buy over

Singapore.   But  the  strength   of   this   adult

population cannot last forever. With the passage of

time it must gradually dissipate. Therefore, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



order to preserve our hard-won achievements and  to

ensure  that  there  will be further  progress  and

prosperity  for Singapore, we must take  preventive

measures  so that our country under the  leadership

of  the  next generation will not be taken over  or

manipulated by foreign elements. As stated  in  the

Presidential address, Constitutional amendments are

necessary to ensure that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`no surrender of our sovereignty, or any part

thereof,   by   way  of  incorporation   into,   or

federation  with,  any other country  is  possible,

unless  two-thirds  of  the total  electorate  vote

positively for it in a referendum.'



<br><br>All  this is a preparation for a better future.  It

does  not  mean that we have no confidence  in  the

next  generation of leaders. This is because  about

50 per cent of them at least do not have the actual

experience  of the difficulties and hardships  that

older leaders had undergone in the past. They  lack

the experience of the hardships and tribulations of

the  early `50s. Whatever knowledge they may gather

about  those  difficulties  comes  from  books   or

hearsay.  Most  of them have been enjoying  modern,

stable  and  comfortable living in Singapore.  From

childhood  to adulthood they have not gone  through

the mill, as the present generation had. Therefore,

we  have to give some consideration to this matter.

To  make  good the shortcomings, we must strengthen

this  feeling  of  patriotism and  the  indomitable

spirit  by  laying sufficient stress on  education.

Education is fundamental to nation building and the

running of a country. To make sure that the  future

leadership  from the younger generation  will  have

the  same  verve  and  capability  of  the  present

leadership, we must see to it that the content  and

quality  of  education should he  such  that  these

future  leaders will not only be able to contribute

towards  the  economic progress of the country  hut

also maintain political stability with patriotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look around the industrially advanced

countries  in  the world. Many of  them  have  paid

attention  only  to their industrial  and  economic

needs,  and  not the cultivation of  the  necessary

virtues



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



and character of their people. As a result there is

an   imbalance  of  interests  among  their  people

manifesting     excessive    individualism     over

nationalism.  Some of the young people  study  hard

merely for the sake of getting highly paid jobs  so

that  they  can  enjoy.  Although  Singapore  is  a

developing  country, in terms of  economic  growth,

she is already a developed country. It is necessary

only  to  enhance the quality of education  and  to

encourage technological education. But if  we  only

crystallise our attention on our economic needs  at

the  expense  of the cultivation of  patriotic  and

ethical  virtues,  then there may  come  a  society

steeped in selfishness with a generation of  people

who  only care for themselves without so much  care

for  the country the young leadership will then  be

weakened. Therefore, for the future of our  nation,

we   must   try  to  arrest  the  trend   of   such

development. We must actively foster the concept of

patriotic virtues among our young people.  We  must

make  our young people realise that improvement  in

the  quality of education is not meant  to  enhance

their  own selfish personal interest, but  for  the

national interest and for a better service  to  the

society.  Hence,  the Ministry of Education  should

positively shoulder up this responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few years

particularly  during  the last  general  elections,

there  is  a  clear indication of  doubt  over  the

loyalty of some opposition parties. For ideological

reasons,  some of them are inclined to look  up  to

other  countries,  others, for  their  own  selfish

reasons,  have  become  the  Trojan  horse  in  our

country; some have become the mouthpiece of foreign

interests. On the face of it, such people are  very

convincing  in  their  talks,  but  in  the   final

analysis  we  can  see  their hideous  motives.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if our way of life and our  policies

have  not had the strong support of the people,  we

would  not  have been able to obtain this landslide

victory. The crux of the problem is that there  are

still some people with ulterior motives who wish to

make use of the mass media, both to mislead and  to

divide our people. They are doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



this  in  order  to  satisfy the  desire  of  their

foreign  masters. So the people of  Singapore  must

always   be   on   guard   against   such   people.

Constitutional  amendments to ensure  our  national

integrity   and  sovereignty  are  therefore   very

necessary.  These  measures are also  necessary  to

ensure   the   political  stability  and   economic

prosperity of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of the present political

stability, economic prosperity and high standard of

living there are some people in our midst who  have

neither tasted nor realised what hardship is.  They

are  very naive and very foolishly tried to  create

trouble  by interfering with the good life  of  the

people.  If  history should repeat itself,  and  if

there  should be a return of the turbulent days  of

boycott of classes, strikes, and riots of the  `50s

and  the early `60s, then could we continue to lead

this  secure, happy and satisfying life? We should,

therefore,  heighten our vigilance,  cultivate  our

patriotic  feelings, examine ourselves  and  foster

the  virtue of putting national and public interest

above  personal  interest, and  working  diligently

with others. With concerted effort we must maintain

our verve and drive, take up the responsibility and

plan  carefully for a better future, and make  full

use  of  whatever  potential we have  to  meet  the

challenging roles confronting us in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore have voted

wisely for political stability, for they know  that

economic and social progress depends upon a climate

of stability and confidence. With such a favourable

climate,   we   can   address  ourselves   to   the

challenging task of developing our country  into  a

great  metropolis,  with a cultured,  well-educated

and highly-skilled population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his distinguished address, our President

stressed two essential pre-conditions for Singapore

to become a centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



for  excellence. The first has to  do  with  family

planning.  People  in the low income  group  should

take  particular  note  of this.  They  should  not

handicap themselves further by having more children

than  they  can feed, more children than  they  can

educate, or more children than they can accommodate

decently in their one- or two-room flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pre-condition the President mentioned,

that  is,  the preservation of the work  ethic  and

discipline,   must  be  taken  seriously   by   all

Singaporeans.  Parents, in particular,  should  not

overindulge  their  children with  liberal  pocket-money or tolerate idleness and indiscipline. When I

see  students today driving their own cars  to  the

Junior  College, or to the University, I  sometimes

wonder whether parents are not making life too soft

for  their children. If our youth do not learn  the

value of money and do not acquire a measure of self-discipline,  then  our future as  a  nation  is  in

doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the immediate future, our task is to upgrade

our  industries, improve our technical skills,  and

acquire more sophisticated managerial and marketing

expertise. In the past, we were more concerned with

promoting  foreign investment than with development

as  such. In the future, investment promotion  must

go  hand in hand with development of technical  and

managerial  skills.  To ensure  this,  perhaps  our

industrial incentives could be revised to encourage

expansion of existing enterprises, especially local

enterprises. Perhaps we can also devise  additional

criteria for granting tax incentives to industries,

e.g, a  target number or a proportion of technical

and  managerial personnel could be specified so  as

to  ensure  that proper development of Singaporeans

take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the constraints to further development of

industry  is  the  availability  of  technical  and

professional personnel. I believe we should  create

a   pool  of  such  people  from  abroad  by  prior

screening  and  granting of  provisional  permanent

visas. Such visas can be exercised when an approved

job  is available to the applicant. This would  cut

down delays in recruitment. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



addition, housing needs to be made available to the

new immigrant for the initial six months or a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid development requires a corresponding

capacity to cope with change. In industry, we shall

have  to  deal  with  firms made  uncompetitive  by

rising rents and wages or else by urban renewal. We

shall have to balance the need for equity with  the

long-term interests of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to add my support

for the Finance Minister's decision to increase the

pay of civil servants. The dedicated efforts of our

civil  service  have  been crucial  to  Singapore's

development  over  the  last  14  years.  We   must

recognise  and reward the dedicated.  Moreover,  as

the  President  pointed out, we  need  to  preserve

quality  in our civil service. I believe we  should

have  periodic  reviews of civil service  salaries,

especially in the context of rapid development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the Government's policy of taxing

luxury consumption. This would encourage saving and

discourage  lavish consumption which can  have  bad

social effects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully endorse the

Government's intention of amending our Constitution

to  prevent  Singapore from being  bought  over  by

foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the motion moved by the hon.

Member for Bukit Batok.



<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I

am  happy  to  note that, in the  addendum  to  the

President's  Speech dealing with  the  Ministry  of

Labour,  there  is a categorical statement  to  the

effect that "workers are human beings and not  mere

cogs  in  the wheels of production." If we  want  a

healthy   framework  of  industrial  relations   to

develop   in   Singapore,  it  is  of   fundamental

importance that our system of industrial  relations

should  get  away  from concepts which  regard  the

worker and his skill as no more than yet another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



purchasable  commodity on the market. Human  skills

certainly  have  a  market  value.  But  human  co-operation  cannot  be purchased.  It  can  only  be

earned  through  the practice of  sound  industrial

psychology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere which prevails on the production

sites  of many enterprises in Singapore is poisoned

by  pernicious  doctrines of industrial  relations,

which regard workers as wage slaves who have to  be

coerced  and  bullied, and not as partners  in  the

production   process,  whose   co-operation,   even

enthusiastic co-operation, might be obtained by the

simple  expedient of regarding them as  responsible

human beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all to the good that we in Singapore are

becoming  increasingly conscious of pollution.  But

pollution is not only physical pollution. There  is

also  psychological pollution which exists in  many

of  our  industries  and which can  and  does  have

serious  harmful  consequences for  our  industrial

production.  This  psychological pollution  is  the

consequence of the primitive notions of  industrial

relations and of personnel management, which I have

referred  to.  And  it  manifests  itself   in   an

atmosphere of mutual distrust and disregard between

managements  and  workers on  our  factory  floors.

There  is no mutual consultation on what, in  fact,

are common problems. Instead, there is a system  of

arbitrary  orders, the reasons for  which  are  not

given,  but which the workers are expected to  obey

like automatons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I had to deal with one factory where

the  management  embarked on a major reorganisation

of  work schedules. They had good reasons for  this

reorganisation, for they had obtained new and  more

productive  machines.  But the  workers  were  left

completely  in  the  dark  about  the  management's

plans. One fine morning, they found themselves  re-allocated and transferred about. Resentment  boiled

over,  and  there was a work stoppage. The  climate

was not improved by a Production Superintendent who

threatened dire punishment for the workers  because

he  claimed that he was a close friend of  what  he

termed "top PAP leaders." He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



is  one of those persons responsible for destroying

the  confidence and trust which our  Government  so

richly  deserves.  I  shall be happy  to  privately

identify  the  gentleman concerned to the  Minister

for   Labour,  so  that  he  may  consider   taking

appropriate action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But coming back to my theme, none of these

troubles would have occurred if the management  had

taken  the workers into confidence about the "whys"

and   "wherefores"   of   the   reorganisation   of

production.   Indeed,  a  number   of   enlightened

managements  make  good use of  works  councils  to

discuss  and  to  consult  with  their  workers  on

problems which arise in the process of production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligent use of works councils can give

workers  a  rewarding  sense  of  participation  in

production,   and   thereby   help    to    enhance

productivity  and  to  transform  the  climate   of

industrial  relations. Workers come  to  feel  that

they  belong to the enterprise they work  for,  and

identify  themselves  with  the  success   of   its

operations.    Unfortunately,   the    number    of

managements in Singapore which are prepared to give

the  works  councils  a  try-out  is  few  and  far

between.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If workers and management can regard themselves

as  two necessary parts of a production team,  many

of   our  problems  in  industrial  relations  will

disappear.  The  Secretary-General  of   the   NTUC

proposed  in  a  recent speech the desirability  of

achieving  what he called "a community  effort"  in

all  our  industrial enterprises. Some managements,

however,  fear that this proposal means that  trade

unions   will  attempt  to  take  over   management

functions.  This is rubbish and is far  from  being

the  intention  of  the NTUC. We clearly  recognise

that  the specific economic problems in industries,

touching  on  the division and the  nature  of  the

product, the utilisation of labour and capital, the

distribution  of  raw materials,  etc.,  cannot  be

solved  by majority decisions or voting.  They  can

only  be  dealt  with  by  those  who  possess  the

technical knowledge. The workers are not specialist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



in  this  field. So there is no  question  of

trade unions wanting to usurp management functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the actual process of production, workers

can  and  should  be  made to feel  that  they  are

members  of  a  production team  and  not,  as  the

addendum  to the President's Speech puts it,  "mere

cogs in the wheels of production."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the near future, the NTUC hopes to hold

discussions with a number of selected employers  in

the  Republic  with  a  view  to  trying  out  more

enlightened  and productive methods  of  industrial

relations. We cannot institute these changes on our

own.  Management must also co-operate. Furthermore,

we  hope to obtain the blessings of the Government.

It  would be a great pity if the initiative we have

shown proves to be still-born because of a lack  of

positive response from the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tripartite affiance between Government, trade

unions  and employers must not be an alliance  only

on  paper.  It must be translated into practice  on

our  factory floors. We offer our hands in  sincere

co-operation  to  the employers. We  hope  that  at

least  some of them will have the wisdom to  accept

the proffered hand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

his  speech at the opening of the First Session  of

this Parliament, the President broadly outlined the

Government's policies for the next five  years.  He

laid   particular  stress  on  quality   and   high

performance on the part of all so that our Republic

"can  become a centre for excellence in all  fields

important  to our economic and cultural life."  And

the addenda of the various Ministries elaborated on

these two aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during the debate on the motion of

thanks  to the President, many of my colleagues  on

the backbenches have made contributions in terms of

suggestions  and concrete comments. So  I  propose,

Sir, to touch on some of the topics that need to be

brought up for the Government's consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone through the addendum and note with

considerable interest the portion from the Ministry

of  Education.  I  am glad of the  ambitious  plans

proposed. But somehow I am surprised at the brevity

of  some  parts  contained therein, in  particular,

that  part which dwells on industrial training.  It

is  noteworthy  that an Industrial  Training  Board

will  be established and for which a Bill has  been

presented   to   this  House.  Referring   to   one

particular   aspect  in  the  field  of  industrial

training, I had an occasion in September this  year

at  the  official opening of the Ponggol Vocational

Institute  to  comment  on the  building  industry,

which  is  now facing an acute shortage of  skilled

and semi-skilled workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be denied that the building industry

adds  much  to our Gross Domestic Product.  I  said

then  that  the  demand for  housing  in  both  the

private  and public sectors had outstripped  supply

to  a point of no return, at least for the next ten

years  or  more.  And that this  unprecedented  and

unexpected  situation had brought  about  an  acute

shortage  of  skilled and semi-skilled construction

workers.   As   a  result,  building   construction

companies,  as  an  immediate  solution   to   this

problem,  had  to import labour. I  had  then  also

stressed the need to develop a large pool  of  such

workers   of  our  own  in  order  to  reduce   our

dependence on imported labour. This could  be  done

by   organising  more  courses  through  vocational

institutes, like the Ponggol Vocational  Institute.

And  we  could encourage more of our school-leavers

to  take up building construction as a career. This

could  be  clone  through wider  publicity  of  the

courses  run by the Institute with the stress  that

monetary   benefits  from  such   a   career   were

comparable to a white-collar job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that similar emphasis should be

given  to  this  field  of  Singapore's  industrial

activity  before the problem becomes  critical.  In

the  past  too  much  emphasis,  if  not  an  over-emphasis, had been placed on the need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



for  technicians  in  the manufacturing  and  other

fields  of  industrial training that  there  is  at

present    a   corresponding   lack   of   building

technicians.  We must not forget that the  numerous

factories  in  Jurong and other areas  have  to  be

built   first  before  the  machinery  and  factory

technicians  could  move in. These  buildings  were

built by building construction workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Ministry concerned is

actively  looking into this aspect of  the  problem

that  our Republic is now facing, and whether steps

are  being taken to overcome this, because I am not

very  impressed by the statement that, and I quote,

"the  Ministry will continue to develop  vocational

training  in selected manual and applied  arts  and

service trades." It is thus my hope that one of the

first tasks of the Industrial Training Board,  when

set  up, will be to look into the provision of more

courses   on  building  construction  among   other

things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect, Sir, I wish to touch on is the

problem faced by fishermen, especially those  based

in   my  constituency  at  Kangkar.  Although   the

addendum on the Ministry of Defence consists of two

short   paragraphs,  there  is  much  to  be  done.

However, it is in the structure and set-up  of  the

Maritime Command of the Singapore Armed Forces that

I  am particularly concerned with, i.e, what can it

do  to  safeguard our territorial waters  and  what

protection can it give to our fishermen who go  out

to  fish  in  the  territorial waters  and  beyond?

Perhaps I can best illustrate this by familiarising

hon.   Members  with  the  problem  faced  by   the

fishermen in my constituency, who have to  sail  to

the  South  China  Sea to make a living.  It  is  a

hazardous means of livelihood for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time a trawler leaves its base at Kangkar

for the fishing grounds in the South China Sea,  it

has  to pass through the Straits of Johore and head

north-east. Sometimes even before it can reach  the

fishing    grounds,   say,   near   the   Horsburgh

Lighthouse,  some fast pirate boat would  come  and

harass



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



them.  They do this on the return trip too!  These

pirates either demand large sums of money or order

our fishermen at gun-point to some island and hold

them to ransom. When the fishermen do return, they

come  back  empty-handed. On many occasions,  when

sums  of money ranging from $100 to $400 are  paid

on  the  way  out, another pirate boat would  come

along  and make similar demands on the fishermen's

return.  The fishermen have complained  to  me  on

several   occasions;  I  have  brought  up   their

complaints  to  both  the Ministries  of  National

Development  and  Foreign Affairs.  The  officials

said  they were looking into the matter  and  that

was  that.  Even a protest note from the fishermen

sent  earlier  this  year to the  Foreign  Affairs

Ministry has not brought about any change  in  the

situation. I was told that the Ministry would  get

in  touch  with  the Ministry  of  Defence  to  do

something.  I  would like to know  what  is  being

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen tell me that the patrol boats of

the  Maritime  Command do patrol the  said  areas,

especially along the territorial waters, but  they

do  not  seem to be very effective for  they  were

merely  passing by. In other words, the sea  lanes

used   by   our   fishermen  are  not   adequately

patrolled.  I  wonder  whether  the  Ministry   of

Defence  could look into this. Well,  the  Defence

Minister may turn round and say, "There were  only

few  cases reported to us. And if there are  more,

why  do the fishermen not report?" I can only  say

that  some  reports have been made and  some  have

not.  The simple reason why some reports have  not

been  made is that the fishermen see no  point  in

reporting  as they say that nothing can  be  done.

Some time ago, I read a news item in a local paper

which states that very few amateur fishermen would

dare go out to the South China Sea these days  for

fear  of being harassed by these pirates. This  is

not  an  exaggeration, but a fact. I do  not  know

whether the Defence Minister is satisfied with the

present  set-up  of the Maritime Command  and  the

role  it is now playing. In this respect, can  the

Minister inform this House on the steps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



he  proposes to take to give better protection  to

our  fishermen  from  being  harassed  by  pirates

within and near our territorial waters? If he  can

assure this House that he is looking into this,  I

am   sure  the  fishermen  in  my  area  would  be

grateful. I feel strongly that one aspect  of  the

Maritime Command's duties would include this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a topic that constitutes the usual cry of

Members of Parliament for the rural areas  is  the

inadequacy  of  Government to  provide  the  rural

folks   with  amenities  like  roads,  water   and

electricity supplies and street lighting. Though a

sum  of  slightly more than $4 million  was  voted

earlier  this year to meet the requirement  of  58

constituencies  then (and now it is  being  spread

over 65 constituencies) these rural constituencies

usually  use  up most of the funds  allocated.  In

spite  of  this, still much more funds are  needed

for  more  has to be done. If I were  to  ask  the

Minister  for  Law and Home Affairs, and  National

Development, for an increase in the allocation  of

funds  to  the rural areas, he will most certainly

say  that he is in sympathy with us, but what else

can  he  do,  for  he  is not  holding  the  purse

strings!  Well,  then,  I will  urge  the  Finance

Minister  to consider the plight of the  residents

in  the rural areas when he presents the budget in

March  next  year. I can only request  him  to  be

mindful of the words of the President that  "There

is  a bloom which will spread from the city to the

new   towns,  and  through  to  the  villages  and

kampongs in the rural areas". On our side, we, the

MPs  for the rural areas, earnestly hope that  the

bloom  will take the shape of more metalled roads,

electricity  and  water  supplies,  better  street

lighting  and  better drainage. If  this  happens,

then I say the bloom is fair and realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I conclude I would also

like  to touch on the Ministerial statements  made

last  week and earlier this week in this House.  I

choose  to make comment now because only questions

can  be asked of Ministerial statements, and very

often they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



"lost"  even  though  answered.  Sir,  the  Finance

Minister in his Ministerial statement raised  taxes

on  motor vehicles, petrol, wines, tobacco, etc. He

said  that the taxes raised would not hit  the  low

income  group.  I  do not think  this  is  entirely

correct  because  the increases in  tax  on  wines,

liquor,  beer and stout do bit them quite hard,  if

not,  hard enough. Let me illustrate. I do not know

whether  he is aware that dinner parties are  given

by  the  low income group on occasions of  marriage

and  anniversaries. The majority of the  population

are  below the age of 30, and marriages take  place

every  day.  And  when receptions and  dinners  are

held,  hard  and soft drinks are usually  provided.

This is not lavishness, as it is only customary  on

such auspicious occasions. Even if one were to  cut

down  on  such  expenditure, I just wonder  by  how

much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister also increased the import

duty on cars from 30 per cent to 45 per cent, but I

note  that  he has not imposed the excise  duty  on

locally  assembled  vehicles. This  gives  one  the

impression  that he is giving the 15 per  `cent  or

more  to the local assemblers who will have an edge

over  the  importers. If the objective  behind  the

introduction   of  the  additional   duty   is   to

discourage  people  from owning  cars  and  to  use

public transport instead, then I think excise  duty

should be introduced. Otherwise, prospective buyers

will  be encouraged to buy locally assembled  cars,

big  and  small as they are, for they cost so  much

less!  For,  after all, excise duty does  bring  in

revenue. If it does, why not impose it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another counter-effect on the recent increases

in   customs  duties,  I  would  like  the  Finance

Minister to consider that with high customs duties,

smuggling  can  be made more profitable.  Smuggling

may  well be on the increase instead. I think there

must  be some sort of balance. However, I must  say

that  the move to increase the tax on luxury  items

is good.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the statement made by the

Health  Minister  when he raised  the  accouchement

fees  in  Government hospitals. I do not share  his

view  that  "For  the Singapore of the  1970's  the

third  child is a luxury. The fourth and fifth  are

anti-social  acts." The Minister also pointed  out,

in  answer  to a question, that he was not  against

those  who could afford the 3rd, 4th or 5th  child,

and  he also said to the effect "by all means  have

more if you can afford." I am of the view that  the

statement  is  not  only unfair but  contradictory.

Well, according to him, lowering the birth rate  is

the best solution to raise our standard of life and

quality of the environment. And the introduction of

increased accouchement charges with effect from 1st

August  next year is primarily aimed at  the  lower

income  group that have or are going to have  large

families in the 70's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister concerned has admitted in his

statement  that  there has been a  decline  in  the

birth-rate through family planning. I say this is a

good  sign; but I was disappointed that he did  not

take  up the suggestion made by the Member for  Kim

Seng  who suggested persuasion as a means. I  would

like  to  urge  him  to  consider  this  suggestion

seriously  and  to  get  the  Family  Planning  and

Population Control Board to launch a relentless and

intensified  campaign in the rural areas,  to  make

full  use of the mass media and to conduct courses.

I say, do this first, and should the birth rate not

be lowered further or not at the desired rate, then

only  can  the  Government resort  to  measures  as

contained in the statement. We have said  that  our

electorate is sophisticated enough and that we have

been  quite successful in mass education.  I  would

like to urge that we postpone the implementation of

increasing such charges and see the effect of  such

a  campaign.  Frankly, I do not  think  people  are

happy  with  the introduction of such measures  for

they do not like to be told what to do and what not

to  do.  And  with the growing population  becoming

more  and  more literate, especially in the  1970's

and beyond, coupled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



with  it such mass education, I  am  positive

that the desired result can be achieved without any

penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.



<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  12th  of  this  month  the

President  delivered his Address on behalf  of  the

Government, in which policy statements  were  made.

In  his  Address, the President charted the various

tasks   and  measures  to  be  taken  for   further

improvement  of  the  country over  the  next  five

years.  Undoubtedly,  with the  fulfilment  of  all

these  measures, Singapore will certainly become  a

more   progressive,  stronger  and  more   gracious

country, with a better and happier life for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that in the Addendum on

the  Ministry of Education, stress is made that the

quality  of  trained teachers will be enhanced  and

the  contents  of textbooks improved.  It  is  also

stated  in  the  Addendum that: "As more  qualified

teachers   become  available,  the  teacher-student

ratio will improve, reducing the number of students

per  class to provide more individual attention for

each  student."  This  is a  very  encouraging  and

praiseworthy  policy. As we all know  education  is

the foundation of nation-building. If we can really

ensure  that  students  are given  more  individual

attention,  then there is no reason why  we  cannot

produce much better students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past few days, several Members of

this  House  have  expressed  their  views  on  the

administration  of  the Ministry  of  Education.  I

would  like to take this opportunity to reflect  to

this House on matters that I have observed. Sir, it

is  quite  usual for the Ministry of  Education  to

send  relief  teachers  to schools  when  for  some

reason  or other the regular teachers have left  or

are on leave. This is only a temporary measure,  in

my  view.  At  best,  it is an  expedient,  because

relief   teachers  can  only  be   temporary.   But

sometimes this causes dislocation, particularly  to

those students who are in the final year. As far as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



know, there was one secondary school with about  70

teachers in both sessions. Before the term was out,

there  was  a  turnover  of  more  than  40  relief

teachers  in  this  particular  school.  For   some

subjects, the students had to wait for more than  a

month  before they could get relief teachers. These

relief teachers only stayed for a short while. Sir,

I have also been informed that this also happens to

some  other schools in Singapore. What we  fail  to

understand  is that while, on the one  hand,  there

are  many  trained teachers waiting to be recruited

or  appointed,  on the other hand, there  are  many

vacancies yet to be filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government should think very carefully

and  analytically  before a  decision  is  made  or

implemented.  It seems to me that the  Ministry  of

Education  is  one  particular Ministry  which  has

frequently changed its policies or decisions. As in

the case of the secondary technical school which  I

have  just  referred to, initially this school  had

both   technical  and  academic  classes.  In   the

beginning, the students and teachers were all  very

devoted  and  hardworking, and within a  few  years

they  had created a fine tradition of devotion  and

hard-work. But shortly after that, the Ministry  of

Education  converted  this  school  into   a   pure

technical school and abolished the first and second

year  classes. Because of this, students'  stay  in

the school was shortened. Thus the students had  no

feeling  of  attachment  for  the  school  and  the

teachers  also  could not understand  the  students

well,  resulting  in  poor  performance.  The  fine

tradition  was thrown overboard. In view  of  this,

the  Ministry  of Education allowed the  school  to

recruit  first  year students at the  beginning  of

this year. I understand the school is also going to

have  academic  classes next year. All  this  shows

that the Ministry of Education has been too rash in

making decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Culture and

the  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs,  the  President

stated  that  the mass media, both  Government  and

private,  must  help to inculcate  the  virtues  of

patriotism,  pride  in  the  national  effort   and

achievement and the importance of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



teamwork  and  national endeavour as necessary  for

group   success.   The  inculcation   of   national

consciousness for the building of a rugged  society

is one of the pressing tasks ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, I met a student leader of an

institution  of higher learning. He  told  me  that

most  of his university mates were rather depressed

and downhearted, devoid of fighting spirit. He said

the  society  was to be responsible for  all  this.

Sir,  is  it not a pity that even among the  future

stalwarts  of  our  society  there  could  be  such

thinking? Moreover, among our young people today  a

great  many  of them are still dependent  on  their

parents,  and  it is also a pity to see  that  they

have taken deeply to a life of decadence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last weekend I had the opportunity to see a show

provided by children of kindergarten classes run by

the  People's Association. The programme was  very

attractive  and  entertaining,  and  it  was   very

meaningful  in content. It was a very  praiseworthy

performance. What was regrettable was that  in  the

souvenir  magazine for this occasion. I  noted  the

following remarks in the "What we say" column:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I must study hard in order to become a rich

father in future;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must study hard so that when I grow up I can

make  more money for my father and mother to fatten

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must study hard now in order to be first in the

class and win a prize.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the remarks made by these innocent

children  of five or six years of age,  we  can  at

once  know what their thinking is. I wonder if  the

teachers had inculcated in them the right thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government does not seem to have done enough

to  curb yellow culture and to check the spread  of

inimical western fads. Many films, which have  been

banned  in  our  country, have been allowed  to  be

advertised in the local press. The campaign to curb

long hair announced by the authorities and launched

with  all  seriousness appears to  he  short-lived.

Even  today  we  can see posters on  the  walls  of

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



offices saying that those who sport long hair  will

not be welcome and will he dealt with last. Yet  we

often see many people sporting long hair and in odd

clothes roaming about the streets, and going in and

out of Government departments. Even some Government

servants  are sporting long hair, many of whom  are

office boys in uniform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, industrialisation and economic development

is  the life-blood of our country. In the past  few

years  our  efforts  and achievements  in  economic

development have become a fact and is open for  all

to  see.  As the President has pointed out  in  his

speech,  in order to maintain the economic momentum

the policy of quantitative achievement is no longer

adequate  to meet our present needs. He  also  said

that we could now afford to select those industries

which  would not ruin the environment. It  is  time

now  for us to take stock and to rectify and adjust

any errors. Some foreign investors have made use of

our  industrialisation policy  to  benefit  in  the

transitional period. They exploited the  weaknesses

in  our  immigration  policy and  monopolised  high

technology and managerial administration,  so  that

our  citizens are denied the opportunities  arising

therefrom.  Some  of these foreign  investors  even

played foul to achieve their selfish interests. Not

long  ago,  the Minister for Labour  spoke  at  the

annual    dinner   of   the   Singapore   Employers

Federation, appealing to our small and medium-sized

enterprises  to  speed up modernisation  to  create

keen   competition.  He  also  urged  the   Chinese

educated   senior  personnel  to   take   part   in

management  training  in  order  to  make   further

contributions to the prosperity of the country.  In

its  wake,  I am glad to note that next  month  the

Chinese  Chamber  of Commerce and  the  Faculty  of

Commerce  of  the Nanyang University  will  jointly

hold  a  series of vocational training  courses  in

management  and  administration  for  the   Chinese

educated  personnel who serve in medium  and  small

industries  to provide them with opportunities  for

further  education. No doubt, this is most  timely.

We  hope  it  will  really  serve  the  purpose  of

training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



more  managerial personnel for our country to  meet

our  needs,  and  we also hope  that  from  now  on

Nanyang  University will take fuller initiative  to

establish closer links with the society in order to

make greater and more positive contribution to  the

advancement of our nation and our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion moved by the Member for

Bukit Batok thanking the President for his speech.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I wish to support the motion of thanks moved by the

Member for Bukit Batok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development programmes outlined in the

addendum   to   the  President's   speech   deserve

commendation.  Such  programmes  have   also   been

proposed  in  some other developing countries.  But

the  vital  difference is that our programmes  will

not  simply  be  blueprints but will be  translated

into reality and without fail. We in Singapore have

witnessed achievements after achievements by reason

of  the  determined efforts of an honest government

and  the  active  co-operation  and  support  of  a

hardworking population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this

opportunity  to  touch  on  some  aspects  of   the

policies outlined by the President, and I hope that

the  Government will give serious consideration  to

the comments made here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the addendum to the President's speech

concerning  the Ministry of Labour, the  Government

has proposed to regulate the rate of wage increases

so  as  to keep pace with any rise in the  cost  of

living and level of expectation of workers, no more

and no less. Such a proposal is much to be welcomed

as  the  desirability of orderly wage increases  is

beyond   question.  In  any  inflation  of   prices

resulting  from  disorderly wage increases,  it  is

always the wage-earners themselves who suffer since

whatever wage increases they may receive are  bound

to be more than swallowed up by price increases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am wondering as to the means the

Government  intends  to  use  in  controlling  wage

increases,   in   the  absence  of   any   proposed

legislation  to regulate prices and incomes.  As  I

see  it,  the  only two main groups of wage-earners

over   whose  wages  the  Government  may  exercise

effective  control are (1) employees in the  public

sector,  whether  organised or otherwise,  and  (2)

employees who are organised in the private  sector.

Unorganised   workers,  who  include   almost   all

managers and executives, however, constitute by far

the  greater  majority  of  the  workforce  in  the

Republic.  For the unorganised workers who  do  not

come  within  the  jurisdiction of  the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court  or  the  consideration  of  the

National Wages Council, there is nothing to prevent

their  respective  employers  from  according  them

unlimited wage or salary increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange as it may seem to be, an employer may

find  it more profitable, for instance, to pay wage

increases to retain or attract skilled workers  who

are  in short supply, by reason of the heavy outlay

in  time  and cost for training such workers.  Then

again  there are employers who are prepared to  pay

their  workers  more  as  an  incentive  for  their

remaining  unorganised.  The  desire  to   convince

workers  of  the  disadvantages of being  organised

also  explains why some employers, after concluding

a collective agreement on the lowest terms possible

by  sobbing  their hearts out at  the  Ministry  of

Labour and before the Industrial Arbitration Court,

unilaterally and voluntarily proceed to grant their

employees more favourable benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that so long as

employers  are  permitted to  discriminate  between

employees  on  an arbitrary basis,  as  opposed  to

differentials of pay on an objective  basis,  there

is bound to be frustration and unrest among workers

in  the matter of pay. If trade unions are required

to  exercise restraint over wage increases  in  the

national   interest,  there  should  be  reciprocal

restraint  by  employers in the exercise  of  their

prerogative to accord



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



wage  increases on a voluntary basis,  particularly

the unorganised employees, including executives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed regulations requiring applicants for

work  permits to undergo a medical examination will

undoubtedly  impose a severe strain on our  medical

service. As a matter of fact, such requirements are

already  being  practised by many well  established

firms. I wonder whether the Ministry of Labour will

consider  accepting medical certificates issued  by

company doctors in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of creches and kindergartens in

densely  populated areas is indeed most welcome  by

housewives  who  wish to work to  supplement  their

family income. But there are housewives who may not

want  to  put  their children in creches  for  some

reason  or  other.  The Ministry  of  Labour  could

assist such housewives by being more liberal in the

granting of work permits for domestic servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the addendum relating to the

Ministry   of   Communications  stated   that   the

Republic's  communications system will be  expanded

and  improved upon. Here, I would like to draw  the

Ministry's  attention  to  the  state  of  the  bus

services. It is true that the reorganisation of the

bus services some time ago had greatly improved `on

the  chaotic conditions that existed in  the  past.

However, it is not an uncommon sight to see stalled

buses  in every part of the town. Some of the buses

are fairly new. Breakdown of buses not only causes

traffic  congestion but also inconvenience  to  the

travelling public. Such a state of affairs will run

counter to the Government's encouragement to people

to  travel by public transport rather than by cars.

When  a  bus breaks down, the driver and  conductor

usually  disappear  from  the  scene,  leaving  the

passengers   stranded  and  the   bus   obstructing

traffic.  I  would  suggest that bus  operators  be

required  to  maintain their buses in good  running

order and That heavy penalties should be imposed if

they do not do so.

<br><br>4.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, I am happy and

honoured to speak in support of the motion moved by

the  hon.  Member  for  Bukit Batok,  thanking  the

President  for  the Speech which  he  delivered  on

behalf  of  the  Government at the opening  of  the

First Session of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read and studied the Speech and subsequent

Addenda,  I  am  convinced that the Government  had

done  its utmost in deeds and planning to  build  a

Singapore which is today the pride of its  citizens

and  the  envy  of its neighbours.  The  plans  and

guidelines  laid out before us for  the  next  five

years  are glowing testimonies of a government  led

by  able,  dedicated and far-sighted  leaders,  men

with  vision  who see beyond the present  into  the

future,  men  who stand fast by logic,  reason  and

principles, and men with imagination who  care  for

the people's welfare and Singapore's destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of nation-building is an unending

one.  Much  had  been done in the  past,  but  much

remains to be done. Never before in the history  of

our  country is there such material abundance  with

ample opportunities for jobs and the promise  of  a

good  life.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we have come  a  long

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy is buoyant with all the signs of

continuing growth and sustained momentum. We have a

people  characterised by industry,  enterprise  and

drive.  Our defence build-up is sound; a  pragmatic

foreign  policy of dynamic neutralism and  regional

co-operation  and goodwill, tough  internal  social

and  labour measures; all these ensuring  political

stability,  creating the right climate for  massive

foreign capital investments, and sustained economic

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the past we emphasised on national

security and survival, we now stress on the quality

of  life  and gracious living. And this is  rightly

so. In the next five years, we seek in the words of

the President, to achieve in qualitative terms what

in the last five years we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



have achieved in quantitative terms. Wages will  go

up  in  a  steady and orderly fashion.  Health  and

education are fundamental guarantees for all, young

and old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living must now carry new dimensions-meaning and

purpose, not toil and sweat and more toil and  more

sweat.  The  Government seeks a more gracious  life

for  all. The city is now clean and green. It  will

be   cleaner   and   greener.   More   recreational

facilities  and social amenities are promised.  The

performing arts are encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing wealth, the problem of leisure

will inevitably set in. The afflictions of advanced

western  societies  are  a constant  reminder  that

unless  we  take adequate steps to avert  them,  we

shall in the years to come succumb. With more money

and free time, our youths will turn to distractions

and  activities  that today bear headlines  in  the

mass media in western societies. We have instituted

effective measures against drug-taking. But we must

remain  vigilant and sustain efforts  to  inculcate

good habits and healthy living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government quite correctly has placed

increasing  emphasis on sports and extra-curricular

activities in schools. Our educational system  must

gear itself towards a more comprehensive education.

Bi-lingualism   is  stressed  and  multi-lingualism

encouraged.   Civics   is  part   of   the   school

curriculum. More time must be given to the teaching

of  the  arts and subjects like history,  geography

and  literature must have greater relevance to  the

Southeast Asian and Asian milieu. In short, we seek

to  produce  educated men with all-round  abilities

and not just literate men with narrow interests and

knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal recognition must be given to extra-curricular activities and sports by awarding

credits that count in the final analysis and  final

assessment  of a student's performance, entry  into

institutions of higher learning and employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our campaign to build a people tough in mind

and body and a rugged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



society,  it is not untimely for the Government  to

consider establishing a Ministry of Sports.  Active

participation and interests in sports is so much  a

part  of' our national character. Numerous national

sports associations are in existence and much money

is  spent by these and other interested parties  in

sports promotion. Yet the standard of sports leaves

much to be desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many dedicated people who have given

their  best in time, energy and years. The National

Sports  Promotion Board, in spite  of  its  initial

promise,  is  now  bogged  down  by  financial  and

organisational problems. A new Ministry  of  Sports

will  certainly he a timely and welcome move.  With

official recognition, Mr Speaker, a new chapter for

sports will begin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centralised control and authority, finance,

expertise,  purpose and fair play will do  much  to

elevate sports from the near-gutter state it is now

in  to higher plains. Next year, we shall host  the

SEAP  Games  and,  in 1978, the  Asian  Games.  The

National  Stadium  is  near  completion.  So   much

nationalism  and pride are generated in competitive

sports  and a real boost will come if our sportsmen

and athletes do well in these Games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a medical practitioner, I

feel  it  incumbent upon me to comment  on  medical

service  in Singapore. I am proud of the fact  that

we  do  indeed  have  the best medical  service  in

Southeast Asia. Our doctor-population ratio is  the

lowest.  The Government's decision to build  a  new

General  Hospital to replace the  existing  one  at

Outram Road is well received by the public and  the

medical  profession. Yet I would be failing  in  my

duty  if  I do not bring to the attention  of  this

House some aspects of existing medical service that

need  improvement. We are paying ample emphasis  on

preventive  medicine. But curative  medicine  needs

equal emphasis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, good health is a vital pre-condition to a more active and meaningful life. As

the  standard of living goes up, people will demand

better medical care. At present in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



Government  institutions, there is a real  shortage

of  doctors, ancillary staff, ward space and  other

facilities.  There  will continue  the  problem  of

attracting  and retaining top calibre personnel  as

long  as pay and service conditions compare  poorly

with   private  practice.  Again,  we   need   more

specialists  who can render expert  treatment.  Not

only do we have the problem of retaining doctors in

service,  but  we  now face the  added  problem  of

attracting  good students to study  medicine.  Each

year  some 120 students at the Faculty of  Medicine

of the University of Singapore graduate as doctors.

Today some 50 per cent of the 3rd year students are

non-citizens and 60-70 per cent of the 1st and  2nd

year students are non-citizens. Very similar trends

are  present  in  the dental and pharmacy  schools.

What these figures mean really is that we shall  he

producing  fewer and fewer doctors to cope  with  a

situation  of rising expectation among  the  people

for better health care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, faced with this manpower shortage problem,

may I therefore suggest to the Health Ministry that

they  maximise  the utilisation of available  staff

and post doctors in optimal strength to the various

departments.  The surgical wards are  over-burdened

with  work  and more medical officers and  housemen

are needed. Again we have too few anaesthetists and

insufficient operating theatres. On many  occasions

operations  for  surgical emergencies  are  delayed

with  consequent  rise in morbidity  and  mortality

risks.   The   Ministry  must  be   sensitive   and

responsive  to staff request for elective  postings

anti  the  period of posting must  be  such  as  to

enable doctors to obtain the necessary requirements

for   specialist  training.  In  short,  we  should

orientate  the  medical service from  one  of  pure

service  to one where service commitments  are  met

optimally  with job satisfaction and  training  for

doctors and staff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is worth considering the setting up

of  convalescent homes for patients  who  are  well

enough not to require constant doctor care but sick

enough  not  to be up and about. Many patients  are

discharged from the hospitals too early because  of

bed   shortage   and   inadequate   medical   care,

thereafter  leading  to  unnecessary  medical   and

surgical   complications.  This  causes  suffering,

prolonged  medical leave and loss of  many  working

clays.  Often  patients are retained  in  wards  in

spite  of  ward  overcrowding because  of  medical,

social  and  economic reasons.  Old  patients  with

working children, surgical and orthopaedic patients

in high-rise flats, disabled celibates, just cannot

be  sent  away. Convalescent homes are  cheaper  to

build  and  maintain than hospitals, and  certainly

more   economical   in  the   long   run.   Indeed,

convalescent  homes  have become  an  indispensable

feature  of good medical practice in most  advanced

western countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I support the motion moved by the

Member for Bukit Batok, thanking the President  for

his  speech made in the House on the 12th  of  this

month.  In his speech the President indicates  that

in  this new age and environment our people  should

carry  out new tasks and try their best to keep  in

step  with  all round development and  progress.  I

believe  our people can redouble their efforts  and

strive  for  individual and national  progress  and

security. In the speech of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



President,  mention  was made about  spreading  the

affluence  of the city to the rural areas.  We  all

welcome this policy. We hope this objective can  be

achieved   early.  The  rural  people  are   always

diligent. They have struggled very hard to eke  out

a  living from the land. Their contribution to  our

country  has  in  no way burn small.  However,  the

services  they  obtain  from  the  Government   are

comparatively  few. Now that we have developed  and

progressed,  we  should  be  able  to  improve  the

livelihood of our rural folks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since independence the Government has been

carrying out large scale construction work, even in

the rural areas. Every year millions of dollars are

allotted  for development of the rural areas,  such

as  the provision of electricity, water, roads  and

other  social facilities, in order to  improve  the

living conditions of the rural people. However,  in

spite  of  our  efforts in the  rural  areas,  many

problems and difficulties have still to be  solved.

There  are many places without any electricity  and

water supplies. To the rural folks, their immediate

need is roads, water and electricity. For a country

like  ours, which claims to be a developed country,

we  should not allow this situation to exist.  From

the projects carried out in the past, I see that we

lack   a   comprehensive  and  unified  scheme   of

development.  I  hope  the  Ministry  of   National

Development will formulate a comprehensive plan for

the  development of the rural areas so that  water,

electricity  and  roads may be supplied  throughout

our  country.  This will prevent any  suspicion  or

discontent among the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the speech mention was also made about

the efforts of the Ministry of National Development

to  solve our housing problem. Now, the Ministry is

paying   attention   to  the  provision   of   more

recreational facilities in the residential areas. I

feel  that  it  is  necessary to  provide  adequate

social  amenities in the Woodlands satellite  town.

There  should  be better facilities for  recreation

for the residents there, including sports. When all

this  is  done,  it  can  be  said  to  be  another

achievement of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



Government in trying to provide better services  to

the  rural people. It will thus narrow the  gap  in

the  living  standard between the rural people  and

that of the urban dwellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have personally witnessed the progress of

the  projects out there, and I found that the first

batch of flats in the housing estate is expected to

be   completed  early  next  year  for  allocation.

However,  the  development of  housing  estates  in

Woodlands  seems  to  have no connection  with  the

Ministry of Education, because there seems to be no

sign  of any provision for a school. So we can well

imagine  the  situation in the years to  come  when

people  move into this new satellite town  only  to

find  that their children will not be able to enrol

in any of the existing schools. I hope the Ministry

of  Education will pay attention `to these problems

arising  from  the building of this  new  satellite

town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, whenever a new satellite

town  is built certain people must be affected  and

they  have  to be resettled. However,  there  is  a

difference in the psychological effect between  the

removal  of  rural people and the  urban  dwellers.

When  urban dwellers move out, they move only to  a

better  environment or to better houses.  But  when

the rural folks are resettled, they are moved to  a

new  environment of which they have  no  knowledge.

They   will   be   worried  about  the   facilities

available,  for  example, schools, playgrounds  and

other problems like transport for their children to

go  to new schools. All these difficulties increase

their psychological tension and pressure, and  will

cause  more  social  problems,  thereby  increasing

discontent against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Woodlands area, which is in my

constituency, there will be many resettlement cases

in  the  future. We should note that  even  at  the

present juncture resettling the rural people causes

them  difficulty. I therefore hope the  authorities

concerned  will  in  consultation  with  the  rural

people set up a Resettlement Committee in order  to

co-ordinate and assist in the resettlement  of  the

rural folks affected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (in Mandarin):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I would like to  join  the  hon.

Members of the House, who have spoken just now,  in

their  expression  of thanks and gratitude  to  our

President for his enlightening Address made at  the

opening of Parliament on 12th October, 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with pride that I endorse my strong support

to  the  challenge posed by the President  to  make

Singapore  a  centre for excellence in  all  fields

important  to  our  economic, cultural  and  social

life.  Our  main concern now is to  find  ways  and

means  to sustain and further develop the  pace  of

growth that exists with the thriving economy of our

Republic. Let it be our priority task for the  next

five  years  to endeavour in every way possible  to

achieve  higher standards in everything,  with  the

emphasis  on quality whether in jobs, in social  or

recreational amenities, or homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social policy must of necessity reflect our

deep  concern for the welfare of the less fortunate

in  our society. But it must at the same time be  a

policy  in keeping with our tradition of enterprise

and  industry  and  our desire for  excellence  and

achievement. In a society like ours,  there  is  no

place  for the indolent. If we are to make progress

and  to  prosper, everyone must work and  make  his

personal contribution. No one should expect to  get

something for nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social welfare, I fully endorse

the  President's  statement that  in  view  of  the

extenuating circumstances in Singapore, we can ill-afford  to adopt the characteristic of the  welfare

state  syndrome  in  supplying everything  free  to

everybody  who wants it from cradle  to  grave.  We

would  like to see a Singapore where everybody  who

can  work shall work unless he or she is beset with

sickness, severe disability or old age. We  do  not

believe in merely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



doling  out  free  gifts which will  lead  to  much

abuse.  The  Government's intention  is  to  assist

everyone  to achieve the fullest degree  of  social

and economic adjustments and usefulness of which he

is  capable. It is for this reason that an  all-out

effort   has  been  made  by  the  Social   Welfare

Department   to   assist   the   handicapped,   the

destitutes  and  other  needy  persons,  to  obtain

gainful  employment so that they need not  continue

to  depend  on public assistance. In this  respect,

the Social Welfare Department under our Ministry is

going  all  out  to establish more creches  in  the

immediate  future in order to enable  more  married

mothers  to leave their homes to work and  to  play

their role in increasing the family income as  well

as  the productivity of the nation. For example,  a

new  creche  will be added on to our long  list  of

existing creches in Singapore, with the opening  of

the  huge Toa Payoh Creche in the Toa Payoh  Estate

before  the end of the year. More creches  will  he

built  in  housing estates and areas  with  a  high

density  of population, so that mothers  can  leave

their babies and children safely in the creche  and

concentrate in their effort of increasing their own

income and the national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the welfare homes run by the Social

Welfare Department, every effort is made to  ensure

that  the  inmates, who rely on  public  funds  for

their subsistence, will be able to contribute  even

though in a small way to society, so that they  are

not  getting  something for nothing.  The  workable

among  the  aged,  and  the  employable  among  the

destitute persons, who are now looked after by  the

Social Welfare Department, will have to work or  be

trained  to  work in a manner that is commensurable

and  suitable to their physical and mental ability.

It is only those who are positively unable to work,

on account of their very old age, sickness or their

unfortunate circumstances, who may be excused  from

carrying  out  any serious job. But even  then,  in

their own small way, they will be encouraged to  do

some  handicraft work or some light  labour  within

their  means  and ability to help them  play  their

part in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



society.  In  this  way,  they  will  be  able   to

subscribe productively to the nation that whilst we

are  subsidising  them for their  livelihood,  they

will at least be able to pay a small percentage  of

the actual cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming years, the emphasis in the

expansion of social services will be on quality and

participation.  Plans  have already  been  made  to

strengthen  the  existing system of social  welfare

services  through  the  restructuring  of  existing

welfare  institutions  and  the  provision  of  new

facilities  and  services  consonant  with   modern

concepts  of  social planning. The Government  will

strengthen  its  programme of promoting  the  well-being  of families, children and youths as well  as

protective  measures  for the  aged,  and  for  the

physically,   mentally  and  socially  handicapped.

Apart  from the humanitarian objectives of  such  a

programme,  it  is  intended  to  organise   social

services   in   such  a  way  as  to   ensure   the

conservation  and  development of  human  resources

which are vital for economic expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to the President for pointing out

in his Address the existence of fortunately only  a

handful of our citizens who still believe that  the

State owes them a living, a good living. These  are

usually  the youngsters who ape the bad  habits  of

western  culture,  who  don  long  hair,  who  lend

themselves  to drug abuse and who eke  the  easiest

way  out  for a living by terrorising other people.

Such  misfits in our society should be  brought  to

task, and the quicker they realise that nothing  in

life  is  for free, the better it will be  for  the

future of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be more conscious of the pressures which

push some of our young people into consumption  and

other  thought-habits, which  are  often  not  only

inappropriate to our work ethics and life-style for

nation building, but also antagonistic to sustained

social and economic growth and which give birth  to

tensions which may undermine and destroy the fruits

of  hard endeavour. True, no society can completely

insulate  itself  against adverse  influences  like

hippism and the drug sub-culture, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



it will be a grave dereliction of duty if we do not

take  firm measures at an early stage to counteract

such influences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that our crucial task is to

provide  community programmes which can  catch  the

imagination of our young people to ensure that they

will not fritter their time away but are given  the

opportunity to participate in meaningful activities

of benefit to the society and to themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our youth must be encouraged to participate in

healthy and fruitful past-times, As Members must be

aware, our intention is to develop sports as a  way

of  life in Singapore. Already, the foundation  for

mass  participation in sports has  been  laid.  The

Government  is  committed to develop through  mass-based and competitive programmes of sports activity

for   the  purposeful  occupation  of  leisure  for

pleasure   by   our   people.   Intra   and   inter

constituency sports programmes will more  and  more

be  encouraged  and  provide the  escape-valve  for

modern  pressures  and needs. In  our  increasingly

urban  society and youthful population, we  believe

that  sports, as a regular habit and as a means  of

entertainment  and enjoyment, should  enthuse  more

and  more as players and spectators and in this way

not  only contribute to a larger measure of fitness

but also productivity and happiness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgent consideration is now being given to the

drawing up of a Master Plan for Sports in Singapore

for the next one or two decades, which, among other

things,  will provide for the requirements  of  the

primary,   secondary   and   tertiary   levels   in

facilities and activities of sports for leisure  as

well as competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look forward to the increasing realisation

of  a  more  rugged and productive  society  and  a

better life and a centre of excellence in Singapore

through  sports and recreation with the seeds  that

are  being  sown  firmly and  increasingly  bearing

fruit in the years to come. This task will be  made

much  more  successful  and  satisfying  if  it  is

realised  that it is in the national interest  that

the public and private sectors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



institutionally and individually,  take  to  sports

consciousness  and  performances   in   every   way

possible, since sports can do only a world of good.

For  the  foreseeable future, sports  in  Singapore

will  essentially he amateur. In this connection  I

wish  to  exhort employers to encourage recognition

and   incentives  for  sportsmen,   including   the

provision of adequate time for the requirements  of

training  of  their sportsmen for  competitive  and

national sports. The Government will on its own  do

all  that  s possible to provide the base  and  the

facilities  and finances to realise through  sports

further  progress in and glories for Singapore  and

to  increasingly engage the leisure-time of  people

in the pleasures of sports.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon.

Members  of  the House will agree with me  that  in

very  few  countries  in the world  which  practise

parliamentary democracy for a party to have won all

the  seats in Parliament for two successive  terms.

Why  is  the PAP so overwhelmingly accepted by  the

people?  Why  are  the majority of  the  people  of

Singapore  subscribing to the ideals  of  the  PAP?

Sir,  for  a  person  who is unconcerned  with  the

political  life and pulse of Singapore, this  might

appear  to  be  a  complex exercise  attempting  to

analyse the cause and result. But the reason behind

it  is really very simple: the PAP which was formed

18   years  ago  as  a  democratic,  non-Communist,

socialist,  and multi-racial party, has adhered  to

two  fundamental beliefs. They are written into the

party constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To abolish the unjust inequalities of wealth

and  opportunities existing in the present  system;

to  establish an economic order which will give all

citizens  the  right  to  work  and  full  economic

returns  for  their labour and skill; to  ensure  a

decent living and social security to all those who,

through  sickness,  infirmity or  old  age  can  no

longer work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To infuse into the people a spirit of

national unity, self-respect and self-reliance, and

to  inspire them with a sense of endeavour  in  the

creation of a prosperous, stable and just society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is with these two fundamental beliefs and

convictions   that  many  of  my  colleagues   have

struggled  fearlessly  in  order  to  achieve   our

ideals.  We fought the colonialists, the right-wing

reactionaries and their lackeys and the Communists.

If  we  did  not  have the guts, the  stamina,  the

courage, the energy and determination to defeat the

Communists and the reactionary forces, many  of  us

will  not be here in this Chamber and the situation

in  Singapore would be entirely different.  In  the

process  we have overcome a multitude of  problems.

Sir,  when the PAP took over the administration  in

1959,  as  a self-government, we knew that  without

honesty,  determined and incorruptible  leadership,

proper planning, hard-work and above all loyalty to

the country and its people we could not survive. We

have  never  run  away  from  any  threat  or   any

difficulty; we stood by our principles  and  fought

for  our  objectives or we would never be  able  to

survive  the  trials and tribulations befalling  us

through the years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were kicked out of Malaysia and

became an independent Republic, we were faced  with

the   hard  facts  -  lack  of  natural  resources,

unemployment,   economic  uncertainty   and,   most

important, national security which became even more

intangible  with the announcement  of  the  British

military rundown. This multitude of problems  would

have deterred those with less fortified minds.  But

not those who were in the PAP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic prosperity and political

stability  that we enjoy today does not  fall  from

heaven,  but paid at a very high price.  These  are

the  results  of sheer hard work of our  population

and  the honest, incorruptible, realistic and  able

leadership who are prepared to sacrifice even their

lives for the country and the people. Sir, although

the PAP had about 70 per cent of the total votes in

the recent general elections,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



there  are  about  30 per cent of  the  votes  cast

against  us.  There  are  many  reasons  for  these

protest votes, for example, personal disappointment

in  not  getting hawker licences or other  permits,

demolition of illegal structures, resettlement, and

a   good   portion   of  the  hard-core   Communist

supporters  and the racialists. Sir,  in  the  next

five years, the Communists will change its line and

tactics  in their struggle. I must warn  the  House

that  the  challenge will not come from the  U.N.F.

led   by  Vetrivelu,  the  Workers  Party  led   by

Jeyaretaam  or the fly-by-night political  parties,

but the Communists. Sir, those of my colleagues who

were  with me in the `50s and early `60s will agree

with   me  that  the  Communists  will  make  rapid

recovery of the ground they have lost if we are not

careful and take things easy or becoming complacent

in  that event, we would lose not by the credits of

others  but  by  our  default. Therefore,  we  must

prepare our battle now, before it is too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was not easy for Singapore to become

independent. We are living at the crossroads of the

East  and  West, and it is because of our strategic

position   that  the  concept  of  an   independent

Singapore  would  be  challenged  from  within  and

without  for  as long as we live. It is unavoidable

that  we  Singaporeans have to  face  this  in  our

lifetime  -  the Communists are out to destroy  the

independence   of   Singapore   and   the   extreme

reactionaries  would wish to hand over  independent

Singapore to others either on a gold platter or  by

violence. We, therefore, must be vigilant and  must

be prepared to meet any contingency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's address, which was delivered

in  this House on the 12th of October, is a  highly

socialistic guideline for our people for  the  next

five   years.  The  Constitutional  amendments   to

protect  the  sovereignty of  our  Republic  is  of

paramount importance, and timely too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In building a robust and rugged society and to

free  our young people from evil influences of  the

West, of drug addiction and hippism, more emphasis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



and  effort will be carried out by the Ministry  of

Social Affairs in the field of Sports. Many coaches

in  different  games were engaged  to  promote  the

standards of our Sports. Sir, I am sure  a  lot  of

public  funds  will be spent on coaches  and  other

facilities. I hope the aim is not only  to  produce

gold  medallists but to inculcate  into  our  young

people  the sense of loyalty, discipline  and  good

sportsmanship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, owing to the fast growth of our industries,

there  is  an  unprecedented  shortage  of  skilled

workers.  The  Ministry of Labour, I presume,  will

issue  work  permits more liberally to non-citizens

with at least a primary education and who must pass

a  medical  examination. Sir, more  and  more  work

permit holders will be staying in Singapore to help

our industrial production. This is, of course, good

for  our  economy. But on the other hand  I  wonder

whether  the  Ministry of Labour has made  thorough

investigations into their background so  that  they

will not pose a security problem to our Republic in

the  years  to  come. Already  we  are  faced  with

increased crime rates. Sir, almost everyday we read

in  the  newspapers that shops are robbed, payrolls

grabbed,  and  people  kidnapped  or  murdered   by

gangsters or hired assassins. It is hoped that with

the reorganisation of the Police Force, crimes will

be  reduced  so that the life and property  of  the

people will be protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the PAP took office, much effort has

been  done to develop the urban areas. The progress

is  tremendous and we deserve to be proud. However,

I  would  like to urge the Government  to  consider

very  seriously  and to implement  immediately  the

building of rural town centres. Although the  rural

residents, farmers and fishermen, enjoy good roads,

electricity,  water, and street  lights,  but  when

these  rural folks come down to the city they  will

compare the improvement and development of the city

with  that  of  the rural areas. They  cannot  help

feeling that the rural areas have been left out  or

ignored. Therefore, these simple people will be  an

easy prey to Communist influence. Sir, although the

Government has plans to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



build new towns in Woodlands and Telok Blangah,  it

is  not  enough. The Government should  immediately

draw  up  plans  to  build and  improve  the  rural

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new mandate has just been given to us by

the people in the recent general elections. For the

next  five years the Government's aim is  to  raise

standards of skill and technological competence and

to     improve    professional    management    and

technological expertise. We are entrusted with this

heavy  task  and we ensure that we will  carry  out

this responsibility to the best of our ability; but

the  most  important ingredient for its success  is

the full co-operation of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I join hon. Members in this House in

expressing  our  thanks to the  President  for  his

address.



<br><br>5.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support  the  motion  of  thanks  to  the

President  for his speech to Parliament,  moved  by

the Member for Bukit Batok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal burden of the President's Speech

and  the  elaborations  contained  in  the  various

Addenda  is the promotion of excellence and quality

in  our  country,  and  that  such  excellence  and

quality can be achieved only through tough exercise

of  our  will to succeed - in other words,  through

continuous  diligent attention to our  work.  I  am

sure  that the same "sheer determination, hard work

and realistic planning" which enabled Singapore  to

make  the grade before will also see it through  in

the  coming years. May I add to what other  Members

have  said,  my  own expression of views  regarding

government  policy? Inasmuch as  others  have  been

affected  by their own preoccupations, I  need  not

deprecate my own, which is adult education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Ministry of Finance is concerned, the

objectives stated in the relevant Addendum can only

be  achieved by our civil service being  geared  to

top



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



productivity  and  efficiency.  The  Minister   for

Finance  himself has, in a speech at  the  official

opening  of the Staff Training Institute, mentioned

that  the civil service' has to be attuned  to  new

developments   that  are  taking   place   in   its

environment.  New  ministries and statutory  bodies

have  been  set  up and the Government  has  itself

become   involved   in  business   and   industrial

enterprises. The Staff Training Institute has since

its  inception organised a large number and variety

of  training activities for various grades of civil

servants. But for the Institute to perform its role

at  maximum  efficiency- the role of  enabling  the

civil service to become an instrument responsive to

the   changes  that  are  taking  place  then  some

reorganisation of the Institute is called for.  For

one,  more  staff  will have to  be  given  to  the

Institute.  For  another,  the  principal  of   the

Institute  will  have  to be  not  merely  a  civil

servant of excellence but also someone who has  the

capabilities  to  be  the head  of  an  educational

institution. The status of principal,  to  make  it

commensurate with the ability of such a person, has

to  be at least equivalent to a University dean of'

faculty.  If  the combination of civil service  and

educational  experience is  not  available  in  any

single  person who can be spared currently for  the

job  of  head of this Institute, I propose that  we

set  about  training  such a  person  so  that  the

Institute  may  be run effectively  as  a  training

institution  for  civil  servants.  Such  a  person

would,  of course, have functions only in  relation

to the running of this Institute as a full-time job

and   not   be   assigned   other   civil   service

administrative jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Ministry of Defence is concerned, now

that  we  have  ensured to an  extent  our  defence

capability, it is hoped that we may be able to  set

about   providing  our  officers  with   continuing

education to add polish to their demeanour as  well

as   skill  and  competence,  and  also  to   their

additional   skill  and  competence   where   their

professional soldiering is concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Foreign Affairs, although this is not directly

within  the province of the Ministry, it  is  about

time  we  thought  of  educating  our  people,  the

ordinary  Singapore citizen, to a greater awareness

of  the larger world beyond Singapore so that  they

may  be  all  the  more able to understand  foreign

policy,  especially  the  great  changes  that  are

taking  place in the alignment of nations. Although

education  is not a direct business of the  Foreign

Ministry, encouragement of understanding of foreign

relations would certainly be part of the Ministry's

portfolio.  In respect of our close neighbours,  we

must give whatever support we can to ASEAN and seek

to  extend real and active co-operation in as  many

fields as possible under the umbrella of ASEAN.  We

should  note  that it is not only the Minister  for

Foreign  Affairs or those working in  his  Ministry

who  can contribute a greater understanding between

ourselves  and  our neighbours.  For  example,  the

recent  visit of our Defence Minister to  Indonesia

has,  I  am sure, cemented further the relationship

between  ourselves  and that nation.  Regional  co-operation   in  respect  of  subjects   under   the

jurisdiction of other Ministries is also  a  policy

we should actively encourage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Addendum relating to the Ministry of

Home  Affairs  is concerned, there are  two  points

which  I  would  like to make. First,  I  think  we

should  pay  special  attention  to  the  need  for

training  an  efficient  specialist  staff  in  the

Commercial Crimes section. Although Singapore is an

international    commercial   centre    in    which

transactions  of  some  sophistication  are   being

carried  out, yet we have been shown to be in  some

respects  woefully  naive.  With  regard   to   the

necessary  co-operation that has to  be  maintained

between  the  Police  and  the  Law  sector,   this

effective co-operation where commercial crimes  are

concerned can only be implemented if our Commercial

Crimes  officers  are equipped with  the  necessary

knowledge and expertise. I propose that we  should,

if necessary, send our officers abroad to relevant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



institutions to be further trained in investigative

skills  related  to commercial crimes.  As  I  have

mentioned  before  on some other  occasion,  and  I

doubt  whether  the  situation has  improved  since

then, the principal training instrument used by the

Commercial  Crimes  Department  seems  to  be   the

Department of Extra-mural Studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to bring up,

and  which  is a responsibility of the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs  as well as that of the  Ministry  of

Communications,  is  the  problem  of  traffic   in

Singapore.  I  am surprised that no  reference  has

been  made  to this matter in the Addendum  on  the

Ministry   of  Home  Affairs.  Annually   we   have

thousands  of  accidents  and  hundreds  of  deaths

besides    innumerable   maimings   and   scarrings

resulting from carelessness and aggression  on  the

roads.  It  is  about time that the traffic  police

took the matter firmly in their hands and proceeded

in a systematic way to educate drivers for courtesy

and  caution  on our streets. If we  are  to  bring

about a sense of excellence, a sense of quality  in

our  people,  we certainly should try to  eradicate

the  rashness  and defiance of the Jaw  that  often

prevails among the users of the roads. Is there any

difference  in  kind  between  the  defiance  of  a

criminal, a, gangster, a person who commits assault

and  other  depredations on the one hand,  and  the

defiance  of  the violent user of the road  on  the

other? Is there any difference between the loss  of

income, loss of life, loss of man-hours suffered by

those involved in accidents on the road on the  one

hand, and those involved in industrial accidents on

the other? Inasmuch as we want to instil a sense of

one  person identifying with his neighbour  in  our

community centres, in our housing estates,  in  our

clubs,  in our recreational grounds, we have  still

to instil this regard of a person for his fellowman

also  on  the roads where thousands of  people  are

moving  daily, where Singaporeans come  in  contact

with  Singaporeans but frequently in  a  manner  of

aggressive   competition  in  which   feelings   of

community are almost completely forgotten.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we should congratulate the

Minister  for  Science  and  Technology   for   his

foresight in setting up the Science Centre,  and  I

hope   that   this  institution  will  relate   its

activities  closely  to  the  interests  and  needs

especially  of  our  young  people,  as   well   as

represent  itself as an outstanding institution  of

its kind in Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may look forward, in the not too distant

future, to seeing the effective implementation of a

mass  rapid transit scheme to relieve our  domestic

transportation problems. More immediately, however,

our present bus service has to be further improved.

The  disciplining  of a few hard-core  recalcitrant

bus  drivers, who have shown scant regard  for  the

comfort  and  convenience of  bus  users,  must  be

complemented  by improvement in present  conditions

of  work  of  bus drivers which result  from  their

having to race around trying to keep to unrealistic

schedules.   Bus   owners  should   co-operate   by

improving  the  mechanical as well as accommodation

quality of their buses. It is only by making a  bus

trip   a   relatively  pleasant   and   comfortable

experience that we can induce our citizens  to  use

public  transport more frequently. Their  education

is through enjoying a bus ride. Being rattled along

to  their  destination, willy-nilly, is a deterrent

educational experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be happy to note the reference in the

Ministry of Labour Addendum to encouragement  being

given   to  workers  to  constantly  improve  their

knowledge   and  skills  (incidentally,   why   not

attitudes  also?)  in adult and workers'  education

courses. But this is not only to enable a worker to

further  increase his capacity in  more  productive

labour,   as  has  been  stated  in  the   Addendum

(although we should stress the importance of this),

hut  also  that he should use education to  improve

his  cultural and spiritual condition. I hope  that

the  Minister for Labour will support any  move  to

persuade Government to grant paid leave to  workers

who   may   like   to  attend  relevant   full-time

continuing education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



courses  such  as may indeed  increase  the

worker's capacity for more productive labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department intends to set

up factory farms and flatted farms. I hope that all

required  educational measures  will  be  taken  to

enable   farmers  to  adjust  to  this  aspect   of

urbanisation. Further, it is perhaps important  for

farmers  to  be educated to the importance  of  co-operatives,  and be given aid to set  up  such  co-operatives

as  will  prevent  them   from   being

exploited as they have been in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where our health environment is concerned the

"Keep  Singapore Clean" campaigns have been  models

of   co-ordinated  public  education  activity.  My

reference  to this, in discussions of our  informal

adult  education  procedures, has  evoked  on  many

occasions  extreme  interest and  admiration  among

people  overseas. I hope that such public education

activity  will  continue to feature prominently  in

the  life of our city. Perhaps a campaign  of  this

kind   could   he  conducted  to  improve   traffic

conditions in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has jurisdiction over the

mass  media.  I hope that greater use of  the  mass

media,  especially  radio and television,  will  be

directed  towards continuing education,  especially

of  the  worker. There are many subjects  that  can

lend  themselves  to  interesting  and  educational

presentation through radio and television, if  only

more  programme organisers could have more time  to

use  more imagination. It would be a good  idea  to

have   additional   personnel  trained   in   adult

education to organise such programmes for  workers'

education.  Subjects like labour economics,  labour

law,  trade  union organisation, the new developing

role  of the trade unionist, relations between  the

worker, employer and government as well as cultural

features for the worker, may be presented. We  have

media  experts  and  adult  education  experts   in

Singapore.  Somehow  these  expertises   have   not

harmonised in a single individual. Perhaps we could

train  an adult educator in media techniques  or  a

media man in adult education principles so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



that we may have greater success in the use of  the

media for adult education. But the media alone  has

not  an  adequate educative capability. Experiments

have shown that the mixed media approach would have

the  optimum educational results. This implies that

there  must  not only be listening or  viewing  but

also discussion in an inter-personal situation  and

even the use of correspondence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the People's Association

community centres could be used as venues  for  the

organisation of listening or viewing and discussion

groups.  This  would be one way  of  adding  a  new

dimension to the function of community centres.  In

any  case, the activities in community centres have

to  be  diversified so as to attract  participation

from a broader spectrum of the population. Inasmuch

as a multi-disciplinary approach has been necessary

in academic progress for the successful progress of

the   People's   Association,  perhaps   a   multi-ministerial  approach  may be  necessary.  The  co-ordination

is  required  of  People's  Association

activities  with  resources from  other  Ministries

like   Defence,  Education.  Social  Affairs,  even

Finance (perhaps especially Finance).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Ministry has, throughout the years

of  PAP  Government, striven successfully to relate

its  objectives more and more harmoniously with the

objectives  of  the rest of the Government  sector.

Our  educational objectives therefore  comply  with

overall national objectives. And now there  is  the

emphasis  on  quality of teachers, of  methods,  of

curriculum. The quality of the teacher  depends  on

his   personal  ethic.  But  the  standard  of  his

professional ability depends on the quality of  his

methods.  I  think  the  main  manageable  emphasis

should be on the quality of educational methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thorough grounding in good methodology should

reinforce  the  teacher's  understanding   of   the

environment in which he teaches as well as the aims

of  the  educational sector. Teachers in  Singapore

should   find  in  their  environment  a   stirring

challenge.  I think it was Plutarch who  said  that

the City is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



the  best teacher. Within the size of our  city  we

can keep the relationship of one citizen to another

within  human  proportions. Our  administration  is

able  to reach out to the grass-roots of our city's

population. Our social structures give a tremendous

educational  potential  to the  city.  The  teacher

should see his role against this potential.  He  is

teaching   children  to  develop  and   take   full

advantage  of  this potential.  He  is  not  merely

teaching  subjects.  He is teaching  a  continually

learning  person,  who will hopefully  continue  to

learn  long  after the classroom and childhood  has

been left behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, as children are learning in

school,  adults  too are exposed to  a  variety  of

educational challenges in our learning society. The

very housing projects, the satellite towns that the

Government puts up, forces learning oil our people.

They have to adjust to the pace of urbanisation. We

could  make our city the Athens of Southeast  Asia.

En  Athens, education was not something perpetrated

in  the schools. There was no fixed time, no  rigid

curricula. Education was not confined to a  certain

period  of  childhood  in  a  person's  life.   The

Athenian  was educated by his environment,  by  his

culture,  by his way of life. Of course,  all  this

was  possible because of the existence of  slavery.

But  we  have machines. Let these machines  be  our

slaves,  not  the other way about, as has  happened

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I plead for is that education in various

institutions  and in all periods  of  the  person's

development be an integrated life-time process. The

education  of  the  child  and  the  adolescent  in

schools,  industrial  training  procedures,   adult

education, or other educational institutions, these

are  not separable experiences but facets belonging

to the whole of one's educational life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This integration has been faintly recognised in

the Addendum on the Education Ministry, in which it

is  stated  that  "adult  education  will  he  more

closely  linked with the school system on  the  one

hand,  and with industrial training on the  other".

But adult education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



is  not  a continuation of school education  merely

for   as  long  as  our  workers  wish  to  improve

themselves,  as  stated  in  the  Addendum.   Every

opportunity  should  be taken  to  demonstrate  the

importance of continuing education to the worker in

a changing environment. And provisions should be in

a  variety  of forms through a variety of agencies,

so that our workers, whatever their age or whatever

their   preoccupations,  whatever  the   style   of

education  to  which they have been accustomed,  or

whatever  style they may want, will find  something

about   which  they  may  want  to  continue  their

education and, in this way, find their city  giving

them  not  only a material sustenance  but  also  a

quality of cultural and spiritual living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the motion.



<br><br>6.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to join my colleagues in this House in

supporting the motion moved by the Member for Bukit

Batok   to  thank  the  President  for  his  speech

delivered  on  behalf  of  the  Government  at  the

opening Session of this Parliament on 12th October,

1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech, together with the addenda

from the various Ministries, clearly spells out the

policies of the Government and what it would do for

the people of Singapore during the next five years,

so  as  to  achieve higher standards in everything,

with the emphasis on quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last general elections held on 2nd

September, 1972, 760,472 voters, or 93.55 per cent,

in  the  57  contested  constituencies  cast  their

votes,  of  which more than 525,000, or  69.02  per

cent,  voted  for  the People's Action  Party.  All

opposition   party   candidates,   including    two

independent candidates, were defeated. All  65  PAP

candidates were elected to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PAP's victory in the last general

elections means the victory of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



the  people of Singapore. The result of the general

elections clearly shows that the opposition parties

are not wanted by the voters and they only want the

PAP.  The voters of Singapore, young and old,  male

and  female, are very intelligent in casting  their

votes  wisely  and opposition parties  cannot  fool

them   with  empty  promises  or  obsolete  slogan-shouting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I observe that leaders of opposition parties

still  do not realise that if they want to  win  in

any general elections, they must have the following

good qualities: -`



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) They must have intelligent, honest, capable

and  incorrupt  leaders who are  respected  by  the

voters of Singapore and who are especially of  good

character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) They must prove to the people of Singapore

that  they are dedicated and loyal to the  Republic

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) They must convince the electorate that their

leaders  have the ability and capacity to  do  what

the  PAP  leadership has obtained, i.e, peace  and

prosperity for the people of Singapore.



Unless  the  opposition  parties  have  these  good

qualities  which  I  have  just  mentioned,  I  can

predict  they  will be totally defeated  again  and

that all the PAP candidates will win again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Wages Council had recommended

for  the workers a wage increase of 8 per cent  for

this  year with effect from 1st July, 1972,  4  per

cent  of  which  will go to the  Central  Provident

Fund. I regret to say that the net balance of 4 per

cent is hardly enough to meet the present high cost

of  living  and the gradual increase of  prices  of

things  from  5  per  cent  to  15  per  cent.  The

Consumers  Association  of  Singapore  (CASE)   can

testify to the truth of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministerial statements given by the Minister

for  Finance, the Minister for the Environment  and

the  Minister  for Health during  this  Session  of

Parliament  will  increase  the  charges   on   the

following items:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) New rates of duties and taxes on liquors,

cigarettes and tobacco, petrol,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



cars, additional registration fees and road tax  on

private cars;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) New electrical tariffs from December 1972;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) New accouchement fees from August 1973.



<br><br>Sir,  the abovementioned increases in the new rates

of  duties  and taxes, the new electrical  tariffs,

and accouchement fees mean that more money have  to

be  spent by the workers. The net balance of 4  per

cent  wage  increase given to the workers  will  be

taken   away  by  the  new  taxes,  new  electrical

tariffs, new accouchement fees, and the increase in

prices of commodities. With one hand, the employers

give  us the wage increase of 8 per cent but 4  per

cent  go  to  CPF,  and with the  other  hand,  the

employers   take  the  8  per  cent  back   through

increases  in the prices of commodities. Government

has  to  increase the taxes so that the  additional

revenues  will  be used to pay the wages  of  civil

servants,  to build HDB flats, schools,  hospitals,

roads,   bridges,  etc.  But  when  the  Government

increases  the taxes, the employers increase  their

prices  of  products. In the end, the workers  will

suffer.  The  Government requested the  workers  to

exercise wage restraint and to make sacrifices  for

the  national survival, which they have  fully  co-operated. But unfortunately it is not possible  for

the Government to impose price control on anything.

Again,  the  workers have to suffer. Where  is  the

justice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that next year when the National Wages

Council   makes   any  recommendations   for   wage

increases,  it would take note of the increases  of

Government  taxes,  the  increases  in  prices   of

commodities and the high cost of living. Otherwise,

whatever wage increase is given to the workers will

be  taken  back  by the employers  through  general

price increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was reported by a local paper recently

that  there  is  exploitation  of  the  workers  by

unscrupulous employers. These bad employers pay low

wages to the temporary and daily-rated workers  and

demand  high productivity. They also dismiss  these

workers' without good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



reason  and  replace them as often as  possible  so

that  they  can keep on paying low wages  and  free

from  paying  CPF contributions. I  would  strongly

urge  the  Minister for Labour to investigate  this

matter. I appeal to workers who have not joined any

trade  union  to  do  so immediately.  The  Pioneer

Industries    Employees   Union,   the    Singapore

Industrial  Labour Organisation and  the  Singapore

Manual  and Mercantile Workers' Union will  be  too

pleased to recruit them and to get for them  better

wages and conditions of service and job security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate the necessity of getting

additional  workers  to  meet  the  present  labour

shortage.  It  was also suggested to  get  as  many

women  workers  as possible to meet this  shortage,

especially  the housewives, by doing  part-time  or

piece-rate  work.  It is perfectly  all  right  for

housewives  to do part-time or piece-rate  work  if

they  have  the  spare time,  or  else  they  would

neglect their home duties and their children  would

not  get  the usual attention or love from them.  I

think  it is not wise for housewives to earn $2  or

$3  a day to do part-time or piece-rate work and to

neglect   their  home  duties  or  their  children.

Children who do not get the attention and love from

their  parents  and are neglected  will  eventually

become school dropouts or juvenile delinquents  and

a   danger   to   society.  I  would  prefer   more

mechanisation  of work, a little  more  liberal  in

granting  work  permits  and  better  pay  for  the

workers.  Also,  the  workers  must  accept  family

planning and the need to have a small family of two

or  three children only. With better wages for  the

workers,   more  mechanisation  of  work,   further

relaxation  in granting of work permits,  and  with

workers  practising family planning, we  can  spare

the  good housewives from doing part-time or piece-rate  work, so that their attention and love  given

to  their  children  will  bring  up  good,  loyal,

healthy  and  strong citizens of Singapore  in  the

spirit of gracious living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (Bukit Batok)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir I would like to thank Members of  this

House  for  supporting my motion. I  wish  also  to

thank them for their valuable suggestions, many  of

which   are   constructive  and   are   worthy   of

consideration by the various departments;  although

1  must  say  that I do not know what will  be  the

reactions of the departments concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in accordance with the usual tradition

of  the  Singapore Government, I believe  that  all

constructive suggestions will certainly receive due

consideration  by  the departments  concerned,  and

will be speedily processed and implemented. We  all

know  that  some  suggestions may not  seem  to  be

practicable,  and  therefore  there  is  need   for

further   study.  Besides,  it  is  easy  to   make

suggestions which may sound practical but they  may

not  be  implemented  without prior  study  of  the

consequences which may arise. Some suggestions seem

to  be  too  ambitious, while others  sound  rather

good.  However,  I  cannot  accept  or  reject  the

suggestions  on  behalf  of  the  Government.   The

various suggestions put up by Members involve every

Government  department  and ministry,  touching  on

medicine, politics, finance, agriculture, industry,

labour and other fields, As regards education, some

Members  have  criticised certain  aspects  of  the

administration    and    have    expressed    their

dissatisfaction.  However, I do  not  know  exactly

where the faults lie. I hope I will be able to find

out  where  the  fault is, if any,  in  future.  On

culture, to sum up the opinion of Members, it seems

that  we  all  agree  that we should  preserve  our

traditional  eastern culture and we should  prevent

our  youths  from  being infected by  any  decadent

trends  of  Western culture. We all hope  that  our

economy  can continue to progress and keep  abreast

with  the times. We all agree too that in Singapore

we do not hope to see any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



pillion-sitters,    instead    everybody     should

contribute  his share of work in order to  get  his

commensurable reward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about politics, we all agree that

Singapore is strategically situated in this part of

the  world, and is also an important metropolis  in

Southeast  Asia.  This  has created  envy  in  some

people  and  they  plan designs  against  us.  When

people come to us, it may not be just a visit or to

do  business  with us or because they  want  to  do

something  for our good; it is normally  for  their

own  selfish interests, or they may desire to  gain

some  control  over  us, if possible.  So  we  must

always be on the alert.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On medical services, several Members have made

good  suggestions relating to such topics as family

planning,  which  is interesting and  constructive,

and  environmental control, which is a  fairly  new

subject.  In  many constituencies, including  mine,

many  residents  have expressed  their  concern  or

dissatisfaction about environmental control. One of

the reasons is that, it being a fairly new subject,

many people are not very conversant with the degree

of  human  tolerance  against pollution  before  it

becomes   unbearable.  I  think  this  topic   will

stimulate  more  debate,  but  we  hope  that   the

Government  Department concerned will  first  carry

out a campaign to inform the people of the need for

anti-pollution     measures     before     actually

implementing them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards agriculture, many Members representing

the  rural constituencies have spoken on behalf  of

the  rural  folks, and they have commented  on  the

price  of  pigs.  They have also spoken  about  the

problems of our fishermen among other matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, it seems to me that two points have

not   been   touched   on  sufficiently.   One   is

patriotism, and the other is the implementation  of

our  Income Tax policy. In a city state,  you  will

find  that it is a basic trend of the people to  be

drawn  naturally  towards  material  enjoyment  and

individualism. This is in direct conflict with  the

sense  of  patriotism.  We must  therefore  promote

patriotism, especially among the younger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



generation so as to make each and every one of them

more  patriotic  and more loyal to the  country  so

that the future of Singapore will be assured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards income tax, this is the basic problem

in   every   democratic  country.   What   we   are

propounding   here  in  Singapore   is   democratic

socialism. This imposes on us the need to pay  more

attention  to the inequality between the  rich  and

the  poor  and  the problems arising therefrom.  We

have  progressed quite rapidly in  respect  of  our

economy.  The  equal distribution of wealth  should

receive  more attention by us, otherwise  the  rich

will become richer and the poor become poorer. This

will  not  be good for the future of Singapore.  We

know  that  under  our  present  income  tax  laws,

company  tax  is levied on a company's net  profits

only  up  to  40 per cent. Holders of shares,  when

declaring their personal incomes, are not  required

to pay further taxes because tax deduction on share

dividends can be regarded as a tax credit. Here are

the  faults because personal income tax is, at  its

highest  scale, more than the 40 per cent which  is

the  maximum  leviable on company's  profits.  Many

people   take   advantage  of  this   loophole   by

organising private limited companies, so  that  all

their  incomes can be declared within the  accounts

of  the  company  and their expenses  paid  by  the

company. No dividends are declared. If the personal

incomes  of  such people are very  high,  then  the

Government will incur a loss in revenue,  as  there

is  a  difference  of some 15 per cent  in  revenue

between  personal  income  tax  and  company   tax.

Perhaps  in future some tighter tax measures,  like

those  of Australia or elsewhere, may be introduced

in   Singapore,  because,  as  the  President   has

mentioned  in  his  speech,  our  present  taxation

policy  is in certain respects rather outdated.  So

they have to be rectified. This, of course, is only

my personal view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. I would like to thank Members for

lending  support  to my motion  of  thanks  to  the

President for his speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech

of the President be agreed to: -

Minister  for  Law and Home Affairs,  and  National

Development, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4  of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),

approves  the reclamation by Government of  those

portions of the foreshores and sea-bed off  Tuas,

Jurong,  containing a total area of approximately

135.9  acres as shown coloured pink on  the  plan

marked  "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN  NO.  4/72"

which   is   deposited  in   the   Land   Office,

Singapore.

<hr>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that in June this year, this

House  approved the reclamation of about 974  acres

of  the  foreshore and sea-bed at Tuas, Jurong,  by

the  Jurong Town Corporation to meet the increasing

demand  for  sea-front lands by marine and  marine-orientated industries. The Corporation now proposes

to  reclaim a further 135.9 acres of the  foreshore

and sea-bed in this area, as shown coloured pink on

the  plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN  NO.

4/72",  a copy of which is displayed in the Library

of this House for the information of Members. It is

proposed   to  allocate  the  reclaimed   site   to

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



ship-repairing   and   ship-building    industries.

Negotiations  are  now  taking  place  between  the

Economic Development Board, the Development Bank of

Singapore and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, for

the project to be undertaken as a joint venture  at

a total initial investment of about $88 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reclamation is expected to be

completed by May 1974 at an estimated cost  of  $12

million.  The  fill required for this  reclamation,

about  12  million cubic yards of  earth,  will  be

obtained by cutting down nearby hills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed

land  will be proclaimed as State land and will  be

alienated   to   the  Corporation  on   terms   and

conditions  to  be agreed with the Land  Office  to

enable  the  Corporation to issue subsequently  its

own sub-lease to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in July 1971 this House approved the

reclamation of about 91 acres of the foreshore  and

sea-bed at Pasir Panjang, as shown edged red on the

plan  marked  "LAND  OFFICE  RECLAMATION  PLAN  NO.

1/71", a copy of which was displayed in the Library

of  this House for the information of Members. This

reclamation,  undertaken by the Port  of  Singapore

Authority  as  agent  of  the  Government,  is   in

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to extend the reclamation by

filling  up  the area shown edged green  (about  20

acres  in  area)  on the plan marked  "LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 5/72", a copy of which is  now

displayed  in  the Library of this  House  for  the

information of Members. The proposed development by

the  Housing and Development Board at Telok Blangah

requires  urgent  earth works  to  be  carried  out

within the next three months, and the surplus earth

will  be used as fill for the proposed reclamation.

In  fact,  in order not to hold up earth  works  at

Telok  Blangah,  approval,  under  the  proviso  to

section 4 of the Foreshores Act, has been given  to

the  Port of Singapore Authority to reclaim, in the

first  instance, the five acres shown edged red  on

the plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reclamation, which will also be undertaken

by the Port of Singapore Authority on behalf of the

Government, is expected to cost approximately  $2.5

million. On completion of the reclamation, the land

will  be  utilised by the Urban Renewal  Department

for tourist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



projects  and for the resettlement of the  existing

auction centres in urban areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area to be reclaimed adjoins land on which

are  private  residences.  The  Authority  will  be

requested to take all the necessary precautions  to

ensure  that  the reclamation will not cause  undue

nuisance or inconvenience to the occupiers of these

properties.    However,   about   nine    temporary

structures  on  the foreshore, falling  within  the

area  to  be reclaimed, will have to be demolished.

These temporary structures are licensed by the Land

Office  and  are  occupied by  about  23  families.

Arrangements   will  be  made  to  resettle   these

families.
