<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

last  year I spoke on community centres and this year

I  have  to  bring this matter up again. I find  that

community centres run today are not making  good  use

of  the  money  we spend on them. I notice  that  the

Government  always cling to the policy of wanting  to

have advisory committees. They hand-pick their people

and  allow  the community centres to be run  by  such

people.   I  told  the  Government  last  year   that

community  centres  run in this  manner  would  never

produce  good results. I related to them  the  events

right  from  the beginning, probably in  1953,  after

they  appointed advisory committees which have  shown

until  today very little result. However,  Government

considered  that  it  was  still  essential  to  have

community centres run by advisory committees. Another

year  has  elapsed and more advisory committees  have

been  appointed but the net result produced is  still

negligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put it to the Government, Sir, that when it comes

to  community centres, the people feel that they  are

Government  institutions and they feel  reluctant  to

make  use of such centres so that today apart from  a

few  little boys making use of them and a little  bit

of  activity like adult education, community  centres

are  really not being used as they should be used.  I

put it to the Government last year that it should  be

best  that  people  should be  elected  to  run  such

centres. We have elections at the Assembly level  for

the  running of the country. We have elections at the

City  Council  level; we will also have elections  at

the Rural District Council level: yet, with democracy

practised  at such levels, we deny the  people  of  a

small  village  or  a small community  the  right  to

choose  their own natural leaders to run their little

local affairs. This is most unsatisfactory. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3305</b></font><br><br>



Government  want  community  centres  to   be   fully

utilised, the natural leaders of the people should be

chosen to run them so that the people would feel that

these  centres  belong to them and  I  am  sure  that

community centres would then be properly used. I have

put  forward schemes as to how this could be achieved

but  so far I have not had the satisfaction of either

seeing the schemes I suggested being implemented or a

more  workable  scheme  being  put  forward  by   the

Government.  I  urge the Government to consider  this

matter  more fully so that money expended under  this

head should not be wasted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  glad  that  the  Government is  speeding  up  the

Malayanisation  scheme and that  the  Social  Welfare

Department  is  fully  malayanised  having  a   local

officer  as  Acting Director of Social Welfare.  Sir,

this  officer  who  is holding this  appointment  has

quite  a  considerable  knowledge  of  economics.   I

understand  that  he went to the  United  Kingdom  to

study  this subject but what is most essential,  Sir,

in this department is that we should have a local man

with  practical experience rather than a man  with  a

knowledge  of economics because social work  is  such

that  you  come in close contact with the people  and

you  should have a complete knowledge of social  work

through  contact with all communities  in  Singapore.

The  present holder of this appointment, I  may  say,

Sir,  is more suited in the Chief Minister's Economic

Adviser's  Department. We want, in fact, a local  man

to  go into this department as an understudy to  take

over  eventually  the  post of the  Economic  Adviser

instead  of an expatriate officer in that department.

Shame!  If  we  can  malayanise  the  Social  Welfare

Department,  why can we not malayanise  the  Economic

Adviser's  Department as well? Surely,  local  people

can take over such appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, this officer went to the United

Kingdom  for  seven years training in  economics.  He

came  back  two  years ago and was attached  to  this

department but what has been the nature of  his  work

in  this  Department? I understand he was  placed  on

research work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3306</b></font><br><br>



rather  than on the actual function of the department

which is social welfare. Now, Sir, within a period of

two years in that department doing research work,  it

would  be  rather  difficult  for  him  to  know  the

practical side of social welfare - the requirements and

the  needs  of the public in connection  with  social

welfare.  Social welfare is a very, very  complicated

problem  and  it  takes time to learn  and  know  the

actual needs of the public. As I said it must be done

by  a  man  with practical experience. So  Government

should appoint officers in departments to suit  their

actual qualifications and the present holder, who  is

an  economist,  should go to the  Economic  Adviser's

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if there is an officer in the Social Welfare

Department who has got practical experience. I  think

he  should be appointed to take over that department.

It  is  better to appoint one officer who  knows  the

work rather than to appoint a man who has got all the

theory but has not got the practical knowledge in the

department  and  then  in the end  find  that  it  is

difficult to run it. I do hope that the Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare will look into this and see  that

the Economic Adviser's Department will be malayanised

very soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, as a person who is closely

associated  with  community centres in  Singapore,  I

would  like  to  contribute  my  experience  to  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore community development has entered

its  first  stage. During this initial stage,  it  is

very  necessary  that  the  management  of  community

centres   should   be  in  the  hands   of   advisory

committees.  Up to now, the advisory committees  have

been   responsible  for  stimulating  the   necessary

interest of the community to participate actively  in

their  affairs. Sir, this first stage of  development

has  been  very successful, in that it has encouraged

those interested in community work to come forward to

work hard unselfishly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am told by the Social Welfare Department that

the  next  stage  in  the  development  of  community

centres is in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3307</b></font><br><br>



the  offing. In the rural areas, of course, as we are

all  aware,  it  will be the District Councils  which

will  be  responsible for the management of community

centres and these District Councils are shortly to be

composed  of  an  elected majority. I  can  see  that

community development in the rural areas will be much

more  vigorous  and enthusiastic once these  District

Councils  come into being and we will  then  see  the

elected  representatives of the people playing  their

part  in the shaping and in the development of  their

respective communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that there is ample room for the

development of community centres in Singapore.  I  do

not for a moment think that we have achieved all what

we  should have achieved in the past two years and  I

think  one  of the ways in which we can  be  actively

helpful in the matter of community development is  to

see  that  politics do not become part  of  community

development.  Sir, there can be great  harm  done  to

community  development once politics become  part  of

their  activities.  Community centres  are  primarily

designed   to   help  the  community   as   a   whole

irrespective   of  whether  they   are   members   of

particular  political parties and that is one  aspect

of   the  essence  of  community  development,   that

politics  should not be the order of the  day.  I  do

hope,  Sir, that the people who participate  actively

in  community  centres will not engage themselves  in

party politics.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other aspect I would like to deal with is the

second  stage  of  community  development.  Community

development  cannot be a success if one is  to  think

that it is either a Government responsibility or that

it  is  the  entire  responsibility  of  the  people.

Community development must be developed on the  basis

of the utmost co-operation between Government and the

people and then only community development will  come

to stay in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I believe that with the coming of the District

Councils  and  the  new City Council,  the  community

centres will take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3308</b></font><br><br>



a  new form, have new ideas and a new stimulus and if

we  all  actively  participate with  the  active  co-operation   of   the  Government,  we  will   develop

community life on the right and proper lines.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Serangoon

(Mr Lim Choon Mong) himself said that he brought  up

this  subject of community centres last year and this

year,  he  is  just repeating what he has  said  last

year.  Last year, Sir, I replied to the points raised

by  him and I think I should not repeat what was said

in  order  not  to take up the time of this  Assembly

unnecessarily but I would refer him to  what  I  said

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the points raised by the Member for

Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) the officer who is now

holding the post of Director of Social Welfare is  an

officer  who  has  been  in  that  department,  if  I

remember  rightly,  from the  very  start  when  that

department was formed after the liberation. He has  a

very   close  knowledge  of  the  working   of   that

department.  It is true that he is very  suitable  in

the  economic field - the only man in the  whole  civil

service  who can take over from the present  Economic

Adviser. But the hon. Member must not forget that  in

regard  to an appointment, this is left to the Public

Service  Commission.  The Government  does  not  post

officers  into  any particular posts. The  Government

has  plans  for organising an economic research  unit

under  Dr Goh who will, we hope in due course,  take

over from the present Economic Adviser.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after all that

was   said  last  year,  I  must  still  express   my

dissatisfaction   that   work  concerning   community

centres  is still at a standstill. It has been  at  a

standstill for the last two or three years and  I  do

not think that what the Government replied to what  I

asked  last  year would be sufficient. I have  always

told  the  Government that what we want  to  see  are

results and not just words or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3309</b></font><br><br>



replies.   I  find  that  instead  of  the  Assistant

Minister  for Labour and Welfare replying to  what  I

said,   another  Assistant  Minister,  the  Assistant

Minister to the Chief Secretary, replying to  affairs

concerning welfare.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I quite frankly admit that I was not

replying  and  that  it was not my responsibility  to

reply  to an item under this particular head. I  said

at  the  very beginning of my speech that I was  only

contributing  to  this Assembly my  experience  as  a

person  who  is  closely  associated  with  community

centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Assistant   Minister  thinks  that  he   is   closely

associated with community centres, then I think he is

not  fully  versed  with  the  affairs  of  community

centres. He said that party politics should not  come

into  community  centres. So far as I  know,  I  have

never  found  it  to  be so. He said  that  community

centres  should be guided at first but  I  find  that

those   centres  which  are  free  from  governmental

control  and  set  up by the local people  themselves

progress to a far greater extent than those guided by

advisory  committees of the Government. Now,  Sir,  I

believe that if Government is not going to put  up  a

scheme  whereby  greater use  is  made  of  community

centres,  then  Government will again  fail  in  this

aspect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go on, Sir, to further aspects of social

welfare work. We know that today in Singapore we have

a  large  number of young people who because  of  the

inadequate educational facilities are on the streets.

They  are  too young to be employed and not  educated

enough.  I believe that the Social Welfare Department

can  come  in  to help these people to a  very  great

extent.  I must state that they have been helping  in

this   direction  but  I  would  like  to  see   more

intensified  assistance being given  to  these  young

people. If the Social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3310</b></font><br><br>



Welfare Department is not going to take a very active

part  in shaping the lives of these people and making

them  into very useful citizens, then I believe  that

the  work  will then pass on to other departments  of

the  Government, say, the Police Department and later

on  the Prisons Department. If we do not spend  money

for  education and for social welfare, then  we  will

have to spend more money on a bigger police force and

build more prisons to house criminals. Assistance has

been  given in this direction but I maintain that  it

is  insufficient. Greater help must come.  The  young

people  must  be  looked  after.  They  will  be  the

citizens  of  tomorrow  and  Government  should  give

greater  assistance to such people. Even today,  Sir,

on  this  question  of  the problem  with  the  young

people,  there  is one great need and that  is  boys'

hostels.   Here   again,  I   find   that   voluntary

organisations are helping to a far greater extent.  I

refer  to  the Boys Town. They have done  a  splendid

job.  They have places for these young people  but  I

think there are so many other people who want to  get

in but are unable to do so and Government should give

further  assistance  in this direction.  If  it  were

possible,  it  would  even be  better  if  Government

should undertake to run such an organisation as  Boys

Town.  I  hope  that Government will take  this  into

consideration  and  see  that  the  young  people  of

Singapore are given greater attention than  they  are

being given now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the points

raised  by  the  Member for Serangoon regarding  more

active help to be given to teenagers and linking this

with Boys Town and hostels, may I say this, Sir.  The

Government  is  doing every, thing that  is  possible

within  the limited means at its disposal. In  social

work of this kind, it is vital that the public should

work  hand in hand with the Government and  if  there

are  organisations as pointed out by the hon.  Member

which are keen to play their part to assist the youth

of  Singapore,  I  can on behalf  of  the  Government

assure  such  organisations that whatever  assistance

they   may  require  from  the  Government  in   this

co-operative work, will always be given

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 52 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 13 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 13 refers to "Public Assistance" and

comparing  the figures to be provided for  next  year

with  that  for  this year, I see that  there  is  an

increase  of  $380,000. This is  a  very  substantial

increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I must make it clear

that  I  am  not trying to decrease or to reduce  the

vote. I only move this amendment to initiate a debate

because  public  assistance  is  very  essential   in

Singapore but what I cannot understand is this,  Sir.

Why  should there be such a substantial increase?  Is

the Government expecting more unemployment next year?

And  if not, why should there be an increase then?  I

paid  a compliment to the Government yesterday,  Sir,

pointing out there was less unemployment this year as

compared  with  last year. So if  we  can  have  less

unemployment  this year, we can definitely  have  far

less  unemployment next year. We always look  forward

to  progress  and  we must move in the  forward  gear

rather  than  in  the  reverse  gear.  Sir,  if   the

Government is not anticipating more unemployment next

year,  then  this  increase is not  warranted.  There

should  not  be any increase. If Government  provides

more  employment for the people, I am quite sure that

the  vote for "Public Assistance" will not be such  a

big amount as $6½ million for next year. The question

is  this:  Government  must have  stability  in  this

country  and  if Government does not have  stability,

then  there will be more unemployment. It  is  not  a

question of providing more and more money for  public

assistance.  It is a question of providing  more  and

more  employment  which would reduce  the  number  of

applicants coming for public assistance. I  am  quite

sure  that  no  one  would like to apply  for  public

assistance if he is employed and if he can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3312</b></font><br><br>



earn  a decent living. I am quite sure that a man  is

forced   to   submit  his  application   for   public

assistance  through poverty and unemployment.  So  if

Government provides more employment, then there would

be  less people applying for public assistance. So it

is  up  to  Government  not to  increase  the  amount

required  for  public assistance but to provide  more

employment  so that less people will be dependent  on

the charity of the public and the Government.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the increase asked for this

particular   vote  is  not  because  of  Government's

anticipation of increased unemployment  in  the  next

year. The rates are still the same. There is to be no

change in the rates next year. The relief granted  is

not only to the unemployed. It is also granted to the

sick  and to the aged and, from experience gained  in

the department, we know that more and more people are

coming forward for this relief because they feel that

they  are  qualified to do so. When we first started,

it was with a small amount. It was not, shall we say,

so  popular. It is now becoming very popular  to  the

poor,  popular in the sense that they now  know  that

there  is a Government which is anxious to look after

their  welfare, and the fact that they know now  that

there  is  somebody to look after their welfare,  the

more anxious are they to make application for relief.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under this

head, I find that the name given to the Ministry does

not  cover  transport but I take  it  that  the  word

"Communications" covers transport as well and that it

is  one of the functions of the Ministry to look into

the transport problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries, as far as I understand, transport

is a state responsibility and not run on a commercial

enterprise basis but in Singapore I find that  it  is

run  by  an expatriate firm under a monopoly. Rightly

or wrongly, most of the shareholders of that firm are

expatriates  or British rather than Asians  and  this

monopoly  is  given to this firm in the name  of  the

Singapore  Traction Company. There are  also  Chinese

bus  companies running this passenger bus service  in

Singapore  but the competition between these  Chinese

bus  companies and the Singapore Traction Company  is

out of comparison. There is a move I under, stand  to

amalgamate all the Chinese bus companies into  a  big

company to compete with this Singapore Traction Company.  Whether it will materialise or not is left  to

be seen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the consideration of bus

routes is left in the hands of the Transport Advisory

Board - that may be the correct name of the Board. I do

appreciate that all the members sitting on this Board

are   experts  on  transport  but  they   are   fully

conversant with the theoretical side of the transport

problem and not with the practical side. The question

of  bus routes, I think, should be considered more in

the  light  of  the  needs and  requirements  of  the

public. Sir, the number of vehicles on the roads  are

increasing day by day. With the new serial  lettering

"SS"  that is coming up, I am quite sure that we will

have more vehicles by the end of the year. Car owners

are finding it difficult to park their cars with this

increase  in  the number of vehicles  on  the  roads.

Practically every road in the city is restricted  for

parking purposes. You either find a "white line" or a

"No  Parking" sign on roads within the city area.  It

is rather fortunate that Members of this Assembly are

privileged  to  have a special car parking  space  in

front  of  this  Assembly  House.  If  not  for  this

privilege, I am sure that Members will also  find  it

difficult  to  find a place to park their  cars  when

attending sittings of this Assembly. It is my opinion

that  it is more convenient to come down to the  city

in  taxis  than in our own cars. Now, to  solve  this

traffic problem, I think Government should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3314</b></font><br><br>



consider  introducing  a  light  railway  scheme.   I

believe,  some years back, the Assistant Minister  to

the  Chief Secretary who was then in the City Council

suggested  such a scheme. He is now in  power  and  I

think  he should push this scheme through. This light

railway  scheme,  Sir, could bring workers  from  the

rural areas into the city, and if most of the workers

or those who come down to the city for business would

travel  on  small trains, I am quite sure  that  this

would lessen the number of vehicles on the roads.  In

most countries, there are such light trains which  go

into  the  rural areas to convey the people  down  to

work. Sir, I hope that Government will look into this

and give consideration to the introduction of such  a

scheme  whereby  people can travel to  and  from  the

city. This will lessen congestion on the roads  as  I

said  and, at the same time, petrol consumption  will

be  less.  With  the increase of 20 cents  tax  on  a

gallon  of petrol, I am sure that the public will  be

quite happy to travel in light trains rather than  in

their  own  cars. They can leave their cars  at  home

until  the  evening when they can then go  for  their

pleasure  rides. I sincerely hope that the  Assistant

Minister to the Chief Secretary who had this in  mind

some   years  back  will  press  the  Government   to

introduce such a scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I ask the Minister for Communications  and

Works  whether he is aware that some of the buses  in

the  rural districts are not running uniformly.  Some

of  them run from morning to 12 o'clock midnight  and

some  of them run to 10 p.m. I do not understand  why

this  should  be so especially for the rural  people,

Sir,  who,  late  in  the night, find  difficulty  in

getting  down to town, especially on emergency  cases

such as confinement or accident. If the buses run  up

to  12 o'clock midnight, I think that will give  more

help to the rural people. So I hope that the Minister

for  Communications  and  Works  will  consider  this

matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

just  like to add to what the last two speakers  have

said,  that the problem of public transport  is  very

little nearer solution than it was 2½ years ago  when

the  Labour  Front stated that their  policy  was  to

nationalise  transport. There is only  a  short  time

left  under this head. So I do hope that the Minister

will give us a resume of what is the intention of the

Government in the last few months of its life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> With regard to transport, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have already made a statement in  the

course  of  this Budget debate. I presume  that  some

Members were out of the room at that time. They  will

get  a copy in due course of what I said and they can

see  what my remarks were: they can also get it  from

their  friends. So I do not think that I need say  it

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua) that  buses  are

running  irregularly, I am aware of that problem.  It

is  a  complex problem which is derived  partly  from

managerial  inefficiency  perhaps  and  partly   from

stresses  and strains between employer and  employee.

When  some  workers  dislike the management  they  do

sometimes  get the buses driven wrongly.  In  effect,

they do not exactly go slow, but go in a muddled way;

you  get  five buses close together on the roads  and

they pass the bus stops at the same time and then for

half an hour after that there is no further bus. That

kind of thing does occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, generally speaking, it is a problem derived

from the long and muddled history of public transport

with  which I have had to grapple because it had been

badly  done in the past. It is a complicated job.  We

could,  no doubt, have made a Ceylon approach to  the

problem  and  gone  with great  rapidity  and  passed

laws - not  provided money - and set up a Board.  Whether

or   not  that  would,  in  fact,  have  brought  any

improvement  remains to be seen. My own  judgment  is

that  it  is much better to accept delay and to  make

sure that you are going forward over sound



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3316</b></font><br><br>



foundations than to say, "This is a bad situation and

I  assume  that any action will make it better."  You

have  got to get the right kind of action or you  may

merely  make it worse. But we are in fact considering

now  whether  it  is possible to do anything  interim

about  the  bus services, particularly the rural  bus

services and the Chairman of the Rural Board has been

pressing on this matter for some time. I hope that as

soon  as  this Budget is out of the way, my Permanent

Secretary  can attend to other work and  he  will  be

able to get on with this one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for the Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon

Eng).  As usual, he took a good deal of our  time  to

say nothing of any importance at all. He knows a good

deal about bus companies because he was or is still a

City Councillor -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Until tonight.

but  if he know about the workings of this House,  he

would know that in this House, we have already passed

an  Omnibus  Services  Licensing  Authority;  not   a

Traffic  Advisory  Board, but an authority  with  the

duties  and powers properly laid down and constituted

by  this House. It was typical of the approach  which

he  makes to this House that he should not even  know

what  he  is talking about and talk about  a  Traffic

Advisory Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light railway scheme is, of course, a very old

chestnut. I have got lengthy reports which have  been

brought  up  to  date since I was a  Minister  in  my

office  and, of course, it would be worth considering

but  the  capital cost would be enormous. Even  using

relatively vacant land, the mere fact that  you  have

got either to lift the thing up in the air or run  it

down  in  the  ground - foundations and  that  kind  of

thing - makes  it a very difficult thing to  carry  out

and highly speculative, particularly if the main work

of  development  is not on the present  line  of  the

railway.  If  you  are going to run  a  railway  from

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the function of this department is to

study   the   atmospheric  movements,  with   special

emphasis on weather forecasts. From my experience,  I

emphasise  again  that the forecasts  given  by  this

department  sometimes  go wrong.  Before  big  social

functions,  I understand that some hosts  do  contact

the   department  to  ascertain  the  actual  weather

forecasts for the day but as I have said, some of the

forecasts  given  by  the  department  go  wrong.   A

forecast is given as "fine" for the evening and  when

the  host  is entertaining his guests in the evening,

there  is a big downpour or a big shower. So I  think

that   there   must  be  something  wrong   in   that

department. I am afraid I do not know where the fault

in   the  department  lies  as  I  am  not  in   that

department. I can only speak of what I actually know,

that  the forecasts have sometimes gone wrong. So  if

there  is  something  that has  gone  wrong  in  that

department, I hope the Minister will look into it and

find out where the fault is or what is wrong and  let

us know whether he can remedy the faults or right the

wrongs of that department

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Of course, the difficulty for the

Meteorological Department, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  that

Singapore  is  surrounded by water and by  relatively

undeveloped   areas   and   countries   from    which

meteorological  reports are not  directly  available.

Even  in  Great Britain, which is a highly  developed

area,  you still get mistakes over what is  going  to

happen  to the weather; whether it is going  to  rain

tomorrow;  or  whether you are going  to  have  light

showers or heavy showers. Because what, in fact,  the

meteorological people can do is to check  up  on  the

clouds and the speed they are approaching, the height

they are at and the type of cloud and all the factors

involved  and say, "It looks as though the result  of

this  and this and this added together means a shower

of  rain  in Katong." But the shower of rain  may,  of

course, by some factor they have not completely  been

able to evaluate, fall on the sea instead or fall  on

Queenstown  perhaps. However, I do  not  think  that

there  is anything wrong with the department. I think

it  is a very good department. Its main function,  of

course, is not to provide information for V.I.P. tea

parties  but  to advise the ships and aircraft  which

are  in our meteorological area and to give them  the

best  warning  it  can  as to what  sort  of  weather

conditions  they are likely to meet  with.  It  is  a

safety-of-life  service. It may give a  safety-of-tea

party service on the side as far as it can, but  that

is not its proper function. We are hoping to have the

storm  warning radar in use (it is now being erected)

and  this  will  give  a further degree  of  reliable

information  but I do not think at any  time  in  the

foreseeable future will Singapore be able to say with

absolute  reliability precisely where and  when  rain

will fall.

there is half a page of vacant quarters, some of them

running  quite  far  back,  others  coming  up   very

recently.  As  far as I am concerned, it  is  just  a

matter  of seeing that they are secure and are looked

after  as much as possible during the confused period

during which they are standing idle for one reason or

another.  I cannot give any more details  as  to  why

they stand idle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 58 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (3) of subhead 2 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item, Sir, relates to Maintenance and Current

Repairs,  General, each year. Last year,  the  amount

approved  was $2,300,000. This year, we are asked  to

increase  this  item  by  $300,000.  I  see  in   the

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member has not given

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 58 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 4 therein."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the next amendment we are dealing with, and I

think  the  hon. Member pinpointed item (3)  of  that

subhead, if I am not mistaken?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes. I will come to that under

the  general head, Sir. I will proceed with item  (1)

of subhead 4. That concerns the provision of $100,000

for Maintenance of Runway, Taxi Tracks, Aprons, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an entirely new item. I am not

conversant with the requirements of runways  and  the

maintenance  of taxi tracks at the Airport.  I  would

like  to  know  why such a vast sum  of  $100,000  is

required  for next year when it was not  required  in

1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I get this a little clearer? Is

the hon. Member moving in respect only of item (1) of

subhead 4?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question then is,

items  were dealt with under what is now item (3)  of

subhead  4 - Upkeep  of Government Roads  and  Approach

Roads  to Government Buildings and Quarters - and  that

is  why the vote for item (3) of subhead 4 is reduced

this  year, although I think it has gone up in  other

respects but down as regards this. There is this  new

item  (I)  where  we  show the  Airport  costs  as  a

separate  item because they are now of a  significant

size  and deserve to be separately recorded. I  think

the  costs have probably gone up as the work has been

expanded  and, of course, they have now been  in  use

for 18 months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the

explanation and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 58 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (8) of subhead 6 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a question of minor works, Sir. The footnote

to this item says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increase required to meet essential requests for

items not provided for under Head: Public Works, Non-Recurrent (General) - Development Estimates."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like more information as to what are items of

general  works, non-recurrent, for which  this  extra

$150,000 is required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This represents a tussle between the

Treasury,  who  are  anxious to  economise,  and  the

Public  Works Department, who are anxious to maintain

and to provide what other people ask for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955 the total provision was $485,000 for minor

works - $60,000 for unforeseen minor works, $50,000 for

Customs  and Excise, $75,000 for Education,  $100,000

for  foreseen minor works, $100,000 for Medical,  and

$100,000  for  Police. You can see  that  the  fairly

heavily   spending  departments  have  fairly   large

allocations,  and obviously there is some  temptation

for heads of departments to say, "Now, I have a large

sum of money for minor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3322</b></font><br><br>



works.  I  will have a lot of attractive little  jobs

done." But in the interests of economy, the vote  was

pretty vigorously cut. I think for 1956 and 1957  the

amount was very much less. It is only a proportion of

the  requests that come in for odd jobs of all  sorts

that  are  approved. A lot of requests  are  rejected

straightaway as soon as they are put up. Others go as

far  as  the  requisition stage and  there  they  get

turned  down.  In 1957 a total of 570  requests  were

examined,  total cost being $245,738. 494  jobs  were

carried out at a total cost of $149,988.75 cents.  76

requests  were disapproved or postponed, their  total

estimated  cost  being  $95,749.25  cents.  I   think

perhaps the increased allocation in this case  brings

it a bit nearer to reality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I hope this struggle will result

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $7,725,680 for Head 58 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I just want to touch on the

question  of  the  increase  in  the  Estimates   for

maintenance  and repair of government  buildings  for

which  another  $300,000 is asked.  While  I  do  not

object to the increase, because undoubtedly there are

more  government houses being completed,  I  do  urge

that extreme care should be taken to see that we  are

getting  value  for the money spent on  the  repairs.

Sir,  I  understand this job is undertaken by a  very

limited number of contractors and something should be

done  to  see that the number of contractors who  are

asked to do this job should be increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this: The other day I met the head

of  a firm who sells cement-based paints in Singapore

and  he  was in a fearful fit of temper. He  told  me

that he had been quarrelling with his agents who  had

not  been looking after his business, and I asked him

what  was  the  trouble.  He  said  he  had  received

complaints that cement-based paints were of  no  use.

They were being washed away in about six months. Then

he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3323</b></font><br><br>



had  scrapings taken down from a wall, had them  sent

for  analysis and found that they were three-quarters

local  lime and only one-quarter was his product.  It

was  a  really bad mixture which was causing all  the

trouble.  Sir, I hope such instances can  be  avoided

where government expenditure is concerned.

<br><br>SECOND SCHEDULE



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 1 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name

of Mr Lee Kuan Yew -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 1 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 2 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 2 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 1 deals with additions and alterations to

the Supreme Court. The note says that the Registrar's

Court and chambers are now required for a sixth Court

and  provision is asked for to build an extra chamber

and  Court  for  the  Registrar.  I  can  speak  with

considerable authority on this matter, Sir, because I

was  Acting Registrar in the Supreme Court  for  over

six  years - between 1932 and 1938 - and I did my job  so

well  that  when  after three years I  got  into  the

Colonial  Legal Service, I was appointed as Registrar

to  the Civil District Court, a post now held by  the

chief clerk! Anyway, Government found it so difficult

to  fit me in the District Court that they sent me to

Penang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3324</b></font><br><br>



and  Malacca!  Sir, I was for six  years  the  Acting

Registrar of the Supreme Court, and I do not  believe

I  ever  had  any  occasion to hold any  enquiries - probate,  divorce or accounts - in any Court and  I  do

not  think, Sir, a Registrar really requires a  Court

for  his work. His work is more chamber work  and  it

can  be  done in a large chamber. $200,000 is a  very

large sum of money. I can do a lot of things with it.

Take this beautiful Assembly Hall. The whole building

was  renovated at a cost of $600,000. Now I  want  to

know  whether or not you are putting a new  Court  on

top  of  the flat roof. Where is this $200,000  going

to?



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> It is a

two  new  Courts for Judges, to create a new  waiting

room  and  an extra Court for the Registrar,  and  an

office for the Deputy Registrar, and all these  rooms

will be air-conditioned with furniture provided.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 9 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 1 is my favourite, Sir. It relates to

Division I quarters. I notice with satisfaction  that

no  increase  has been asked for this item.  I  think

partly  one  of  the  reasons is  that  I  have  been

consistently  attacking these quarters for  the  last

two  years. Sir, this quarter is to replace  the  hut

now  used by the engineer at the Broadcasting Station

in  Jurong,  but it is a big step from  a  hut  to  a

Division I quarter. Why cannot we give him a Division

II  quarter  which  costs $18,000?  This  is  a  very

reasonable sum. I caused a bungalow to be  built  for

the chief clerk



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3325</b></font><br><br>



of  a  big rubber estate and it only cost $12,000 with

sanitation  complete. Sir, cannot  we  save  at  least

$20,000 on this item?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The item is item (1) of subhead

1 - Division I Quarters, Jurong, one - is that correct?

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am not perfectly clear if I have got

the  hon. Member right, but I think he now accepts the

cost of the quarters as all right, but he thinks there

should be a lower grade of quarter. In regard to  what

quarter  that officer should have, that  is  a  matter

which  does  not concern the builders but it  concerns

those  who control the civil service. It comes  within

the  terms of employment of the civil service and  the

availability of certain types of quarters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I just want to find out if

Government can reduce it to a lower cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Sir,

the  Resident  Engineer  at Jurong  is  a  Division  I

officer  and  we are providing him with  quarters  for

which Division I officers are eligible. In fact, it is

only a Class V quarter which we are providing for this

officer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Did I hear the Chief Secretary

say  that  the  Government are  providing  a  Class  V

quarter for a Division I officer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Government quarters are divided into

categories, Sir. The most senior Division  I  officers

have  Class  I  quarters. The most junior  Division  I

officers have Class V quarters. The particular type of

quarter  suitable for the Resident Engineer at  Jurong

is  a  Class  V  quarter. It is the cheapest  type  of

quarter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I strongly advocate doing

away with this type of quarter. I would rather add two

extra  rooms  to a Division II quarter at  a  cost  of

another $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 11 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 2 comes under the Royal Malayan Navy and it

deals with shipbuilding the estimated cost of which is

$15 million. At last year's Budget sitting I said that

torpedo-boats were obsolescent, and now  I  can  claim

that they are obsolete. With the advent of the Sputnik

and  intercontinental missiles with  atomic  warheads,

warfare  has  made a complete circle in  that  it  has

returned  to  where it started, where the fighting  is

between  leaders - like the stags at rutting - the  winner

takes all. It is clear that in the next war, which God

forbid,  the blows will fall on the nerve centres  and

the  large centres of production, and far-flung  areas

like  Singapore  will fall like  ripe  apples  to  the

victor. There will be no more blockades or mine-laying

as  was  the  case  in  the last  war.  Therefore  the

expenditure  on  building  torpedo-boats  will   be

unnecessary.  In  their place we can have  more  small

patrol  boats  to patrol our shores and  help  in  the

preventive  measures  against smuggling.  Furthermore,

the saving of this very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3327</b></font><br><br>



large  sum  of  $15 million can be used for  building

more  schools  or carrying out other welfare  schemes

for the population of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support  most heartily the  mover  of  this

amendment.  The whole question before  the  House  is

briefly this: whether it is safer for Singapore to be

known  as  an  open city or as the Gibraltar  of  the

East - the  impregnable base of the British  Empire  in

the  Far  East - and therefore we must have an army,  a

navy,  and a strategic air force stationed at  Changi

Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Member for Paya Lebar that we

can  save  this  money  for many  useful  and  urgent

purposes,  rather than spend it on what  some  people

have  described  as  a "toy navy".  Sir,  I  strongly

supported  the  proposal to scrap the  idea  that  we

should establish a Defence Department. A friend  once

said  to  me, "If we do not have an army or  a  small

navy, and if neighbouring countries like Indonesia or

China  or  even India just send a battalion into  our

territory, what are we going to do?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me ask this question: whether any hon.

Member  of  this House ever fired a single bullet  or

shed  a single drop of blood to gain our freedom from

the  British  imperialists? Sir, I must confess  that

without Hitler, who was hitting the imperialists  and

the  colonialists  in the West, and  without  General

Tojo,  who started the war from the East,  I  do  not

think   we   will  today  have  so  many  independent

countries in Africa and Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our independence and our security are based on

our international relationships. We must have friends

in  this  new  age. No military power can  conquer  a

people  with genuine national aspirations.  Therefore

we   have   no  fear.  Let  anybody  try  to  conquer

Singapore. They will have to withdraw at last. Sir, I

repeat  again,  it is now a question of  principle - whether Singapore should continue to be known as the

Gibraltar of the East or be declared an open city.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am so sorry, Sir. I should

like  to  point  out that the whole  emphasis  of  my

speech  has been to scrap not only the Royal  Malayan

Navy but all the defence expenditure arising from it.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is  a programme of $15 million to be spent  on

this item of shipbuilding. Nothing has been spent  so

far.  If  so,  it  should not be proceeded  with  and

"money  wasted  in the water". The  money  should  be

utilised  for  the  welfare of the  people.  Besides,

Singapore  is  not responsible for external  defence.

This  rests  with the United Kingdom  Government.  If

Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom want to

have  their  interests defended,  they  may  maintain

anything they want at their expense. We should not be

their cat's-paw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give another instance. The United States of

America is maintaining a naval reserve force in  Near

East waters, near Formosa, Vietnam and so on. If  the

United  Kingdom  Government want to follow  the  same

course  to  protect their own interests  in  the  Far

East,  let  them do so. But certainly we  should  not

spend  our money on a shipbuilding scheme.  It  is  a

mere waste. You may need an army for internal defence

and  also  you may like to build up an auxiliary  air

force,  but it is a waste of money. We saw how  money

was  wasted on such defence services in the last war.

Singapore  is a small city, Sir. In case of  war,  it

can  be declared an open city - that is quite easy.  It

is  impossible for a small city to defend itself.  We

should not spend so much money on defence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, when I heard the views of the hon.

Member  for Telok Ayer and the hon. Member for Changi

on  defence,  I  was reminded of a remark  which  was

attributed to the Duke of Wellington



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3329</b></font><br><br>



who, after reviewing his forces before a  battle

in  the Peninsula War, said "I hope they frighten the

enemy, for, by God, they frighten me!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to enter into a discussion on the

question  of defence policy, Sir. I cannot altogether

agree  with  the views put forward by the Member  for

Paya  Lebar, the Member for Telok Ayer and the Member

for  Changi.  I do think there is still  a  need  for

small  coastal defence craft. But I would  say  this,

Sir,  that  this  programme  of  shipbuilding  is  in

abeyance because a decision has not yet been  reached

on  the future of the Royal Malayan Navy. I think  it

can  be taken for certain, Sir, that this expenditure

will  not  fall  to  the  account  of  the  Singapore

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, in that case, I beg to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of the Committee

that the amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Aye.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 11 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 9 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to subhead 9 which shows that an amount

of   $12  million  is  required  to  build  permanent

barracks for the Singapore Infantry Regiment. I  have

already described this Budget as unrealistic and this

is one of the items which makes me form that opinion.

Sir,  $12  million  is  a very large  sum  of  money.

Although  we are committed to the Singapore Battalion

and  troops to help us keep our internal and external

security,  I  do  not  visualise  the  necessity   of

spending  such  a  large sum for permanent  barracks.

Barracks  can be made of different types and  we  can

put up large buildings for less than half



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3330</b></font><br><br>



that sum. The objection has always been that the cost

of  maintenance of a semi-permanent building would be

double  that  of a permanent one. That is  true,  but

when  you come to the question of arithmetic, if  you

can  save $6 million out of $12 million, the interest

saved on that large sum would be more than enough  to

be  used  for  the  repairs and  maintenance  of  the

buildings,  and the sum of $6 million could  be  used

for  other  projects. Sir, as I have said before,  we

are  coming to a time when we must examine every item

of  expenditure, and I say that $12 million  for  any

project must be examined with minute care and  pruned

down wherever possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> These barracks are required for the 1st

Battalion  of  the Singapore Infantry Regiment.  They

are  based on a schedule of requirements drawn up  by

the  War  Council and on a programme of building  for

the Federation Regiment. The figure shown is merely a

very rough P.W.D. estimate based on cubic footage  of

building and ancillary services required for a  large

military  cantonment.  The plans  have  still  to  be

prepared. I imagine that very considerable reductions

will  be  made, not perhaps so much on  the  cost  of

items  but on the number of items in the schedule.  I

think,  when the final plans are drawn up,  the  hon.

Member will find that the total sum required will  be

very  considerably reduced. At the same time, Sir,  I

should  say  that  if he were dissatisfied  with  the

estimate drawn up, it would be an appropriate  matter

to be taken up by the Estimates Committee. The matter

is  still in the planning stage. We have entered into

no  commitments  and  the hon.  Member  will  in  the

Estimates   Committee  have  every   opportunity   of

determining whether the estimates are realistic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, looking through

the Development Estimates under this head, I feel  it

is a real shame on the part of the Government that no

provision  is  being  made for a  sports  stadium  in

Singapore. It is also a disgrace to Singapore that we

do not have a sports stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago the Government set up a Sports

Stadium   Board.   Members   of   this   Board   were

representatives  of  local sports organisations,  the

City Council and, I believe, the Rural Board as well.

I  happened  to  be a member of this  Board  for  two

years,  as a representative of the City Council.  But

last  year  I  was compelled to tender my resignation

from this Board because I was not satisfied with  the

set  up.  I felt at that time that I would  serve  no

purpose  by sitting on the Board if it could  not  do

anything  for the benefit of Singapore in the  sports

field.  Any  proposals made by members of  the  Board

were  just  simply  turned down - I see  the  Financial

Secretary  is nodding his head. The reason  given  by

the Government for turning down any proposals made by

members  of the Board was that there was no money  to

carry  them  out.  Yet this year's  Budget  Estimates

could be prepared with a deficit of $35 million,  and

Government  knows  how to find that  $35  million  by

increasing taxes and so forth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was not only I who was disgusted with the

attitude  of the Government. All the members  of  the

Board,  excluding  the  ex-officios,  especially  the

Financial Secretary, I think, were not happy  at  all

with  the state of affairs. Ultimately there  was  no

alternative  for the Government but to dissolve  that

Board.  I  think  there  is another  Member  in  this

Assembly  who was also a member of the Board,  and  I

believe he felt the same way as I did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, Sir, some members of the Board

suggested  to  Government to take over  Bendemeer - the

Member for Kampong Kapor is not here; if he is  here,

he will not feel happy about it, Sir, because that is

the   property  he  inherited  from  his   ancestors.

Bendemeer  is  a  very suitable  site  for  a  sports

stadium.  If we could have taken that over, we  would

today  be  proud and could boast of having  a  sports

stadium in Singapore. But Government was not  at  all

prepared  to  listen  to the  advice  given  and  the

suggestions made by members of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another excuse that the Government always gave was

that  there  was no response from the  public.  Would

that be correct, Sir, that there was no response from

the  public?  I am sure that the people of  Singapore

are  quite  sports-conscious  and  sports-minded.  We

often see big crowds at sports events. If there is no

move  made  by the Government, how can they ascertain

if  there is any actual support and response from the

public?  Government must make a move or  a  start  so

that  response  or  support from the  public  can  be

forthcoming. But no, Government was not  prepared  to

make a move at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already on the sports map. We won many

Gold  Medals, Silver Medals and Bronze Medals in  the

Olympic  Games.  Why cannot we have a sports  stadium

and  so  be on a par with other countries? At  least,

Sir,  the  City Council of Singapore - a  much  smaller

authority  than the Assembly - can boast of  a  running

track  in Farrer Park. If the City Council can  boast

of   a  running  track  in  Farrer  Park,  what  have

Government  done and what have they to  boast  about?

Nothing at all. A running track provided by the  City

Council and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3333</b></font><br><br>



not  by the Government! But it is never too late  for

the Government to realise and correct their mistakes,

Sir.  There  is  still time. If  the  Government  are

sincere  in  admitting that a mistake has been  made,

then I think they can have second thoughts about  the

sports  stadium. Government can again set it up,  but

in  doing so, let me tell the Government this -  there

is  no purpose, as I have said, in having a board  if

its   members  have  no  voice  at  all   under   the

dictatorship of the Government. No member would  like

to  sit  on  the Board if the Government dictated  to

him.  As a citizen of Singapore, I would like to  see

Singapore have a sports stadium which will  be  on  a

par  with  those  of other countries. Let  Government

find  out  whether there is any support  or  response

from the public. If the worse comes to the worse, why

not  run  the stadium on a semi-commercial basis  and

ask  Government to give a dollar for dollar grant and

see whether there is any response from the public?



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I rise to support the last speaker. The idea  of

having a sports stadium was mooted about eight  years

ago. The previous Government encouraged the formation

of  a  Singapore Sports Stadium, but during the  last

three or four years, no support came from the present

Government. This year it was said that because  there

was  no support for this project, there was no  point

in  carrying  on with it and therefore it  should  be

suspended for the time being. But the fact is, as you

have heard the last speaker say, no encouragement was

given  by the Government at all. Government's idea  I

think  is,  "Oh, we need a lot of money for  schools,

hospitals and housing." Well and good, but today when

looking  at the Budget we are asked to approve  about

$242  million. I can see no point why we  should  not

have $1¾ million for a sports stadium and I think  it

is  a shame for the Government in not having a sports

stadium  built for Singapore. There are, I think,  in

Singapore  at least 300,000 people who are interested

in  sports.  Over 100,000 are interested  in  various

forms of sports and 200,000 are either supporters  or

onlookers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were the first to cry for a sports stadium, and

yet the Federation of Malaya, who did not clamour for

one,  were  the first to build their stadium.  It  is

because  they have a great sportsman in  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  and  their  Ministers are all  sports-minded.

Unfortunately, looking across the Chamber,  I  cannot

see  anyone  on the Government benches who  has  even

stepped  into the Jalan Besar stadium. That  is  why,

Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government are not interested

in  sports at all. We are spending our money to fight

subversive  elements, and yet in a way  I  think  the

Government  are  encouraging their existence  by  not

providing the youths of Singapore with healthier  and

better recreation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage I was told by a member of the

Government  that  we have a sports stadium  in  Jalan

Besar.  Sir,  that  is not a sports  stadium;  it  is

merely  a  playing  field  and  not  fit  for   major

competitions.   What  we  want  is   a   stadium   of

international standard where games can be held on  an

international   level,  so  that  the   citizens   of

Singapore can have something to be proud of.  I  hope

the Government will change their views, and they will

receive  the  blessings of the younger generation  if

they provide Singapore with a decent sports stadium.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, if I may speak for the non-games

playing  aesthetes who sit on the Government  benches

on  this matter of a sports stadium for Singapore!  I

do  not  want to go into this matter again at length.

It  has  been  ventilated in  this  Chamber  on  many

occasions  over the past four years. It may  be  true

that  we have disappointed the Stadium Board and that

we have turned down requests from various sections of

the   community  for  a  stadium  in  Singapore.   We

appointed the Board in the hope that it would be able

to  evolve  a  suitable and workable scheme  for  the

construction and running of a stadium, but it  failed

to  do so. Its idea was that Government should put up

all  the  money  for  the  stadium  and,  I  presume,

subsequently all the money for its running  expenses.

I  would  like to summarise briefly why this proposal

was  not  supported by Government. First of  all,  we

have an excellent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3335</b></font><br><br>



stadium  at  the  moment. We  have  Jalan  Besar  the

capacity  of  which has never been fully utilised  at

any  sporting  event  held  there.  It  is  perfectly

suitable  for  all  reasonable  requirements  at  the

present  time. It could be expanded if necessary.  We

also  have  a running track in Farrer Park  which  is

suitable  for our athletes to train on. An even  more

cogent  reason  for not supporting the proposal  from

the   Stadium   Board  is  that  our  resources   for

development  are limited and we feel that,  while  an

international  sports  stadium  might  add   to   the

prestige of Singapore, in present circumstances,  the

money  required for it could be devoted to far better

purposes,  for example, to building houses, hospitals

and schools for the population.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it

really  surprises  me to see the Financial  Secretary

come  to  this Assembly and boast that we have  Jalan

Besar stadium and a running track at Farrer Park, and

that all sporting functions can be held at these  two

places. Sir, Jalan Besar stadium belongs to the  City

Council, and not the Government. The running track at

Farrer Park also belongs to the City Council, and not

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to go further, Sir, and say that Jalan

Besar  stadium  is  not a sports  stadium.  It  is  a

stadium  built  especially for football  and  hockey.

Throughout the whole year the activities held in that

stadium consist of nothing but football. Other sports

activities are seldom held there, not because  people

are  not interested, but because the place is not big

enough  by international standards. The size of  that

stadium is too small for the Olympic Games to be held

there. Only small schools hold their sports there. It

is  really  surprising  to see Government  trying  to

cover  up their responsibility by saying that we  are

well  catered  for  by having this  stadium  and  the

running track at Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Cairnhill has suggested, it

is only through sports and games that you are able to

teach  the younger generation to do the right things.

We  have  seen  many teenagers going the  wrong  way,

becoming either gangsters or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3336</b></font><br><br>



subversive   elements.  Why?  Because   they   cannot

concentrate their minds on the right path and so they

go  into  the  wrong path, where you have  subversive

elements  and gangsters and gang clashes  and  secret

societies.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should try to bring the younger generation to the

sports  field where they can mingle together, because

it  is  through  games and sports that  the  sporting

spirit  is cultivated, and the winning or the  losing

does  not  matter.  It  is better  that  the  younger

generation  go  in  for  sports  rather  than  become

subversive elements and extortionists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Cairnhill has said, I hope the

Government  will change their minds and  re-establish

this Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

argument of the Member for Queenstown that we  should

bring  teenagers to the stadium where they will learn

to  cultivate the sporting spirit and be good boys is

most stupid. I thought the whole argument was that  a

stadium  of international standard should be provided

in  order  to  enhance the prestige of  Singapore.  I

think  the  Member for Queenstown does not understand

the  fight of ideologies in this country. It  is  not

through  sports  alone that you can fight  subversive

elements or gangsterism. It is the provision of  more

employment,  more housing and more schools  that  can

fight these two problems - not sports alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I wish to stress is this: the

Member  for  Queenstown  said  that  we  should   get

teenagers   to   take  an  interest  in  recreational

facilities  to  prevent them from becoming  gangsters

and subversive elements. If the Member for Queenstown

and  the  Member  for Cairnhill, as  public  spirited

leaders   of   this  country,  will  organise   these

youngsters into small sections and bring them to  the

Youth  Sports Centre, I will say then that  they  are

doing a duty to the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I was much impressed by the obvious deep

feelings  of  the  Member  for  Cairnhill,  and  even

perhaps of the Member for Queenstown, in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3337</b></font><br><br>



matter. But I feel they might go a little bit further

and  make  it  quite clear to us by  what  means  the

Government   are  going  to  find  this  money.   The

Government  cannot do all the things for which  money

is required - a minimum of $¾ million. To get the money

they want, we must drop out schools, or hospitals, or

public assistance, or whatever item they want to  cut

out. Alternatively, they can indicate what taxes they

would like to impose to get this money. Let them make

it   perfectly  clear,  not  in  general  terms   but

precisely - to show that they have studied very  deeply

this  subject - exactly what item in  the  Budget  they

would  delete  or  what additional taxes  they  would

impose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, if there had been a failure to

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, since the Assistant Minister

to the Chief Secretary has given way, may I seek your

is  an  argument whether it is a point of information

or  a  point  of order. May I have your  ruling,  Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, it is quite usual for people to hold

different  views. In this case some  members  of  the

Stadium  Board  had made certain suggestions  to  the

Government, and the Government had quite rightly told

them  they could not have their way. I would like  to

ask  those  members of the Board who had  made  these

suggestions   whether   they   had   considered   any

alternative suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this country many people believe that

improvements  can  only be made through  Government's

efforts alone and with Government's money alone.  But

they have not pondered over the capacity of voluntary

contributions which people could make in  matters  of

this  kind.  Sir, I would like to call upon  the  two

Members of this House, who have championed the  cause

of  a  sports stadium in Singapore, to champion  also

the cause of raising voluntary contributions to build

this  sports  stadium. I do not think for  a  moment,

Sir,  that the Government need feel any shame.  Where

is  the  shame?  The  Government have  supported  the

Singapore Youth Sports Centre. There were responsible

men  who  came  forward  and  organised  it  and  the

Government  made a dollar for dollar grant  for  that

purpose.  I do not believe this stadium is  only  the

Government's  responsibility. The City  Council  must

come   in,   and  so  must  various  other  voluntary

organisations.  We  will then  be  able  to  build  a

stadium of international standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I never

expected this lively debate to develop into a  heated

quarrel.  Sir, I wish to answer the question  put  by

the   Hon. the  Assistant  Minister  to  the   Chief

Secretary    and   the   Hon. the   Minister    for

Communications  and  Works when they  ask,  "How  are

Government  going  to find the money?"  Sir,  if  the

House  will just accept my proposal to scrap  defence

expenditure, we will have the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if the Minister for Commerce and Industry is

keen  enough to boost up tourism, one of the ways  he

can  do so is to boost up sports. Build a stadium  of

international standard which can not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3339</b></font><br><br>



only hold the Asian Games but also the Olympic Games,

and  that  will  be  another way  of  increasing  our

national revenue. What I strongly oppose, to boost up

tourism,   is   to  extend  the  working   hours   of

restaurants  and hotels to 4 a.m. in the morning,  or

relax  the immigration regulations to allow  artistes

to  come into this colony and make Singapore be known

as  second to Tokyo in attraction or Paris.  I  think

sports  is  one  of  the best means  to  attract  the

tourists  and the Minister for Commerce and  Industry

should think about it. Of course, I support the  view

of   the  Minister  for  Education  that  Singapore's

prestige  would  be enhanced by the  provision  of  a

stadium of international standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> I have heard the views of the

Government  Members and, as I have  said,  they  have

never  been present at sporting events. The Hon. the

Financial Secretary has said that we have Jalan Besar

Stadium  and that it has not been filled  up  at  any

time. This is because it is not fit for international

competitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education talked about the Youth Sports Centre. Does he know what the Sports Centre is

catering  for?  It  is catering  for  the  youths  of

Singapore particularly for those who may not have the

privilege  of joining clubs. To have that  centre  is

well  and good. But I am talking of having a  stadium

where we can hold sporting events on an international

scale.  I  must  say this, Sir, that  the  Government

representative  on the Stadium Board  had  been  most

discouraging.  We put up suggestion after  suggestion

and  when I said "we" I was referring to the  Stadium

Board, but all our suggestions were ignored. I accept

the  challenge of the Government - provide  us  with  a

site  and  a dollar for a dollar and we will  have  a

stadium  built  in no time in spite  of  the  present

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot

allow the comments from the Government benches to  go

unanswered.  First, I will touch on the remarks  made

by the Minister for Education. He said that it is not

only teenagers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3340</b></font><br><br>



who are interested in sports. I agree with him,

because  a  sports  stadium  is  not  only  for   the

youngsters.  A  sport  stadium  on  an  international

standard  is meant for international and Olympic  use

and  not  only  for small children. So  when  I  said

teenagers  I  was  only  making  a  quotation  or   a

reference. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point raised by the Minister for

Education  was that it is not only sports alone  that

will  turn  a bad boy into a good boy. I again  agree

with him, but is not sports one of the most important

factors,    apart   from   others   that    he    has

quoted - employment, schooling and education - that  will

turn  a bad boy or a subversive element into a  good,

loyal and faithful citizen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> On a point of

elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!--Mr R. C. H. Lim-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> No, Sir. I now come to the

remarks  made by the Minister for Communications  and

Works. He asked "Where can we find the money? Tell me

which of the items in this Budget we can cut down. Or

can  we  increase  any  form of  taxes?"  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, if there is no extravagance in this  Budget,

there  will  not  be this number of  amendments  that

appear  in  the Order Paper. This clearly shows  that

there  is  extravagance in the spending of  money  by

Government,  and  if they can cut out  some  of  that

extravagance,  they can provide money  for  a  sports

stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Assistant Minister to the Chief

Secretary.  He asked, "Did any member of the  Stadium

Board  put  forward any alternative  suggestion?  Why

were  members of that Board silent about it when they

were  members of the Board?" Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

many alternative suggestions were put forward, as the

Member for Cairnhill has said. Apart from the case of

Bendemeer which I have quoted, there were many  other

places like Anson Road and so forth. Was that not  an

alternative suggestion? The Member for Cairnhill  has

suggested  that,  instead  of  having  a  government-sponsored stadium, Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3341</b></font><br><br>



make a dollar for dollar grant, and in no  time

we  feel  sure the whole sporting public will  gather

together  and  pool  their resources  to  build  this

sports stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government make out their case against a sports

stadium  under the guise of the Youth Sports  Centre.

Is  this  centre  a sports stadium? What  English  is

this? A sports centre is not a sports stadium.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill  has said  that  none  of  the

Members  on the Government benches has any  knowledge

of  sports. A sports centre is for training  purposes

only.   What   we  want  is  a  sports   stadium   of

international  standard  so  that  we  can  have  the

Olympic Games held here. Rather than going abroad, we

can  invite  other  countries to come  here  for  the

Olympic  and  international games. There  is  only  a

minute  left,  and I will give way to the  Government

benches to reply if they feel like it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

All I wanted to make sure from the two experts on the

sports  stadium - the  Member  for  Cairnhill  and  the

Member for Queenstown - is that if they can prove  from

their personal experience that they can turn bad boys

into  good boys by exercise and sports, I am  all  in

favour of more sports stadiums.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 42 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment I am not attacking the

sum involved as being too large for district offices.

That  is  a  matter which can in any case go  to  the

Estimates   Committee.  But  what  to  my   mind   is

disappointing is the progress intended to be made  in

1958.  The District Councils themselves are to be  in

operation  by  April or May next year.  One  presumes

that,  at  the  earliest, district  offices  will  be

completed somewhere around the end of 1959  and  only

$250,000 is to be spent next year. It seems to  us  a

pity  that,  as far as providing proper  centres  and

offices  is  concerned, the District Councils  cannot

become  more  of a reality, more of a focusing  point

for  the  rural  areas at an earlier  date.  District

Councils  have been planned by the Government  for  a

very   long  time.  This  delay  seems  to  be   most

regrettable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, as you will see from the subhead in

the  Estimates,  this  involves the  construction  of

three  district offices. It is our intention to  farm

this  project out to private architects. Our estimate

is  that  by the time these architects have  prepared

their   sketch  plans,  and  these  are  subsequently

approved  and  the  working drawings  made  out,  the

necessary  contract documents prepared and  the  work

put out to tender, tenders received, considered and a

contract  let, it will be August. That  is  only  our

estimate.  Following  from  that,  we  have   allowed

$250,000  in  the  Estimates  as  the  sum  which  we

consider  will  be  spent on all three  offices  next

year.  If, however, we find that that is not  enough,

that our estimate of time has proved to be faulty and

that  more  progress is made, then we will  certainly

come to the Assembly and ask for further funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while accepting

that statement for what it is worth, I would like  to

know  what are the District Councils going to  do  in

the interim? They come into operation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3343</b></font><br><br>



in  another  six months. Where are they going  to  be

housed?  How  are they going to function properly  as

District Councils should?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat):</b> Sir, the land for

these District Offices, depots and quarters has  been

acquired  and work on site preparation and roads  has

already started. The intention is to erect new  light

steel type buildings immediately which will serve  as

temporary  offices  until the permanent  offices  are

ready. These temporary buildings can subsequently  be

used  for community centres, markets and for  depots.

They will be ready for use in April next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $250,000 for Head D 42 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it

seems  that  people  living in the  rural  areas  are

always  forgotten  by  Government.  In  the  case  of

elections,  the rural areas have never had  any  yet,

and  this  is the first time they are going  to  have

some  members elected. But still there will  be  some

government-appointed members on the Rural Board. What

I  am thinking about is this, if there is going to be

an  election  and the representatives of  the  people

come  in  to sit down and consider matters  affecting

their own welfare, it is important that we should not

start them off with a handicap. Previously under  the

Government  they had handpicked men  to  sit  on  the

Rural  Board,  in  Empress Place - in a  good  concrete

building. Now we learn from the Government  that  the

rural  districts are going to have elections sometime

in  April  next year. I will be happy  if  the  Chief

Minister  will  confirm that they  are  going  to  be

housed in prefabricated buildings. I also do not know

whether  the  provision is going to be sufficient  to

enable  them to run their affairs properly.  I  think

this  leaves the rural people with an idea that  they

can only have second best, not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3344</b></font><br><br>



only in the matter of modern services but also in the

matter   of  planning  by  the  Government.  If   the

Government  had been thinking of having  an  election

for the District Councils next year, they should have

planned  in  1955  or  1956 that all  such  buildings

should  be put up, and as soon as the representatives

are  elected,  Government should at least  have  some

decent place for them to discuss their affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

congratulate   the  Hon. the  Minister   for   Local

Government,  Lands  and Housing  on  producing  these

"semi-temporary"  buildings  for  district   officers

before April next year. I am very happy to learn that

the  P.W.D. are now seriously undertaking  such  work

and  I am quite sure they must be designing something

which  is  eminently  suitable, because  we  are  now

informed  that  these semi-temporary offices  can  be

turned  into markets and community centres  when  the

permanent   buildings   for  district   offices   are

completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it carries me to a further point: Why cannot

this  type of temporary buildings be adopted for  the

schools  to be built in the rural areas and even  for

our  barracks? A large sum of money can be  saved  if

such  buildings are considered fit enough to be used

later for markets and community centres. Sir, I think

we  should  examine these plans and  adopt  them  for

further use.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the leader of the Liberal-Socialists posed the Government a question, and a

Back-Bencher  of the same Party has answered  it  for

the  Government! I am indeed happy  to  know  that  a

question  asked  by one is answered by  another  from

their own ranks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the suggestion raised by the Member

for  Paya  Lebar  about  cheaper  costs  in  building

schools, it will receive the serious consideration of

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was

most  surprised to find an Opposition Member opposing

his  own colleague on the question whether the  Rural

Board  has been satisfactorily performing its duties.

Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3345</b></font><br><br>



think,  to  be  fair, we must hand a bouquet  to  the

Rural  Board  for the work it has done  in  the  past

year,  especially to officers like Mr Chan Sek  Kuan

and Inche Hussein who have really contributed a great

deal  to  the service of the people. One point  worth

mentioning  is  the remarkable change that  has  been

achieved  in the relationship between the people  and

the  Rural  Board officers. Before these new  changes

took  place,  the  rural people were frightened  when

they   heard  the  word  "tigu".  "Tigu"  means   any

government  officer coming to inspect  a  house.  But

since  last  year their fears have died down  because

the  officer has such an easy approach,  so  much  so

that they have been pleased to co-operate with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the Government will confirm again that there

is  going  to  be an election for the rural  district

councils.  If so, the earlier it is held, the  better

so  that we will know exactly where the divisions  of

the  three  district councils are. I  also  wish  the

people  who  will  serve  on  the  Rural  Board  will

maintain this co-operative spirit, and so be of  more

assistance to the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 43 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, I seek information. We are asked to

approve an enormous lump sum of $10 million, of which

$8  million is for general development. I think it is

only right that we on this side should hear from  the

Minister something as to what is intended under  this

Head.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this vote is

the  combination  of  two separate  ones  which  were

provided  in the 1957 Estimates. A sum of $8  million

was  entered  last year for Purchase  of  Land.  This

year, there is a reduction of $2 million, and as  you

will  see,  it is $8 million for general  development

and  $2  million for resettlement. The Estimates  for

1958 are based on actual needs. Purchases of land are

necessary if Government's plans for the expansion  of

the  housing, education, medical, social welfare  and

other  Government  services are to  be  carried  out.

Purchases  must  be made not only for sites  required

for  schools,  hospitals and social welfare  centres,

but  also  for purchases of land on which to resettle

people.  From 1957 onwards, the Singapore Improvement

Trust is a body primarily concerned with development.

The    cost    of   such   resettlement,    including

compensation, still has to be borne by Government. Up

to  the  present, Sir, a total of 70 areas have  been

investigated  and, as I mentioned yesterday  in  this

Assembly in the course of the debate on Head  42,  on

my Ministry, there are some 2,652 farm lots which are

being investigated, or have been investigated and are

due for allotment to farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is about all I can give the Member for

Tanglin. If he wants any further information I  shall

be pleased to give it to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do realise of course

what  this vote is intended for, namely, for  general

development, for such things as schools and so on  as

my  hon.  Friend  has mentioned. But  I  repeat,  $10

million is a very large sum and we would like to have

an  assurance that it is in fact going to  be  spent.

There  must have been some calculations to arrive  at

this very large figure. There was estimated to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3347</b></font><br><br>



spent   in   1957   under  general  development   and

resettlement, a similar sum of $10 million. We  would

like  to know, for instance, whether this $10 million

will  have  been spent by the end of  this  year.  We

should have rather more information than the Minister

has already given, and we would be very glad of it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

indications  as  to expenditure on  these  items.  In

1954,  the  total expenditure on land  purchases  was

$8.35  million, in 1955 $10.2 million, in  1956  $6.5

million  and in 1957 it is expected that a  total  of

$9.8  million  will have to be spent by  the  end  of

December.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, that was not the

information  that  my colleague wanted.  Actually  he

wanted  to know how this enormous sum of $10  million

is  going  to  be spent, and I think possibly  I  can

supply the information. I know -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why ask then?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Well, to let you know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I surmise that part of this amount will be required

for the acquisition of 500 acres in Woodlands for the

Master Plan to settle the population of Singapore. In

connection  with this land, I can say  that  this  is

where   our  effort  to  produce  houses   has   been

stultified to the extent of nearly 1,000 units. About

two years ago, we made enquiries whether we would  be

allowed  to  develop  very low-cost  houses  in  this

particular  area. For some reason or other,  we  have

been put off repeatedly; then six months ago, we were

told,  'Don't  waste your money on contour  surveys';

then  about  two months ago, a notice of  acquisition

was served on us. We now know what the reason is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification - I

notice,  Sir,  that the hon. Member says,  "we"  lost

1,000  housing  units.  We  would  like  to  have   a

definition  of what "us" implies or embraces,  it  is

not "us" on this side of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I think the hon. Member has

always been trying to trip me on this subject. Yes, I

mean the two companies of which I am director and  of

which we are -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is it

not more proper for the hon. Member for Serangoon  to

state -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Paya Lebar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - Paya Lebar to state categorically

at  the  start that he represents them or has certain

interests  in these matters. Then we would  not  have

had to ask him who "us" implies, who "us" embraces.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Standing Order and the relevant

Ordinance  are quite clear on the point: if  an  hon.

Member  has a direct pecuniary interest, he ought  to

inform the House about that direct pecuniary interest

before  he speaks on any subject. But whether or  not

there  is direct pecuniary interest, I am not at  the

moment prepared to find. Perhaps the hon. Member  for

Paya Lebar will explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I declare I have no direct

pecuniary interest except from a director's point  of

view  to help in the housing of Singapore. If I  were

to  declare in detail I would take such a lot of time

that  there  would be none left for  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  to carry on with his  very  important

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not see why Government should try to

develop  500  acres,  a complete  town,  when  it  is

already  finding trouble in financing and  developing

other  houses  planned in town  areas  like  the  old

Kallang  Airport.  If  it had only  concentrated  its

efforts   there,  and  allowed  and  helped   private

builders to go on, we would have got somewhere and  I

am  quite  sure we would have put up an  extra  1,000

houses there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the $2 million to be allocated for

resettlement,  I  would  enquire  whether  Government

would  encourage people who live in densely populated

areas, where there are many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3349</b></font><br><br>



plank-attap houses and where there is a danger of the

landlord  selling  out  to  unscrupulous  developers,

whether Government would consider helping the  people

living  in  these attap houses by having a scheme  to

acquire  the land on their behalf and cut it up  into

smaller  pieces for sale to them. This  will  prevent

hardship  to people in attap dwellings and save  them

from  being exploited by unscrupulous speculators  of

land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Perhaps, Sir, I can tell the hon. Member

how  this vote is made up. I have the information  at

my  disposal. I obtained it from my hon.  Friend  the

Hon.   Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands   and

Housing.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Helping each other!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Naturally!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the year, Sir, the Commissioner of Lands

asked  various heads of departments in  Singapore  to

state  what were their possible requirements for  the

purchase  of  land  for the coming year.  These  were

sifted  by the Commissioner and it was on that  basis

that  his application for a vote for the coming  year

was  made. In this particular year, his bid was  well

over  $10  million but it was thought  that,  on  the

basis of expenditure in the past, $8 million would be

enough to enter in the Estimates. Correspondingly, in

connection   with   the   purchase   of   land    for

resettlement,  the initial bid from the  Commissioner

was  $5  million  but  it was  thought  that  in  all

probability $2 million would be enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you will notice that the form of the vote has

been  changed this year and that both the items which

appeared  last  year as subheads under  the  Head  of

Development  expenditure, now appear as  items  under

one subhead. This enables us to switch funds from one

item to another, as is allowed. If, for example,  the

sum  voted  for the purchase of land for resettlement

is  insufficient, or on the other hand if the  amount

of  money voted for the purchase of land for  general

development proves to be insufficient, and there is a

saving  in  the other item, we can switch funds  from

one to the other as required.

by $10 in respect of subhead 3 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only a very short time at my disposal and

shall  cut  my  remarks very short. I  refer  to  the

contribution to Rural Board, Appendix DB, page 434 of

the Estimates, subhead 11, item (5)

-"Link  road Holland Road/Bukit Timah" - and  to  note

with  regret  that the development of  this  road  is

going  to  be virtually delayed for yet another  year

because  only  $20,000 of the required  $220,000  has

been voted. I would refer to the explanatory note  on

page 470 which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This road will open up a considerable area

for   development,  and  will  be  used  by  through

traffic  which  at  present  uses  the  very  narrow

winding and dangerous Upper Holland Road."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the importance of this road in opening up

this area, I express regret, as I say, and wonder why

it is being delayed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, on development of our

education,  I  wish  to ask a question,  whether  the

Government has considered higher education.  I  think

Nanyang  University was mentioned by  His  Excellency

the  Governor in his Address not long ago. I am sorry

to  see  that  in the Estimates of development,  this

item  is  not  included.  I  know  that  the  Nanyang

University has tendered an official memorandum to the

Government  seeking aid from it. I hope the  Minister

for Education can clear this point to the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The question of Nanyang

University is a subject still under consideration not

only  by  the  Government, but also by the  Executive

Council of the Nanyang University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I do not wish to join in any

vote-catching  scheme about Nanyang University.  When

the Chairman of my Party went to a forum organised by

the  Nanyang  University  Students  Union,  when  all

political    Parties    were    invited    to    send

representatives, quite a number went  there  for  the

express  purpose of trying to win votes. In  fact,  I

was  told  that one of them went there with  a  large

symbol  of  some very lethal instrument  and  shouted

fierce  slogans which had no relevance to the  rather

intellectual subject then under discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not think that Nanyang University is a

subject  for discussion merely between its  Executive

Council  and  the  Singapore Government.  If  Nanyang

University wants to settle its future, I think it has

to do it, not only with the Singapore Government but,

more   important,  with  the  Federation  of   Malaya

Government. If it wants to cater for the education of

the  people of Malaya as distinct from the people  of

Singapore,  then  the important  partner  to  discuss

these  matters with would be the Federation. That  is

where  the final settlement will undoubtedly be made,

and I hope will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch upon certain other topics in

connection with this head: It is with regret  that  I

note that not so much money is being expended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3352</b></font><br><br>



on   secondary   schools.  We  all   understand   the

tremendous pressure on the educational facilities, so

that  we  cannot  muster enough to meet  the  growing

demands of a fast increasing generation. I am told by

teachers - and   I  have  heard  it  with  considerable

alarm - that  no  less than 70 to 80 per  cent  of  the

students  now  passing out from primary schools  will

find no place in secondary schools next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Hon. the Minister for Education would be

delighted  to  rise  to refute this  allegation,  but

unless  more and more secondary schools are built  to

equal  the  pace of building of primary  schools,  it

must  logically  follow that he who goes  to  primary

school does not necessarily go to a secondary school.

Unless you build as many secondary schools as you  do

primary   schools,   that  is  just   not   possible.

Mathematically it is an impossibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to find out from the Minister is

how  long  does  he  think it  will  be  before  some

effective approach can be made to this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand, of course, that the moment an

elected  or  partly  elected  government  comes  into

office,  it  is under all kinds of pressure.  Whereas

the  old Colonial-type government could issue  annual

reports  with a glossy cover-piece and nice  pictures

inside   and   nobody   would   put   searching   and

uncomfortable questions, an elected government is not

that well protected. Therefore, the moment an elected

Government  gets  into  office,  all  the   dammed-up

demands  which  have  been mounting  over  the  years

suddenly burst through at some point or other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand also that the needs of the younger

generation  are more acute than those of the  not-so-young,  but you have to face this problem. If  we  do

not  put  these children passing out from the primary

schools into secondary ones, then we will be in for a

big  increase  in  juvenile  delinquency  and  graver

problems  of unemployment, because employment  cannot

be  created for all those in the unskilled  category.

If you want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3353</b></font><br><br>



to   create   employment  under   modern   industrial

conditions, you have to create your industrial  class

to   form  the  basis  of  your  new  industrial   or

commercial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to hear from the Minister for

Education  is some disclosure of plans or of  serious

thinking that has gone into this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad

that the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has come round

to  our  point, and that he is in fact  now  worrying

about  the young people. We have voiced that so  many

times and I think we must keep on voicing that need.

I asked a few questions when the Head under Education

was discussed, and if the Minister could give us some

sort of a reply we would be very grateful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Tanjong Pagar says right when he says that I would be

delighted to refute the statement that 70 to  80  per

cent  of pupils from primary schools will not be able

to  get  secondary education. We are  admitting  next

year into our secondary schools slightly more than 60

per  cent of all primary school pupils who pass  out.

As  I  said yesterday, we have provided for, and  are

expanding, our evening classes to absorb

those  pupils found to be unable to profit  from  a

secondary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said yesterday that no country in the world can

afford to provide secondary education for every child

who  needs it. What we aim at is to give an education

to   those  pupils  who  cannot  get  into  secondary

schools,  to  give  them  a chance  to  have  further

education  in  subjects  such  as  those   having   a

commercial bias, so that they can be made employable.

That   is   one  of  the  ways  to  combat   juvenile

delinquency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary education is not an easy matter. We must

have  the  teachers and we lack able and  experienced

ones  to  staff the secondary schools. We  must  also

think  of standards. If we are not to lower standards

in  all  the schools, we must ensure that we get  the

right type of teachers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3354</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Nanyang University, it is in

fact, as pointed out by the Member for Tanjong Pagar,

a   subject  for  discussion  between  not  only  its

Executive  Council and the Singapore Government,  but

also  the Federation of Malaya. I am always in  touch

with the Federation Government and we are approaching

the problem with common-sense and treating it with  a

realistic mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the questions put by the hon. Member for

Serangoon,  I think his main attack was  that  pupils

were  not given schools or placed in schools  nearest

to   their   homes.   It   is  almost   a   practical

impossibility  to  place every child  in  the  school

nearest his home. There are thousands of them  living

in  the  city area, and there are just not sufficient

places  in  particular schools  to  cater  for  them.

Therefore, there must be cases where pupils  have  to

travel  a bit further from their homes. It will  take

time  to  solve this problem and the officers  in  my

Ministry will try to solve it as quickly as possible.

The  only quick method, I think, is by building  more

schools  in the urban areas, skyscraper buildings  if

necessary, with very little space for recreation  but

with enough places to house all these pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for evening classes, these have been expanded,

as  I  said,  and pupils will be given  education  in

subjects with a commercial bias so that they will not

be unemployable when they eventually graduate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,061,260 for Head D 45 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 48 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 6 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deals with the first District Hospital. The

estimate  of cost as first presented to this Assembly

was  $3,200,000;  the  revised  estimate  is  now  $7

million, an increase of more than 100 per cent. We on

this  side of the House would like to know  how  this

increase  has been effected, how much of  it  is  for

extra accommodation and how much of it is claimed for

increase in cost of building.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of this

District Hospital, which is optimistically called the

first  one in the Estimates, must be as much a source

of embarrassment to the Government as that of housing

on  which it has failed so dismally. This business of

a  district hospital has been going on ever since the

present Government took office. If I might refer  the

House  to  column 1064 of Volume 1, No.  19,  of  the

Official  Report  for  21st November,  1955,  in  the

debate on the Estimates two years ago this was stated

by the Hon. the Financial Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As regards district hospitals, complaints have

been  made  that we are making no progress  with  the

work. It has been explained that we have changed  our

plan and that we are now going to Kallang and I think

nobody would care to question that decision, which is

putting  a  district hospital right in the middle  of

one  of the major centres of population of Singapore.

The site that has been provided will cost no money to

the  Government, but the site at Bukit Panjang  which

would not, in any case, have been suitable, had to be

acquired,  as  would  sites in  other  parts  of  the

island.  That  is the major advantage  of  putting  a

district hospital in Kallang, that the site is free."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, we on this side were complaining

about   inaction.   Now,  Sir, we   do   know   that

difficulties were met with at the Kallang site  after

that optimistic speech of the Financial Secretary two

years ago, and some explanation of this business  was

given to us by the Minister, (the reference is column

1030 of Volume 2, No. 14, of the Official Report  for

23rd  November,  1956),  because  by  that  time  the

estimate of $3.2 million had crept up to $6.5 million

and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3356</b></font><br><br>



Minister said the first estimate of $3.2 million  had

been  based on pure paper calculations of  the  cubic

measurement  of the schedule of accommodation  for  a

400-bed  hospital without provision  for  residential

accommodation. So from $3.2 million we jumped to $6.5

million,  but  in the interim, during the  course  of

this year, I made tender enquiries into the health of

this  district hospital, the first, and on 22nd  May,

1957 I asked (column 1931-2, Volume 2, No. 27):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that there

is  considerable dissatisfaction over the great delay

in   the  building  of  the  District  Hospital,  now

extended over two years?"



<br><br>To which the Minister for Health replied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any delay, Mr Speaker, Sir, is outside my own

jurisdiction."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at that stage, it appeared that the Minister more

or less washed his hands of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, having jumped, as I say, from $3.2 to

$6.5  million,  here  we  are  jumping  again  to  $7

million - another   $500,000   more - in   next    year's

Estimates;  and  of  this  jump  of  $500,000,   only

$200,000 is estimated to be spent during 1958.  Now  I

suppose  that  if the Government is  in  office  next

year,  it will want another $500,000 to bring up  the

estimated  cost  to  $7.5 million,  and  so  on,  but

fortunately we will be spared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard of people suffering from

imaginary illnesses, but it seems rather a novel idea

to  have an imaginary hospital in which to cure them.

We  do  regard this business as wholly unsatisfactory

and we would like to know what is going to happen  in

future  because, at the present rate of progress,  it

does seem impossible for this district hospital to be

completed before 1960 or even later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, we do know there have been

revisions.  First, 250 beds, I think  it  was,  under

consideration; then it was 350 and 400; and  then  it

went  up  to  450 (if my memory serves me right,  the

Minister for Health himself was not sure) a year ago.

We  would  like  to know why it could not  have  been

possible to get on rapidly with a 200-bed hospital or

whatever unit would be regarded as economic, and then

develop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3357</b></font><br><br>



it  into  something larger at a later  date.  Even  a

hospital  with  a smaller number of beds  would  have

been  a  start, and would have been more  in  keeping

with  the Government policy than the present  failure

to build anything at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   I  think  I  have  given   adequate

explanation  in  this House in the  past  as  to  the

original rise in the estimates from $3 million to  $6

million  and  I  do not think that there  need  be  a

repetition  on  the  question  of  the  Kallang  site

subsequently found to be inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in cost from the approved $6.5 million

in 1957 to $7 million now, is necessary, Sir, for the

following  reasons - the provision of access roads  and

the  preparation of the site for water and  sewerage.

Furthermore, as the site of the proposed hospital  is

on  the top of a steep hill, it is essential that  an

ante-natal  clinic  be provided near  the  main  East

Coast  Road,  as  it is unreasonable to  expect  pregnant

women  to  climb  to the top of the  hill  for  their

routine  clinical examination. If the hon. Member  is

interested,  as  the Member for  Paya  Lebar  is,  in

certain  figures, I am quite prepared to give  him  a

detailed  breakdown of the cost involved if  he  will

come to my office, or I will send them to him. I have

the  details here but I am afraid they are  much  too

lengthy to go into at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether land is available or not, plans have to be

drawn up, and the plans would serve as standards  for

district  hospitals elsewhere. In consequence,  great

care is exercised so that the maximum benefit can  be

obtained at an economical price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw attention to the fact

that  the  decision to build a district hospital  was

taken  soon after I took office. The complexities  of

the  drawings have occupied the architects for a long

time,  as  is explained on page 466 of the Estimates.

Furthermore, acquisition of the land for  the  access

road  and  the ante-natal clinic for the hospital  is

proceeding. The site chosen for this clinic is in the

best part of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3358</b></font><br><br>



particular  area, and the owners are making  a  claim

for  injurious affection to their land. This has also

been  the cause of some delay. The original  cost,  I

think I have already informed the Member for Tanglin,

was  based  only on hospital building which  did  not

take  into account the provision of quarters  and  so

forth.  We  have now true estimates and I have  every

reason  to believe that there should be some progress

in building.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister gave as an

explanation for an increase from $6.5 to  $7  million

in  1958 that provision had to be made for the access

road  and  for  water and sewerage, those  being  the

first  two  out of three items. Are we to  understand

then, that in the estimates for 1957 the provision of

an  access road and for water and sewerage  had  been

overlooked, and that these did not exist? I  fail  to

believe  that that could possibly be so. That  is  my

first question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is I would like to have, if I may, an

answer  from  the  Minister as  to  why  it  was  not

possible  to  start  a smaller scheme  and  so  bring

hospital  facilities  to  the  Eastern  side  of  the

island, and to have expanded it at a later date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I thought, Sir, I have already said that

the  $500,000 extra on the original estimate for 1957

is  partly for the road to make access easier to  the

building  for the ante-natal clinic at the bottom  of

the road. There will be access to it in two ways, one

from Bedok Road and another from the main road.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Minister mean

that the access road, water and sewerage to which  we

arc  referring  is for the ante-natal  clinic  alone?

That  is  my  first  point. The  second  point  still

remains:  would not a 200-bed hospital  or  something

rather more modest have been a better project?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I just want to make a point I think the

hon.  Member  might  perhaps feel  comforted  by.  In

general, the larger your project for a hospital,  the

more you can get costs down. You



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3359</b></font><br><br>



will  have to provide certain common services in  any

case  for a hospital - sterilising units or what have

you - and  these will not be fully utilised unless  you

have a full-scale number of beds to go with them. The

units have to be there in any case.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I might thank the Minister for

Communications and Works for coming to the rescue  of

the  Minister  for Health. I do now fully  understand

that   the   thing   is   not  under   the   latter's

jurisdiction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, may I suggest that my next

three  amendments,  (ii) , (iii)  and  (iv)  be  taken

together? The main point I want to raise in all three

is  to  seek  an explanation as to why the  estimates

have  shot  up so much, and generally what proportion

of them is represented in increasing costs.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Probably it will be a bit more

convenient if we take them separately.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Very well, Sir. I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 48 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 7 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead refers to extensions to the Children's

Orthopaedic Hospital. The estimated cost was $400,000

but   now   nearly  $1  million  is   required.   The

accompanying note does say that 44 quarters are going

to  be  built,  but  even these 44  quarters  do  not

justify   the   increase.  I   would   welcome   some

explanation as to what new projects are involved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the original estimated

cost  of  $400,000 provided for wards and ancillaries

but   did  not  include  special  accommodation   and

quarters. Subsequently, a revised estimate  was  gone

into  and  arrived  at,  which was  $1,250,000.  This

included   an  operating  theatre  block.   For   the

information of the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, I will

give him details of the extra work to be added. There

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3360</b></font><br><br>



a 340-bed ward, a classroom block, sisters' quarters,

servants'  quarters  and a laundry  block;  and  then

there  is  to  be  a special block for  an  operating

theatre, X-ray department, administration and stores.

This  alone  was estimated at $263,000.  There  is  a

nurses  hostel,  medical  quarters  and  ancillaries.

However,  it  was eventually not considered  that  at

this  stage  an  operating theatre  block  should  be

constructed, so the sum of $263,000 was deducted from

the  $1,250,000. Since the medical plan was  started,

the  Department has found it necessary to plan for  a

doubling  of the size of the proposed hospital,  that

is for 120 beds more.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with regard to the classroom block, since the

patients  are  children, some of whom would  have  to

stay  on  for  a  long period in the  hospital,  this

provision was essential. To use the end of a ward  as

at   present   would  not  be  convenient.   Sisters'

quarters - the  two extras were required.  The  laundry

block  was not included in the original proposal;  at

present  there  is  no  laundry  block  and  one   is

definitely  essential.  The nurses'  hostel - for  both

convenience and economy the existing hostel, standing

on most valuable ground, is dilapidated and should be

demolished  to make room for new wards. A new  hostel

is therefore necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, as can be observed, include all

facilities  and has been subjected to  very  critical

observation.  Considerable economies  in  consequence

have  been effected and, as I just pointed  out,  the

estimate of $1.25 million has now been whittled  down

to $987,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the

explanation. I beg to withdraw the amendment.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 8 therein."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead relates to the Hospital for the

Chronic  Sick  in  Thomson Road. Here  the  estimated

increase  in cost is nearly 300 per cent. That  is  a

very  large  sum,  Sir,  and  we  would  welcome   an

explanation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that that sum

has  already been approved by the House, but I  would

like to draw the hon. Member's attention to subhead 9

in the Draft 1957 Development Estimates, at page 383.

The  revised estimated cost is shown as $2.9  million

and  the  previous estimate was $1.5 million.  I  can

explain  that the estimate of $1.5 million  was  made

without  knowledge  of  the  exact  site  and  on   a

diagrammatic  line  drawing of the cheapest  possible

envisaged  pavilion-type hospital of 200 beds.  Since

then,  available  Crown  land  at  Thomson  Road  was

surveyed  and  it  was decided that  a  pavilion-type

hospital  meant an extravagant use of  land.  It  was

therefore decided to use plans already drawn  up  and

available for a multi-storeyed hospital building. The

use  of  existing  plans saved 18  months  delay  and

enabled work to start in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When estimating the $2.9 million this was to

provide for a hospital of 180 beds. In the process of

detailed  planning, it was, however,  found  that  it

would  be cheaper in the long run to build a  396-bed

hospital on a single site rather than to build a 180-bed  hospital  on the site at a cost of $2.9  million

and at a later date, another at the same cost. Had we

progressed  as originally planned, that  is  to  say,

built  two hospitals of 180 beds each, it would  have

cost  us  a total of not less than $5.8 million.  The

present  construction therefore  shows  a  saving  of

$1.15 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of this hospital is proceeding

satisfactorily and it should be ready for  occupation

by  the  middle of next year. When ready, we will  be

able  to relieve the General Hospital of beds blocked

by  chronic or incurable patients. At present,  there

are  more  than 300 beds blocked by such patients  in

the  General Hospital and the provision of a hospital

of  396 beds for the chronic sick cannot by any means

be considered excessive. It is hardly necessary, Sir,

for  me  to  say  that the annual recurrent  cost  of

running  a  chronic sick hospital is very  much  less

than that of running an acute General Hospital.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like one

further  point  of information from the  Minister.  I

think he stated that the hospital will be ready  for

occupation in the middle of next year. However, there

will  still  be $2,405,000 required to  complete  the

building,  which will presumably come in 1959.  Could

he explain how he reconciled these two points?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am sorry, I meant the middle of 1959.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first half of

1959, $2,405,000 worth of work can be done as against

only $1.5 million during 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, hon. Members do

not  quite  appreciate how these  things  work.  What

happens  is that the work is done and then the  bills

come  in  and it may well be that bills come in  late

for  work done in 1958; but even if they do  come  in

they  may  not be approved if the work has  not  been

checked: and so they have to be paid in 1959 although

the  work might have been done earlier. This sort  of

breakdown of future expenditure is to be expected  to

some  extent: you cannot be certain or precise as  to

what the progress will be; you cannot divide the  sum

voted  precisely between one year and  another,  with

absolute certitude that it will be spent precisely as

set down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item relates to the Students Nurses Hostel and

Training  School.  Here we see an estimated  cost  of

$1.2 million being revised to $2 million. While we do

not  want  to  deprive nurses of a fair  standard  of

accommodation,  we  have  always  thought  that   the

lavish side. With requirements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3363</b></font><br><br>



of  money for other services, I would  enquire

whether  a less expensive type of quarters could  not

be provided.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to

remind  the  Member for Paya Lebar that this  is  not

only  a  students nurses hostel but also  a  training

school. You will observe that we are only asking  for

a  token  vote of $1,000 for the project. The  reason

why  there  is  only  a  token provision,  which  has

probably  escaped the notice of the Member  for  Paya

Lebar,  is  that  at present it is  anticipated  that

there  will be no need for opening all the  wards  in

the   Tan   Tock   Seng's  Hospital  immediately   on

completion. In consequence, it is expected to release

one floor, which would lie vacant for a while. It  is

therefore proposed in the meantime to use this  floor

for  training  of  assistant  nurses,  and  to  start

construction  of  the  student  nurses   hostel   and

training school in 1959 or later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure, while not impeding the training

programme of assistant nurses, will assist the P.W.D.

by  not  throwing too much of a strain on it  and  so

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this project

dates  back  as  far  as  1949.  In  that  year,  the

Department  of  Social Welfare drew up its  five-year

plan  and  provision was made in the 1950,  1951  and 1952  Estimates, but the building did not materialise

because  it  received a low priority. This  item  was

then  deleted from the 1953, 1954 and 1955 Estimates.

In  the  1956  Development  Estimates,  $100,000  was

entered and this amount was later reduced to a  token

of $20. The total cost required for building was then

$400,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 20th February, 1956, the Department was informed

by  the  Public  Works Department that  the  cost  of

building  this  Junior Approved  School,  with  staff

quarters,  was approximately $566,000, and that  more

money  would be required than that envisaged  in  the

Development Estimates, that is $400,000. In  view  of

this,  $250,000  was entered in the 1957  Development

Estimates  under Head D 53, leaving $316,000  as  the

sum  required to complete it. When the drawings  were

completed   this  year,  the  Department  was   again

informed by the P.W.D. that the estimated cost of the

project was then $683,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This school, Sir, when completed can accommodate

120 boys.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I would enquire whether,

when  plans are set in motion and buildings are going

to be built, a limit could not be set by the planners

so  that the architects would know what they have  to

work  on, instead of having to ask for increases year

after  year.  I  have  one particular  instance,  the

building  for Auxiliary Police Constables in  Whitley

Road,  in  the  Police  Training  School  grounds.  I

believe  the  architects, when they  were  asked  for

plans  for this headquarters, said they could not  do

it  for less than a quarter of a million dollars, but

as  the  sum approved was only $200,000, the  project

was  given to a private architect and the whole thing

was  completed for $195,000. Sir, can that  principle

not be applied to some of these present projects?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 54 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of subhead 1

therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1957 on items (1) , (2) and (3) we spent $2

million  odd. Now we are asked to approve  a  sum  of

over $3 million for 1958. No details are given.  May

I  have  some details as to how and on what  projects

this money is to be spent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, looking at the Permanent Terminal

Building, the revised cost is put at $8 millions.  We

have spent about $250,000 so far on that project. May

I  know how that has been spent? I happened to  be  a

member  in  the  old  days of the Airport  Committee,

which  started  the project, and I am  interested  to

know  what  are  the  prospects  of  completing   the

building.   Is  it  being  completed  as   originally

designed, or is Government going to change it because

of  the  different  political position  of  Singapore

today? And we do not even have a sporting stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to have the details, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member's amendment

respect of subhead 1 therein."



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, if hon. Members cannot submit

their  amendments precisely, it does probably  defeat

the purpose of putting in amendments. The information

asked for can of course be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3366</b></font><br><br>



given  them but it will be rather difficult if a  lot

of  Opposition Members put in amendments  and  it  is

found  in  fact  that  they do  not  speak  on  those

amendments but on something else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present terminal building is functioning but it

is  pretty tightly packed, with people coming in  and

out,  and  if the number of flight movements  through

the  airport continues to expand, then there will  be

congestion and delay. I think it was the hon.  Member

himself  who drew attention to the undesirability  of

letting  people  get  a bad impression  of  Singapore

because of slow handling through at the airport.  The

only  way to get them through fast is to provide more

channels   and  improve  facilities.  Therefore   the

terminal  building is a necessity.  If  there  was  a

slowing down in the development of aviation for  some

reason, the urgency would not be so great, but we are

looking to the future and, as far as I can judge  the

future,  it  is  essential. We shall be  calling  for

tenders, I hope early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the main point of the hon. Member is the

cost  of about $1 million under "Other Works". I  can

give  him  the details of that. There  is  a  sum  of

$350,000 required for fencing, turfing, levelling and

completion  of the drainage system, and miscellaneous

work of that sort. He will appreciate that there  are

very  large areas at the airport which have to be  upkept  and  maintained. This work has  been  going  on

slowly  but steadily, but there are still  some  eye-sore  patches which I hope will be less of  eye-sores

by the end of next year. Then roads and car parks are

needed, we have to get the perimeter road in and also

the  largest part of the access road to the  proposed

new  terminal building site; and then the third major

item  of  course  is  radio aids of  which  the  most

significant is the VHF omni-range beacon  which  will

probably  go  on  Lazarus  Island  although  a  final

decision  has  not been made yet. It does  require  a

level  surface on which to stand in order to operate,

and  it  is  a question of deciding where  this  high

level  sounding-off ground for this beacon should  be

placed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir, both these items relate

to Division IV quarters, item (5) to 15 at Paya Lebar

and  item  (6) to 18 at Jurong. For the  15  at  Paya

Lebar,  a  revised estimate of $90,000  is  required,

working out at $5,000 a piece.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> $6,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, I am sorry. For the 18 at

Jurong, the revised estimate is $130,000, which works

out at $7,250 a piece. There is a difference there of

$1,250  per  quarter. As the quarters at both  places

presumably  must  be from the same plan,  there  does

seem  to  be a lot of difference, and a lot of  money

involved when the total difference is 18 x $1,250.  I

would like to know what the difference is due to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to be

allotted  for Head D 59 be reduced by $10 in  respect

of  item  (5) of subhead 31 therein", and  discussion

may range over the next amendment - "That the sum to be

allotted for Head D 59 be reduced by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3368</b></font><br><br>



$10 in respect of item (6) of subhead 31 therein."



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Paya Lebar quarters of course are

still  in the planning stage and it is impossible  to

say, when we start building in 1959, what  the  cost

will  be  then. Costs did go up very heavily  earlier

this  year but they have now taken a downward  swoop.

In  fact, cement is down below what we call the  base

line,  below the 100 mark. Whether they will continue

to go down or up, or whether items will vary in 1959,

I cannot say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, there is a presumption that

anything  built in Paya Lebar will, by and large  for

an  equivalent  job,  be cheaper  than  something  at

Jurong: you have city services and that kind of thing

more  conveniently available at Paya Lebar,  and  the

further out of the City you go, the more likely  will

you  be  to  have higher costs. There is therefore  a

token provision of $1,000 extra which means that  you

will have room to change your mind if you want to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These would be the standard Division IV married

quarters. I do not know whether the hon. Member wants

to  know or not what such "quarters" comprise. I will

give  him an opportunity to ask if he wants  to  know

any more about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 60 -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head D 60 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 7 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This head relates to construction of roads, phase I,

half a million dollars. My first point is to ask  the

Minister if he would give some indication as to  what

is  intended under this particular Head and how  many

phases there will be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point I wish to refer to is the expenditure

on  roads and some of the extravagance which I  think

is  being  indulged  in and which  perhaps  could  be

saved.  I  realise of course that roads are expensive

things  in  themselves  and that  if  you  make  them

cheaply,  they fall to rack and ruin and have  to  be

repaired more often. That is not my point. I have two

points  to  make.  The  first  is  the  question   of

roundabouts.  I  have a sort of fetish  against  them

which possibly the Minister does not share, but  they

do  seem to me to be extraordinarily extravagant  not

only in the use of land, but in the cost of metalling

and the time taken to make them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is of course a fact that roundabouts are no

use unless you make them large, of a sufficient size,

to  keep  a  proper flow of traffic.  Then  they  are

ideal.  But it does seem to me, when you look at  the

roundabouts being made at the moment at the  junction

of  Thomson Road and Lornie Road, and the junction of

Upper  Thomson Road and Yio Chu Kang Road,  that  for

the  time  being when we have not all that  money  to

spend  on  these  important  things  such  as  roads,

traffic lights would be simpler and cheaper. We could

save  time and money in making these roundabouts  and

put  them to the making of other roads which are more

important. I think that would be putting first things

first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to refer to is what I

have observed recently in Mandai Road, that there has

been  a whole stretch of that road - for about a  mile-and-a-half - on  which re-turfing has taken  place.  It

has got to the extent of the old turf being taken out

of  the  edges of the road and replaced by new  turf.

Now  again  I  appreciate that what  is  intended  by

turfing  is to prevent wash aways and the  damage  to

roads that would ensue, but what has happened in this

particular  area - and it is a waste of  money - is  that

this beautiful turfing is being done at this time  of

year  when there is heavy rain almost every  day  and

that it is all being washed away almost as soon as it

is laid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3370</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, what is happening is that because the

drains  are  not properly constructed, the  labourers

are  coming along and digging out the silt  that  has

gone into it, putting it in nice piles on the top  of

the  new  turf. The piles of silt are thereby burying

the  turf, which will be destroyed quickly,  and  you

will be getting back to the same position you were in

about a month ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to go and see what is

happening. That kind of thing is of course a waste of

public  money and I would draw the attention  of  the

Minister  to these two points when he tells  us  what

this item is intended for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The vote under this sub-head is a

"notional"  vote. The fact is that we  have  not  yet

decided   finally  which  roads  ought  to   be   the

responsibility of the state or government, and  which

should be that of the local authority, and the matter

has   still   to   be  sorted  out   and   discussed.

Consequently, this vote makes provision for  work  to

be done but is not related precisely to any job which

may have to be done.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to roundabouts, I think that if you are

going  to  have one, you might as well put it  in  as

soon  as  you  have the road up to that  point.  When

making  a new road system, you might as well put  the

roundabouts in with it. One particular reason is that

corner  sites  are very popular with squatters - coffee

shop squatters - and if you leave a corner site, a  bit

of  turf at the edge of the road, you will find first

a  man  sitting there and then a concrete floor  laid

and  then a roof, and before you know where you  are,

you get somebody with the protection of some vigorous

Assemblyman  fighting for the  rights  of  the  poor:

'This  man should not be turned out without  a  large

compensation.'  The  best  thing  is   to   get   the

roundabout in first and then nobody can squat on  the

corners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the turfing in Mandai Road, I take

note  of  the hon. Member's remarks and I value  very

much  anybody who draws my attention to what  appears

to be a failure in efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Hon. the Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and Housing has had his fair share of  punches

during  this  sitting. I would like to pull  back  my

punch  if  possible, but unfortunately this item  has

given  me  a  smack  right in the eye.  In  the  last

Assembly debate on the 1957 Estimates, $5 million was

asked  for.  Now  we  have here an  explanatory  note

saying  that  the new provision is for an 11-storeyed

building.   Last  year  it  was  not  an  11-storeyed

building;  last year it was only seven  storeys.  Its

size  is now suddenly to be increased in spite of  my

protest against an already palatial building for just

one  Ministry.  The  cost is now  increased  to  $7.5

million   and   the  11-storeyed  building,   to   be

constructed on Shenton Way, is to be for the Ministry

of  Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  and  the

Ministry of Communications and Works, and departments

that come under them. Probably the extra $2.5 million

is for the second Ministry to be housed on top of the

Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing. Sir,

if  two Ministries are going to cost us $7.5 million,

heaven  help  us! I think housing all the Ministries,

if  we  go  on  at this planned rate,  will  cost  us

hundreds of millions of dollars!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I attacked this item I pointed out the

very nice and substantial buildings like those of the

Chartered  Bank in Robinson Road for $3 million,  and

of  the  Bank of China for about the same  amount.  I

cannot  possibly conceive how the two Ministries  are

going to fill three times the accommodation that  can

be  offered in the Chartered Bank with all  its  very

special   expenditure   on  safe-boxes   and   luxury

fittings. Sir, I have to ask that Ministers must come

down to earth and possibly build prefabricated little

structures  which  the Hon. the  Chief  Minister  has

promised  to  look  into and which might  suffice  in

future days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, it is not undesirable that we

should have further Government accommodation. We  are

getting overcrowded as all offices tend to expand. We

have  read about Parkinson's law that they do expand,

if  only in relation to the increasing population; we

must presumably keep on adding to the number of civil

servants  to look after the population as  it  grows.

The  Opposition, I am sure, will concede that  we  do

need  more office accommodation, and that it is  only

concerned  that we do not need to spend  as  much  as

this.  It  may  well be that this is a project  which

would  be  farmed out to a private architect  and  we

should then have a useful case for comparison and  be

able to see whether in fact a private architect could

provide  what  was required without our spending  all

the  money;  but the vote is a guess rather  than  an

estimate,  as we do not yet know precisely  what  the

cost will be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, this is the third year in

succession  that  we have heard the hon.  Member  for

Paya  Lebar give us his expert evaluation of the work

of each project. If ever I get bourgeoisie tendencies

and have to put up a magnificent building to house my

industry, I shall certainly look for the Member,  not

only  to  give  me advice, but to make sure  that  he

builds it at the figure he advised me is possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, apart from the fact that I do not think he

really  believes it can be done so cheaply,  I  would

like  to  add  my  concern that one cannot  make  the

public  believe  that  the  Public  Works  Department

exercises   all   the  economy,   skill,   care   and

supervision  in  the  world.  In  fact,  my  backseat

driver, the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis, who has some

practical experience in these matters, tells me  just

the  opposite. To that extent I am inclined to  share

the  anxieties  which the Member for Paya  Lebar  has

often  expressed  in this House. Perhaps  we  do  not

really get one dollar's worth out of every dollar  we

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move the

motion standing in my name. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the decision on major

issues  like  Malayanisation and one  and  a  quarter

million  dollars  ex-gratia  payments  made  by   the

present  City  Council during its last  few  days  of

office  and  urges  that  sanction,  as  required  by

paragraph   (r)  of  section  29  of  the   Municipal

Ordinance, to the payment of over one and  a  quarter

million  dollars  for  ex-gratia  payment  mostly  to

expatriate employees, be withheld until the new  City

Council  to  be  elected  on the  21st  December  has

reconsidered the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a typographical error in the Order Paper,

Sir.  The last part of my motion should read ".  .  .

has reconsidered" the matter, and not, as printed, ".

. . has recommended".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the days go by, we approach Christmas time,

and we all receive beautiful Christmas cards sent  by

fellow  Assemblymen to one another. I hate  to  spoil

other  people's Christmases, but whilst I would  like

to  convey  my  good  wishes for a  happy  and  merry

Christmas, I cannot be urged to join in felicitations

to  the  extent of letting pass unnoticed $1¼ million

worth  of  public  funds, most of which  will  go  to

expatriate  officers  already in  retirement  in  the

United Kingdom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two possible approaches to the

subject that I have tabled for debate today,  one  on

principle and the other on detail. Whether it  is  to

be  on principle alone or on detail and principle,  I

leave  it  to the Members on both sides of the  House

other  than those of my Party. I propose to take  the

question of principle first. If Members, particularly

those  who  are Members of the City Council  up  till

midnight,  choose to raise this matter in  detail,  I

may  inform them that I have been fairly well briefed

by local senior officers in the City Council and I am

quite prepared to go into the matter in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the one question of principle that I object

to  strenuously  is  this: that at  the  second  last

meeting on the 29th November, when almost every  City

Councillor  knew whether or not he was going  to  put

his  record of office before the electorate, and  had

decided  that  he was not going to do so,  he  joined

expatriate officers - the President of the City Council

and  his  colleagues - in bundling these two  Christmas

gifts by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we all know that elections to the City

Council  should  have been held in 1955.  The  P.A.P.

supported  the  ex-Chief Minister  when  he  moved  a

resolution that elections should be postponed so that

the  whole question of the local government structure

could   be  reviewed.  These  people  were  therefore

allowed  to  carry on, and they have carried  on  for

over  two years. Their mandate had expired. They  had

no  right to decide on major issues such as this  one

costing  millions of dollars - $1¼ in the case  of  the

additional  benefits  of  provident  fund,  and   $14

million  (in our calculation) on the other  issue  of

Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the two big issues on which there was a

lot  of  hard  argy-bargy for  a  long  time  but  no

decision was arrived at. No vote was taken until  the

Councillors  knew  that  they  were  not   contesting

elections, either because their Parties thought  they

were  too  heavy a political liability, or for  other

personal reasons. The moment they decided that  their

future was not for the public to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3375</b></font><br><br>



decide any more, since they did not think their  past

record  worth  putting  before  the  public  for  its

decision,  they passed these two big things,  and  we

strenuously object.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We object in particular to the expatriate officers

in  the  Council being not just a party to this,  but

being  the prime movers of this. They knew  that  the

next  Council is going to be radically different from

the  present one. This is a nice, cosy little set up.

We have nine nominated members, we have 18 elected on

the old basis - small little elections, 800 people were

involved;  and nice little people like - well,  I  will

not say nice little people but little people like the

hon.  Member  for Queenstown; I mean  it  depends  on

whether  one  likes him or not, but they  are  people

whom  you  can  accommodate, you could persuade,  you

could talk them round - reasonable chaps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next City Council is going to be quite a

different proposition. These officers know it and  so

do  the  Councillors. And these officers know further

that  it is very unlikely that they will get such  an

amenable  council as the present one. They are  going

to  get people who will be very sensitive to what the

public  thinks and who have very decided views  about

how  public  funds  should be  dispensed.  Therefore,

rather  than  risk the matter receiving more  careful

consideration,  and  a  final decision  by  the  real

representatives   who  will  be   elected   on   21st

December - tomorrow - they smuggled it  through  on  29th

November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have worded the motion carefully because

I  do not want to apply it to each and every case  of

those  who retired before the operative date. I think

it  was  1954 (I believe you are quite familiar  with

the  matter) - when salaries were boosted up after  the

war  and  provident fund schemes were  not  similarly

adjusted. The consequence was that those who  retired

before  that date when the provident fund scheme  was

adjusted  to fit in with the new emoluments, suffered

in  not getting the benefits of the new rates.  There

may have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3376</b></font><br><br>



been a few individual cases where, quite properly,  a

case  can  be made out under section 29  (r)  of  the

Municipal Ordinance. This section stipulates that the

Governor  in  Council - but perhaps I should  read  the

exact words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commissioners are authorized to expend the

Municipal Fund for the following purposes: -  .  .  .

(r)   payment  with  the  previous  sanction  of  the

Governor in Council in special cases of gratuities to

deserving municipal officers or workmen prior to, on,

or  after  their  retirement or to  their  widows  or

children on their death".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, people like Mr A. P. Rajah of the Liberal-Socialist Party, who gave away $50,000 to the City

Council engineer (I think it was the Chief Engineer),

and  another,  Mr Chan Kum Chee, who  voted  another

large  sum  of  money to some electrical  expert  for

stopping  the  power failures, quite wisely  did  not

offer  themselves for elections. But here  they  have

the  impudence, these Councillors as a whole have the

impudence,  not to consider, according to section  29

(r) , each individual officer's case to see whether or

not any injustice was made or had been inflicted in a

particular case, but to make a blanket payment of $1¼

million. If they want to give away their own money it

is  their  funeral, but this happens to be our  money

and  it  is our business. We in this Chamber  have  a

right  to  urge  the  Government  not  to  give  this

sanction,  as the City Council is required under  the

Municipal   Ordinance  to  get  sanction   from   the

Executive Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that is a nice legal point. This Ordinance

will expire by tomorrow, and the question is: Can the

Government  under  the new Ordinance  give  sanction,

because  the new Ordinance does not contain a similar

proviso?  In  my opinion, there is not the  slightest

doubt whatsoever that if this is not done before  the

21st  December - before midnight tonight - then it cannot

be  done  at all. But if my view happens to be  wrong

and another view is established that the sanction can

be given even after the Ordinance is repealed, then I

say very seriously to the Government that it would be

an act of political folly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3377</b></font><br><br>



to  be  a party to this rump of local political  has-beens, and give away this amount of public money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been careful, Sir, in my drafting of the

motion  not  to say that this is wrong in  each  and

every  case.  There may have been some special  cases

where  an  injustice  might have  been  done,  but  a

blanket  provision, if approved, would be a  betrayal

of  the  mandate of the people to us  to  look  after

public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I shall leave the personalities involved,

who  voted through this $1¼ million, to the  Liberal-Socialist   Party  because  it  issued  a   statement

immediately after we brought public attention to bear

on  this matter. It washed its hands completely clean

of  this. It said, 'Oh, no, we are against the  whole

business.' In fact, but for the Member for  Cairnhill

who, for some reason or other, abstained on the whole

matter  and  thereby  connived at  it,  the  Liberal-Socialists  were dead set against it.  They  did  not

approve  of this waste of public funds and  doubtless

it will be their duty to clarify their position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the more important issue, that of

Malayanisation; this is a more complex subject and  a

larger  sum of money is involved. Quite a  number  of

minds  have  been at work on this topic  for  a  long

time.  They  have  worked out a very  nice  and  very

complicated   scheme   whereby   all   City   Council

expatriate employees who are at present on  contracts

can opt to sign new contracts - type A, type B and type

C.   In short, it means money all round because there

is no reason why any contract should be renewed. They

are  not  Malayan Civil Service officers, the heaven-born   who  were  in  a  special  category.  We  were

persuaded  last  year because the Government  of  the

Federation  approved  the  abolition  terms  in   the

Federation,  not  to  attack the  Government  on  the

abolition terms offered to expatriate officers  here.

But  of course that has acted as a great stimulus  to

expatriate  officers in the Singapore Harbour  Board,

the   City  Council  and  all  other  semi-government

corporations,  to  try to get similar  or  equivalent

abolition terms. Everyone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3378</b></font><br><br>



thought  that  this was a jackpot free-for-all - just

put your hand into the kitty, grab a bagful of notes,

put them into your pocket and push off. Better still,

get   another  job  in  the  Telephone  Board  where,

subsequently,  you  might be able  to  persuade  some

stupid  members on that Board to agree  to  give  you

further abolition terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should go into this in much detail and

read  to  this House a letter which has reduced  this

complicated plot into fairly simple terms. This is  a

letter  written by the President of the Local  Senior

Officers   Association  of  the   City   Council   of

Singapore, an open letter published in the Press.  It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore City Council at its meeting on

November 29th agreed to offer expatriate officers the

option  of  continuing on the permanent establishment

on their existing terms and conditions of service, or

as  varied  by  agreements  from  time  to  time,  or

entering  into  one of the following three  forms  of

contracts  of service with the Council on  the  terms

and  conditions set out hereunder and referred to  as

contracts A, B and C."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is a fairly complicated matter to the

uninitiated. I will read a little slowly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contract A is to incorporate all the conditions of

service  applicable to all senior officers at present

and,  in  addition, to provide that  an  officer  who

resigns after five years is to be paid a lump sum  of

the  difference between the more favourable  and  the

less  favourable method of compilation for  provident

fund."-



<br><br>There are two methods of calculating provident fund,

one the more favourable, one the less favourable; the

difference  is about 30 to 40 per cent.  Sir,  if  an

officer signs contract A, stays on for five years and

resigns,  and if he himself quits - he gets this  extra

30 or 40 per cent, for no rhyme or reason whatsoever,

because in any case he is on contract. If he does not

like  it,  and  has a better job, he  goes,  as  some

officers who have better jobs have gone. To continue:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If his service is terminated by the Council"-



<br><br>and this is the other proviso, this is the other

side of this plot-



<br><br>"for any or no reason other than misconduct or ill-health"-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3379</b></font><br><br>



in  other words, you cannot sack a man other than for

misconduct   or  ill-health;  if  he   is   downright

inefficient you have to tolerate him. It is all  laid

down,  you can only sack him for misconduct  or  ill-health-



<br><br>"and he be thereby compulsorily retired"-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in other words, malayanised-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the compensation payable is to be calculated on the

following basis:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The difference as in the first paragraph above

[that is, table A and table B of the provident fund];

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Government abolition terms."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the big thing. That is what everybody is

grabbing. Expatriate officers will have written  into

their  contracts  that if any expatriate  officer  is

malayanised, then compensation is payable to all such

officers  and  provident fund benefits will  also  be

paid  in  addition. So all the officers who now  have

contracts - a  hundred odd persons - sign new  contracts.

They all sign contract A, and then if they serve five

years  and  they do not like it any more,  they  take

this extra provident fund with no abolition terms. If

they  happen to stay healthy as they are bound to  on

their  present  salary, and they  do  not  commit  an

indiscretion, then you cannot get rid of them. If you

do  get  rid of them, then they get greater benefits

of  provident  fund. This will no doubt  serve  their

five  years for abolition terms on Government  rates.

Furthermore,  if  you sack one, then  all  the  other

officers  who have signed contract A, can also  say,

"Well,  I  am  leaving  too.  Please  give  me  extra

provident fund benefits plus abolition terms."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, contract B provides for an officer who resigns:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to receive provident fund benefits according to

Table B of the Provident Fund Rules,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the less favourable one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and to sign a contract which is similar to contract

A  except in lieu of further provident fund benefits.

He  receives  an allowance equal to 20  per  cent  of

basic salary."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the important one, because I do not

think many will plump for that one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract C provides for an officer who resigns:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to receive provident fund benefits according to

Table  B  of the Provident Fund Rules and to  sign  a

short-term contract for three years' resident service

on  the  same  lines  as  the present  contracts  for

temporary   officers.  It  has   been   agreed   that

gratuities,  compensation of provident fund  payments

be made tax free."



<br><br>In  other  words, the Council pays the tax, and  they

collect.  Now, we worked out the abolition terms  and

all these people who come in will collect $50,000  or

$60,000  and that is tax free. They are not  in  that

same  privileged position because under  the  law  of

income tax, they have to pay a large slice of  it  in

income  tax.  So they providently provide  beforehand

that  on  the  sum  they are going  to  receive,  the

Council  will pay the income tax and they collect  as

much  as  they  would  have  had  if  they  were   in

Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is what the local officers have to

say on this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Council has apparently approbated its rights to

terminate  any  expatriate  officer's  contract   for

inefficiency    or    redundancy    without    paying

compensation. In times of recession, it would be less

expensive for the Council to retrench local  officers

than  expatriate officers. My Association,  [this  is

the  President's  writing] after its  representatives

had   given   evidence   before  the   Malayanisation

Commission, have not pressed the Council to implement

the  terms  of  this Commission's Report  as  it  has

viewed with concern the enormous sums of money  which

have  been  paid to expatriate officers in  Singapore

and in the Federation Government services."



<br><br>Those  praiseworthy,  public-spirited  servants!   In

Singapore, it was stated that the direct cause  of  a

deficit in 1957 - the deficit being $8 million - was that

$9 million was paid out in abolition terms. Therefore

the  conclusion we draw is that but for  that,  there

might  not  have been a deficit but a surplus  of  $1

million. This is according to the computation of  the

Hon. the Financial Secretary. I read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the opinion of the members of my Association,

these  large  sums  of money could have  been  better

spent  in  enlarging the local services  which  could

have  directly benefited the peoples of  Malaya.  The

members  of  my Association feel further that  whilst

they  hold the view that all the senior posts in  the

City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3381</b></font><br><br>



Council   can  be  fully  malayanised  with   a   few

exceptions within four years, they should  not  press

for  immediate Malayanisation if vast sums  of  money

are  to be handed out to all the Council's expatriate

officers.  This  money  could  be  better  spent   on

projects that benefit the people of Singapore."



<br><br>These are the facts briefly and succinctly stated.  I

am  quite prepared to go into further details on this

but I would like to take the matter on principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member did

anticipate the Chair when he said that he  would  not

go  into  the details but would debate the  principle

because, as I read the motion. it says,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the decisions on major

issues  like  Malayanisation and one  and  a  quarter

million  dollars  ex-gratia  payments  made  by   the

present  City  Council during its last  few  days  of

office and urges ..." etc.



<br><br>Of  course,  the hon. Member can touch on details  to

indicate  that it is, in fact, a major  issue  but  I

would not allow a debate on the issue itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, but I merely indicated that in order to

inform  all Members in this House that we are  fairly

well  briefed on the subject. I am quite prepared  to

answer any questions from our point of view regarding

the subject matter which we have tabled for debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows that over 520,000 voters are

going  to  the polls tomorrow to elect  32  new  City

Councillors.   Everybody  knows  that  the   Liberal-Socialist Party have had the impudence to put  up  32

candidates  many of whom are likely  never  again  to

contest   elections,  and  also  that  the   Liberal-Socialist Party were very anxious to wash their hands

of this matter the moment we brought the spotlight to

bear  on  it.  Sir, when they shelved off  the  extra

payment  of provident fund, they were silent  on  the

question of Malayanisation. It is necessary to remind

them that they were the prime movers. Their Mr A. P.

Rajah  who  was their leading man in the Finance  and

General  Purposes Committee was responsible for  this

whole scheme. A long time was taken to work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3382</b></font><br><br>



this  out. In his last statement, which the  national

dailies were judicious enough not to publish, because

it  probably did him more harm than good,  but  which

the not so judicious daily Free Press did publish - Mr

A. P. Rajah said that the reason why he did all this,

of course, was that he did not want to see the people

being  victimised. He is a presumptuous  man.  If  he

does not want to see anybody being victimised and  he

thinks  that  he  is the man to do justice,  then  he

should  have  come  out to fight  the  elections.  He

should  speak his Party's policy and explain  to  the

people  why he did so and so. Instead he has  decided

to  retire from politics for the time being, and  not

to  try and justify what has been done. What we would

like  to tell him and his colleagues is this. We  are

here  to  see  that the people of Singapore  are  not

victimised, and not to see that a few persons in  the

City   Council   are  not  victimised.   Nobody   is

threatening to victimise them provided they do  their

duties. We do not want to cut off our noses to  spite

ourselves  but if we feel that somebody is trying  to

pull  a fast one over us, we will cut off their noses

to   spite   themselves, even  if  we  suffer   the

consequence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in asking this House to approve this

motion,  all  I  am doing is to say that  the  matter

should  be  reconsidered by the new Council.  It  may

well be that the first new candidates of the Liberal-Socialist Party will duly assemble on Monday the 23rd

to  elect their Mayor. They will not be electing  one

who  has  been trained to be a Mayor because the  one

who  has  been  so  trained  is  not  contesting  the

elections, but if that eventuality should arise, then

so  be  it.  But the suspicion one has is  this:  the

President  of the City Council does not believe  that

they  are  going  to come in. In fact  everybody  who

knows what is going on knows that they are not coming

in  and  knows  that  these resolutions  would  never

receive  the same favoured treatment if the  question

were to be opened again. It may well be that on  the

question of the provident



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3383</b></font><br><br>



fund,  certain individual cases may have to be  taken

on their merits and justice meted out. We do not want

to  be  unjust.  It  may well be that  the  new  City

Council  may be even more stable, more in a  position

to  offer  long-term prospects of employment  and  to

keep its promise. But we do not want something to  be

bundled  through so that we who come into the Council

on  the 21st (tomorrow) and meet on the 23rd December

for  the first time are prevented from doing anything

about  these  major issues because they  are  already

fait accompli. That is the principle that I am asking

this House to join me in supporting.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar did

point  out  what he called a typographical error.  He

has   asked  that  the  word  "recommended"  be  read

his own.

<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

before this House is in two parts. The first reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House deplores the decisions on major

issues  like  Malayanisation and one  and  a  quarter

million  dollars  ex-gratia  payments  made  by   the

present  City  Council during its last  few  days  of

office."



<br><br>And the second part reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and urges that sanction, as required by paragraph

(r)  of section 29 of the Municipal Ordinance, to the

payment of over one and a quarter million dollars for

ex-gratia payment mostly to expatriate employees,  be

withheld until the new City Council to be elected  on

the 21st December has reconsidered the matter."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part, Sir, is concerned with a point of

principle,  namely  that the City  Council  has  made

decisions on important matters within a few weeks  of

the expiry of its tenure of office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> A few days, not a few weeks - 29th

to 31st.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> It is still a couple of weeks. It

is  necessary, Sir, for the purpose of debate to take

the  two  decisions separately before coming  to  any

conclusion  about  the point of  principle.  Firstly,

Malayanisation. It is I think implied in  the  motion

and  in  the  speech of the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

that  this  is a hurried decision made  at  the  last

moment and that -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not suggest for one moment

that  this  was  a hurried decision. I  suggest  that

there  has  been a long time hatching this  plot  and

that  it  has been smuggled through just  before  the

cockerels came in.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> I still think my interpretation

of  his speech is that he meant that it was a hurried

decision. I must point out, Sir, that it is not  true

that  the  decision was a hurried one. Government  is

aware  that  it has been the result of very  detailed

study  by various committees of the City Council.  It

is  a  problem which the City Council has lived  with

for a long time although I myself can say that it was

rather  unfortunate that they could not arrive  at  a

decision, say, a few months before the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the decision to make ex-gratia payments

amounting  to  about one and a quarter of  a  million

dollars, once again I know that this is not a  matter

which has been decided swiftly or hurriedly. It has a

long  history  and it has been the  subject  of  much

discussion  and  study by various  committees.  I  am

informed that it originally arose from a petition  by

ex-local employees of the City Council giving grounds

of  hardship owing to the reduced postwar  purchasing

value of the dollar. I have endeavoured to point  out

that  these two decisions were not arrived  at  in  a

hurry  and that being the case, Government therefore,

Sir,  cannot subscribe to the terms of the first part

of the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3385</b></font><br><br>



The  terms of the second part of the motion are quite

clear. It urges upon the Government that sanction  be

withheld  under paragraph (r) of section  29  of  the

Municipal   Ordinance  in  respect  of  an  ex-gratia

payment  of  about  $1¼ million. In  regard  to  this

matter, the City Council has made application to  the

Governor  in  Council  and this  application  is  at

present  under  consideration and I  cannot  at  this

stage, Sir, commit the Governor in Council for  their

views.  Government, Sir, does not have to urge itself

to do something. We either do it or we do not. If the

Opposition thinks that any urging is necessary, it is

free  to  do so but I can assure the Opposition  that

Government will take due note of their views.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had no

intention  of  speaking on this motion  when  it  was

tabled. As there is exactly 7½ hours more for  me  to

remain a City Councillor, I do not think that  it  is

right for me to speak on the motion, but after having

heard the attack of the Member for Tanjong Pagar that

all City Councillors joined in with the President and

senior  officers to approve what is contained in  the

motion before the House -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, just in case the Member for

Queenstown says a few brash remarks that he may  have

reason  to regret subsequently, I would like  to  say

that not all of them joined in this plot. If they had

all  joined in this plot, the thing would  have  been

smuggled through with such deadly silence that nobody

would  have heard about it. It is because a few birds

did make a lot of noise; they squawked away and so it

reached  half round the world and finally arrived  in

this Chamber.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3386</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member seems to

be making another speech. He could probably have said

that in reply and I think he has clarified the matter

sufficiently.  I  think the point  that  excited  the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  to  ask  for  leave   to

intervene was that the Member for Queenstown  thought

that  he  was involved in this so-called plot  and  I

think  the Member for Tanjong Pagar has said 'No'.  I

think that clarifies the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I would like to be quite

explicit   on   this  matter.  On  the  question   of

Malayanisation, I would like to say that he  was  not

involved  at  all.  He  voted  against  it,  to   his

everlasting credit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged to the hon.

Member  for  clarifying the situation.  I  thank  the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar for making it clear that  I

was  not actually involved in one of the issues. That

is why I stood up to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the thing is this. The manner in which he has

tabled  this motion shows that he is not quite  fully

aware  of  the internal affairs that went on  in  the

City  Council.  The  Minister for  Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing said that the motion appeared  to

him  to be in two parts and as it now appears  to  me

that  it is in fact two parts which is framed in  one

motion, I am at a loss to understand what the  actual

motion  is. Really I cannot understand where or  what

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar is arriving at, whether

it is Malayanisation or the provident fund. According

to the extracts he read from some information he got,

I am led to believe that it is more on Malayanisation

than on the second part of his motion. The first part

of his motion reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . decisions on major issues like

Malayanisation   and  one  and  a  quarter   million

dollars ex-gratia payments...".



<br><br>Now,  these  one  and a quarter million  dollars  ex-gratia   payments   have  got  no   connection   with

Malayanisation at all. And the second part is  clear,

as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3387</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for  Local Government,  Lands  and  Housing

pointed out just now. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the payment of over one and a quarter million

dollars  for ex-gratia payment mostly to  expatriate

employees...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there were actually two issues in the City

Council: one, Malayanisation and the other, provident

fund for those who retire after certain dates. So now

if  you  mix  both issues together, I am afraid  that

some  Members  of this Assembly will  get  themselves

confused and will not be able to cast their votes  in

the  proper way. The hon. Member (Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew)

knows  who  has voted and who has not voted  on  this

question in the City Council. Much as I would like to

explain and go into detail of the actual facts of the

two  issues - Malayanisation and provident fund - I think

I  would prefer to keep him guessing. I would like to

quote  the Hon. the Chief Minister's words, "A little

knowledge is more dangerous than to have no knowledge

at  all." Since the Member for Tanjong Pagar has only

a  little knowledge, it is rather dangerous for me to

tell  him more and so I prefer to refrain from  doing

so.



<br><br>4.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, the issue seems to

be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House deplores the decisions on major

issues...",



<br><br>and  Malayanisation and ex-gratia payments are  taken

as  examples.  I  wonder why the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  has not brought up other major issues. I  know

that  today is the eve of the City Council elections.

It  is  the  intention of the hon.  Member  that  the

Liberal-Socialists should not receive all the  credit

and  that we do not get all the votes tomorrow.  Such

an  attitude should actually be discouraged.  For  no

better  propaganda  material,  he  has  accused   the

Liberal-Socialist Party of one thing or  another  and

later  on he swallowed it all back to say, "No,  they

are  not involved. They have cleared themselves."  I

just cannot understand how the leader of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3388</b></font><br><br>



political  Party can just tell all these  half-truths

to  the people of Singapore and get away with it  and

then  come  to this Assembly to tell us, "Well,  they

have cleared themselves. We are now on this issue and

we  are now on the other issue." I think that this is

not absolutely honest.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Serangoon

should  try and contain himself. The expression  "not

absolutely honest" with reference to a Member of  the

Assembly is unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Perhaps, Sir, I -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member withdraw the

expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I withdraw it. It may not be,

Sir, that the Member for Tanjong Pagar is the only

leader of the P.A.P. There are also other leaders not

in this Assembly who spoke the same untruth and I

suppose I shall not be pulled up for applying such

remarks to such people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of the motion on the ex-gratia

payment, I shall repeat what has been said. There was

a   committee   consisting  of  the  following   City

Councillors none of whom are from our Party. They are

Mr  Sim  Beng  Seng, Mr Seet Leong Seng,  Mr  Theo

Leijssius,  Mr L. Rayner and Mrs G.C. Smith.  They

recommended  that an ex-gratia payment  amounting  to

$1,267,000  odd  be  paid  to  the  retired  officers

concerned.  Of  course, the matter  went  before  the

Finance  Committee  and for various  reasons  it  was

voted  against. Finally, it was brought up before  an

ordinary  meeting of the City Council and the  motion

for this payment was approved, but not with the votes

of  the Liberal-Socialists. All of them voted against

the  issue  with the exception of one who  abstained.

Sir, on  this matter, I believe that the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  has  said that the  Liberal-Socialist

members  have done this and that but finally he  said

that we were not involved. I would say that he should

withdraw all those things he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3389</b></font><br><br>



said.  If  he wants to quarrel with the Labour  Front

Members,  he can go ahead and quarrel with  them.  We

have no issue with them on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Malayanisation, Sir, I think that

it  was  the idea of the Member for Tanjong Pagar  to

get  rid  of  all expatriate officers from Government

service  and he advocated buying them out,  I  think,

when   the   question   of   compensation   for   the

Malayanisation of the civil service came up. He said,

"We can recover all the money from our savings and it

would be cheaper buying them out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Would the hon. Member quote me -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Only if the Member will give

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Even during this Budget debate,

Sir,  when he discovered that the interest from  this

money would not be sufficient to pay for the cost  of

Malayanisation, he advocated, "We will put up posters

outside the banks and say, 'We seize them in the name

of  the  people to pay for expatriation fees and  all

that.' "  Well  that confirms it. If he had  not  made

that previous suggestion, Sir, then he would not have

regretted  making  this  other  suggestion  in   this

Assembly. If the Government is spending $21.4 million

on Malayanisation, the City Council is following suit

in trying to get rid of their expatriates and on that

score,  Sir, unless the Member for Tanjong Pagar  can

come up with a better suggestion as to how to get rid

of them -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Serangoon

is  going  dangerously into a  debate  on  the  issue

itself. I am trying to prevent that. The issue before

the House is merely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House deplores the decisions on major

issues  like  Malayanisation and one  and  a  quarter

million  dollars  ex-gratia  payments  made  by   the

present  City  Council during its last  few  days  of

office...".



<br><br>That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Minister for Local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3390</b></font><br><br>



through  the problem for quite a long time  and  they

came  to  that  decision but I  was  saying  that  if

somebody else has no better ideas on how to go  about

it, then it should be -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It will be done after the 21st.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - done this way. So far, Sir, I

have heard no concrete suggestion as to how the thing

could best be done. This motion is on two issues tied

up  together  as one and it would be better  to  deal

with  them as two separate issues instead of one that

is bundled up to be smuggled through this Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

understand complicated matters of political plotting.

To  me  the  issue is quite simple. The  approval  of

these  two resolutions would cost the public millions

of  dollars.  I am sure, if the European officers  in

the City Council expected the next City Council to be

the same as the present one, they would not bother to

rush these two resolutions through. The President  of

the  City Council, Sir, knows that the term of office

of  his  collaborators is going to expire at midnight

tonight,  and I know that they will never be  elected

again to the City Council. Sir, I object to this kind

of  plotting.  If a thing is right, surely  the  next

City  Council will have the right to approve it. Sir,

we  have  more  than a suspicion that  the  thing  is

wrong.  So  do  the  people  of  Singapore.   It   is

important, Sir, that the people's representatives  in

the next City Council should decide what is right  or

what  is  wrong  in  the  future,  not  the  European

officers, nominated Members and political wash-outs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, when I received notice of

this  motion,  I read it through three  times  and  I

could not make out what it was. To me, it was a great

surprise that a very learned and precise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3391</b></font><br><br>



mind  could have drawn up such a motion to be  placed

before  this House. The more I thought about  it  and

the  deeper I went into it, the more I was  convinced

that  it was an attempt to confuse the issue  and  to

involve  our  Party  which has stood  honourably  and

correctly on the ex-gratia payment issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear! Then vote for it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I am glad that today the hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar at least has the decency  to

admit that he was wrong when he imputed all sorts  of

things  against us for wanting to give away  millions

of dollars. Sir, we are not concerned at all with the

ex-gratia  payment issue and we stick  to  the  stand

taken by our representatives on the City Council  and

we say they were correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of Malayanisation, Sir, we have to ask:

Who  has  brought  about this difficult  position  in

which  our country finds itself? We are in a position

where  we do not have enough technical people to  run

our  City Council services, and we may be faced  with

the possibility of so many of these people wanting to

leave  this  country  at the  very  moment  when  we

require  them,  because our  local  men  who  are  in

training  overseas  and in Singapore  are  not  quite

ready  to take over. Rather than make a mess,  surely

responsible persons must look for a way to bridge the

gap  so that we can still have the services of people

who  are  running  the very important  and  essential

public  services of Singapore until such time as  our

own  people can take over. That is exactly, Sir, what

our  City Councillors have done. They have gone  very

carefully  into  the problem without  bias  and  have

tried to take the proper attitude towards two sets of

people  with conflicting claims, and in their honesty

they  have placed before Government a scheme, and  it

is  now  for  the  Governor  in  Council  to  make  a

decision. Sir, I think our position is clear. We have

not  done anything wrong and our Party is proud  that

it  is  fielding  32  candidates  in  the  field  for

tomorrow's  elections. The hon.  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  asked  us what impudence made  us  put  in  32

candidates. I ask him, "What impudence

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you have

clearly  ruled that the debate on this motion  is  on

the question of principle and that details should  be

avoided as far as possible. Therefore, it is not  for

us  on  this  side to stand up and try to  defend  or

condemn the decisions of a lawfully constituted  body

which has come to a decision of very grave character,

particularly as the Council itself is very  concerned

with  the staffing problem of the basic services.  My

colleague  the  Minister for Local Government,  Lands

and  Housing  has said that the Government  is  aware

that  there has been no rush in the consideration  of

this  very important problem. I have personally  been

interested  in this particular problem and  have  had

discussions of an unofficial nature with  members  of

the  City Council, and I can say in all honesty  that

this matter has not been rushed nor smuggled through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the decision to make an ex-gratia

payment  of $1¼ million to ex-employees of  the  City

Council,  local and overseas, the Minister  has  said

that an application has been made to the Governor  in

Council,   and  this  application  is   still   under

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the first part of the motion, we have

made  it clear that we cannot be a party to deploring

something  which we know is not right. To the  second

part,  we  say that we cannot prevent the  Opposition

from  urging the Government to do what it thinks  the

Government should do.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is very strange, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that every time we have a live political matter

for  discussion,  very few Members  are  prepared  to

express their opinions upon it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, I would like to correct a misconception

in the minds of both the Member for Serangoon and the

Member for Paya Lebar. I would like to read them  the

P.A.P. statement on this matter, and they  will  see

that right from the word go we had our facts correct.

We condemn the City Councillors on Malayanisation and

we  condemn the whole lot of them, not just the  Lib-Soc  element, on the ex-gratia payment issue. I  have

the  statement here but I will just read the relevant

parts  to  assure the two Members that they have  not

been  misrepresented.  In fact,  the  case  has  been

presented with great vividness over a series of  mass

meetings and the people of Singapore are quite  aware

of the position. What we said is this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The P.A.P. condemns the decisions taken by the

present  City Councillors in their last few  days  of

office on important issues like Malayanisation of the

City Council and ex-gratia payment of a million and a

quarter   dollars,   mostly  to  retired   expatriate

officers. They have no right to tie the hands of  the

new  Councillors to be elected on 21st December.  The

P.A.P. does  not  consider  itself  bound  by   the

decisions of these Councillors who are so ashamed  of

their  record of office that they dare not stand  for

election."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of them are very brazen types. They have

presented  themselves for re-election  and  we  shall

know their fate tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the President and Councillors of the City

Council   try   to  rush  and  finalise   the   legal

formalities  before 21st December  and  so  deny  the

people  of  Singapore,  through  their  newly-elected

Councillors, the right to say what they  think  about

spending  millions of dollars of the people's  money,

we,  the  P.A.P., will  take  appropriate  steps  to

rescind the decisions and reopen these matters. It is

scandalous  that  this rump of local  political  has beens,  led by Liberal-Socialist A. P. Rajah,  should

decide  in  the  last  few days  of  office  that  to

malayanise the City Council in the future the  people

of   Singapore   must  pay  over  $14   million   for

compensation to expatriates and it is the  same  rump

that  has decided to give away itself. We blame  them

for  the  Malayanisation. We blame the whole  Council

for the $l¼ million."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make our position quite clear. A lot

of  issues may develop out of the stand that we  have

taken  today.  My  motion has  been  drafted  with  a

certain  amount  of care. The Member  for  Queenstown

wrote  me  a chit just now saying, "Why did  you  not

break  up the motion into two, and then I would  vote

for  one?"  It  is  clear that on the  Malayanisation

issue  he  would like to vote for it. The others  are

clear on the ex-gratia payment, except for the Member

for  Cairnhill who has very conveniently  disappeared

in  case we call a division, and therefore they would

like  to have the two issues taken separately. "I  am

really not so bad, you know. I did right in one  even

if I did not do right in the other."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are taking up this issue on the question of

principle.  We  have never suggested  that  the  City

Councillors  have  suddenly  hatched  this  plan  and

bundled it through. What we do suggest is that  there

has  been careful plotting and hatching and they have

decided  that,  as the incubator is  likely  to  pass

under new ownership on the 21st of December, they had

better hatch the egg now or it will never be hatched.

That is what we are saying - that they have no right to

do that. Now we are urging the Government not to give

sanction  under  section  29  (r)  of  the  Municipal

Ordinance,   because  they  have  to  come   to   the

Government for that sanction or the whole matter will

be   ultra  vires  and  we  will  hold  all  of  them

responsible.  We will surcharge them  and  make  them

bankrupt for paying out public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the contracts themselves, I was delighted to

hear  the Member for Paya Lebar say that he is  going

to  ask  the Government about them. Sir, we are  very

preoccupied with the elections at the moment and  our

research bureau has not had the time to look  up  the

legal  implications of these contracts. But we  will,

after this election, if any step is taken about them.

Whether  or  not  sanction is required  for  payments

other   than  what  is  already  agreed  between   an

individual officer and the Council, we say this: even

if  sanction is not required, if those contracts  are

signed  before  midnight tonight,  or  if  they  have

already been signed, then this will become a live



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3395</b></font><br><br>



issue for the next Legislative Assembly elections. If

they  are validated, then we shall make this an issue

in  the next Assembly elections - that we shall pass  a

Bill in this Assembly to rescind and render null  and

void  all  those contracts. We say this knowing  full

well  that tomorrow is Polling Day. That is the stand

we have taken before the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear the Member for Paya Lebar speak

the  truth because Mr A. P. Rajah was what they call

in  Malay "lichin" - it is like a big marble ball;  you

cannot  pick  it up because it slips away  from  your

fingers  every  time. First, they said,  "Oh,  it  is

utterly  ridiculous. Of course, the new City  Council

can  be  malayanised. It is quite untrue to say  that

they  cannot be malayanised." But today we have heard

from  the Member for Paya Lebar that the whole object

of   the   operation   is  to   put   a   ransom   on

Malayanisation.  He says the local officers  are  not

ready  and cannot take over. These technical men  are

valuable - I do not say they are not, probably many  of

them are. Therefore we shall make sure that they  are

not  got rid of by putting up this ransom. A contract

is  signed. The officer gets extra provident fund. He

is  sacked,  and  he gets abolition terms.  In  other

words,  they  are all like the armadillo - they  go  on

with  this  armour-plating. But we say quite  clearly

here   and   now  that  if  this  scheme  is   pushed

through - maybe we cannot undo it in the  City  Council

if  it is all signed, sealed and delivered before the

21st  December. But if it is done, we will wait until

August or September next year when we will come  back

here, move a Bill to rescind that and say, "That  was

an act of indecency," and scrap it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this in conclusion before I

call  a division on this matter. First, I think  they

were  just  plain stupid to do what they  have  done,

trying   to   bundle  the  thing  through.  Secondly,

whatever  merits there were in both the  issues  have

now  been  tarnished  and soiled  by  the  suspicious

manner in which the whole affair was handled. We  are

bound   to   approach  this  matter   with   a   very

considerable  degree of suspicion, to see  what  this

great  haste  was  all about. There  must  have  been

something wrong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3396</b></font><br><br>



or  the  whole  matter would not  have  been  bundled

through.  We say this: if the Liberal-Socialists  are

really against all this bundling through at the  last

moment,  then  they should vote for this  motion.  If

they are not, then vote against it, knowing full well

the consequences tomorrow. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with

considerable regret that I have to make a few remarks

on  this  motion. It has already served its  purpose.

Political Party broadcasts have already started -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member moving his motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am, Sir. Tonight is the last of

the   Political  Party  broadcasts,   but   I   shall

nevertheless  formally move to record my  disapproval

of  the  obstinate and completely indefensible  stand

taken by the Government on this matter. Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is of the opinion that political

parties   competing  in  the  present  City   Council

elections should be given time over the radio to  put

over their party programmes for the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In civilised countries where the modern conveniences

of  communication have reached the level where almost

every  other working-class home has a T.V. set,  the

work  of the politicians becomes much easier. He does

not have to shout and rant at the mass of people.  He

puts  over his programme in a quiet and friendly way.

This  motion was introduced to compel the  Government

to  acknowledge  that fact. You  will  remember,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that I first took the occasion to raise

the  matter on a motion for the adjournment.  As  the

position then was very uncertain, I decided that  the

best  thing to do was to make it go to a vote, and  I

was  quite  right.  This  is definitely  the  way  to

compete.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3398</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night the Liberal-Socialist Party had 15

minutes  of radio time. As I was travelling from  one

rally to another with my little car radio on, I heard

their Party representative say, in his best parsonic

manner,    "And    now    this   Victoria    Memorial

Hall - everybody blames the Liberal-Socialist Party for

it.  It  is very dishonest. Because we were  not  the

only  people  to  blame. The Labour Front  Government

appointed  nine people. Therefore they  are  also  to

blame for the Victoria Memorial Hall scandal." I said

to  myself, 'Fifteen minutes well spent. Proof to the

people   of   Singapore,  an   admission   from   the

representative of the Liberal-Socialist Party that it

is  responsible,  if only in part, according  to  the

admission, for waste of public funds.' And they  have

also  shown to the people of Singapore what a lot  of

intellectual duds and buffoons they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the way the democratic system should

operate. Put your programme over and if you cannot do

it,  then  perish. I cannot think of any  better  way

than to tell everybody sitting down quietly, under no

obligation  to listen, and without being able  to  do

any  greater harm than to switch the radio off if  he

does not like what he is hearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore with great regret that I find that I

need  to  set this motion down, before the wheels  of

the  Government machinery could be made to  work,  to

allow Radio Malaya to give us radio time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I formally beg to move, in order to allow other

speakers time to make whatever remarks they  like  on

this matter. But if nobody wishes to make any comment

on  what I have already stated, then I shall at  some

subsequent time beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I second

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find that

when people cannot put ideas over to the masses, then

they  want a lot of ways to try to win them, and they

ask for radio broadcasts and all that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3399</b></font><br><br>



For our Party, I think our ideas and ideals have been

well  known, and whether we have or we have not these

radio  broadcasts, we do not bother very much.  Well,

it  is  our idea that since the P.A.P. wanted  it  so

very badly, we would help them out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel that for a Member in this House to

come  over here and criticise those who have not  the

privilege  to speak in this Assembly is  not  at  all

good.  I  think if you want to criticise anybody  you

should  criticise those who are inside this House  so

that  they  have a chance to reply. In this instance,

even  on  a matter of political radio broadcasts,  he

has something to say against broadcasts by our Party.

Perhaps, Sir, the truth hurts. When other people know

that  the  ideas  and ideals of the Liberal-Socialist

Party are the best for Singapore, they feel that they

cannot  let  that  go but that they should  at  least

throw  a few stones at it. We know that ideas can  be

propagated  by action and not by just misleading  the

people  and  making them suffer for  their  political

acts, by the action of the leaders showing that  they

really care for the people and will work for them and

will  not  in any way put them into misery.  Such,  I

think,  will be a far better way of propagating  your

ideas than just asking for five-minute broadcasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have helped them and I hope they will be grateful

for our helping them out.

that  the  Government was obstinate. We explained  to

the hon. Member when he first brought this matter  to

the attention of the House that Radio Malaya is a pan-Malayan  Department  and that we  had  to  discuss  a

question   of  this  kind  of  broadcast   with   the

Federation Government. At the conclusion of the  last

sitting  of  this  Assembly, I  found  time  to  have

discussions with the Federation Prime Minister and we

came to an agreement. That agreement was conveyed  to

the  Members  of  the  Opposition  and  there  was  a

discussion  as to how best this radio time  could  be

utilised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore find it difficult to understand why the

I hope he is not doing it just because polling day is

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am sorry if I cause the

Government any embarrassment by pursuing this motion.

I  felt very strongly about it and I made my position

quite  clear to the Government that I intended to  go

through  and force this matter to a division.  It  is

vital, if we want competition of political ideas  and

political programmes, that the radio should be  given

to  the  political  parties to put  their  programmes

over.  Now,  Sir,  I  understood there  were  certain

technical difficulties with the Federation Government

but  what I objected to, was that no effort was  made

earlier to clear the position until I had to table  a

motion.  Only then was the effort made to  clear  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this should have been completely unnecessary.

When  I  raised  the matter on the  adjournment,  the

Government should have been in a position to say, 'We

are in agreement in principle and we are clearing the

position.'  I would have been satisfied. But  we  had

such  a wishy-washy answer about the position and  so

forth,  that I thought if the matter was not  pressed

hard, nothing would come out of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as for the remarks of the Member for

Serangoon,  he  said he wanted to  help  us  out.  Of

course his Party is not really keen on radio time. My

Party  representative informed me that when  all  the

Parties  met  in  Radio Malaya, the Liberal-Socialist

Party  representative said he would not know what  to

do  with  the 15 minutes and he wanted three or  four

speakers  to use them up. That is the real  truth  of

the  matter  and the people of Singapore should  know

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can cover up a lot of things by just issuing

pamphlets or leaflets. But put a man over the  radio,

put  the party programme over, and be it good, or  be

it  bad, the people are there to listen and to decide

without anybody disparaging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3401</b></font><br><br>



whatever   is   being  put  over,   without   anybody

interfering  with  your  delivery.  If  under   those

conditions  you  are not able to put  your  political

views  over, then you are not likely ever to  compete

successfully under any other condition, no matter how

favourable  they may be. If a political party  cannot

compete  on a par over the radio, then it  can  never

compete at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I should take this matter further but

will  let  it go until the vote is taken,  because  I

would like to have it established that we are of  the

opinion  that  when  political parties  contest  City

Council  elections, they should be given radio  time.

The  matter  will  arise when  the  District  Council

elections come up in March, and will arise again when

the  Legislative Assembly elections come up in August

or September. We should all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3402</b></font><br><br>



make our position quite clear and if there should  be

a  dissenting voice on this motion, then  a  division

should be called.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is of the opinion that political

parties   competing  in  the  present  City   Council

elections should be given time over the radio to  put

over their party programmes for the City Council.
