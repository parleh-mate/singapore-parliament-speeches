  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) declared that the seat of Mr M.P.D. Nair, who had been elected a nonconstituency Member of Parliament had become vacant for the reason stated; and

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) resolved that that seat be filled by Mr Tan Chee Kien of the Singapore United Front, the next succeeding candidate at the last general election, in accordance with the law.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the resolution were communicated to Mr Tan Chee Kien on 11th March, 1985.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received a letter dated 28th March 1985 from Mr Tan Chee Kien confirming that he will not be taking up the seat of non-constituency Member of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 51 B of the Parliamentary Elections Act, once Parliament had resolved in the terms of paragraph (b) of the aforementioned resolution of 8th March 1985, Mr Tan Chee Kien was deemed to be elected as a non-constituency Member of Parliament, and I take Mr Tan's letter addressed to the Speaker as a letter of resignation of his seat in Parliament.

   <b>LOW-INCOME FAMILIES</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Plans to improve their lot)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence what plans the Government has to improve the lot of families in our society whose gross income is less than $750.00 per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has asked how the Government intends to improve the lot of families in our society whose gross income is less than $750 per month. A family who earns $750 per month is not poor. It can afford to own its own 3-room HDB flat. The lot of such a family has improved as the fortunes of Singapore have risen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address at the opening of Parliament, the President said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My Government will pay particular attention to those who find it difficult to keep up with the pace of change.'
  <br>
  <br>These are the older families earning less than $500 per month and whose capacity to earn more is limited. These are the families I would regard as the relatively poor in Singapore. They form about 12% of the population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even here, we have made dramatic progress. In 1977, 475,000 persons earned less than $500 per month. In 1980, the number dropped to 400,000. In 1982, the figure dropped further to 306,000, a reduction of 36% in five years. This has been achieved through economic growth and education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic growth has been rapid - from 1974 to 1984, it has been 7.9% per year. The expanding economy meant more jobs and better wages. Everyone could move up, provided he made the efforts. The incomes of the poor went up even faster than that of the general population. In the same decade, they increased nearly twice as quickly as incomes of the average wage earner: by 4.2 times as compared to 2.4 times, in real terms. Without growth, there would have been widespread poverty in Singapore. Our Government will therefore continue to target for economic growth in the years to come.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the other key to unlock families from poverty. The better educated and trained a person is, the more productive will be the job which he can do, and the more will he earn. The statistics show this clearly. Among the poor wage earners, fully 56% have less than PSLE qualifications, while among average and above average wage earners, only 32% have less than PSLE. This is why the Government has emphasized, and will continue to emphasize, education as a means of upgrading the next generation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is of course not only a matter for the schools and the teachers. It is also a matter for the homes and the parents. Poor families with many children will have great difficulty giving all of them adequate parental care and attention. Furthermore, each child will only have a small share of the limited resources in the family. As a result, the children's school work will suffer, and so will the chances of the family making good in the next generation. This is why our Government strongly encourages poorer families not to have more than two children. The $10,000 cash grant scheme is designed with this purpose in mind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme also serves the purpose of helping poorer families own their own homes. The sum of $10,000 is more than adequate for a down-payment on a 3-room flat. Helping the poor to own their own homes is an important objective of our Government. Then they will not feel left out. Their sense of commitment and belonging to our society will increase. Their children will have a better environment to grow up in.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the cash grant scheme, the HDB is considering making it easier for the poor to buy flats. At present, applicants of HDB home ownership flats are required to pay a 20% down-payment at the time of application. The HDB is considering reducing the down-payment to 5% for tenants of HDB rental blocks, if they buy a 4-room Simplified or smaller flats. If the tenants wish to buy a 4-room Model A or bigger flats, the down-payment will be 10%, with another 10% payable upon allocation of flats. The HDB will grant loans to the buyers for the remaining sum. It will also increase the maximum repayment period, from the present limit of 20 years, to 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the easier repayment terms, the families will have to earn enough income to pay for the flats. One way to increase the family income is for both husband and wife to work. Many wives from poorer families presently do not work. They cannot afford to pay for child care services. To help them to do so, the Ministry of Community Development is embarking on a programme to provide more child care centres in housing estates at affordable prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> $150.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Then mothers can leave their children in good hands while they work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's approach to the problem of the poor is therefore high economic growth, universal education and skill training, small families, home ownership, and working wives. It has in large measure succeeded, although it has not eliminated poverty altogether. Our experience has confirmed that welfare and generous handouts are not the solution to the problem.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, does the First Deputy Prime Minister appreciate that he has not really added very much more to what was said by his junior Minister, the Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry, when he spoke at Guild House sometime ago? Would the First Deputy Prime Minister say whether the Minister of State was speaking on behalf of the Government when he said that the eradication of poverty must remain a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> mirage? Is this Government resigned to poverty in Singapore for a section of its people?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry is a member of this Government. His views are therefore not just personal views, but views which reflect the thinking and the philosophy of the Government. I do not believe when he said that the eradication of poverty is a mirage, he meant that we are not making the effort to eradicate poverty. What he meant, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that it is not possible in any society to totally eradicate poverty. We can make all the effort to improve the lot of the lower-income group, but the reality is, no matter what we do, there will always be a group of people who remain relatively poor in our society, and in any country for that matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the United States for that matter. The US has been trying to eradicate poverty with welfare programmes, food stamps for the poor, welfare payments for the aged, but has it succeeded in totally eradicating poverty? And the United States is a much wealthier society than Singapore. We will make the effort. We will try to the best of our ability to keep the number as low as possible. But we have to be realistic. It is not possible to totally eliminate poverty from any society.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do I then understand the First Deputy Prime Minister to say that the Government is resigned to poverty in Singapore? Does he not think that the duty of any socialist government is to commit itself to the eradication of poverty? Am I to understand that this Government does not propose to commit itself?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I ask the First Deputy Prime Minister, when he says that education is the key, what steps the Government is taking to provide better education for the children from these poor families? Would the Government consider my suggestion in this House in the debate on the President's Address to give child allowances to children from these poor families who are in primary schools or secondary schools so that they could better their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> education in the schools by the provision of more reading books and other aids?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson should have listened carefully to my reply. As a Government, we are committed to improving the lot of all Singaporeans. And as stated in the President's Address, we will pay special attention to those who are not able to keep pace with the economic progress of Singapore. When I said that we could not totally eradicate poverty, I also said that we have to be realistic. As a Government, we are committed to improving the lot of these people, but do not expect that total eradication of poverty can be achieved.

  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> No society has done so and I hope that the Member for Anson would be able to tell us how this can be done in Singapore. We have been asking him for his programme of action on many things.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why don't you resign?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> So why not tell us in due course how he plans to totally eradicate poverty in Singapore? If he has a solution, he should in fact tell it to us.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> It is a secret plan!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Then he can be sure of winning the votes of the poor. But if he is unable to come out with any solution, then he should listen to us. Our means of reducing poverty in Singapore is through education, economic growth and a few specific programmes to help them, as I have mentioned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has suggested giving child allowances to help children from poorer families to buy books for their education. It is not necessary for us to provide cash grants in the form of child allowances to such families. School fees are free. The miscellaneous charges are minimal. And any poor family can always apply to the Education Ministry for bursaries, for textbook grants. The schools have adequate facilities in the form of books, libraries,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> teaching aids, to help these children. There is no need for any special child allowances for these families. You cannot eradicate poverty by giving allowances, hand-outs to poor families, as proven in programmes elsewhere. In the United States, hand-outs create more poverty. They do not solve the problem of the poor.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is it not true that children who could not afford to pay for textbooks could apply to the .Education Ministry and they would get free textbooks?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He has answered it. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the First Deputy Prime Minister say how the provision of $10,000 which is to enable the HDB to get rid of its houses, would enable the children of these poor families to be better educated, if he says, and quite rightly, that the only way to lift them out of this poverty is through education?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, they are actually two separate issues. First, on the education of children from poor families. No child in Singapore is prevented from attending school simply because he is unable to pay. Nobody in Singapore is denied an education, just because he is poor. A child coming from a poor familiy can apply to the school for free textbooks and for other financial assistance. So education should not be confused with this cash grant scheme of $10,000 to help the family to improve their home environment. The cash grant will enable poor families to upgrade from congested old rental blocks to a better environment. And with a small family living in a better environment, the parents can devote greater attention to the children, give them more resources, and a better environment for the children to spend time on their studies. With the financial assistance given by the Education Ministry, they can hopefully proceed beyond PSLE, go on to the 'O' level, and for some of them, even to the Universities.

  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, the proposal to build funeral parlours in HDB estates is still being studied by the HDB. The HDB will take into account the sensitivities of residents to this new concept when finalizing the policy. Unlike traditional funeral parlours in Chinatown, funeral parlours in HDB estates, if built, will be self-contained, air-conditioned buildings sited away from apartment blocks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view of the funeral parlours from apartment blocks will also be adequately screened. Funeral rites will be totally confined within the building to prevent disturbance to the neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan to build a funeral parlour at Clementi Avenue 6 has been deferred pending a policy decision on the matter.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have earlier circulated to hon. Members a statistical table (Cols. 93 - 94) showing evidence of land value. The table lists ransactions of private residential land in areas comparable to Potong Pasir between March 1981 and March 1984. Based on the evidence, the land at Potong Pasir which as a permitted planning density of 706 pph, has been very conservatively valued at $1,500 psm.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1985/19850514/19850514-HA-0460093.htm">table - EVIDENCE OF LAND VALUE (Cols. 93 - 94)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the Government sold the land for Potong Pasir Estate, it would have fetched $1,500 psm. The imputed land cost for Potong Pasir Estate is therefore $255,356,800. In addition to the building cost, the HDB incurred the following costs in the development of Potong Pasir:
  <pre>

   Infrastructural Cost      - $7,490,500



   Professional and          - $5,083,300

     Administrative

     Overheads



   Financing Cost            - $10,144,700

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total development cost, inclusive of land cost, was thus $454,765,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total proceeds from the sale of the 3,634 flats was only $228,380,000. Therefore, the Government subsidy for the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> development of Potong Pasir Estate amounted to $226,385,000. This works out to a subsidy per flat of $62,296 or 99% of its purchase price.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's policy to keep public housing at prices within the reach of Singaporeans. However, even if the Government continues to provide heavy subsidies for public housing, the present pace of building 40,000 new dwelling units a year cannot be sustained indefinitely. The simple reason is that Singapore has only a finite land area. At the present pace of construction, all available land for 400,000 units of public housing will be exhausted in 10 years' time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These additional 400,000 units plus the rebuilding of the older HDB rental blocks can provide enough units to meet the Government's aim of a 100% house ownership society. However, when the land bank is used up, and Singapore has to depend on land obtained from the demolition and rebuilding of old HDB blocks or other built-up properties, the prices of flats will rise steeply. In other words, those who come on to the housing market after the land bank is. used up, must either inherit a flat from their parents, or buy an existing flat at free market prices then prevailing. The question Singaporeans face is how to modulate or moderate this transition from very heavily subsidized HDB prices to free market prices after all land which is available for public housing is used up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is being studied by a Ministerial Committee, comprising Mr Dhanabalan, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, Dr Yeo Ning Hong and myself.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Supplementary questions, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I see it, the figures given by the Minister from the successful awards are in fact very much lower than the prices of flats sold at Potong Pasir. A 3-room flat is sold at $52,200; a 4-room flat is sold at $59,600; a 5-room flat is sold at $115,700; and an Executive Apartment is sold at $145,600. These prices are way above the prices of the 'successful awards quoted by the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, as regards his -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> What is your first question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The first question is, therefore, the construction cost is in fact lower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> It is not complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is it not true then that the construction costs of these flats are in fact much lower than the prices quoted by the HDB?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is on the various costs, ie, the infrastructural cost, professional fee, financing cost, the total development cost. Could the Minister give a breakdown of the cost per unit of flat in regard to all these additional costs?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third supplementary question is: have these figures been verified, checked and certified by the Auditor-General or are they the figures of the HDB? In fact, I have other questions but, for the time being, I think these three questions will be sufficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it appears that the Member for Potong Pasir has only absorbed part of my answer which I gave just now, ie, on the construction cost, and he appears not to have absorbed the other parts. In the building industry, the total cost, as I have stated in my answer, is the structural cost, the land cost, the infrastructural cost, the financing cost, the professional fees. These added together form the total cost of the flat. If he is just taking part of the costs, then it does not constitute the total cost. It is just like when a person is going to buy a motor-car, say, a Mercedes-Benz 190. He asks the salesman of the firm, Cycle &amp; Carriage, which sells the car, "What is the cost of these four tyres?" The salesman says, "These four tyres cost $600." Then he says, "This is most unreasonable. The tyres cost $600. How can you sell the car for $100,000?"
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, will the Minister please answer the first question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Please remain seated, Mr Chiam.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> I am answering the question. I am just illustrating that if a person is asking for the cost of a car, it must be the cost of the whole car and not just the cost of the four tyres. So if the Member for Potong Pasir is asking for the cost of the flat, as I have stated here, it must be the construction cost, the infrastructural cost, the financing cost, the professional fees and, most important of all, the land cost. I have added up all the costs for him to show that the subsidy is extremely heavy because the subsidy provided by the HDB constitutes 99% of the selling price of the flat. I have stated this very clearly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question about individual unit cost -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered the first question, whether or not the construction cost is in fact lower than the selling prices of the flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, will you please resume your seat and allow the Minister to give his reply? If you are not satisfied, you may pose another supplementary question. Carry on, Mr Teh.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have answered the question quite clearly. When a person buys a car, he does not just ask for the price of the four tyres. He asks for the price of the whole car.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You keep on repeating.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Because the hon. Member for Potong Pasir repeats the question and I have to repeat the same answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Construction cost is higher than the selling prices of flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Construction cost is higher than the selling prices of flats. Of course, and if the Member for Potong Pasir adds the other costs, it would be much higher. It is just like when a person is buying a flat from any private developer. He cannot ask the private developer what is the structural cost of the flat. Of course, the private developer will say, "No. My cost is not just for the structure alone. It must include the architect's fee. It must
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> include the infrastructural cost. It must include land cost and it must include my financing cost. That is my total cost."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am talking about construction cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> The Member for Potong Pasir is talking about construction cost. He cannot buy a flat without the infrastructure, without the architect preparing the plan, without the land. What is he buying? He must buy the flat with the whole infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Buy a piece of land.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> The second point is about the unit cost. I can apportion the unit cost for the Member for Potong Pasir. Or he can work it out himself. It is the total cost divided by the number of units. If he wants the cost of each individual unit, I can apportion it out and I can send it to him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point about whether or not HDB's accounts are audited by the Auditor-General, the answer is yes. Every Annual Report of the HDB must be audited by the Auditor-General. In fact, all the Members in this House have received a copy of HDB's Annual Report. In the Report there is a statement of accounts which is properly audited and certified by the Auditor-General. My answer to his third question is yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, am I correct in drawing the following inference from the Minister's figures? Of the total proceeds of $228.3 million from the sale of flats at Potong Pasir, $176.6 million is actual construction cost, $23.3 million constitutes the infrastructural, professional, administrative and financing costs, which make a total of almost $200 million, which leaves $28.4 million for imputed land costs. And this figure of $28.4 million, compared with the actual conservative market value or cost of the land of $255 million, is only 10% of the actual market value? In other words, the Government is, in effect, subsidizing 90% or more of the land cost itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer to the Member for Whampoa is yes.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister has said in this House that the construction cost of the HDB flat is in fact higher than the selling prices of the flats. If I remember correctly, during the Budget debate, there was an allocation of $5.149 billion for the HDB and, out of that, $149 million was given as grants to the HDB. In other words it is a gift to the HDB. If this grant is given other than for development, can the Minister tell this House what is this grant for? Is it not for professional fee, for the infrastructural cost and for other expenses in running the HDB? Therefore, can he take into account all these other costs?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: can he define exactly what is construction cost?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it appears that the Member for Potong Pasir has not read or does not understand the accounts. The Annual Report shows quite clearly how this grant or Government subsidy is arrived at. In the old accounting system, the HDB usually incurs a deficit. In other words, the HDB's income is less than its expenditure and the deficit is being subsidized by Government in the form of a grant. This is the grant given annually by the Government when the HDB suffers a deficit in its income and expenditure. If the Member for Potong Pasir does not quite understand this grant, I would suggest that he goes back and read the HDB's accounts.
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am not asking for myself. It is for thousands of my constituents.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Since the Member has some accountants, if I remember correctly reading it in the papers, assisting him on the preparation of the 19 conditions which he sent to me, they would be able to enlighten the Member for Potong Pasir how that subsidy has been arrived at. Very simply, the housing subsidy granted by the Government is the difference between the income and the expenditure in the HDB's accounts.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government is concerned at all times to ensure that we have a prosperous and thriving economy. As I said in the Budget Statement, I expect this year, 1985, to be a somewhat more difficult year than 1984. But our economic structure is a strong and resilient one, and I do not expect any serious damage to occur to any sector of our economy. We have had four exceptional years of strong growth. During the first quarter of this year, economic growth in the United States was slow, at 1.3%, and we may expect that the effects will carry over to countries like Singapore. I think that the measures which we should take in order to combat the recession this year should be designed to ensure that our economy is strengthened for the long term. This means a more competitive structure, a lower level of costs, better training, and such assistance as would be compatible with our aim of upgrading our economy and bringing it to a higher level. After this period has passed, our economy will be stronger, fitter, and we will get back on the path of rapid growth.

  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, taxi driver's vocational licences are issued to enable holders to drive taxis for a living. In the past, because of limited training resources and an overwhelming number of applicants, it was necessary for the ROV to train only those who were most likely to drive taxis after being issued with taxi driver's vocational licences. Therefore, starting from 1979, the ROV ceased accepting applications from Government employees as they are not

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> allowed to take on a second job. Those who had previously been issued with taxi driver's vocational licences were allowed to retain their licences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know the number of taxi drivers who are currently employees of Government and statutory boards as the ROV does not keep a separate record for this particular group of taxi drivers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1985, in a move towards greater privatization, the Ministry has authorized NTUC Comfort and the Singapore Commuters Pte Ltd to conduct training courses for taxi drivers in order to accelerate the training of taxi drivers. Applications are currently open to anyone who meets the basic requirements for the licence.

   <b>NEW TAXI FARE STRUCTURE</b>

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence, in view of the substantial drop in demand for taxis after the introduction of the new fare structure and the consequent reduction of income of taxi drivers, if the Minister will consider revising the fare structure after taking into consideration the views and suggestions of taxi drivers and operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, last year, as Members will recall, the taxi situation in Singapore was one of excessive demand for taxis. Commuters complained about long waiting times, about long queues, and time wasted waiting for taxis. They also complained about choosy drivers who refused to stop or refused to take them to their destinations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, taxi drivers also asked for fare increases. As a result of this, the Ministry decided last year to increase taxi fares to resolve these problems. We allowed for the passenger demand for taxis to drop by about 30% initially, and then recover to about 15% to 20% over a two-month period. Under those circumstances, taxi drivers would have been able to pay the diesel tax to be implemented in October, and still have an increase in take-home pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it turned out, the drop in demand was greater than expected. In response to a request from NTUC Comfort on behalf of taxi drivers, my Ministry agreed to a 20% discount on the new fares. This has helped to improve passenger demand for taxis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fare increase has achieved the objectives of reducing excessive passenger demand due to unrealistically low fares, and has improved the level of taxi service all round. However, contrary to expectation, taxi drivers were unable to increase their take-home pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC Comfort has been discussing with their drivers and representatives regarding more appropriate fare structures. NTUC Comfort has also exchanged views with other taxi operators and companies. When the various taxi companies and associations have finalized their proposals for a new fare structure, my Ministry will give their proposals full consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as possible, taxi fares, like prices for goods and services in other sectors of the economy, are best determined by market forces. Therefore, taxi fares should be determined by taxi companies and associations. They will of course have to assess consumer demand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's role must be to ensure, firstly, a reasonable and competitive level of taxi service to serve the segment of our population that does not own cars and uses taxis occasionally and selectively; secondly, that the increase in the number of taxis does not contribute to excessive traffic jams; and, thirdly, that fares are common among different taxi operators so that a commuter knows what fare he has to pay when he steps into the taxi.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have informed the House on 21st March this year, my Ministry will continue to monitor closely the travel pattern in taxis in the coming months. I shall review the overall position closer to October, and if necessary, I shall take up the matter of diesel tax with the Minister for Finance.

Notwithstanding this, my Ministry will ensure that the quality of bus service continues to improve.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information on Government policies and programmes is best disseminated through the existing mass media, ie, the SBC and the local newspapers, which reach almost everyone in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important task is for the Government information service as well as individual Ministries to provide the mass media with information presented in a timely and interesting manner.

  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the debate on the estimates of the Ministry of Education on 25th March 1985, I informed Members that I would recommend to Cabinet that the priority scheme for graduate mothers for Pre-Primary and Primary 1 registration should be abolished and the guidelines for this year's Pre-Primary and Primary 1 Registration exercise be modelled along the lines of the 1982 guidelines which, in my opinion, are the fairest and the most satisfactory.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to inform Members that Cabinet has accepted my recommendation, Subject to past Government commitments, the Ministry of Education will use the 1982 system to register children for admission to Pre-Primary and Primary I classes in 1986. This system is set out in Annex I (Cols. 95 - 96) which, with your permission, Sir, I will now ask the Clerk to distribute to Members. [Copies of document distributed to Members.] The actual dates for the various phases of the registration exercise will be announced by the Ministry of Education early next month.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I consider the 1982 system to be the fairest and the most satisfactory is because this system gives
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> priority to the interest of the child. For example, the desirability of having siblings studying in the same school is recognized by giving such children top priority under Phase 1. The importance of preserving alma mater or religious ties is catered for under Phase IIA and Phase IIB. The remaining phases follow exactly the criteria used in the 1982 registration scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my speech of 25th March, I stated that commitments made by the Government in previous registration exercises should be honoured. In my view, this is only fair. You cannot change the rules when the runner is half-way through the race.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children of graduate mothers who gave birth to their second or subsequent child will therefore not lose the priority (Phase 1) they enjoyed in the 1984 scheme provided that the second or subsequent child was conceived between the 24th January 1984 (the date of announcement of the 1984 registration scheme) and today's date, the 14th May 1985. Giving an allowance of one month for pre-mature deliveries and one month for late deliveries, the second or subsequent child would be born between the 24th September 1984 and the 14th March 1986 (both dates inclusive).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, children from three-child families where one of the parents has at least one 'A' level pass or the equivalent will qualify for Phase llA provided that the third child is born between the 24th September 1984 and the 14th March 1986 (both dates inclusive).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children from 2-child or 3-child families where one of the parents has at least 3 'O' level passes (obtained at one sitting) or the equivalent will qualify for Phase IIB provided again that the second or third child is born between the 24th September 1984 and the 14th March 1986 (both dates inclusive).

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards sterilization cases, Government will also honour its 1984 commitment so that children from families where one of the parents has been sterilized on or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> before the 24th January 1984 after the birth of the first or second child, will qualify for registration under Phase IIA. As in the 1984 scheme, if the parent was sterilized after the 24th January 1984 after the birth of the first or second child, then the child will qualify for Phase IIA only if both parents do not have any 'O' level pass.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated numbers of children who will be involved in each phase are shown in Annex II (Cols. 97 - 98), which is already with Members.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1985 Registration Scheme is not perfect. Nor is it as neat and as tidy as I would have liked. But I believe that Government has a duty to be fair, not only to present and future generations of parents and children but also to those children whose parents have undertaken action as a result of announced Government policies. In framing the 1985 Registration Scheme, my officials and I in the Ministry of Education have endeavoured to keep the interest of the child in the forefront and to discharge our duty as fairly as we can.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Changkat):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a question for the Minister. Can the Minister assure the House that every child who is eligible for a Primary 1 registration will have a place eventually?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as Members will see from Annex 11, there will be an estimated 41,100 children who will be eligible to register for Pre-Primary and Primary 1 classes in 1986. There are slightly over 42,000 places available. So every child who is eligible to register for Primary 1 in 1986 is assured of a place.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Clementi):</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister whether a child who stays near a school will be given a higher priority for registration?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the answer is yes. If the number of applications in any phase exceeds the number of places, then priority will be given to those children whose homes lie within two kilometres of his school of choice.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the difference is a very small one, but a very significant one, In the 1983 scheme, priority under Phase 1, Phase IIA and Phase IIB for siblings or for children whose parents are connected with the school is given only up to the second child. In the 1982 scheme this priority is also given to the third child and I think that it is more desirable.

   <b>REQUISITION OF RESOURCES BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>12.12 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a national emergency, we must mobilize all the resources at our disposal to combat the danger. We cannot afford to leave idle any equipment or facilities which can be useful in the struggle for national survival. Many of these resources can be found in the civil economy, in private hands: vehicles, aircraft, ships, hospitals, warehouses, even land. In
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> peacetime, they are properly and productively employed for economic purposes. In an emergency, they must be requisitioned and committed to the areas of greatest national need. Hence, the requirement for this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A military threat would be the chief example of a national emergency, and in war the SAF would be the major user of requisitioned resources. This is especially so because of our National Service system, with the bulk of our strength in the reserves. Our reserve formations are fully equipped with a complete complement of weapons, ammunition, and military vehicles. These items are not used in peace-time training, but are kept in cold storage, in a high state of readiness, to await mobilization. Maintaining such emergency stores is expensive, but for military equipment and ammunition, there is no other way. However, the SAF also has a large requirement for civilian equipment: engineer plant like bulldozers and shovels for constructing fortifications and roads, and vehicles for carrying logistics supplies, ferrying troops or evacuating casualties. Ordinary trucks, buses and ambulances fulfil this role adequately. For such vehicles, it would be wasteful to keep a duplicate set of what private owners already possess. Far better to rely on requisition than on storage, provided requisitioning can be rapid and reliable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, war is not the only contingency, and the SAF is not the only user of civil resources. After a civil disaster, hospitals, ambulances, excavators, even buildings to house the homeless, may be needed for rescue operations. And of course in war, the SAF is only the military arm of the Total Defence effort. Civil defence and essential services will have to be carried out, under difficult conditions. This will require a broad range of resources. The state will not only need equipment and land, but will also have to call on undertakings and individuals to render services. For example, it would be of little use to requisition an aircraft without requisitioning also the services of its pilot and its crew. The Bill provides for all these requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the requisitioning process is to function well in a crisis, much work must be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> carried out in peacetime. Records must be kept of where the civil resources are, what condition they are in, who owns them, who operates them. These records have to be verified by periodic inspections of the resources. Equipment which is predesignated for a specific purpose may need to be modified to suit special requirements. For example, a bus which is meant to be used as an ambulance may need brackets installed in peacetime for mounting stretchers and drip sets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important peacetime requirement, however, is to exercise the civil resource requisitioning system, iron out the bugs, and ensure that everyone involved knows exactly what he has to do. This is especially critical for equipment which has been earmarked for the SAF. We can mobilize our reservist soldiers, and equip them, within 30 hours using silent mobilization, and in less time using open mobilization. We must be able to mobilize resources as quickly as we can mobilize reservists. This means a very slick and well-oiled requisition process which is impossible if the process has not been exercised. To authorize these peacetime activities, legislation is needed now. It would not be feasible to depend on emergency legislation, introduced only after a crisis has broken out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources and services requisitioned must, of course, be paid for, quickly and fairly. This is so both for peacetime exercises, and for wartime operations. The principle adopted in the Bill is that compensation will be according to market rates at the time of requisition. For vehicles, vessels and aircraft, this would be the prevailing rates of charter or hire, for buildings the rental value, for goods the purchase or sale price, for undertakings a reasonable remuneration, and for services of individuals their previous income. Such individuals shall be deemed Government servants and also receive disability payments for any injury or death sustained by them. If the resource is damaged or totally lost whilst it is under requisition, which is quite possible, especially in war, the damage or loss will also be compensated. In case the owner and the appointed Com-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pensation Office disagree over the amount of compensation, the dispute will be referred to a Compensation Board set up to adjudicate the claims. The Board will have a Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, who shall be persons qualified to be District Judges, plus two other members, and the decisions of the Board shall be final.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requisition of resources cannot, however, be done willy-nilly. Clause 2 of the Bill specifies the circumstances under which requisitioning can take place. The Minister for Defence must be satisfied that it is necessary:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for the securing of the public safety or the defence of the country, or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community, or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for the conduct of exercises for any of the aforesaid purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is satisfied, he may then by order direct all or any provisions of Part Ill of the Bill, which is the part dealing with the Requisitioning of Property and Services, to come into operation. His order cannot be for more than seven days. Beyond that, the approval of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, is required. In comparison, in Britain, the Secretary of State for Defence can order the requisitioning of vehicles and billeting for one month. In Israel, the Minister for Defence can order the mobilization of equipment up to 14 days. Our legislation is therefore more restrictive than the equivalent British and Israeli legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill authorizes the requisitioning of property and services, the payment of compensation, and the establishment of Compensation Boards to determine disputes. It also authorizes criminal sanctions and powers of arrest against individuals who fail to comply with the requirements of the Act. The maximum penalty provided is a fine of $10,000, or imprisonment for two years, or both.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these penalties are meant to be invoked only as a last resort, Fundamentally, requisition of resources depends on the willing cooperation of the people. If this is not forthcoming, then the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government might as well fall back on commandeering resources, which means for vehicles setting up road blocks and waylaying any suitable trucks or buses which happen to come by. This would be arbitrary, inequitable, and ineffective, which is why the Government is making a vigorous effort to publicize the Bill, to educate the public, and to seek the views of the wide range of people affected by its provisions: employers, owners, operators of resources, their views on the fairness of the compensation rules and the practicality of the mobilization procedures. Hence, the intention to refer the Bill to a Select Committee after the Second Reading.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have made a success of our National Service system. People yield their sons, brothers, and husbands to the SAF, to put their lives at risk in the defence of the nation. There is no reason why they should not yield their vehicles, property, services, for the same cause, equally willingly. I have every confidence that Singaporeans will indeed do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,
  <br>12.22 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Party has no quarrel with the principle of this Bill. We are second to none committed to the defence of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> There has been no quarrel about that, no doubt about that, in spite of many attempts by the Ministers on the other side to try and make out that we are less than committed. There has been no doubt about that although the Minister of State sometime ago, in a patronizing manner, said that the Workers' Party would now appear to be agreed on the essentials of defence. May I say that there has never been any doubt about that. But that does not mean that we do not question the cost-effectiveness of the measures taken by the Government or the powers that the Government proposes to exercise, even when it comes to a question of defence of the country and it is to this that I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> wish to address myself, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill does not, as I see it, make any distinction between a state of war in which the country is engaged and peacetime. May I know whether these provisions are intended to apply in a state of war? I should have thought that would not be necessary because the measures could be provided for by a special proclamation or order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this Bill is intended to apply in peacetime, I am a bit concerned about the powers that have been given. Sub-clause (2) of clause 2 of the Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, gives the Minister - I take it, the Minister for Defence - power to bring into operation Part Ill of this Bill which relates to requisitioning of property and services and he may do that if it appears to him that,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'it is necessary for the securing of the public safety or the defence of the country or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community or for the conduct of exercises for any of the aforesaid purposes.'
  <br>
  <br>We agree that if it is essential for the life of the community that certain requisite things should be requisitioned, so be it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we are concerned about is the sole discretion given to the Minister. I note what the Minister of State said that the Minister's order is subject to the President's sanction within seven days. The Minister of State said that the powers here are more limited than the powers in the United Kingdom legislation. Is he quite right on that? Because my understanding of the UK Act is that the Secretary of State for Defence is required immediately to report any order made by him to Parliament so that Parliament and the people of the country are informed of the need and the reasons for bringing the relevant Part into operation. What is more, that order will not continue for more than a month unless Parliament has, by resolution, agreed to its continuance for more than a month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there the effective control is laid where it should be, with Parliament. And here in this Bill, I see no reference at all being
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> made to Parliament. Should the people not be informed of the reason and need for the order? Should the people not be informed if there is a threat to their security? And what better place for them to be informed than in Parliament? So I would ask the Minister of State to say why it has been thought necessary to bypass Parliament in this very important operation, ie, the giving of drastic powers to the Minister. I should have thought that clause 2(3) should have read, "An order shall not be in force for a period exceeding 7 days (or 14 days) unless Parliament by resolution approves the continuance of that order." I would ask the Minister or the Government to give serious consideration to this. We, who believe in parliamentary democracy or we claim to believe in parliamentary democracy, must honour that belief and we must allow Parliament to be informed and, as I said before, it is not Parliament, it is the people who are informed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we come to the administration of this Act. Once the Minister brings Part Ill into operation, any person or persons named by him or by office to be the competent authority can exercise the powers given under Part III of this Bill. It says, "any person or persons by name or by office" may be appointed as the competent authority. There is no clarification in this Bill as to who this person or persons may be. In the UK Act, they are spelt out as to which person or persons may exercise the powers. Here, this is left at large. Is that satisfactory? I would ask that the person or persons who may exercise the powers be clearly spelt out in this Bill now so that we know who can exercise the powers and who cannot.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand why it is necessary, if it is in peacetime, for payment to be made cumbersome by persons having to make applications for payment to the Compensation Board. Again, since the UK Act has been referred to, may I ask the Minister of State whether he is not aware that in the United Kingdom, the practice is for payment to be made immediately at commercial rates. There should be no difficulty in determining what the rates are for hire of a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> vehicle, lorry, bus, have it whatever you want. So what is the difficulty about making payment at commercial rates? What is the need for the cumbersome procedure of a Compensation Board? I understand that in UK, the Compensation Board only comes into play during a time of war, and not in peacetime. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that in peacetime, if it is necessary that we should requisition chattels from our people, they should be paid immediately. I understood from the Minister of State that this order may even be made for exercise purposes, just to see how efficiently things can be mobilized. All the more reason that payment should not be made months later, but that payments should be made immediately.
  <br>12.30 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Are there any other Members who wish to speak before I call on the Minister of State to reply?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Requisition of Resources Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The build-up of our citizens' army started in August 1967 with the first batch of 9,000 national servicemen. In the early years of the build-up of the Singapore Armed Forces, much effort was placed on formulating policies for the development of the Army, Navy and Air Force. There was heavy expenditure on capital investment, in buildings, acquisition of military hardware, and the training of a pioneer core of officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, our first Brigade of 3,000 men was formed. In 1972, our first Division of 10,000 men was formed. Today, we have already in force three Divisions to meet any threat to our security. The SAF Support Arms, the Artillery Armour and Engineers, and our Navy and Air Force are well established. We have a ready reserve force of 200,000 men with the hardware to equip each and every soldier. In 1982, Mindef carefully thought through the concept of Total Defence. In 1982, the Civil Defence HQ was set up and the training of civil defence volunteers was earnestly started. In 1984, the concept of Total Defence was introduced to the public and the message was well accepted by most Singaporeans. This is shown by the results
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of a Public Opinion Survey conducted by Mindef. 96% agreed that national service is necessary for our defence; 70% believed that the SAF is a modern fighting force; 74% agreed that Total Defence would discourage others from attacking us; and that 80% are very clear that they will stay in Singapore even if war breaks out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus a natural extension to our concept of Total Defence that we now have before this House the Requisition of Resources Bill. The introduction of this Bill is both timely and logical. It is timely because it is an excellent follow-up to the efforts to explain to the public the concept of Total Defence. Further, the 23,000 trained civil defence volunteers can now see that their training will be backed up with the hardware through civil resources mobilization should the need arise. It is timely because the public is now able to understand the need for this Bill because, in one way or another, they have been exposed to the message of Total Defence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is logical because the initial years saw our defence build-up requiring heavy expenditure on purchasing military hardware such as guns, tanks, fighter aircraft and naval ships. These are the basic tools required by any modern Armed Force. Now that we have the basics and the trained men, we can complement this with the equipment and services available in the private sector, in the civilian sector. For example, lorries, buses, and trucks can be used to transport soldiers, medicine, food, and equipment. Heavy construction equipment such as cranes, bulldozers and excavators can be used not only by our army engineers but also by our civil defence volunteers for rescue work. Private hospitals and their equipment and staff can be used to nurse our injured.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No loyal Singaporean, I am sure, will challenge the rationale of this Bill. This Bill will mean an immense saving by the Government whilst still preparing for emergency. As stated by the Minister of State for Defence, instead of buying equipment and putting it in cold storage, we will have available in an emergency, Civilian equipment for military use. It is gratifying to note that this Bill has taken into careful consideration the inconvenience that will be caused to the civilian owners of these equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech during the debate on the President's Address, I mentioned that any efforts to marshal civil resources must take into account four factors:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) That the inconvenience to the civilian sector should be kept to a minimum;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) That there should be minimum disruption of civilian operations in peace-time;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) That financial compensation, where applicable, should be fair; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) That those asked to participate should be convinced of the importance of their contribution to the defence of our nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef has taken all these factors into account. Owners will be given three months' advance notice of the mobilization exercise. These exercises will be held at night and on weekends so as not to disrupt normal working schedule. Financial compensation at market rates will be paid and a Compensation Board has been set up to settle only cases of dispute. Further, I must congratulate Mindef and the Feedback Unit of the Ministry of Community Development for organizing the discussion on this Bill on 7th and 8th of May for our grassroots leaders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only three points which I would like Mindef to consider further:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) It may be a problem for the owner to deliver the vehicle to the mobilization centre and this problem deserves further study.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Bill places the responsibility on the owner to keep the mobilization centre informed within seven days of changes in the initial information provided. I hope that the information required will not be of a complex or too technical nature. I hope that the Minister of State will comment on this. This may pose a problem to the smaller companies and less well-educated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) It is suggested in the Bill to pay compensation at the end of the emergency. May I suggest that payment be made at monthly intervals for items which can be easily computed, for example, rental of a vehicle? Payment for compensation due to damage, for example, will of course be computed only at the end of the emergency. This will not cause
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> undue hardship to owners whose vehicles or other equipment may be mobilized for a long period, though I hope this situation will never arise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we in Singapore alone in this idea of civil resources mobilization? The answer is a definite no. The Swiss, our model, have under their defence plans measures for requisition of civilian trucks and even horses, food, fuel and medical supplies. In Sweden's Total Defence plan of 1982-87, I quote, in relationship to transportation:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It must be possible to utilize the total transport resources according to the demands of a crisis or a war situation.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Falklands War, the British Ministry of Defence requisitioned a total of 45 merchant ships. The luxury liner, QE2 (Queen Elizabeth II), was converted into a troop carrier. Others were modified as mine hunter support ships, a hospital ship, ammunition ships, and water carriers, etc. Some merchant ships were eventually armed with small calibre weapons, and a number actually joined in the initial assault at considerable risk.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, after World War 1, passed legislation to establish a programme for the construction of a new merchant fleet that should be capable of serving as military vessels in time of war or national emergency. This programme was embodied in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, and is a basic policy under which the United States is operating today. Thus, we can see that civil resources mobilization is not a new concept. It is a logical concept which deserves our support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I would like to congratulate Mindef on the timely introduction of this well-thought-through Bill. The fact that this Bill will now be referred to a Select Committee reflects the seriousness with which Mindef takes the opinions of the vehicle owners and the public. This Bill will have far-reaching consequences for our future security and, to be successful, it must have the full cooperation of all involved. I am confident that the Select Committee will carefully consider all views presented to the Committee.

  <br>12.41 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Party has already stated our stand as regards defence. We believe in the defence of Singapore, and I share the views of my colleague, the Member for Anson, who speaks of the safeguards and I share his concern. I notice that this Bill can be used in peacetime. As much of the points have been covered by speakers, I will not dwell in them. The only thing is that perhaps it is used to cut down costs to keep the disruption down and other points that have been brought up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there is one other point. This will probably be used with the intended mobilization exercise, as I have read in the papers, involving about 100,000 men. Check me if I have not read the papers correctly. This is a huge number. We can remember in the last War, there were something like 40,000 Japanese assault troops who came down the Peninsula to conquer both Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. And 100,000 men in peacetime is a large number. I am sure the exercise will involve a fairly great amount of movement and attention and perhaps our Government should give an indication to our immediate neighbours that we have no hostile intentions; make it clear to them that this is only for our defence. We have to take into account their sensitivities. We do not want the signals to be read wrongly and matters may escalate and get out of hand if there should be extremist elements in the other countries. In this regard, perhaps when they are conducting the exercises, they could take this point into account and not blow it up into a high-key exercise, preparing as if war is coming tomorrow, and rather, if possible, to keep it down to a low-key exercise.

  <b>Encik Yatiman Yusof</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I rise to speak in support of the Requisition of Resources Bill, I wish to draw attention to the criticism levelled by the Member for Anson. The Member for Anson alleged that the question of payment of compensation posed a hardship. He also touched on the need of the public at large to be informed concerning the security of the nation. He
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> quoted at length examples from Britain to prove that the Requisition of Resources Bill is imperfect, inadequate and therefore ought to be copied from Britain in its entirety.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot understand the rationale that when the security of the nation is threatened, the public at large must be informed about the threat. Because informing the people about the threat in itself is tantamount to divulging the message to the enemy, and thus it will negate our capability to defend ourselves. Secondly, the question of payment of compensation had been spelt out by the Minister of State when he moved the Second Reading of the Bill; that payment will be effected as expeditiously and efficiently as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, defence and security of the nation is one of the important factors that determine whether a country can continue to survive or perish when it is faced with a major crisis, be it external or political threat. We have opted for the concept of total defence which is a combination of civil defence, social defence, psychological defence, economic defence and military defence. It is an exact approach and based on the principle that the defence of a country is a national responsibility which involves every citizen and every sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Requisition of Resources Bill falls within the framework of this defence concept. It is an instrument to enable the logistic needs to be created and fulfilled in the event of a crisis or an emergency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure to requisition resources, whether they are privately owned or owned by individuals, is not a new phenomenon in the world. The hon. Member for Fengshan has intimated that Britain, the United States, Sweden and Switzerland have already practised this concept. So as far as Singapore is concerned, this step is appropriate and not extraordinary and, in truth, at this point of time, it is relevant. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, West Germany passed a similar legislation in 1972 which empowered the Federal German Government to requisition vehicles for military purposes during an emergency.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it necessary for us to implement such measures, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir? It is unrealistic and unwise politically and economically to have such resources specifically and separately to be set aside for use in times of need. Particularly so when such resources cost a great deal of money and even more so when these resources are already at our disposal and can be used at any time by the public sector. So, by utilizing available resources, if the need arises, we can reduce expenditure for defence purposes and, at the same time, involve the people in defence on a wider scale.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are a variety of other reasons why such measures are the best in mobilizing available resources for the defence of the country. Firstly, the requisitioning of resources will enable the Government to strike a balance between current requirements and available resources. My point is that we need not make use of all resources available except for our real needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singapore is well-known as one of the countries that possesses mature and complete transportation resources, logistic and communication resources. The management, operational and cost-wise, the utilization of such resources, including sea, land and air transportation resources, is a big waste if these resources are duplicated merely for the needs of the military. We should make use of the resources at our disposal efficiently and productively for the benefit of the State.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to develop these resources privately, besides being a waste, is untenable economically and creates political problems. It can give rise to suspicion. There is no need to arouse suspicion among neighbouring countries. I disagree with the Member for Potong Pasir who stated that the involvement of 100,000 people in such an exercise would reverberate in our neighbouring countries and consequently would arouse great suspicion. I think the figure is a small matter if the exercise is carried out meticulously and with care, without fanfare. So, by mobilizing available resources, we are at the same time bringing home to the ordinary people the message that in war, no civilian resources will be immune or safe from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> threat. Therefore, active defence must involve civilian resources and consonant with that, Singapore, as a small and compact State, cannot divorce civilian resources from military resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that premise, I believe that in order to protect lives and the people of Singapore in an emergency, it is necessary for the Government to continue to have control over such resources, if needed. It is necessary to ensure that the people and the Armed Forces continue to obtain food and logistic supplies; ensure that work is carried out satisfactorily to repair ancillary facilities; ensure that direct support to the military is provided. Hence the necessity to have such a law. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, two matters are bothering me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I seek elucidation from the Government concerning compensation. Although I understand from press reports that compensation will be made in accordance with market rates, and that such payments will be effected while the resources are being made use of during an exercise, I wish to seek an assurance from the Government that such payments will be made expeditiously without any dilly-dallying and that the interpretation of market prices will not be made arbitrarily.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that the utilization of such resources during an exercise will definitely disrupt business operations and the operational plans of the firms involved. I support the view expressed by the Member for Fengshan who stated earlier that such disruptions should be kept to the minimum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I give my support to the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me first respond to the points raised by the Member for Fengshan. The first problem is whether there will be difficulties delivering vehicles and equipment to the SAF. I think there will be, but we still have to do it this way. Because it is much faster for us to depend on the person who owns the vehicle to bring it to us, to drive it to where we need it, than for us to despatch the right drivers
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to each of the individual vehicles scattered over many hundreds of car parks, vehicle parks, in Singapore, and take the vehicles from them. There are also other administrative requirements, like inspections, handing over procedures and so on, which have to be done together. So I think there will be some problems, getting people to learn how to bring their vehicles to the mobilization centres. And this is indeed the reason why we are planning to have exercises to test out the system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member raised the question of information requirements, and hoped that it will not be too onerous. We will keep the information requirements to the minimum. There are two basic sorts of information which we need in order to make the system work. First, information on people. Who owns it? Who drives it? Where can I get them? Do they have telephones? It is the same information which we keep for our reservists. We do it for several hundred thousand reservists. I think we can do it for several thousand pieces of equipment and several thousand owners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sort of information requirement is specific to the types and particular characteristics of the equipment which we want to mobilize. For example, if we want to take over a hospital, we need to know how many beds are there, what facilities are in there, whether we can conduct particular types of operations, are there enough after-care facilities, storage facilities and so on. If we want to take over a bus, we need to know how big it is, how many stretchers can go in, what its speed is, what condition it is in. These are the basic minimum information requirements. Mindef, in implementing the Act, will be conscious not to impose onerous reporting requirements on the owners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, payment. This was mentioned by the Member for Fengshan and several other Members, the Member for Anson nd also the Member for Kampong Kembangan. We intend to pay promptly. Immediately after the vehicle/equipment is mobilized, we will pay. We will pay according to fair market rates. The Member for Anson may have perhaps read the Bill too hastily. But the Compensation Board is not meant to deal with the vast majority of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cases where the market rate is easily determined and a settlement can be done immediately. The Compensation Boards are meant to deal with contentious cases where there are difficulties in determining a fair quantum of compensation. For the vast majority, we shall compensate immediately at fair commercial rates. The Member for Fengshan asked if we have requisitioned services, whether we can pay the people involved monthly. The Bill does not say so, but I think that is indeed how it will be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have time for just one more point. So I will take the remark of the Member for Potong Pasir, which, strictly, is not on the requisition of resources. But since, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you have indulged the question, perhaps you will indulge a reply. The Member for Potong Pasir asked whether I had said we would mobilize 100,000 men. I did not say that. I said 10,000 men. Zeros are very important. So we are indeed very conscious of keeping exercises on a reasonably low profile, of not alarming people unnecessarily, either within the nation or outside of the nation, and of giving adequate notice all round before exercises are carried out, especially for the first few exercises. I have given this reassurance many times, most recently in talking to the grassroots leaders. But for those who were not present and had not heard it, I say so again. We are very cautious not to upset anybody in our operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask a clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is about my misreading the Bill on the Compensation Board. I have not. My point is this. If it is specified that payment will be made according to commercial rates, that should be quite easy to determine and determined in advance. So I do not know why there should be any need to go to the Compensation Board in those cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, unfortunately things are not always as easy as they seem. If we take over a piece of equipment and it is damaged or destroyed, or something happens to it -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Hire.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Or if we hire it, there are a myriad ways in which we may interpret the damage, we may question the responsibility, and we may doubt the amount which is due to be paid. Those of you who are in the insurance business and have to work these compensation claims will know the complexity. That is why we have found it necessary to establish compensation boards. It is not to deal with the vast majority of cases where we will pay market rates, as we pay reservists market rates when they come in.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They can be determined in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I think I have answered the question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we were discussing compensation when we adjourned for lunch. I would like to make a few supplementary remarks here on compensation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, compensation rates will be at market rates, will be the commercial rates of rental, of purchase, or of hire, as the case may be. The details are in the Bill. The rates will be pre-determined and will be gazetted. This is to facilitate speedy payment and settlement after exercises and after real requisitions for operations. After the requisition is over, the Compensation Office will make an immediate offer of compensation to the owners of the resource. And if the owner accepts this offer, which, as I have stated, will be based on market rates, the matter is settled there and then. Only if the owner does not accept this offer, as in the case of damage, destruction or other complications, will the compensation be referred to a Compensation Board. We have really taken all possible steps to make compensation as smooth and as efficient as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now go on to the subject of disruption, raised by the Member for Kampong Kembangan. He suggested that Mindef should take whatever measures possible to minimize the disruption to the owners of vehicles by exercises in peacetime. Mindef is really very aware of this and has taken considerable precaution to plan its exercises and to keep disruption to a minimum. Let me enumerate what we will be doing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we will mostly be exercising the mobilization of vehicles and vessels in peacetime, and not all the complete range of civil resources will be required. Secondly, not all the resources will be mobilized at once, just as we do not mobilize 100,000 reservists at once. Neither do we intend to mobilize all of the lorries, or all the bulldozers or excavators or hospitals which are available in Singapore at the same time. Thirdly, the exercises will not be conducted extremely frequently. We do not expect a particular piece of equipment to be called up more than about every other year, although, of course, the owner will have to keep in touch with us more frequently in order that we may maintain our links and keep our records updated. And we will probably have to inspect the equipment more frequently than every other year. Fourthly, for the beginning few exercises, advance notice of three months will be given of the exercises, so that adjustments can be made and owners can prepare their schedules to accommodate the exercise. Later on, we will not do this, because we need also to test out the system to see how it works when no notice is given. But for the beginning, ample advance notice will be given. Fifthly, of course, compensation will be given. I have already discussed this. There is no need to go into further details here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the comments of the Member for Anson. I note that he prefaces them by stating his general support for the defence of Singapore, and these comments were supported by the Member for Potong Pasir. I presume, therefore, that this is more than a generality or a platitude and, in fact, the Opposition Members not only support defence in the abstract, but
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> support specific measures which we have taken to guarantee our defence. Specifically, the measure of National Service for all male citizens at the age of 18 in the Armed Forces, as distinct from national service for male citizens to do community service or social work. I presume that this is the case. I do not know if it has always been so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point is that the Bill makes no distinction between peacetime and a state of war. Once upon a time, in the days of yore and chivalry, when nations went to war, they declared war on one another. Nowadays, most nations which go to war are technically at peace with one another, except for the Middle-east where Israel and most of the Arab countries are, in fact, in a state of war. In the rest of the world, people go to war and shed blood without declarations of war. There was no declaration of war in Vietnam. There was no declaration of war in the Falklands. So to base our requisition of resources firmly on the requirement for a declaration of a state of war is to live perhaps in cloud-cuckooland. Supposing somebody attacks us without making such a declaration, if we follow this line of argument, I think we would perhaps be at a loss as to how to react.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Are you giving way, BG Lee?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> No, I am not giving way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> He is not giving way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Thirdly, the question of the competent authority which was raised by the Member for Anson. This is a detail which we will be discussing in the Select Committee. However, it is sufficient to note here that, in fact, this is not arbitrary, neither nebulous. The competent authority will be gazetted by the Minister under clause 4(1) of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come finally to the Member for Anson's substantive point, which has to do with Parliament and why we have not followed the British all the way in requiring that the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister report to Parliament at the expiry of the period of the requisition order. Let me explain the position. There are two reasons. First, we follow our Constitution. The Constitution of Singapore states unambiguously - this is Article 24 (2) - that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cabinet shall have the general direction and control of the Government and shall be collectively responsible to [Government].'
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Responsible to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I am sorry. "Collectively responsible to Parliament."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> This is, of course, unlike the situation in the United Kingdom where they do not have a written constitution. In pursuance of this clause, we have made a system that the Minister shall decide and the Cabinet shall recommend to the President to endorse.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How are they made responsible to Parliament?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Cabinet is collectively responsible to Parliament. The second point, which perhaps was overlooked by the Member for Anson when he pursued this line of argument, is that the British practice is not so straightforward as was presented in his speech. The British have a complex, partially unwritten system of government, and what was explained to us was just one facet. There are at least two other facets which are highly relevant here, which I should point out. One, there is recent British legislation in which Secretaries of State have been delegated such powers without requirement to refer to Parliament. I refer specifically to the Civil Aviation Act of the United Kingdom of 1982. If I may quote from section 62(l)(b) of the Act:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In time of war, whether actual or imminent, or of great national emergency, the Secretary of State may by order provide for taking possession of and using for the purposes of Her Majesty's naval, military or air forces any aerodrome or any aircraft, machinery, plant, material or things found therein or thereon ...'.
  <br>
  <br>And this is without the requirement of reporting to Parliament. So British practice is not so straightforward.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the British also have unwritten rules. In particular, there are certain prerogatives of the Crown. And the Queen, by Order in Council, may order the requisition of resources without reference to Parliament. In fact, it was by such means that ships were mobilized in the Falklands war and committed to the battle, and not by parliamentary statute or resolution. So British practice is not straight-forward. We do not blindly follow anybody else's practice. I think we have a Bill which serves our purposes. The details will be discussed in the Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Two points of clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. First of all, I was not saying that these powers should not be exercised in peacetime. What I want to know is: will separate provision be made in a case where Singapore is at war? Of course, I accept that we do not always have declarations of war. But the Singapore Government must be able to recognize when there is an actual state of war in progress, whether it is declared or not. That is the point I was making, whether these provisions are meant for that situation or are they only intended for peace-time exercises. I should have thought that was quite clear.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, these powers that have been incorporated in this Bill have been taken from the British Army Act and the Air Force Act. And it is in those Acts that you find that the Minister has to report immediately to Parliament once he brings these powers into operation and it is in there that you find that Parliament must approve the continuance of these orders beyond the month. So will you please try and answer my points?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill indeed provides for a case in which the security of the Republic is endangered. Indeed, clause 2 of the Bill specifies that the Minister for Defence must, as one of the pre-conditions for invoking Part Ill, be satisfied "that it is necessary for the securing of the public safety or the defence of the country." I think that is quite clear. "Defence of the country" means there is indeed a threat to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the British Army Act, Sir, it is necessary to seethe problem in its totality. The British Army Act does not provide for requisition of land, of services, of aircraft, of ships. It provides for requisitioning of vehicles and -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Billets.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> And billets. That is all. And we have legislation because our requirements are extensive and our legislation is based not only on the British Army Act but on all the rest of the legislation which we have found relevant to this purpose - British, Hong Kong and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You should report back to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I have made my point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Requisition of Resources Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].

  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order. Mr Jeyaretnam, will you move your motion first?
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House regrets the obstructionist attitude of this Government to the growth of a genuine Parliamentary Opposition in Singapore in accordance with the will of the electorate.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, this motion seeks to examine the Government's intentions towards the political progress in this country. Whether we are to progress towards a viable democracy founded on the rule of law and on the supremacy of Parliament or whether we are to progress to some other kind of democracy a'la People's Action Party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it concerns the constitutional rights and the liberties and the freedoms of our people. And it is as well to remind ourselves in this House this afternoon that this is not the first time that this question has been raised. This question was raised in 1956, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we did not have a Parliament, we had a Legislative Assembly. And there was a Member in the Assembly, who was not sitting on the Government Benches, who was sitting where we are now sitting (my colleague from Potong Pasir and 1) on the Opposition Bench. And he was raising the very questions that I am raising now in this House. May I read, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what he then said in 1956, and I read from Part I of the Official Report of the First Legislative Assembly, Second Session, for the sitting on the 4th October 1956. This is what he said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You take over the organisation [he is referring to the Government that had taken over from the colonial powers) of the colonial power, the government machinery, the instruments of policy- the administration,the police, broadcasting and all the "gimmicks" of a modern colonial State. Then you use this machinery with the connivance and concurrence of your colonial masters against rival organisations. It is easier than building up an organisation of your own. All you have to do is to dissolve organisations and societies and banish or detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil and quiet - on the surface. Then an intimidated Press and some sections of the Press here do not need intimidation because they have very friendly owners -
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Press and the Government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done. Or if these things are referred to again, they are conveniently distorted, and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict it. It has happened before in Asia. It happened in China and lndo-China. First, you knock out your opponents who compete with you, peacefully and constitutionally, because they are more vigorous, because you cannot compete with them, because they are better organised than you are. When everything becomes peaceful and tranquil, complacency sets in, and degeneration begins.' [Vol. 2, col. 3231
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he sat down, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, he ended with these words:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But if we say that we believe in democracy, if we say that the fabric of a democratic society is one which allows the free play of ideas, which avoids revolution by violence because revolution by peaceful methods of persuasion is allowed, then, in the name of all the gods that we have in this country, give that free play a chance to work within the constitutional framework. If you do not, then you will face outright opposition, an armed revolt, and eventually an armed victory. Then the whole social fabric of this society will collapse.' [Vol. 2, col. 3281
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those words, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, were uttered in 1956 and, if the new Members of this House are wondering who the Member was, let me tell them that in less than three years after he uttered those words, he found himself the Prime Minister of this country. And he has continued to remain as the Prime Minister to this day. You may well ow has he done this?" The answer is quite simple. There he outlined the steps that should be taken. The difference is that this Government did it far more ruthlessly and efficiently than the colonial government did it, to silence its critics and to do away with any constitutional opposition to it.

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, in spite of all that, I am here because of one thing, may I remind Members of the House, because of the spirit of the people, and the spirit of the voters in Anson. I have paid tribute to them and I will pay tribute again to those voters in Anson.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That was not the only protest that the Member was making in those days. He was loud with his protests against all the restrictions that were placed on the constitutional rights, on the freedoms and liberties of the people. He was the quintessence of the champion of the liberties of the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 24th November, 1955, in the Legislative Assembly, he was complaining about thought control at the University. On the 21st April 1955, he was complaining about the Police refusing him to allow public meetings after 7.00 pm at night. The Police had no objections to him having his public meetings in the day time. But they said, "No meetings after 7.00 pm." And so he was raising a big protest about that. I am sorry he is not here. I had hoped he would be here to reply to this motion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, in an interview that he gave to correspondents of three foreign newspapers, he said this:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'One of the basic ingredients of democracy was the ability to change governments and policy without revolution. If we succeed, we must eventually create a situation in which there is a viable, intelligent, noncommunist alternative.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the operative words, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is the real test of whether my colleagues and I succeed or fail, not economically, but politically, in creating a viable democracy.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, in 1966, the Prime Minister was outlining what was the real test for him and his colleagues, the creation of a viable democracy. And it is sad, Mr Deputy Speaker, to have to say today that in this, this Government has abysmally failed, the test that the Prime Minister set for himself and his colleagues in 1966. It is ironic, Sir, that after 25 years of rule by this Government, there is still a question mark about the succession to this Government and about where the leadership is going to come from. Does that not speak volumes that this Government which took over in 1959, and which was going to prepare the people for a viable democracy had not prepared them? All they produced were people who could only say yes. They stamped out Opposition. They stamped out anybody who dared to stand up and question them. And so we are in this state
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> today, without an alternative leadership because of the policies of this Government. Sir, I could go on and on, regaling Members of this House of what the Member said in those days.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this motion this afternoon, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because the time has now come for this Government to declare its stand. What is its stand towards the political direction of this country? I say this, Sir, in all sincerity because of the convolutions and the somersaults and the twistings we have had from this Government, from the time it took power in 1959, on the whole question of the political direction of this country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, in 1956, 1966, it was quite clear as to what was the desirable state for Singapore to pursue, but things changed. Obviously, the Member thought otherwise after he became the Prime Minister of Singapore, after we came out of Malaysia. After 1966, this Government lost no time in suppressing all forms of constitutional Opposition. And as he said in 1956, he knew exactly what to do, what was necessary to see that he would retain power.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, have we seen the classic illustration of the aphorism by that celebrated historian Lord Acton that, "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." No thoughts of democracy, no thoughts of rights of the people, once you find yourself in power and you begin to enjoy the feeling of power that you have. This Government did the very thing which they sought to condemn in the colonial government and in the government that succeeded the colonial government in 1955, the first partially elected legislature and partially elected government. But as I said, they did it very much more efficiently and totally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The press were soon brought under their control. The trade unions were stood on their heads, as Hitler did when he came to power. The Government organizations, the Police, the Special Branch, the ISD, were made to work to further the aims of this Party in power. And so whilst there was on the registration book of the Registrar of Societies something like 14 regis-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tered political Parties, the political Parties were not given any opportunity or chance to build up a consensus of views from Singaporeans that might be in any way critical of the Government or might pose a different view from the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I could tell you about the difficulties that the Opposition Parties have suffered. I have said this outside. Whilst the People's Action Party had no problems about premises, about funds, the Opposition Parties were left without any opportunities to build themselves up, to represent another point of view, and all this was done subtly through the use of force and intimidation by this Government. We could not get any premises for ourselves because people were frightened. They were frightened about the consequences of being identified with an Opposition Party or seen to be helping an Opposition Party. We could not get any funds because nobody would dare give any money. "Oh, the Government will come down on us if we so much as gave you one cent."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fear was also brought about by the numbering on the ballot papers, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I know that the ballot papers are numbered because of the British practice. But was it in 1977 or so, it was pointed out by our present Ambassador to the United States, Prof. Tommy Koh, that there was a real irrational fear among our population that if they should vote against the People's Action Party, they would be found out and they would be victimized. A government which was sincerely interested in building up a viable democracy would have done away with the numbering of the ballot papers, because the numbering of the ballot papers was not going to help anybody. But not this Government. For one good reason, because the numbering of the ballot papers helped the PAP to maintain itself in power. I do not know who started the rumour, but there was the rumour that the Government which was thought to be omniscient, omnipotent, would know how people had voted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> You believe them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> So this rumour served the PAP very well. It was even resorted to, may I remind Members, in the last election
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in Anson by people who wanted to see the PAP returned to power in Anson. A whispering campaign was going on. "Don't forget, my friend, that the ballot paper is numbered."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1972 elections, the first time that I stood as a candidate for the Workers' Party, there seemed a possibility that there might be some serious challenge to this Government. A monstrous lie was put out through a PAP candidate in the general elections that the Workers' Party had got $600,000 from Malaysia. This was a monstrous lie, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and it was broadcast over radio and carried in the press. Then we had all the statements about Opposition Parties being proxies of foreign powers. All this was done whilst lip service was being paid to the idea of a parliamentary democracy, a viable democracy with an Opposition. I remember, and I have said this once in this House some time ago, in 1972 on polling night, the Prime Minister came over TV and he was almost tearful that there was no one elected from the Opposition. And he said he was going to create University Seats because he thought an Opposition was essential if we were going to have a viable democracy. So while you had lip service on the one hand, you had action on the other. "Stamp them out," that was the order to the ISD, to the Police, to everybody.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had statements about what would happen if the Opposition were to get in, even if one Opposition Member were to be elected into Parliament. We had fanciful statements. There was the statement made by our ex-President when he was a candidate, I think, for the PAP about Vietnamese troops marching down the length of Malaysia if one Opposition Member were to be elected into Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in spite of all this, as I said, in 1981, 31st October 1981, in the by-election, the Anson voters decided that things had gone far enough, that they had to call a halt at whatever cost to them and they decided that for the sake of Singapore's future, there had to be an Opposition Member in Parliament, And so they elected an Opposition Member into Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did this Government react? This Government which had paid lip service to the idea of a parliamentary Opposition. It went into tantrums. The Prime Minister said that Opposition was irrelevant for good government. "We did not need an Opposition in Singapore." His then Second Deputy Prime Minister made similar statements and said, "We are going to get Anson back." Some hope they had!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the rules of democracy, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that you respect the choice of the electors. That is democracy. You have an election and the people elect a person of their own choice. Then you accept that election and you respect the decision of the electors. Did this Government, with its statements about wanting a democracy, respect the choice of Anson voters after 1981? No. It behaved like a child whose toy had been snatched away from it. Overnight, the rules for residents' committees were changed so that -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Rubbish!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Rubbish? Well, I will prove it to you. You ask the officer in the Prime Minister's Office whether it was not changed overnight. It was changed so as to keep the Opposition Member out of the Residents' Committees, not that I wanted to, but the rules were changed. Then the members of the Management Committees of the Community Centres and the Citizens' Consultative Committees were told, "You are not to have anything to do with the Opposition MP."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to wait eight months before I could get my office in the Constituency. Before my election, the PAP Member of Parliament had his office. And as I said it once before, I was told, "No, you can't have that. We have given it to somebody else." I understand from my colleague, the Member for Potong Pasir, that he is still waiting for his office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the National Day Dinner that was organized in my Constituency in 1982 or was it 1983. One would have thought that the people's representative from Anson would have been invited. No. As an insult to the people of Anson, the then Second Deputy Prime Minister - I see he was opening an animal hospital yesterday,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> I was glad to see that he is well - was the Guest-of-Honour. And he talked to the people present, people who were more or less forced to attend the dinner, because the Anson residents were not going to have anything to do with it. He gave them a lecture on what the PAP was going to do about recapturing Anson. So this went on. Not only was the Opposition MP denied outside but in Parliament, an attempt was made to try and get him off the rails. When all this failed, when they saw that all this was not going to get them anywhere, the Government decided that perhaps it was time to change, not because of any genuine change of heart but because they felt that the policy that they were carrying out was not going to help them in any way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were told by the Prime Minister that there was a conversion, that he and his Senior Ministers decided that perhaps - this was 18 months or so after the Anson voters elected the first Opposition MP into Parliament - it was a good thing for Singapore to have an Opposition. But what was he saying in 1956? What was he saying in 1966? But at least he was truthful enough to say that he decided, 18 months after 31st October 1981, to change his mind about the Opposition. But was it a genuine change? Was this Government really interested in building up a constitutional Opposition so that Singapore may become a viable democracy? Or was it further intrigue, further play-acting by this Government to somehow hold on to power? I ask this because the Government came up with this ingenuous idea, first for Singapore, of having non-constituency MPs elected into Parliament. If anything was hypocritical, I say this is, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. It was quite clear that the Government was not interested in the emergence of a constitutional Opposition. What the Government was interested in was in a form of Opposition which could be managed and controlled by the Government. But very luckily for Singapore, the people of Singapore saw through this intrigue, saw that this was a phoney Opposition that the PAP Government was planning for them and they rejected it. They returned two Opposition Members into Parliament, not through the non-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> constituency method, but through direct elections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much talk, Sir, about the present Opposition in Singapore not accepting the fundamentals of our society, about the need to defend Singapore. All this is a sort of smokescreen. I am asking the Government now: do you accept the fundamentals of a truly democratic state in Singapore? I would ask the Government to declare its stand now, whether or not it is for a truly democratic state in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the non-constituency MP idea, the Prime Minister said in this House that his Government was considering amending the Constitution to give the President certain executive powers because of an imaginary fear that if another government got into office they might spend all the reserves. I asked him then whether any proposed change would be referred to the people in a referendum and he said he might consider it. Well, I would like an answer now without any equivocation, whether the Government intends to go ahead with its move to amend the Constitution to give the President powers, limited though they may be. Let us not have any shilly-shallying on this. Let us have clear answers, direct answers. If that is the intention, may I ask whether it will be referred to the people in a referendum or is it the Government's intention to introduce a Bill in this House without a referendum?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, at the end of the elections in 1984, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Government realized that all that it had done to try and keep off Opposition Members had failed, when all its intrigues and all its devices to keep off Opposition Members from Parliament had failed, we had the Prime Minister going into a rage after the polling results were declared, saying that it was time that the one-man-one-vote system was looked at for us to consider whether there should be any change. I ask now of this Government to say here and now without any further hesitation: are you going to do anything to tinker with this one-man-one-vote system? I would ask the Government to come out into the open. You cannot keep these things to yourself. And if that is the intention, would it be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> referred also to the people in a referendum?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the Prime Minister went abroad to announce that he had persuaded his Cabinet Ministers to accept an amendment to the Constitution to give the President some powers. May I know if that is true, if that is the case, that the Cabinet has accepted this?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after the 1984 elections, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we had many statements from the Government Ministers that I have found it very difficult to follow them in this maze of statements that have been uttered. There was the President's hope at the swearing-in of the Cabinet Ministers that the Government and the Opposition would engage in a meaningful dialogue. I have not seen any evidence of this from the Government benches.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the First Deputy Prime Minister speaking to community leaders on 8th February, 1985, said this - I am quoting from a letter written by his Senior Parliamentary Secretary to me on 20th April 1985:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our attitude towards the Opposition will depend on the Opposition themselves. If an Opposition sets out to topple the Government through instigations, agitations, distortions, half-truths, unfounded rumours, then surely we cannot be expected to stand by with folded arms. We have got to react and to come down very hard on them. But if the Opposition is constructive and challenges us with constructive ideas, policies, then we must give them a chance, We must listen to them because they might have some ideas which we can borrow and implement. Let us contest on ideas, on policies. [I say Amen to that.] Who have better ideas and who have better people in implementing good ideas?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contest of ideas must take place not only in Parliament but also in the constituencies. If an MP preaches a certain policy, for example, if he is against our fining people for littering, for inconsiderate parking and driving, then we should perhaps waive the implementation of such rules in his constituency, He believes in that. The people have voted him. Let us take an enlightened approach. Let us implement what he wants to do in his constituency. If an MP, whether he is a PAP MP or Opposition MP, argues for a race circuit for hell-drivers, well, let us put the race track in the MP's constituency. He wants it. No other MPs want it. Put it in his constituency and let it go round and round his particular constituency.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the words spoken by the First Deputy Prime Minister. As I have said before, I do not want a racing circuit in Anson. What I want, Mr Deputy Speaker,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Sir, are classrooms for conducting classes for students from poor families, not classrooms for students to be taught revolutionary songs or Communist songs. I say this, Sir, because from time to time we have heard from the Government an insinuation that in those days somehow Parties, other than the PAP, were responsible for the riots in 1955 and 1956. There was talk about wild men in those days and do we want to go back to those wild years. But let me lay that ghost to rest here. I see there was a full-scale debate in the Legislative Assembly following the riots and there, the PAP was accused of being at the back of all the riots, not the Prime Minister personally, but that Members of his Party were behind it. So I hope we shall not hear any more about wild men in 1955, 1956, creating trouble. And we do not want to go back to those days.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as I said, I have asked for classrooms and do I get them? In spite of the First Deputy Prime Minister saying, "Well, if they have got something constructive, we will help them. We will let them do what they want." I get a reply from the People's Association to say, "You can't have the classrooms. You can't have the conference rooms for meetings." I asked for the rooms for the Anson Council that I had formed. I then wrote again to the First Deputy Prime Minister asking him for clarification of the statement made by his Parliamentary Secretary that community centres are Government properties and no MP can do what he likes with them. Well, I have not had a reply to that yet, except to say that the People's Association would be replying to me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is this: are you going to put obstacles in the way of the Opposition MPs attempting to do anything in their own constituencies? If you are, then what does one make of the First Deputy Prime Minister's statement on the 8th February 1985 to community leaders? Was that all mere mumbo jumbo, not intended to be carried out? This is why I have raised this question, not as an academic exercise, because I am almost desperate in trying to understand what the Government's policy is towards a constitutional Opposition. So, I repeat, please declare your stand now, unequivocally. What is it that you stand
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for? Are you saying that all Opposition Parties are instigators and agitators? Are you making that allegation against the present Opposition Parties? If so, come out with it, and bring the evidence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must carry on, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because I see time is running on. On the 1st of May at a meeting for trade unions, attended by about 1,000 people, the First Deputy Prime Minister was thinking aloud about the social unrest in Singapore that had been noted by an American company, the Business Environment Risk Information. The First Deputy Prime Minister tried to explain what was the cause of this social unrest that was noted by this company. And he said, "Could it be the loss of Anson in a by-election to the Workers' Party in 1981?" May I ask the First Deputy Prime Minister to say in this House what is it that he is trying to say in that? Because I do not understand it. Neither do the people of Singapore understand it. Is the First Deputy Prime Minister saying that there is social unrest in Singapore because Anson voters elected an Opposition Member into Parliament in 1981? Are you saying that there is social unrest in Singapore because in 1984, the voters in Anson and Potong Pasir elected Opposition Members? Because if you are saying that, Mr First Deputy Prime Minister, I am saying to you that you are completely out of touch with reality. So will you please explain your stand?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be quite clear to the Government and this motion assumes that - that the people of Singapore want to see the growth of a genuine constitutional Opposition in Singapore. That is quite evident. It is quite evident that the people of Singapore have grown up, as was noted by a foreign observer commenting on the 1984 Election results. The question is this: has this Government grown up? Is this Government mature enough to accept a constitutional Opposition? Or is it so insecure? I ask you, are you so insecure that you are afraid of any Opposition? It is as plain as that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more utterance of the First Deputy Prime Minister, and this was only yesterday. In an interview with Business Week,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Miss Cheryl Debes, he was quoted having said that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Political self-renewal in the People's Action Party is proceeding well and this is one of the three key factors which will ensure stability and progress in Singapore after Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew retires.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I say that that is a piece of arrogance because it assumes that only the People's Action Party can continue to look after Singapore. If anybody is to look after Singapore, it will be the people of Singapore, not the People's Action Party. And one of the key factors which will ensure stability and progress in Singapore is not political self-renewal in the People's Action Party. The key factor is whether you allow the free play of ideas that the Prime Minister was advocating in 1956, whether you allow the expression of constitutional rights by the citizens. That, Mr First Deputy Prime Minister, is what will make for political stability. If you do not, as the Prime Minister then said, the alternative would be an armed struggle. I should have thought that the PAP would welcome our efforts in the Opposition because we are here to see that an armed conflict does not come about. We want constitutional progress in this country, not throwing of bombs, of going round beating up people. We want to see constitutional progress through the ballot box. And I should have thought that any sane, sensible government would welcome that from the Opposition Parties. But no, not from this Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, before I sit down, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I spell out what I would like to hear this afternoon from the First Deputy Prime Minister. As I have said, I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not here. He should be here to answer these questions. At least, he was battling with this way back in 1956. The questions that I would like answered are: does this Government believe in a parliamentary democracy for Singapore? And may I say that parliamentary democracy can only come about if you have constitutional Opposition in the House, in Parliament, if you afford opportunities to the people to elect their representatives who can then make their representations known to you. So the question is this: do you believe in a parliamentary democracy for Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Secondly, are you committed to that? It is one thing to believe, but are you committed to that? Third, if you are committed, what steps does the Government propose to take to encourage the growth of parliamentary democracy? I have said in this House that one of the things that we can do is to remove the restriction on the freedom of speech.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not permit me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, but I will refer to the public meetings we have asked for, which have been denied time and time again. We asked for a meeting on the 1st of May, not to sing Communist songs or subversive songs, but to explain to the people what we meant by parliamentary democracy and constitutional Opposition. That was denied to us, even though the First Deputy Prime Minister then said that he would support it. And we had, I am sorry to say, a specious reply from the Minister for Home Affairs to May Day is only for trade unions." He was sitting here next to the First Deputy Prime Minister when he said he would support it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked for another meeting on the 25th May. We have been told that we would be granted a permit. But we are still waiting to hear from the Singapore Sports Council whether they would give us the Toa Payoh Athletic Stadium. What is the Government's attitude to this? Because we know that the Toa Payoh Athletic Stadium will be available on the 25th May. It is not being used. Will the Government tell the Singapore Sports Council to grant us the Stadium, that they would have no objections if they gave it? Or am I going to be told tomorrow by the Singapore Sports Council, "You can't have it."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we come down to specifics, are you going to obstruct the Opposition MPs from discharing their duties to serve the voters in their constituencies? To get down to more specifics, are you going to allow the Anson Community Centre classrooms for classes for children of residents in that constituency? Or are you going to shut them out? Why, if you are going to shut them out? Are you going to allow the use of the Conference Room for residents?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not the only one who want the answers to these
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> questions. It does not matter if I am the only one who want the answers. The Government can ignore me. It can even ignore them if it was only the voters of Anson who want the answers to these questions. But, unfortunately for the Government, the people of Singapore want the answers to these questions. And so I trust the Government will answer these questions this afternoon. The people of Singapore demonstrated, in no uncertain way, their preference for a constitutional Opposition when 13% of the voters swung over to the Opposition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes the obvious has to be stated. My colleague, the Member for Anson, and myself are parliamentary Opposition. We are not an Opposition from the underground. Neither are we an Opposition in an Opposition Party outside Parliament. We are parliamentary Opposition. We have been duly elected by the people in a properly conducted election under the Constitution of Singapore to represent them and we have come in by the front door. We have certainly not come in by the grace of the PAP or by their patronage. Therefore, we are representatives of the people and it is only right that the Opposition should be treated as Members of Parliament, equal to those in the Government. But as it turned out, there appears to be two standards practised by Government departments and statutory boards, one for the PAP MPs and the other for the Opposition MPs. I have found this out in the last four or five months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens at the constituency level? An MP cannot perform without an MP's office. I have written three letters but todate the HDB is still dragging its feet about the MP's office. I have heard that in other PAP constituencies, the HDB has built offices in extra quick time at the void decks for the use of the People's Association.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the so-called grassroots organizations, the CCMCs? I have written to the People's Association and they said,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> "No permission is given to you to assist in the community centres. "What about other so-called grassroots organizations, the Residents' Committees? I have written not once, but twice, volunteering to help in these grassroots organizations. What was the reply? "You wait for another year. You have to prove yourself." Why should I prove myself? I have been elected by nearly 60% of the voters at Potong Pasir. They think I am suitable, but not the Secretariat of the Residents' Committees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about other areas? I certainly would like to know what is going on in the schools. Can I visit the schools? "No, you can't." i think education is very important. Can I give my point of view at the School's Council or at least sit in at the meetings? 'No, you can't." I think it would be better to have a different point of view. You have to look at matters from different angles. This has been pointed out by the Minister of State for Defence. The PAP is not infallible. You do make mistakes. So why not get a different point of view from the Opposition? If you had, you probably would not have gone along with the priority scheme for graduate mothers. And now you have admitted your mistake in the third year of streaming in the schools. You have altered it. The HDB says, "We will come out with a new accounting system." Although they have threatened to increase Ministers' salaries, nothing has come out of it. So the Opposition has succeeded to a certain extent in pointing out some of the issues at the last elections and the PAP Government has taken cognizance of these issues.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to learn that a beautiful community centre at the Sennen Estate has been taken over. I have been told that this community centre was built by money raised by the residents and it was specifically designed, planned and built for a recreational and social centre. It has beautiful basket-ball courts, badminton courts and there are rooms for activities. I am sure the Minister for National Development would tell Members that it is unjustified, if you look at it from any point of view, from planning permission, to change it into an administrative office. How can a beautiful community centre be changed
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> into an administrative office of the Residents' Committee Secretariat? I believe it is still not in use. It has been closed down. Why is this step necessary?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another small point. One gentleman came to see me and he i have got this very rare, exotic plant, called Sterculia Nobilis. It has been brought from China and it has got medicinal value." His father brought it but he did not want to propagate and give it around. Later on when the father became old, the son took over and began to propagate the plant. I believe he gave the plant as a gift to the Prime Minister and to the President. I was happy that he came to me and he said, "i am willing to give you this plant in commemoration of the opening of your MP's office." So what did I do? I wrote to the HDB - "We want to plant this particular tree near the MP's office in commemoration when it is built." What do you think the reply was? "No", of course, I said, "All right, since it is such a rare plant, I am sure it will benefit constituents of that constituency. Can I plant it anywhere else?" Again, no, of course. The letter says, "With regard to your request to plant a Sterculia Nobilis in front of the MP's office, since sufficient trees have already been planted in accordance with the Parks and Recreation Department's guidelines, no further planting is necessary." So I wrote to the Parks and Recreation Department to find out what is the planting plan or guidelines. This is the reply I got: "As you did not define the boundary of Potong Pasir Estate, I take it to include Potong Pasir Avenues 1, 2 and 3. The planting proposals for these three roads are put up by the Housing and Development Board. As these are HDB estate roads, you are requested to contact them for the tree planting plan."

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not know where to go next. I asked the HDB and they said, "We have already planted sufficient trees in accordance with the guidelines given by the Parks and Recreation Department." I go to the Parks and Recreation Department and they said, "No, you go back to the HDB."

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I could plant it in my garden but I do not think it would benefit the constituents. The point is this. Potong Pasir Avenue, if you have been there, is a big estate, and it has not been fully developed. There are still vacant lands. Flats are still coming up. There are still places which are undeveloped and I am sure there is enough space for one tree. So if this is not an obstructionist attitude of the HDB, I do not know what is. We just want to plant a simple tree and no permission can be obtained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, even with this obstructionist attitude, we will still go on. We have approached the RCs. We have approached them and we cannot be blamed if we started grassroots organizations of our own. We have tried to fit in but we have been rejected, as if we are persons to be shunned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important question is: is this obstructionist attitude of the Government good for national unity? This morning we talked of total defence. Defence does not mean only the logistics, the armament, but another more important aspect is the morale of the people. I think this is a very important aspect. Therefore, if the Government is going to segregate those who are in the Opposition from those who are in the Government, this is certainly not good for national unity. This is only the beginning and if there were more Opposition Members, the gulf between those who support the Opposition and those who support the Government would even be greater. Therefore, I call on the Government to show their intention, whether they support national unity, whether they support a truly democratic way of life in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask what can be done to promote democracy? Perhaps we could follow the example of Germany. Germany suffered under a period of tyranny when it was ruled by Hitler. And, of course, you know, it was disastrous. The country was divided into two. After the war, they had a constitution worked out by the Germans and the Americans. And to ensure that democracy survived in that country, they took the step of teaching the subject of democracy in their schools. That is what they have done for the last 20 years. They
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> taught about Parliament from their point of view, the separation of powers, the Judiciary, the Executive, the Legislature, their rights, their duties. That is the step they have taken to ensure that democracy survives. If the PAP is sincere in wanting to ensure that democracy survives in Singapore, will the PAP take that big step?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am much obliged, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I strongly oppose the motion of the Member for Anson. Hearing him for one hour, talking verbosely and redundantly in trite sophistry, I thought we could expect something new from him. But in the end it was just a repeat of a lengthy and rotting piece of his idolum, a refrying of the cold rice. If his speech on 24th July last year when debating on non-constituency Members were to be re-run, it would be found that his speech today is just a replay of what he had made on the previous occasion, reciting copiously with added exhibitory verbiage about the Government obstructing in every way the growth of Opposition or the free play of democracy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also tried to deceive himself by wanting our people to believe that since he entered Parliament, the whole scene of Singapore has changed as though whenever the cock crowed, the sun would rise, and hence, it concluded that because of its crowing that the sun has risen. He wants the people to believe that without his crowing, the sun would not have risen in the East. This is "old cock's theory".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the presence of the two Opposition Members in this House is a testimony of our democracy in play, without which they would not have been here. The Member for Anson's allegation is that the Government is obstructing a genuine Opposition Party's growth but, in fact, the true obstruction is done by the opposition members themselves. Their actions and speeches outside and inside the House have caused some intending youths not to come forward to be true loyal oppositions because they do not want to associate with the opposition members(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and thus spoil their own image and reputation. That is how opposition members have themselves
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> actually obstructed the growth of a true democractic opposition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about how genuine opposition members can contribute towards true democractic opposition and towards the interests of our country. First, they must accept and believe in the fundamental principles of nation building and they must be able to uphold the long-term basic interests of our people and our nation. These principles and interests include national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national dignity and prestige and the importance of national defence, and also harmony and mutual tolerance and respect among our different races, cultures, religions and languages.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also of the view that in the interest of the nation, true Opposition Parties must be able to contribute constructive and sincere criticisms of the Government and government policies. The true Opposition must also be able to make suggestions and counter suggestions to help the Government solve certain intractable problems. These problems include those affecting the livelihood of our people, and those threatening our national safety, security and survival. So far, what have Opposition members done?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need such Opposition who question and are against the quintessence of the principles of our national existence and survival. For instance, an Opposition Member once said in this House that when the Russian warship was steaming towards Singapore with a banner hanging over the ship saying, "Singapore, here we come, what can you do?" Who said this? We do not want such Opposition, as this is damaging to our national dignity. This is defeatism. In the U.S. Congress, there are Doves and Hawks, pro- or anti-war factions. Despite arguments over defence and arms between the two, no self-respecting Congressman had ever said, "If the Russian missiles fly towards us, what could we do?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want the kind of Opposition Parties which are bent on smearing, distorting and insinuating. I would like to ask which Opposition Member has made
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> insinuation in this House to hurt an innocent family outside? Which political Party whose candidate has smeared and hurt the children of one of our Party candidates? We do not want an Opposition Party which is dishonest, untruthful and rumour mongering. Who said that the CPF Board has not enough money to pay back its members? And who said that the CPF is a time-bomb that the Government has to extend the withdrawal age in order to defuse it so that it will not explode in time? Who has been saying that HDB is building flats in order to reap huge profits out of their sales, yet would not dare to take up the challenge to prove by facts and deeds what he has said? Who has been saying that the recent changes in policies by the Government have been due entirely to the Opposition Members? On the one hand, the Opposition Members criticized and ridiculed our grassroots leaders calling RC members as Rubbish Collectors. The Member for Anson referred to these grassroots leaders as government agents, running dogs, or something like that. But on the other hand, they hope these grassroots leaders would cooperate with them.

Now they want to make use of these centres to achieve their political end. There is no such thing (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) in this world! Let me tell a small story. It concerns - [Interruption]

  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. When he was talking, nobody interrupted him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell a small story. It is about the result of the general election. The purpose is to let the two Opposition Members know that they should not be too elated about the 51 to 60% votes that they got. There was a university final year under-graduate, a student of mine. He voted for the first time in the last election in 1984. After the results of the general elections were announced, he came to see me with a green and distraught face. I thought something must be wrong with him. He said he had to talk to somebody. I asked him what was the matter. He confided in me that he voted for the Opposition and said that he had contributed to the near 13% swing in votes. He regretted very much what he had done. I asked him why he voted for the Opposition. He said he was not happy about certain Government policies, particularly about the Government's policy on priority given to graduate mothers for admission of their children to schools. This student typifies his generation who now realizes the risk of such voting and that without a strong and capable government, the good number of years they invest in education would come to nought.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me advise the Member for Potong Pasir because I live in Potong Pasir and because I still have a little hope for him. He has said in Parliament that he would be a loyal Opposition Member. I hope he would keep to his promise by his deeds and not follow the example of the Member for Anson. I hope he can really contribute this little bit to the fostering of a true Opposition in the interest of our nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on this big topic, I would like to give a little opinion of mine. I hope we could all consider this matter with a cool mind and in a calm and peaceful manner. Let me give an example. Last month, when Sabah held its state election there was one political party which won only six out of the 48 seats in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the State Legislature. Yet this party wanted to form the Government. Fortunately, the then Acting Premier Musa Hitam made a very wise decision. Otherwise, I believe the state of Sabah would have some trouble and there might even be a bloodshed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this brings me to think about our situation in Singapore. If at any particular general election in future one political Party should happen to win only 10 to 20 seats and the leader of this political Party says that only he represents the people of Singapore and he wants to be the government ruling the country. Then, what kind of Singapore will it be? Perhaps, some may say it is unnecessary worry. But the great English philosopher, Russell, having studied some political events in the world, once said,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some incidental event in the world that could have happened just by chance, but it could have significantly changed the whole situation of the world.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his saying I have this in my mind. If in 1945, when the Japanese had lost in the Second World War and the British were still outside Singapore, had the then leader of the Malayan Communist Party, Chin Peng, made the declaration that Singapore and Malaya had broken away from the U.K. and become independent and sovereign entities, then I believe the histories of Singapore and Malaya Peninsular would have been quite different now. Our situation would be quite different. If, for example, some 20 years later, in 1965, the leader of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, had been successful in the coup, then I believe Indonesia would not be what it is today. Today, the Indonesian Government does not completely follow the parliamentary democracy system of Holland. Singapore and Malaysia do not completely follow the democratic system of the United Kingdom. Likewise, the Philippines does not completely follow the American representative system. Similarly, Thailand is also different. However basically, the countries in the ASEAN region have been quite successful with their own democratic systems. ASEAN has been a stable region. Is this not a good thing? Do we want the world to be in a messy turmoil?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been successful. We can see this very clearly. It is because in the past 20 years, since 1965, we have been holding General Elections as required by the Constitution that we hold one election once every five years. In the past 20 years, we have held five General Elections and on each General Election, the people voted to decide the Party they want to form the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has stated that he has been taking part in General Elections since 1972. This is the success of our democracy. At this juncture, I would like to reminisce on an episode in the history of China. In the Sung Dynasty, there was one person by the name of Shima Kuan. From my study of the Chinese history, he was one of the great leaders of the opposition in pursuit of democracy. He vehemently criticized the then Wan Ang Shig administration. What he did was levelling criticisms at something factual and not making groundless allegations. What he said was meant to unite the people to build the nation, but not to divide the people and to destroy the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Volume 1 of the voluminous Chronicles that he wrote, he said: "For those higher to rule the people lower, it is like the mind and heart ruling the limbs, as the roots supporting the branches and leaves. And for the people lower to service those higher, it is like the limbs guarding the mind and heart, as the branches and leaves sheltering the roots. Then there will be mutual protection between the two and the country will be secure and peaceful."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the world of Shima Kuan was very different from what it is today. His thoughts had limitations. Although he relentlessly criticized the Wan Ang Shig government, in the end he still emphasized mutual protection of each other for the security and peace of the country. This spirit is something which merits our emulating, and which our Opposition Parties ought to consider well. In 1963, the late President Kennedy of the United States said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We stress not the individual liberty of one, but the indivisible liberty of all.'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was emphasizing the freedom of the greater universal self but not of the smaller individual self. It is something which we Singaporeans should learn, particularly our Opposition Members ought to consider well. I am raising these examples of Shima Kuan and John Kennedy to show that even in Singapore, with differing political views coupled with Party contentions, sometimes it may be of benefit to our people but sometimes it would be harmful. This depends on the motivation of Party leaders. John Kennedy was a great leader, yet he ended up by being assassinated by his political rivals. To the people of the United State and to the world, this is of no good. There could only be harm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on this major question of national survival and the future of Singapore, I hope both the Government and the people will be able to learn from past episodes in the political history of the world so that our small nation in this corner of the world may be able to survive and enjoy security and peace and a better life.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Yatiman Yusof</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Member for Anson moved a motion to express regret at the obstructionist measures adopted by the Government towards what he alleged to be the growth of genuine parliamentary Opposition, I thought that he was raising a very important issue which would determine the future course of political development in the Republic. Regrettably, Sir, I am compelled to oppose the motion not because I am sitting on this side of the House, but because the matter which is beautifully packaged, in fact, exposes nothing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ponder why the hon. Member for Anson has moved his motion. The important point that he wishes to raise in the motion centres around his inability to have access to facilities. Complaints of difficulty in getting permits, I consider to be the travail experienced by any Opposition political party in Parliament. In the past, the People's Action Party had experienced similar difficulties. In fact, in the 5O's, opposition to the PAP was very much more intense. The Member for Anson recalled that in the 5O's, the Prime Minis-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ter, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, had expressed his views. This had been made in the confidence that the Opposition in Parliament should be capable of presenting credible alternative views, which should be laid before the people for acceptance or rejection.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, three years after the contest of ideas, the PAP obviously had better ideas. Since the Member for Anson had been elected in the by-election, having been defeated for many years, and again re-elected in the last general elections, has he offered credible alternative views that can convince the people that the Opposition can offer better views to the people of Singapore? I do not think so. So let us examine the arguments advanced by the Member for Anson. First, he says that the PAP Government is determined to crush or to muzzle any form of criticism put up by the Opposition Parties. He says, "to silence the critics". It was under such conditions that the Members of the Workers' Party and the Singapore Democratic Party had been elected. Where then is the justification that there is no freedom of choice, no freedom of voicing opinions, no freedom to conduct campaigns? If these freedoms are really absent, it certainly follows that the two hon. Members would not be in this Chamber.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that he demands that the Government declare its stand. He asks, what is the political direction that Singapore will take in the future? I feel that the reply has already been given to the Member for Anson to the effect that every four or five years the PAP Government return to the people for its mandate, through clean and open general elections without the necessity of inviting observers from the United Nations to corroborate this state of affairs. We return to the people in order to get a fresh mandate. That is the quintessence of the democratic process which has been enjoyed by the Opposition Parties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the course of the future democratic development that he wants? We accept the verdict of the people in the general elections. If the general elections
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> held recently showed that 13% did not approve Government policies, we have demonstrated our sensitivity by reassessing several policies and it shows that as a Party elected by the people, we are sensitive to the needs of the people and are ready to adjust accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member further alleges that the PAP Government employs several threats including the numbering of ballot papers. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to me this is absurd because throughout the campaign in the last general elections, the Member never raised this point of numbered ballot papers as a threat because he was aware that by that time it was no longer a valid issue. Why then did he again harp on this point today?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we scrutinize carefully the debate and the points put forth by the Member for Anson, in truth, I am amazed at the confused state of his mind in moving this motion. What is most regrettable to me is that the Member for Potong Pasir who has hitherto earned my respect as being a reasonable man has also fallen into this abyss by supporting the motion. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, once again, may I ask, has the alleged restriction on the freedom of speech, freedom of choice, resulted in his garnering less votes? Is the question of obtaining the use of classes in community centres a matter that will determine the democratic pattern of Singapore in the future?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I oppose the motion.

   <b>WAIVER OF DEVELOPMENT CHARGES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he will consider waiving development charges on the building of institutional facilities by voluntary welfare organizations as the properties developed are for public and social purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Non-profit-making and charitable organizations are currently eligible to apply for waiver of development charge for developments directly related to their activities. All voluntary and welfare organizations falling under this category may therefore apply for such waiver. Each case will be considered on its own merits.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development if the Housing and Development Board will provide additional parking facilities for lorries and private buses in Ang Mo Kio New Town.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> In Ang Mo Kio New Town, the HDB has provided a centralized lorry and bus park at Industrial Park 2 with 303 lots. Another 442 lorry/bus parking lots are also available at the neighbourhood centre carparks. Of these, only 12 lots at the centralized lorry and bus park and 259 lots at the neighbourhood centre carparks were taken up in April 1985.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the existing parking facilities are already more than sufficient to meet the demand, the HDB has no plan to provide additional parking facilities for lorries and private buses in the New Town.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for the Environment why is it necessary for Mendaki to charge $20.00 per pupil per subject in classes conducted by Mendaki when Mendaki is financed by compulsory contributions.

  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> The Member for Anson makes a habit of stating inaccurate information in the form of a question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, contributions to MENDAKI through the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF) are not compulsory. Any Muslim who does not wish to contribute to MENDAKI or to mosque building or to both may exercise his wish by obtaining a Certificate of Option which he presents to his employer instructing the latter not to pay contribution to the Fund on his behalf during any period not exceeding 12 months. In other words any Muslim can opt out. Similarly if a Muslim employee feels that he can afford to give more to MENDAKI or for mosque building or both he can do so by opting for more. He can complete an authorization form to present to his employer so that the appropriate increased deduction from his salary can be made by the employer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MENDAKI has different charges for its Tuition classes. For its PSLE Tuition Classes, MENDAKI is charging $20 per pupil per two subjects (English and Mathematics) per three months or approximately $3.30 per subject per month. For its Sec 3(Express)/Sec 4(Normal) and GCE 'O' Level Tuition Classes in Mathematics and English, the fee charged is $20 per pupil per subject per three months or approximately $6.65 per subject per month. For GCE 'A' Level Tuition Classes in Economics and Mathematics, the fee is $30 per subject per three months or $10 per subject per month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MENDAKI Tuition Classes are heavily subsidized. The subsidies for 1983 and 1984 were $65,592 and $128,645 respectively.

  <i>Internal Security Act</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 1st May 1985, only one person was detained under Section 8 of the Internal Security Act. He is Chia Thye Poh, a member of the illegal Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). Chia was specifically instructed by the CPM to penetrate the Barisan Sosialis and engage in Communist United Front agitation to destabilize the Government. This he did by mounting a series of illegal demonstrations and industrial strikes. Chia was therefore placed under preventive detention in November 1966. He will be released as soon as he is prepared to give a public undertaking disowning the CPM's use of force and terror to overthrow the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were others who were arrested for purposes of investigation in connection with a case of illegal transhipment of arms through Singapore. These investigations led to the detention, on 8 May, of Shankar Gopal and William Tan Cheng Siew. All the others have since been released.

  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (a) when he can announce the upward revision of the pensions of government pensioners as promised by him in Parliament on 22nd March, 1985; (b) how much the revision will cost the Government; and (c) how many pensioners who are presently drawing monthly pensions of (i) below $500; (ii) between $501 and $750; (iii) between $751 and $1,000; (iv) between $1,001 and $1,500; (v) between $1,501 and $2,000; and (vi) above $2,000 will benefit from this revision, giving separate figures for each category.

   <b>HONGKONG AND MACAU WORKERS IN SINGAPORE</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Acting Minister for Labour the reasons for the Government's plans to encourage workers from Hongkong and Macau to come and settle down in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> It is Government's policy to encourage highly skilled workers to be recruited not only from Hongkong and Macau but also from other Asian countries and to offer such workers permanent residence if they are found suitable and can blend into our society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, not many Singaporeans are willing to acquire construction skills and make a career in the industry. It is therefore unavoidable that we have to rely on foreign workers to supplement our limited pool of local construction workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongkong and Macau are good sources of highly-skilled workers for construction and other trades. With their wage levels higher than Singapore's, they will not depress Singapore wages as when we rely on workers from low-wage countries. We are aware that Singapore contractors are not enthusiastic over their wages.
