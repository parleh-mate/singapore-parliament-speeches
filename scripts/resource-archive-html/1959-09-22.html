<div align="center"><b>(Variation of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  whether,  in  view  of  the

present position of the law that, in the matter of

fixing  the annual value of premises in  Singapore

the  rents  of  which  are  controlled  under  the

Control  of  Rent  Ordinance (Chapter  242),  such

annual  value  must be assessed on  the  basis  of

rents permitted under the said Ordinance, he  will

take  appropriate steps to have the Valuation List

for  1960  in respect of such premises  varied  to

conform with the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, due to the

corruption  in the City Council in  the  past  ten

years,  we  found in Singapore that assessment  of

the  annual  values  of properties  had  not  been

properly  done and not on an equitable basis.  The

result  has  been  that a considerable  number  of

property  owners have benefited over a  period  of

years  from the undervaluation of their properties

while   others  less  fortunate  have  had   their

properties valued correctly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the correct valuation taken by the City

Council   since  the  new  Government  came   into

existence,  many  millions of dollars  of  revenue

which  were lost hitherto have been recovered  and

which  can  be used for the benefit  of  the  poor

classes  in  erecting  more standpipes,  providing

more    electricity,   constructing   parks    and

playgrounds,   kampong  roads   and   many   other

amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revaluation of properties has been done in

certain  areas which we believe have  many  vested

interests connected with the City Council  in  the

past  ten  years and there were many  areas  where

many  properties were not valued properly. At  the

same  time, in our revaluation of such properties,

the  Assessment Department also touched  on  rent-controlled  houses in which certain  anomalies  in

the payment of assessment had been created due  to

rent  control.  Because of the existence  of  rent

control,  there  are  some  people,  mostly  chief

tenants, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



are  now  reaping  rich profits  from  such  rent-controlled houses. We think it is high  time  that

the  chief tenants of these houses should be  made

to  bear  a  part  of the cost of maintaining  the

essential  services and providing better amenities

to   the  poor.  The  revaluation  for  assessment

purposes  of rent-controlled houses has been  done

in some States of the Federation of Malaya. During

the  past few weeks, after the valuation list  has

been  published, we found out that some  landlords

and  chief  tenants tried to exploit the situation

by  threatening  to  increase the  rents  of  sub-tenants who are mainly the poor people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am quite aware, as is pointed out in the question tabled by the Member for Farrer

Park,  that  rent-controlled  premises  are  in  a

special position in that the annual value must  be

assessed on the basis of the rents permitted to be

charged  under the Control of Rent Ordinance.  The

special  position of rent-controlled  premises  is

receiving consideration by the Government  and  an

announcement  will be made as soon as  a  decision

has  been  made on the appropriate  action  to  be

taken with regard to these premises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Does the Minister then accept the

position that the proposed increase in so  far  as

rent-controlled   properties  are   concerned   is

illegal?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have said just

now  that  the special position of rent-controlled

premises   is  receiving  consideration   by   the

Government and I repeat that an announcement  will

be  made as soon as a decision has been reached on

the appropriate action to be taken with regard  to

these premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Local Government Ordinance, the

valuation list is published each year before  31st

August.   In  the  short  time  that  the   P.A.P.

Government  came into power before  the  month  of

August,  we had to publish the valuation list.  We

shall,  however,  soon  consider  all  the   legal

matters which arose when we were pressing for  the

completion of the valuation list.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Does the Minister realise that no

amendment to the Rent Control Ordinance  will  now

rectify the position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



insofar    as   assessments   on   rent-controlled

properties are concerned for the year 1960?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the Ministers have

discussed among themselves the full legal position

and they are not prepared to reveal what they have

in  mind now. As I said just now, a statement will

be issued in due course.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajah, Question No. 2.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Question No. 2.

<div align="center"><b>VALUATION LIST FOR 1960</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Access to public)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development whether he  is  aware  that,

despite the provisions of section 112 of the Local

Government Ordinance, 1957, members of the  public

are  being  denied  full and free  access  to  the

Valuation   List   for  1960   for   purposes   of

inspection,  and what steps he has taken  or  will

take to ensure that the City Council complies with

the provisions of the aforesaid section.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, on 1st September,

1959,  an estate agent who had been working as  an

officer in the City Council Assessment Department,

when  the Member for Farrer Park was there, wanted

to take down a list of valuation of properties but

was  refused  access  to the 1960  valuation  list

because  he could not produce letters of authority

from the property owners. This was in keeping with

previous  departmental  procedure  based  on   the

Municipal  Ordinance. The City Council  assessment

officers   were   suspicious   of   their   former

colleague, who is now an estate agent, and who  in

1958 whilst in the employ of the City Council  had

used  City  Council information for a  High  Court

bank assessment case, that is the famous Chartered

Bank case, and appeared as a witness on behalf  of

his  clients while he was still in the service  of

the City Council. Because of his past conduct, the

City  Council  Assessment Department  refused  him

access to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



1960 valuation list until he could produce letters

of  authority from the particular property  owners

who   would  be  his  clients  to  look  into  the

assessments   of   their  particular   properties.

Unfortunately,  Mr Speaker, the Local  Government

Ordinance promulgated in 1957 was not clear on the

matter  as  to  whether any member of  the  public

could  go  to  the City Council and  look  at  the

valuation list of all property owners with whom he

has  no  connection whatsoever. Mr  Speaker,  the

Municipal  Ordinance on which the Local Government

Ordinance,  1957,  was based  did  not  allow  any

member  of the public to look at the valuation  of

any  property  unless  he  has  got  a  letter  of

authority.  It is based on the same  principle  as

the  Income  Tax  Department in not  allowing  any

accountant or lawyer to have access to the  Income

Tax  Department's  assessment list  of  taxpayers.

This precaution will restrict unscrupulous persons

from  touting for business by looking  into  other

people's  assessments where  there  will  be  many

chances of corruption, particularly in the case of

persons  who have previously been engaged  by  the

Assessment   Department   or   the   Income    Tax

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the matter was brought up to the High Court and we found that the Local Government

Ordinance   is   different  from   the   Municipal

Ordinance on this matter and allowed access to the

valuation list to any person even though he has no

connection. We are studying the law and until such

time   as  the  relevant  section  of  the   Local

Government  Ordinance can be  amended  to  prevent

touts  and unscrupulous agents from making use  of

such free access for their own ends, our hands are

tied. If the Member for Farrer Park wants to know,

this estate agent is Mr C. H. Williams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's recommendation to proceed with the  Bill.

Sir,  I  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cinema business is in a flourishing state.

The revenue from entertainments duty in respect of

admissions  to cinemas has been increasing  during

the last two years. There have been built a number

of new cinema theatres during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



this  period,  and  it  has been  found  that  the

present  rates  of entertainments duty  cannot  be

increased without the burden being passed  to  the

patrons. The local exhibitors who have to  bear  a

number  of  expenses  would  pass  any  additional

taxation  on  the cinema industry to the  patrons,

unless  legislation  were passed  to  control  the

admission  prices.  On the  one  hand,  the  local

distributors who have a share in the  profits  are

subject   to   income  tax.   But   the   overseas

distributors  who obtain greater profits  are  not

subject  to  local  taxation.  Large  amounts   of

royalty are therefore being remitted overseas, tax

free,   as   they  are  not  within  the  charging

provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it has been found that the greater

the  amount paid by the local distributors to  the

overseas  producers, the smaller is the chargeable

profit  of the local distributors here,  as  these

royalties are deducted from receipts to arrive  at

income.  As  the local distributors  are,  in  the

main, subsidiaries of the overseas producers, they

can  conveniently so arrange their  business  that

the  local distributors pay little income tax, and

the  great bulk of their gross income receipts are

paid  and remitted overseas without being  subject

to local taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the law is such that the royalty

received  by the producer is not subject  to  tax,

since  he  is  non-resident,  and  the  income  is

derived outside Singapore and therefore not income

chargeable  within  the scope of  the  Income  Tax

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is usual that agreements are made outside the

country and payments effected outside, 50 that  it

does  not suffer from local taxation. This exempts

payment  of tax on royalties received by producers

resident  overseas and in addition in  respect  of

producers  resident  in the  United  Kingdom.  The

United Kingdom/Singapore Double Taxation Agreement

exempts  royalties from income tax when  they  are

received  by  producers  resident  in  the  United

Kingdom from Singapore. It is considered desirable

that  some measures be taken to extract a due from

these  overseas producers, and this  objective  is

what the proposed Bill intends to achieve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is based on similar legislation in force in

New Zealand since the 1930's. The main contents of

this   Bill   are  indicated  in  the  Explanatory

Statement.  But there are some main provisions  in

the Bill which should be mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 4, it is proposed to levy with effect

from today a film hire duty in respect of proceeds

which  are  derived  from the renting  of  foreign

films.  It  is not the intention of Government  to

impose   this  tax  on  films  which  are  locally

produced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Renter" and "rent" are defined in clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This duty is not allowed for deduction under

subclause  (8) of clause 4 for purposes of  income

tax on account of loss in revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renters of these films will be required to be

registered under clause 5, and to keep records  as

specified in clause 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are liable to pay duty at the rate of one-quarter of 60 per cent of such gross receipts as

laid out in clause 9. It may be suggested why one-quarter  of  60  per  cent is used  instead  of  a

straight  15  per cent. Perhaps this ought  to  be

explained. Film hire duty is in nature  a  customs

duty,  and therefore the country of origin of  the

contract  has  no  bearing on  the  liability.  In

strict theory, it should be levied on the value of

the  film  imported.  It is virtually  impossible,

however,  to ascertain the value of films  at  the

point  of  entry by ordinary methods of valuation,

such  as actual cost, occurrent domestic value  in

the  country of origin, and so on. The  imposition

of  a  film  hire  duty  seeks  to  overcome  this

difficulty  of  valuation  by  making  the   gross

rentals   derived,  the  determining  factor   for

valuation. How gross receipts from rentals  should

be  calculated  is  set out  in  clause  10.  From

experience  elsewhere, it has been found  that  40

per   cent   of  such  gross  receipts  would   be

considered  quite an adequate allowance  to  cover

expenses   and  for  profit.  It  is,   therefore,

considered that the levy should be imposed on  the

balance of 60 per cent. In other words, for  every

$1  that a non-resident producer takes out of this

country, he is charged 15 cents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I would like to say here that this

quantum  can  be  adjusted in  the  light  of  our

experience. One-quarter is an elastic quantity and

according to subsequent events and experience,  if

necessary, we shall adjust it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 11 there is provision whereby the

Minister may grant exemption in respect of all  or

any of the provisions of the Ordinance. The reason

for  this clause is this: for example, if  a  film

society or a body or any other association  wishes

to  exhibit  a film, we would wish to  exempt  him

from  the  tax defined in this Bill, and therefore

discretion is left to the Minister to so exempt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the purpose of Government to go at the

small fry. We consider that tax should be borne by

those  who  can  bear it, and in  this  particular

instance,  taxation is imposed  upon  non-resident

producers,  those  who  make  the  money  in  this

country  escape from income tax by  devious  ways.

Now  it is natural that we would expect that  when

this film tax is imposed, the renter would try  to

pass  it on to the cinema-going patrons. This  has

been  forestalled by a clause here which says that

the existing admission charges cannot be increased

without the approval of the Minister. This  clause

is  in  clause 13. In other words, when this  Bill

comes into force, there should not be any increase

in  cinema  charges, which, as it is, are  already

high.   There   are  other  clauses   which   make

provisions  for  an  effective collection  of  the

duty.  We  do  not  pretend  that  this  Bill   is

absolutely  perfect. Someone may  find  loopholes.

But  when we discover that someone has used  these

loopholes, we shall plug them quite quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate that in a year, the Government should

be  able  to collect $1 million revenue from  this

taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  venture to hazard the guess that this  Bill  is

going  to  set  a record. From the moment  it  was

conceived  to  the time it is put on  the  statute

book,  the time taken is probably the shortest  in

the history of legislation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

Government  are interested in collecting  as  much

revenue  as  possible, and if what the  Government

are  saying  is correct - that certain non-residents

are escaping the payment of income tax because  of

some  loopholes  in the Income Tax  Ordinance - then

such  people should be made to pay the tax because

the profits are earned in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped that when the

Deputy  Prime  Minister was asked by you,  "Second

Reading when?", he would at least have given us  a

couple  of hours in which to study this Bill,  but

instead  of which the answer was, "At the  end  of

item 5", which meant no time at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intention of Government in doing this is

to prevent the Opposition from raising any queries

on  it, then they have certainly succeeded. But  I

must  protest,  Mr Speaker, Sir, at  the  way  in

which this legislation is being pushed through  in

this  Assembly. The Press had been  informed  some

time  back  that  legislation  was  going  to   be

introduced. I would suggest, with respect  to  the

Government  in  power, that the least  they  could

have  done would have been to take the Members  of

this  Assembly into their confidence and let  them

have  this  Bill for some time in order that  they

might study it and express any views, if they  had

any,  or  support the Bill, as the  case  may  be.

Instead  of  which, even the normal practice  with

regard  to  Bills introduced on a  Certificate  of

Urgency  has not been followed, Mr Speaker,  Sir;

and that is, through your courtesy in such matters

you  send us a cyclostyled copy, and we have  time

at  least to go through it hurriedly, and put  out

any   views  which  we  think  would  assist   the

Government in the consideration of the  Bill.  But

apparently the point and purpose of this procedure

now  being followed by the Government is to muzzle

everybody, even the Opposition - a point which I  do

not  appreciate. If the sole purpose of this  Bill

is to bring into the income tax net those who have

been  escaping  it  by some subterfuge,  then  the

Opposition  would  certainly  have  supported  the

Government.  Where then is the necessity  to  keep

the Bill away from the Opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



Members?  I have nothing to say on the  Bill,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, because I have had no time  to  read

it. I tried to read it, but I had at the same time

to  listen  to  the  Minister  moving  the  Second

Reading.  Between  listening to the  Minister  and

trying to read the Bill, I heard nothing.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I thought I would

hear  wisdom  from the Opposition  bench.  Instead

allegations were made that the Government intended

to  muzzle  the  mouths of those  sitting  on  the

opposite side. I would say this to the hon. Member

for  Farrer Park. If he had heard nothing  between

my  introducing the Bill and my moving the  Second

Reading  of  the Bill, I would recommend  that  he

visit a Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that it is never the intention

of  the  Government either to stifle the voice  of

the  Opposition or not to receive criticisms  from

them.  I  am  quite sure that we  are  capable  of

meeting any challenges which the Opposition should

put  up. Nonetheless, coming to the subject  under

discussion, I would like to say this that when you

see money for the taking, you do not start looking

at - what  does  the  proverb  say - "looking  at  the

teeth...looking at the horse's mouth".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A gift-horse.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, I beg your pardon.

Looking at a gift-horse in the mouth. If there  is

money to be picked, we do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not from my pocket!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Oh, you will feel it quite

soon!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am quite sure the Member for

Farrer Park would be generous enough to contribute

to the coffers of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us proceed with this. As I was saying,

Mr  Speaker,  the cinema business is flourishing.

That  we cannot deny. Much of the development that

has been going on in the past few years is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



visible. You see cinema theatres popping up in all

corners  of  the  island, and  from  that  we  can

conclude  that the number of people who are  going

to  the cinemas is increasing. In fact, Sir, I can

give  you  figures to prove this. For example,  in

1957   alone,  the  total  number  of  full-length

feature  films  imported  into  this  country  and

passed for public exhibition numbered 858. Besides

these full-length feature films, there was a total

number  of 440 shorts. The total footage  censored

came  to  9½ million feet. So the population  of

Singapore had quite an eyeful of films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the major source of entertainment

is  the  cinema. Why that is so I do not wish,  at

this  place  or  at  this time,  to  go  into  the

reasons.  But  it is a fact that it is  the  major

source   of   entertainment,  and   therefore   it

contributes considerably to the prosperity of  all

those  involved  in the cinema industry.  Now,  in

simple  words,  what I would like  to  inform  the

House  is this. The reason for this Bill is  that,

for example, agreements made between the Paramount

Films  of  Malaya Incorporated and  the  Paramount

International Films Incorporated are entered  into

in the United States of America. It is agreed that

the  delivery of all negative and master  positive

prints is to be made in the City of New York,  and

payments under the agreement are to be made at the

office   of  the  Paramount  International   Films

incorporated in New York City in the lawful  money

of the United States of America.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is obvious that in drawing up these

agreements,  action is taken to  ensure  that  the

income  therefrom  cannot be said  to  be  derived

anywhere but in the United States of America. That

being  so,  therefore, any profits made  from  the

renting of films to exhibitors in Singapore do not

come  within  the  scope of the local  Income  Tax

Ordinance.  However,  in  bringing  forward   this

example, I do not wish to make it appear that  the

Government  is  making any discrimination  against

films of any particular country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that in 1957

alone,  there  were  imported 55  films  from  the

United Kingdom, 323



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



films from the United States of America, 277  from

Hongkong,  125  from  India  and  78  from   other

countries. This tax applies equitably to all films

irrespective  of  the country of origin.  Being  a

signatory to G.A.T.T., we are not in a position to

offer preferential treatment to films made in  the

United Kingdom. At the same time, this tax being a

new  one,  we do not conflict with the Ottawa  and

Geneva agreements on imperial preference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this Bill, I wish to point out

that  it  is not our intention to stifle the  film

industry.  But it is also necessary  that  in  the

interest of our people we should extract  our  due

from all those who make money in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.
