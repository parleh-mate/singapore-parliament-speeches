<div align="center"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

what measures can be taken to prevent the further occurrence  of

accidents such as that which occurred on the East Coast  Parkway

when  a  prime  mover ran into a stationary car and  caused  the

death of Mdm Cassandra Khor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, the

accident  involving Mdm Khor was very unfortunate.  The  Traffic

Police  and the Land Transport Authority already have  plans  in

the  coming  months  to  facilitate the  early  towing  away  of

breakdown  vehicles on expressways, as well as  to  control  the

speed of heavy vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA introduced an Expressway Monitoring and Advisory

System  (EMAS)  for the Central Expressway (CTE)  on  1st  March

1998.   EMAS  spots accidents and breakdown vehicles  which  are

then  removed by LTA's towing contractor.  The quick removal  of

obstruction ensures that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>

the  source  of danger is removed as soon as possible  and  also

minimises  delays to other motorists.  EMAS will  eventually  be

extended to the other expressways, like the BKE, PIE and ECP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police is also working with LTA and transport

associations  such  as  the Motor Traders  Association  and  the

Freight  Forwarders  Association to look  into  requiring  heavy

vehicles  to  install  speed  limiters.   These  limiters  would

restrict the speed at which heavy vehicles can travel.  Once the

vehicle  reaches  a  certain pre-determined maximum  speed,  the

petrol-supply to the engine would be regulated, and the  vehicle

would  not be able to travel beyond that speed.   Such  limiters

are  already  in  place in almost all SBS and TIBS  buses.   The

first phase of implementation is expected to start in July  this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides taking preventive measures, the Traffic Police will

also  step  up  its  enforcement against  heavy  vehicles.   The

Traffic  Police  has  been charging drivers  of  heavy  vehicles

involved  in  serious and fatal accidents and,  on  a  selective

basis,  slight injury accidents.  Henceforth, the Traffic Police

will  charge  all drivers of heavy vehicles who are involved  in

accidents in court.  The Traffic Police will also charge drivers

of  heavy vehicles who are caught speeding.  Errant drivers will

be liable for heavier penalties as well as disqualification from

driving.  For careless driving, a first offender will be  liable

to  a  fine  of $1,000 or 3 months imprisonment.  For  dangerous

driving,  the offender will be liable to a fine of up to  $3,000

or  12  months imprisonment or both.  The offender can  also  be

liable to disqualification from driving.  In suitable cases, the

Traffic  Police  will press for a deterrent sentence,  including

imprisonment sentences and disqualification from driving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Traffic Police takes a serious view of motorists

who  blatantly  flout traffic regulations, such  as  driving  on

expressway shoulders.  Expressway shoulders are meant  only  for

vehicles to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>

stop temporarily during emergencies, for example, when a vehicle

breaks down.  Motorists should not treat a road shoulder  as  an

additional  carriageway.  Anyone who drives  on  the  expressway

shoulder  can  be  fined up to $1,000 or 3 months  imprisonment.

The  offender  will also be given 4 demerit  points.   A  repeat

offender can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed up to 6 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Traffic Police is currently reviewing the demerit

points  system.   The  review  will include  all  offences  that

currently   attract  demerit  points,  such  as  driving   along

expressway shoulders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police would also like to advise motorist whose

vehicle  has broken down along the expressway to switch  on  the

hazard  lights  and  display the vehicle  breakdown  sign.   The

motorist  and his passengers should move away from the breakdown

vehicle and stand behind the guard rail.   They should face  the

direction  of  the  on-coming traffic and not venture  onto  the

carriageway at all times.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, when can we

expect  the full implementation of the speed limiters for  heavy

vehicles?  Also, what sort of heavier penalties could we  expect

for  drivers  who violate these laws?  For example,  would  they

have more demerit points than before?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the implementation of the speed

limiters  will be carried out in phases.  The first  phase  will

begin with new heavy vehicles which are registered from 1st July

onwards.   Thereafter, existing heavy vehicles will be installed

with speed limiters in phases over a period of time, and we hope

they  can  do it as soon as possible, because it is  actually  a

very  simple  device  costing just  a  few  hundred  dollars  to

install.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the demerit points and the fines, the whole demerit

point  system is being reviewed, whether it is just  parking  at

demerit  point zones, speeding or any other offence  that  would

attract demerit points.  I think far too many people are beating

red lights and speeding.  These

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>

constitute  about  70% of the total traffic offences.   I  think

motorists  should be advised not to violate any of  the  traffic

regulations because the Traffic Police is earnest and serious in

addressing  this  problem, and they will up the  demerit  points

quite severely.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Since the Minister mentioned that there

will be a review of the demerit points system, in the spirit  of

S21,  would the Minister then guarantee that there would be full

consultation before he implements such a demerit points system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think the public is already quite

unhappy that we have so many motorists who violate the law,  and

that they want the Police to take tough action against them.  An

example  is  this  question  of  illegal  parking.   Readers  of

newspapers would have noted that the newspapers ran a series  of

articles  carrying  views from residents,  motorists  and  other

people  who complained about illegal parking and they  want  the

Police to do more in dealing with this problem.  As a result and

in  response  to  this   -  the Traffic  Police  has  also  been

considering  this   -   the  Police has therefore  demarcated  a

number  of areas to attract demerit points if motorists park  in

these  areas.   And the number of such zones which will  attract

demerit  points  for illegal parking will increase  to  quite  a

significant number.  I can assure Members here that  the  Police

will go all out to deal with this problem.

<div align="center"><b>PARTICIPATION IN SPORTS AMONG FEMALE POPULATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development  what measures are being taken or being contemplated

to  promote participation in sports among the female population,

especially at the community and recreational level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):  Sir,  participation of women in sports  and  physical

fitness  activities has grown considerably since the  launch  of

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>

Sports For Life Programme by the Prime Minister in 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Sports For Life Programme, the Singapore Sports

Council  administers fitness tests and organises  the  Learn-to-Play programme.   Between September 1996 and December 1996, a 4-month  period,  763 women participated in the  Sports  For  Life

Fitness  Assessments.  For the whole of 1997, the number  jumped

to  15,968 and more than doubled to 42,674 in 1998.  Women  make

up  55%,  indeed  a  majority,  of  fitness  test  participants.

Women's  participation  in the Learn-to-Play  Schemes  has  also

increased, from 19,237 in 1996 to 27,735 and 40,145 in 1997  and

1998 respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, women are encouraged to use the

ClubFITT  gymnasium facilities available at the Regional  Sports

and  Fitness Centres.  In 1998, there were 143,922 female users.

This is up from 9,635 in 1996 and 88,200 female users in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, the Singapore Sports Council,

together   with  the  People's  Association  Women's   Executive

Committee  Co-ordinating Council, the Ministry  of  Health,  the

NTUC  Women's Programme Committee and the Singapore  Council  of

Women's  Organisations  (SCWO)  will  be  organising  the  third

National  Sports  Carnival  for Women  on  6th  June  1999.   We

anticipate   that   this   event  will  attract   13,000   women

participants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further emphasise the promotion of women in sports, the

first Women and Sports Conference was held in Singapore in March

this  year,  during which Singapore endorsed the objectives  and

principles   of  the  Brighton  Declaration  to   increase   the

participation of women and girls in sports in Singapore.   As  a

follow-up   to  the  Conference,  a  working  group   is   being

established  to  draw up an action plan to promote  the  greater

participation of women in sports.

<div align="center"><b>SALE OF LAND</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  when will the Government launch the  next  sale  of

land.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, during the budget debate in March this year,  I

informed  the  House  that  the  Government  will  announce   in

September 1999 the land sales for next year.  There is no change

in our schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although demand in the private residential sector has

picked  up in the last quarter of 1998 and the first quarter  of

1999,  there is still ample supply of new private housing units.

As  at  first  quarter of 1999, there were  4,100  launched  but

unsold   units.   Another  9,800  units  had  the  pre-requisite

approvals  to  be  launched for sale.  In addition,  there  were

6,300 units from other land sales projects and 3,700 units  from

private  land  projects under construction which  did  not  have

approval  for sale yet.  This adds up to 24,000 unsold units  in

the  pipeline available for future sales.  A resumption of  land

sales for residential units in year 2000 would ensure that  this

pipeline is maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for land sales for commercial development, the

Government has announced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>

in  June  last year that it would release a site at Clarke  Quay

this  year. There is also sufficient supply of commercial space.

The  supply  of  office  and shop space under  construction  was

790,900 sq metres and 150,300 sq metres respectively as at first

quarter 1999.  These would be sufficient to meet demand for  the

next few years.  We would review the situation and announce  our

plans  for  future  land  sales for commercial  developments  in

September as well.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development why new 4- and 5-room Housing and Development  Board

flats are discernibly smaller than older models of 4- and 5-room

flats  respectively,  especially since the  general  expectation

will be of better and more spacious housing when average incomes

increase.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the aspirations of young families to

have  better and more spacious housing would have to be balanced

with the limited land resource of our small country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the 1970s and the 1980s, we now have smaller

family  units.  We would not be optimising land use  if  we  had

continued  building  new flats of the same  size  as  the  older

models  without  taking into consideration the  family  size  of

today.   However, this does not mean that those  living  in  new

flats  today  are worse off.  The living space  per  person  has

increased through the years due to the reduced household size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can do to meet the higher expectations of today's

young  families is to build flats with better quality,  finishes

and  design.   HDB has also been building more Design-and-Build,

and Design-Plus flats.  The designs of such flats are comparable

with  private  condominiums.  HDB will continue  to  review  the

design and finishes of new HDB flats to meet the preferences and

needs of the majority of flat applicants.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, is it not possible to give potential

applicants  a  choice; in other words, to have 4-room  flats  of

various  sizes, because a certain family size of,  say,  parents

plus  two  children, may only need a 4-room flat, but  they  may

prefer  a  bigger  4-room flat rather than the present  size  of

smaller 4-room flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The 4-room flats come in a wide variety

of  sizes, from the smaller ones, 85 sq metres to 90 sq  metres,

to  above 90 sq metres.  If they want bigger 4-room flats,  they

can  buy  from the resale market, and with the aid  of  the  CPF

housing grant, they can go for the bigger 4-room flats of 100 sq

metres and above.  So there is enough variety in terms of sizes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> But will the Minister not agree that

this  is  precisely the point?  In other words, there  are  some

families that are dropping out of the new queue in order to  buy

resale  flats  of  the  same type, for  example,  4-room  flats,

precisely because they are bigger.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It shows that the policy is working. We

give  them the choice.  They exercise their choice.  We are  not

unhappy about it.  They are happy; we are happy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> But I think here the preference could be

that  they  actually want a new flat, but because of  the  size,

they would have to go for a resale flat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If they want a new flat, then they have

to settle for the small flats.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask

what  is  the  Ministry's policy towards current HDB  owners  of

budget flats, like 4- and 5-room flats, who wish to downgrade to

smaller  flats,  like 3-room flats, due to the  fact  that  they

cannot  afford  payments for the larger  flats  because  of  the

economic downturn?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If they want to downgrade, they can sell

off their 4-room or 5-room flats and buy 3-room flats in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>

resale  market,  as  long  as  they have  satisfied  the  5-year

occupation rule.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Is there any chance for a

review  of the policy on the 5-year rule?  Because some  of  the

newer flat owners who have just taken possession of their 4-room

flats  find  that it is rather difficult to keep up  with  their

payments due to the economic downturn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We will look at each case on its own

merits.   If  indeed, they are under financial stress  and  they

cannot  continue  with  their  payments,  we  will,  of  course,

facilitate  their downgrading to a 3-room flat,  notwithstanding

their not meeting the 5-year occupation rule.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while

agreeing  with  the  Minister  that  the  families  are  getting

smaller, there may be some families, because of affluence,  that

want  to  have  bigger flats.  Would the Minister  consider  the

<div align="center"><b>POLICY ON PROSTITUTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

if  he  will  state  what is the policy of his Ministry  towards

prostitution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, prostitution per se is not an

offence  under  our laws.  This has been so since  the  colonial

days.   Singapore is not the only country where prostitution  is

not  an  offence.   Many other countries  also  adopt  the  same

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments around the world and through the ages have

tried   to  eradicate  prostitution,  but  none  had  succeeded.

Criminalising  prostitution  will  only  drive  such  activities

underground,  resulting in crime syndicates taking control  over

such activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs therefore has taken a

pragmatic  approach of recognising that the  problem  cannot  be

totally suppressed or wished away.  Our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>

approach  is  therefore  to contain the situation,  particularly

through continuing enforcement against prostitutes and pimps who

solicit  in  public.   Soliciting  and  pimping  in  public  are

offences  under  the Miscellaneous Offences  (Public  Order  and

Nuisance) Act and the Women's Charter respectively.  The  Police

also  conduct  regular checks at known locations  and  on  those

involved  in the trade to prevent criminal gangs from exploiting

the prostitutes, and underaged girls from getting involved.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may I ask the Minister whether the strict offences created

under  Part  X  of  the Women's Charter for the  suppression  of

prostitution  and  living  on  immoral  earnings  are   strictly

enforced or not?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If Police receive complaint that

somebody is living on the immoral earnings of somebody, then, of

course, they will take action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell us what checks are

made  to see that hotels do not allow any prostitution in  their

premises?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we have maybe close to 30,000 hotel

rooms  in Singapore and definitely nobody expects the Police  to

go  round  checking all the hotels to ensure that  they  do  not

engage  in prostitution.  But when there are complaints  against

somebody operating a brothel in a hotel, then, of course, Police

will go and take action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are we to understand that this pragmatic

view  that  the Minister says his Ministry has adopted  is  that

this  is something that we cannot do anything about?  So is  the

Ministry considering amending the laws in the Women's Charter?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> What the Ministry has done is to ensure

that crime syndicates, gangsters and secret societies do not get

involved in controlling this trade.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>

And  if they do, then Police will take action.  We all know that

no  country  has ever succeeded in eradicating prostitution  and

therefore  we  have taken a pragmatic approach in ensuring  that

only certain areas have such activities taking place.  And it is

better   that  the  Police  know  where  these  areas  are   and

enforcement  action can be taken, rather than to disperse  these

brothels  to  the whole of Singapore and we have a cat-and-mouse

game chasing after them or, worse still, drive them underground,

and they will be operating everywhere.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Perhaps the Minister did not understand the

import  of  my question.  If it is felt that you cannot  control

it, then is the Ministry considering legalising prostitution and

containing it to just one or two areas in Singapore and  keeping

a strict watch on the premises which indulge in this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, there is no need to legalise it but

we  can  at  the same time deal with the problem in a  pragmatic

way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister realise that if you have

laws  and they are not enforced by the enforcement agencies,  it

only leads to disrespect for the law?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the relevant section in the Women's

Charter  is still being enforced.  If there are underaged  girls

being  involved  in prostitution, if there are  people  coercing

women  or  girls into prostitution, they will face the force  of

the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Would the Minister consider moving

brothel  houses from the city centre - I am speaking  of  Little

India - to somewhere else?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I am not sure I heard clearly his point

about moving what houses from Little India.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> We all know of the fact, Sir, that

Desker  Road is a red light area.  It is right in the  heart  of

the city.  Can we move these brothel houses to elsewhere?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, it is a traditional area. People

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

Singapore   offers   students  a  range  of   higher   education

opportunities.  About 20% of each cohort qualify  to  enter  our

two  universities each year and about 40% of each cohort qualify

for  entry into polytechnics.  And this means that about 60%  of

each  cohort  qualify  for higher qualification  in  either  our

universities  or  polytechnics.  This  is  one  of  the  highest

percentages in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans may also choose to study overseas for various

reasons.   It  would  not be appropriate  for  the  Ministry  of

Education to provide information on foreign universities  as  we

are not in a position to verify or vouch for the information  on

these  institutions.   These  institutions  are  not  under  our

supervision.   There are already many sources of information  on

overseas  universities.  It is therefore not necessary  for  the

Ministry   of   Education  to  provide   information   on   such

universities.    Those  wishing  to  find  out   about   foreign

universities can do so at career and university exhibitions,  as

well as the National Library and agencies like the United States

Education  Information  Centre, the  British  Council,  and  the

Australian Education Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Singaporeans studying overseas, the eight

"Contact Singapore"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans overseas, including the students studying overseas.

There are also more than 70 Overseas Singapore Clubs (OSC)  that

are co-ordinated by the Singapore International Foundation.  The

"Contact  Singapore"  Centres provide  information  on  what  is

happening  in  Singapore and also advice on the jobs  available.

Activities  are also organised to raise our students'  awareness

of  national  issues  and  help them  maintain  their  Singapore

identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of what Contact Singapore does is Contact

Singapore  runs  SEARCH  (or Singapore Employment  Advisory  and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Interview Doctrine will not be

document to guide officers in their work within the framework of

the law.  It contains operational details for smooth running  of

police  work  in  relation to the interviewing of  persons.   In

particular, we cannot be `educating' the criminally-inclined  to

beat the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that the interviewing process set

out  in  the Interview Doctrine is in accordance with the  laws.

This  must be the case as the evidence admitted in Court by  the

the  citizen himself does not know what his rights are and  what

What is the good of having any doctrine locked away in the bosom

of the police officers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, not every citizen offends the law.

Most  of  them do not.  Those few who do really have  reason  to

fear  why  they should be interrogated by the police.  When  the

police  interview  a  person they are  not  interested  in  just

getting  a confession from that person.  They are interested  in

the truth, and in getting the truth, they have to make sure that

they conduct their interview process in accordance with the law.

If  they cannot do it in accordance with the law and the case is

challenged in court, then the whole case will be thrown out.  So

there  is no reason for the police to go all out and get  people

who are innocent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What right has he got? What does he know about his rights?

I  think  Mr  Jeyaretnam himself knows that the Law Society  has

published  a few such publications on "Police Investigation  and

You", "Arrest and Bail", "Proceedings in Court", "Criminal Legal

Aid  Scheme",  and  so on.  And if the person is  interested  in

an  acceptable definition.  The Government welcomes the property

industry  taking  the initiative to define  the  terms  so  that

properties can be marketed in an unambiguous manner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in the

property   market,  there  is  a  standard  sales  and  purchase

agreement.  Why does the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>

not  come  up  with a definition rather than  leave  it  to  the

industry to come up with the definition of "built-in" or "built-up" area?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The sales and purchase agreement covers

a  wide  range of parameters, including the obligations of  both

the  developer  and  the purchaser.  Definitions  regarding  the

quality  and  fixtures are very difficult to pin down.   In  the

official  submissions of developments, URA uses the term  "gross

floor area (GFA)".  That does not convey the same meaning to the

purchaser.   It  is  more technical.  So  some  developers  have

tended  to  use  more market friendly terms, like "built-in"  or

"built-up".   Therefore,  we think we should  leave  it  to  the

market to try and define these terms so that the properties  can

be  marketed  in  as unambiguous a manner as possible.   If  the

Government  were to step in, then the Government is more  likely

to  use  the  more technical terms which have been  established,

like GFA.  But since the industry is prepared to come up with an

acceptable  definition  and  everybody  else  will  follow   the

definition, we will let that surface first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> If the industry is to come up with

the  definition,  would  the Government officially  endorse  the

definition  so that there will be credibility in the enforcement

of it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We will see what the definition is and

what  it  will  cover.   We do not want  to  constrain  the  way

properties are being marketed.  There are so many things that go

into   the  advertisement  brochure.   The  sales  and  purchase

agreement has enough technical parameters, in terms of  schedule

of payments, etc, without us complicating it further.  So let us

wait and see how the market defines it.  And if it is acceptable

and people understand what it is, we will let the matter rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>1.08 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like, first

of  all,  to  commend the Minister and his Committee for  having

completed  such  a  comprehensive,  well-written  and  visionary

report.   Back  in 1997, when the Prime Minister first  launched

the  Singapore  21  Committee to look  into  the  five  apparent

dilemmas,  my  intuitive  reaction was that  the  Committee  was

endeavouring  into areas which are philosophical in  nature  and

very broad in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>

scope.  Many lay people may find it difficult to understand  and

appreciate.   And  I personally have expected the  five  subject

committees to come up with five different reports after  holding

separate meetings, forums, interviews and surveys.  But  I  must

say  that I was pleasantly surprised to receive the final report

in  a  form  that  integrates the derived  wisdom  of  the  five

dilemmas  and  successfully  translate  them  into  five  easily

understood headings and expressed in such an easy language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report, without being dry and stuffy, tells a story to

our  Singaporeans, like what the parents do to  their  children,

how  as  a  united  people we can strive towards  achieving  our

dreams   while  strengthening  the  social  cohesion,  political

stability and the collective will, values and attitudes  of  our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important story. Like any well-run corporation,

a  country needs a mission statement, a vision, so that  it  can

galvanise  its  people's  energy to constructively  achieve  its

goals.  The S21 report, in my opinion, is the mission statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, the contents of the S21 report, although

initiated  by the Government, do not suggest that it comes  from

the  Government alone.  The 6,000 people involved over the 1 1/2

years have contributed to create a dream state, an utopia  in  a

modern  form  for Singapore.  If we achieve it, we would  likely

have   a   socially  and  economically  advanced  nation   where

individuals, whether local or foreign, will be pursuing goals in

life  without  undue stress.  The families and  communities  are

closely-knit  together to provide a strong emotional  and  moral

platform.   The  people in the private and public  sectors  will

work and support one another as if they are merged together.  As

the  Minister stated yesterday, we do not know how long it  will

take.   But until this happens, we will continue to hear  people

lamenting that life in Singapore is too stressful.  People still

cannot get away from their stereotype aims - the 5Cs.  And  very

few would aspire to become artists,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>

musicians,  sportsmen, or even entrepreneurs  because  there  is

either no money in these professions or too much risks in them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, everybody will be chasing after higher

paying  jobs,  speculating in shares and properties,  like  what

they  have been doing in the last two days.  And many have taken

for  granted  that  life is a rose garden.  Then  suddenly,  two

years  ago,  the Asian financial crisis hit us.  Things  changed

drastically.   It  makes  many to rethink  about  the  value  of

keeping a job, about getting help from the family and community,

about  what  businesses we should be in and  how  Singapore  can

survive  and prosper in the face of new challenges in this  fast

changing world.  The timing to have this S21 Committee to  study

the dilemmas cannot be more perfect.  The crisis environment has

made  everyone dig deeper into their soul to reflect and  search

for solution.  The impact of this report will be far less, if it

were presented in better economic times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good part of this report is devoted to the strengthening

of   family   ties  and  community  bonding.   When  one   faces

difficulties in terms of employment and business operation,  all

these become apparent and important.  I can guess now that  more

Singaporeans  have realised Singapore's ability to sail  through

this  crisis better than others because we could act as a people

to resolve difficult problems.  We could cut CPF and pay, reduce

taxes  and fees.  We have built up a strong foundation in family

ties,  community bonding and a strong reserve with  good  fiscal

policies that we now have time and energy to utilise this window

of  opportunities to launch a new direction and platform to move

to the next level of prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many westerners have argued that the Asian culture tends to

be  too selfish and too family-oriented.  It only takes care  of

the  interest  of  the family members and ignores  the  societal

issues  evolving around them.  Well, Singapore has  proved  them

wrong.   By  adhering to our culture of having  strong  extended

families with Government policies constantly calling for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>

and  reinforcing  these values, our society is  relatively  more

peaceful,  self-enhancing and supportive.  Asians tend  to  care

for  their  elders  more  partly  because  of  the  culture   of

respecting  the elders, and also because they realise  how  much

the  elders  have sacrificed to provide shelter, good  education

and  opportunities  to the younger ones.  The  desire  to  bring

honour to their family also provides the impetus to compete  and

excel.   These  cultural values, as  can be  easily  seen,  have

driven  the Asian economy well.  We are in the middle  of  these

cultural  settings, and we probably do not feel the merits  just

as much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I chanced upon talking to a Singapore lady

residing in USA.  She cherished the extended family support  she

used  to  get, particularly during her confinement period,  that

is,  within  one  month  after  giving  birth  to  a  baby.   In

Singapore, many mothers will enjoy the close attention of  their

family  members during the confinement period.  They are  served

with  tonics  and special food.  They are given  massages.   And

many  do  not even have to leave the house for the whole  month.

In  the  USA,  many mothers would have to do all  the  household

chores  immediately  after being discharged from  the  hospital.

And they all have to bring their barely one-week old baby to the

supermarket.   I  wonder how many of our  women  would  like  to

choose the American way of life over Singapore's.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me speak on the topic of an aging population.

There  is no escape that Singapore has one of the fastest  aging

populations.    This   is  a  demographic  fact.    Fortunately,

Singapore has a policy of making everyone to save for his or her

own  old age.  The savings through the CPF scheme will make  our

old  age relatively comfortable.  But I wish to share with  this

House  that,  according  to the latest  studies  by  scientists,

modern  science would prolong our lives substantially.  Many  of

us  may have the chance to live up to the 80s, 90s, or even 100.

If  we retire at 55 or 60 years old, we would have many years to

enjoy  if  we have sufficient savings, or we will suffer  if  we

have  not  enough  savings.  Hence, we  should  all  expect  the

pattern of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>

life  to  change.  The  retirement age will  be  pushed  further

because  of  relatively good health.  But for one to  be  useful

beyond 55 or 60 years old, we have to train and re-train several

times  over.   Therefore,  I support the  concept  of  life-long

learning, as suggested in the report and I strongly endorse that

Singaporeans of all ages must be given opportunities to  upgrade

and to renew their knowledge and skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, most of our forefathers came to Singapore

in  search  of  opportunities.  They were pushed  out  of  their

homeland  for  one reason or another.  They also  brought  along

their  skills  and talents.  Through hard work and thrift,  many

managed to seize the opportunities and they prospered.  Now, the

stage   is  different.   Our  people  face  a  lot  of  external

competition because of globalisation.  Hard work and thrift  are

necessary but they are not sufficient to succeed.  We need  more

education,  more  ideas to create more opportunities,  and  more

synergies  to create wealth.  Hence, we need the foreign  talent

policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a small population, Singapore cannot generate enough

talents to achieve the economies of scale.  We need talents, and

we  need  them badly.  Everyone knows USA is a world  leader  in

technology.  But if USA had not opened its doors to talents from

Germany,  Russia and Asia, it may not do as well as it is  doing

now.   However,  America has now reached a stage  where  it  has

become the world's most powerful magnet, attracting talents from

all  over  the  world  with  the possibility  of  fulfilling  an

unlimited  dream.   And that is the American  heartbeat  to  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while we talk about attracting foreign talents,

we  need  to  ensure that our own talents will not be  attracted

away  and  eventually abandon us.  There is no  denial  that  we

expect   our  local  and  foreign  talents  to  shuttle  between

Singapore and a country like USA.  To make them feel attached to

Singapore and continue to contribute to Singapore will be  quite

a tall order.  Not only do we need to let these talents feel the

Singapore  heartbeat,  we may have to  make  our  own  heartbeat

louder than others.  That leads me to argue

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>

that we have to change some of the social order here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Report calls for opportunities for all and

for  the  more successful to help the less successful.  On  this

point,  in my opinion, we have a long way to go.  There  are,  I

think,  some  emotional and moral issues we have not  addressed,

that  is,  the way people are treated.  The people  will  always

feel attached if they are treated fairly and with compassion. It

is  difficult to cultivate loyalty if the relationships are  not

fair.    The   relationships  here  may  refer  to   contractual

relationships between big companies and small companies, between

banks  and their customers, between the employers and employees,

etc.  In numerous instances, there exists a situation of the big

bullying  the small, and the powerful bullying the weak.   There

are  hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans out there who do  not

have  much  education and they do not know very well  about  the

legal  aspects.  But they still need to enter into contracts  if

they  want  to  make a living.  With contracts written  in  fine

prints  and  biased terms, their lives can be  crippled  easily.

Even  for  those who can read, the situation is not much  better

because  the big boys will always draft such contracts that  the

risks  and rewards are not appropriately distributed.   The  law

and  order  situation in Singapore has, in some ways, given  the

advantage to the big boys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attain the goal of making every Singaporean counts and

opportunities  for all, we as a people should strive  towards  a

fair and just society, which will in turn bring out the best  of

each person.  To this end, I am glad that Singapore has moved in

the right direction.  It adopted the UK's Fair Contract Term Act

1977 to protect the consumers.  If we can implement this concept

more  pervasively  and extend to all aspects  of  life,  we  may

become  one of the fairest and most just societies in the world.

This  will add a lot to the reputation of Singapore as a  global

centre and will enhance our heartbeat substantially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another matter related to fairness, I think the

relatively high percentage of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>

people  surveyed  who  feel that they are second-class  citizens

could  be a true reflection of the real feelings of our  people.

They  probably  harbour such feelings even  before  the  foreign

talent  policy was introduced.  Manifested in various  forms  in

the  past,  our  society is often said to be pro-foreign.   Many

contracts  go  to foreigners.  Sometimes, foreign  products  and

services are preferred to the local ones at a higher cost.   So,

when it comes to jobs, the natural mindset is that they will  go

to  the foreigners too.  Yes, many locals might not have been as

good  as  the foreigners.  Many foreign companies are bigger  in

size  or older than our whole nation.  Naturally, they will have

the  products  and  services to beat us.   If  we  do  not  give

opportunities to the locals, then effectively, we have no  self-pride that we can do equally well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope the Government will remove the "Buy IBM"

mentality  to allay the fear that Singaporeans have for  foreign

talent.   The "Buy IBM" mentality refers to the situation  where

the  data processing managers would always choose big names like

IBM  because it is well-known.  If something goes wrong,  it  is

not  the  fault  of the manager.  This mentality has  helped  to

build  up  risk-aversion and it permeates throughout  the  whole

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with unfair terms of contracts, as mentioned

earlier, the whole process has created a "Head, I win, tail, you

lose"  situation.   In a society laden with these  shortcomings,

you  can  expect  the  social and economic  costs  to  be  high.

Therefore,  I  strongly support the Singapore 21  recommendation

that  we should overcome our kiasu attitude and give everyone  a

fair chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of active citizens, I wish to relate one

incident  I  encountered  recently.   A  very  prominent   local

businessman discussed with me about the experience of  being  an

NMP.   In  his  opinion, being an NMP could be a burden  to  the

conduct of business because NMPs could offend the civil servants

in  the  course  of parliamentary debates. I  do  not  think  so

personally and, so far, it does not seem to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>

be  so.   I  think the civil service is mature enough to  accept

constructive   criticisms.    They   are   able   to   make    a

differentiation  between  official and  personal  business.   In

Chinese, we call it dui shi bu dui ren.  The Singapore 21 report

also  aptly says, "There should be no loss of face by the public

sector  if  good ideas come from the people."  As  a  matter  of

fact,   I  am  quite  satisfied  with  the  response  from   the

politicians and the civil servants to the issues I have  brought

up and debated in this House so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, based on my experience as an NMP, I do not hesitate

to  echo  the  call  of the S21 Committee  to  get  more  active

citizens to participate in the civic life of Singapore so as  to

have  a  dynamic  people sector to complement  the  private  and

public sectors.  Today, there may not be enough Singaporeans who

can be classified as active citizens.  With clearer OB lines and

encouragement, I am sure more and more Singaporeans will realise

that they have a stake in our nation and by getting involved and

making their contributions, they can make the nation prosper and

they will be the ones who have it all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to request the Minister to look into

producing  the report in other languages with equal quality  and

substance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and

Minister  for  Community  Development  (Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen)  (In

Mandarin):  Sir, I strongly agree and fully support  the  motion

standing  in  the  name  of  the Minister  for  Education.  This

Singapore 21 Vision has already been set out very clearly in the

book  and I do not wish to waste the precious time of this House

to deal with the materials in this book itself.  I would like to

just raise a point of emphasis and a point of reminder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a point of emphasis: If we want to achieve the S21

vision, we must ask what we can do for S21 and not what S21  can

do  for us.  In other words, we must be pro-active.  We must ask

ourselves what we must do to achieve Vision 21 and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>

should not confine ourselves to just wishing the realisation  of

S21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people commented that the five ideas in the S21 Vision

were  obvious and there was no need to take such a long time  of

one  and  a  half years and involve over 6,000 people  and  many

working hours to churn out these apparently obvious proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I met a friend who said that the time that

the   Committee  and  the  6,000  Singaporeans  had  spent,   if

calculated  in terms of dollars and cents, would be  a  gigantic

sum.   But  I  feel  that the people who advance  this  kind  of

argument just do not understand.  Yes, if we only talk and never

do  anything about it, then this argument may be valid.   If  we

talk  and  just stop there, it would have been a waste of  time.

But  this is only a beginning.  This process of the 1 1/2  years

of  talk  was to reach a consensus to facilitate future  action.

We  do  need  to spend time and energy to obtain this consensus.

As  a matter of fact, all the members, including myself, of  the

S21  Committee and all those Singaporeans who have  participated

in  these  meetings, unanimously agree that the  S21  Vision  is

something  that  we  must  translate into  action.   It  is  not

something  that  we just talk about and forget  about  it.   The

point  is:   what  can  we do and what action  can  we  take  to

translate the vision into a reality?  What efforts must we  make

to  achieve  this?   This is the question  that  we  should  ask

ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we want to achieve our vision, we must

practise  what  we  preach and strive for  positive  results  in

whatever we do.  If we do not do anything, if you just doubt the

sincerity, shun your responsibilities and just indulge in  empty

talks, big things you cannot do and small things you do not want

to do, then we will be losing the golden opportunities available

to  us.  Therefore, I hope that we will not just sit tight, talk

and  do nothing.  We should stand up and think about what to do,

what  action  to  take to realise our vision, our  ideal.   That

being  the  case,  let  us  prepare ourselves  to  take  up  the

challenge, and put the theories into action.  I think our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>

responsibility  can  be summed up in these  words:  "Be  a  good

man/woman.   Set  up  a good family.  Serve the  community.   Be

passionate about the nation."  So start with yourself  and  your

family.  Set it right.  Let our children have a good foundation,

a good learning environment and a good model to emulate to build

up  good character and conduct.  It is only then that we will be

able  to  reduce social problems correspondingly.  A  knowledge-based economy and good work attitude would then have a chance to

take  roots.  If you extrapolate this kind of good conduct, good

character  to  others, you will have the mood, ability,  passion

and  heartware  to  think  about how  to  look  after  the  less

successful  people in society so that we can build up  a  caring

and gracious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that we are young and energetic - but

fortune  may change.  There may come a day when you  and  I  may

need the help of others.  If we can take the necessary action in

our  early  days to build a gracious society and a society  with

care  and compassion, then with this kind of ethos in place,  it

will  be easier for us to get help.  Also, since we have already

given,  when  we  want  to take something in  the  give-and-take

spirit,  we  will  be  able  to  take  without  having  to  feel

embarrassed.   So, you have a sense of security, it  is  a  good

home  that we want to build.  The family, of course,  is  a  key

cornerstone  of  society.   This  is  undoubtedly  so.   In  the

Confucian teaching, the five relationships, ie, the King and the

subjects,  the  parents  and  children,  brothers  and  sisters,

husband and wife, and friends, three of these five relationships

involve the family.  Our Malay and Indian compatriots also  have

similar emphasis on the family.  In fact, I note that the  Malay

and Indian friends are even stronger in their family cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, there is no need for me to emphasise more on

the  importance of the family.  However, I wish to point out the

potential of the concept of Tri-generation Network in  the  21st

century.   At the present moment, it is not easy to  have  three

generations under one roof.  The success

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>

of  our  home ownership scheme has enabled our young  people  to

build  their own families once they get married.  However,  even

if  the  three  generations  do  not  stay  together,  the  Tri-generation Network should still be maintained.  The Network  has

great  potential  and  importance in our  society  in  the  21st

century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Peh Chin Hua also referred to this point. In

the  21st  century, we would have this "sandwiched  generation",

whose  ages are in the 30s and 40s.  They have, on the one hand,

to  be  filial to their parents and, on the other hand, to bring

up  their  children,  while  simultaneously  building  up  their

business   and  career.  These  people  are  facing   tremendous

pressure.   Without  proper support, I  think  this  "sandwiched

generation" would become a "besieged generation".   But  if  the

grandparents can chip in to take the role of looking after their

grandchildren,  then  the pressure of the sandwiched  generation

can  be  alleviated.   At the same time, we have  tri-generation

cooperation  -  grandparents help look after the  grandchildren,

thus  playing  a  key role which help gain the  appreciation  of

their children in the "sandwiched generation".  If we have  this

kind  of strong three-generation ties, then family cohesion  can

be strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 years from now, when I am in my 70s, with Tri-generation

Network,  I  would command better respect as an old man  in  the

family.   If I just sit down at home and do nothing, I think  my

children will not respect me.  They would then not be filial  to

me.   I  feel  that in the 21st century, we must  reiterate  the

important  status  of the grandparents.  In this  connection,  I

have suggested to the Ministry of Community Development and  the

People's  Association that we should promote  Grandparents'  Day

celebration to more grassroots organisations during this  year's

Senior  Citizens Week.  We have Father's Day and  Mother's  Day.

Why  can  we not have a Grandparents' Day?  Mr Loh Meng See  did

this  in  his community centre last year.  I think  this  is  an

excellent  idea.   We  should extend this Grandparents'  Day  to

other  grassroots  organisations.   Once  Grandparents'  Day  is

established, more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>

people  will  better appreciate the importance of  grandparents,

and the grandparents in the 21st century will be able to play  a

greater  role  and get greater respect from their  children  and

grandchildren.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can all play our roles and do what I have just set

out  earlier,  I  believe we will be able to move  forward  with

peace of mind, with the knowledge that whenever we encounter any

setbacks,  we  will be able to fall back on our gracious  social

environment, whether at home or in society, to take a break  and

recover from the setbacks.  We will then be able to make a  come

back  from  our setback, create another tomorrow, and  become  a

great  hero again.  If we can do this, we will be able to attack

as  we  advance and defend as we retreat.  This will be of great

help  and  it  will  give us great confidence in  realising  our

vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concerns raised by Mr Chuang Shaw Peng can also be

solved.  Since we are confident we can attack as we advance  and

defend as we retreat, we will have greater confidence and lesser

worries.   We will not worry unnecessarily and will  not  be  so

kiasu.   We  will have greater spirit of enterprise and  broader

vision.  We will be more prepared and able to realise the vision

of S21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a reminder. We must always remember that we are a

multi-racial society.  We must seek strength through  diversity.

Why  do  I  want to bring up this diversity and multi-racialism?

Recent  discussions  about SAP schools, language  policies,  and

employment  criteria gave me mixed feelings.  I think  the  most

important  point  here  is that all these  talks  and  arguments

remind  us that if we want to realise the five ideas in the  S21

vision,  we  must never forget that Singapore is a  multi-racial

and  multi-cultural society.  This fact is so today and it  will

remain  so tomorrow.  In the 21st century and even in  the  22nd

century and beyond, it will remain the same - multi-cultural and

multi-racial.  Since nation building, we have done a great  deal

to achieve racial harmony.  Our multi-racial people have already

benefitted much from the heritage and wisdom in our multi-racial

society.  This is in fact

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>

the strong point that we have for nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future years, we must also continue to take advantage of

this  heritage. We can all see that the five ideas  in  our  S21

vision are founded on multi-racialism and multi-culturalism.  We

must  continue to strengthen and preserve this heritage.  If  we

cannot  do so, how can we say that every Singaporean count?   If

there  is  no  racial harmony, how can we have a  strong  social

foundation?  How are we going to create opportunities  for  all?

And how are we going to have a Singapore heartbeat?  How are  we

going  to  have active citizens making a difference to  society?

Therefore, I must reiterate and remind our people that  we  must

have  pride  in  our own culture, and we must also  respect  the

cultures  of  others.   This is the essence  of  a  multi-racial

society and country.  It is also the cornerstone for our  future

regionalisation, globalisation and networking strategy.   If  we

cannot  even handle our own multi-culturalism today, how are  we

going  to  globalise, regionalise and to face more cultures  and

more ways of doing things in the world outside?  I think this is

a  very  basic  issue.   This  is not  something  that  we  have

discovered only today.  But it is always the magnanimity that we

have seen and observed over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my own personal experience, I would like to throw more

light  on  this issue.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I was educated  in  the

Chinese  stream in my younger days.  The Chinese school at  that

time was different from the present Chinese school.  In  the old

Chinese school, there were no Indian or Malay students.  We were

all  Chinese speaking and our English was not very good, and  we

could  not  even  read the English newspapers properly  at  that

time.   In  spite  of all that, at that time, I  had  a  lot  of

opportunities to read the writings of the writers  and  scholars

of  Singapore and Malaysia in Chinese.  Through their  works,  I

was  able to understand and respect the cultures of other races.

For  example, I do not know whether hon. Members of  this  House

are  aware  that  one  Prof.  Hsu Yun  Chiaw  had  compiled  and

translated the Malay classic Sejarah Melayu or Malay Annals.   I

still have a copy of the Chinese

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>

translation.  This book tells us about Malay  history  from  Sri

Vijaya to the Malacca Kingdom. Through this book, I was able  to

understand the Malay culture, its progress and advancement.   At

that time, we were able to read fables of Sang Kancil, the mouse-deer.  Sang Kancil is very intelligent, very alert, but is  very

small  and will not harm others. Though it is not big enough  to

attack others, others will find it difficult to bully the mouse-deer  because it is very alert.  So it is able to start up  good

schemes  to extricate itself from situations and run  away  from

its predators.  Having read these fables, I think I learnt a lot

of lessons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Chinese version, I have also read about the epics

of  Mahabarata  and the Ramayana.  I do not know  who  were  the

Chinese  writers in Malaysia and Singapore who translated  these

into  the  Chinese  language.  In an episode in  Ramayana,  Lord

Rama's wife was abducted by a demon.  In order to save his wife,

he  had  to leave his country.   At that time, he was the  King.

Before he left his country, he asked his younger brother to look

after  the country.  He said that he would return after rescuing

his  wife.  His younger brother said, "I do not have the  wisdom

and  ability  to rule the country on your behalf.  But  I  know,

brother, this is something that you must do.  So I will just  do

my  best.  I will sit beside your throne and put your sandals on

the  throne.   You remain the person who is ruling the  country.

I  am  only  your agent, your servant, acting on  your  behalf."

That is what the younger brother said to Ramayana. You must have

respect  for  the elders, you must have shame, you must  have  a

sense of right and wrong.  So this is a story that portrays  all

these values.  It is a very useful and meaningful lesson for  us

to  learn.  When you do not have the legitimacy, you cannot have

the moral ground, and you cannot succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading these, one realises the many parallels between the

cultures and teachings of our ethnic communities.  Being in  SAP

schools will not stop students from learning about the Malay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>

and  Indian cultures if there is a will to learn.  We must  know

more about one another and we must strengthen our solidarity and

through different ways and means, we must promulgate the  values

which  are  common in all of us, so that we will  not  lose  our

direction in future.  When I was young, the influence that I had

was  very useful to me when I grew up.  When I was older, I went

overseas,  I  met foreign friends.  Because I have always  lived

and  grown  up  in a multi-racial society, when I  meet  foreign

friends, whether they are from Africa, Asia, America, Europe,  I

am   able  to mix well with them.  Because I come from a  multi-racial  society,  I  am  interested  and  respectful  of   other

cultures.   So  when my friends talk about their  countries  and

their history, I listened with respect, with curiosity, and with

the  desire to understand more.  So we can talk well, we can mix

well,  and we can interact well.  I learn from them and learn  a

lot of good things and benefit a great deal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I also gain some understanding and

knowledge  about their history and culture.  And this proves  to

be  helpful to me when I handle overseas projects.  It  is  very

easy  for me to communicate with them.  If you do not understand

a certain country, and you need to talk to their businessmen, to

the  clients, it will be difficult.  But, if you understand  the

country  and  its  culture,  it  will  be  easier  for  you   to

communicate with the people from the country.  So we must always

remember that we have a multi-racial and multi-cultural society.

This  is  a great cornerstone, a great advantage, and  a  strong

point.   We must do all we can to preserve this advantage,  this

strong  point,  so that we can achieve even greater  success  in

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, when we talk about the S21 Vision, we must build

on what we have achieved.  We must have self-cultivation, family

cohesion,  service to society and loyalty to  nation.   We  must

continue   to  enhance  our  multi-racial  harmony  and   social

cohesion.  It is only then that we are able to lay down  a  very

strong foundation for our society and country.  We will be  able

to  strengthen our family, so that we can attack as we  advance,

and defend as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>

we retreat.  We will have greater confidence in our action.  All

our  people are more united together in realising the  challenge

and ambition of S21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the motion in the name

of the Minister for Education on the S21 Vision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in my younger days, whenever my parents and I walked  past

the Robinsons Departmental Store at Raffles Place, we just could

not  pluck  up  enough courage to walk through the  entrance  to

enter  the store.  The only luxury we had was to peep  into  the

store  through the main entrance. Why did we not dare  to  enter

the shop?  Because at that time, Robinsons was perceived to be a

departmental  store for the ang mohs.  At that  time,  Singapore

was  still  not  our home.  We had to be careful about  what  we

could do and could not do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Jalan Besar said he had the

courage to do so.  We saw his photograph with his Porsche in the

newspapers  this morning.  If this was 30-odd years ago,  people

would  call him lau hero or since he would be much younger then,

people  might  call him lau Yankee.  At that time,  the  Cricket

Club  opposite  Parliament House was  a  typical  club  for  the

Englishmen,  and  not far from there stood Raffles  Hotel,  also

another  place  where the locals did not dare to  set  foot  on.

Why?   Because  Singapore was then still not our  home.   Today,

Robinsons,  the Cricket Club and Raffles Hotel are places  where

Singaporeans  patronise  freely.  Why?   Because  Singapore  has

gained independence.  It is now our home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore today, foreigners throng our

public  places.   They  came  to Singapore,  and  together  with

Singaporeans,  they create wealth and prosperity for  themselves

and for Singapore.  We have loosely referred to these people  as

"foreign  talents".   But  some  Singaporeans  think   that   by

admitting  foreign  talents,  we  are  marginalising  our  local

talents.  Some perceive that by labelling foreigners as talents,

we give the impression that Singapore has no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>

talent  and  has to rely on foreign talents.  I am of  the  view

that  Singaporeans  who  have this misconception  are  small  in

number,  but  we  should  try  to  correct  such  misconception.

Clearly,  Singapore is a country that values talents, foreigners

and  Singaporeans  alike.   Singaporeans  themselves  appreciate

talents  too.   The Star Search Contest is a good  example.   We

could  see  that the two comperes that night were not  born  and

bred  in  Singapore.  But they won Singaporeans over with  their

wits  and  showmanship.  The Star Search winners on  that  night

were  also  not born and bred in Singapore.  Singaporeans  rated

them highly just the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Asian financial crisis struck at the

time  when  we were drawing up our vision for the 21st  century.

Singapore  was also affected by the crisis.  Singaporeans  begin

to  worry that their jobs may be taken over by foreigners.  They

fear that foreigners will compete with them for their children's

places  in  schools.   For this reason, some  Singaporeans  have

misgivings  about  foreigners.  The worries  of  this  group  of

people are understandable and can be overcome.  We only need  to

ask  ourselves: has the Singapore Government ever neglected  the

interests  of Singaporeans?  Has it not placed great  importance

to  the  progress  of  Singaporeans?  The  Government  has  gone

through  great lengths to attract foreign direct investments  to

create job opportunities for our people.  To ensure that workers

have  the skills for the new industries, the Government has been

disbursing  funds through various channels, including  the  NTUC

which  runs a series of skills redevelopment programmes to raise

the  skill levels of the workers.  Some companies employ foreign

workers   to  meet  their  expansion  needs.   But   then   some

Singaporeans  think that foreigners have robbed  them  of  their

chances of getting the job.  This is not true.  By employing one

foreigner, it may bring more job opportunities for Singaporeans.

Let me illustrate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we take an SIA flight, we would have noticed that the

cabin crew consists not only of Singaporeans but also other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>

nationalities.  If the flight is bound for Tokyo, there will  be

Japanese SIA girls.  If the flights are to Taipei and Hong Kong,

there  will be Hokkein-speaking or Cantonese-speaking SIA  girls

from  Taiwan  and Hong Kong.  Singaporeans enjoy  the  value  of

these  foreign SIA girls. They appreciate these foreign  talents

and  find  every  excuse  to strike up conversation  with  them.

Foreign  passengers  also  appreciate them  because  the  native

accents  of these foreign SIA girls make them feel very much  at

home.   If we have more Japanese, Koreans, Americans and  French

flying  SIA because of SIA's efforts to make them feel at  home,

there  will  be  more demands for flights to these destinations.

Consequently, we would need more foreign SIA girls and even more

local SIA girls.  So these foreign workers do not take away  our

rice  bowls.   On  the  contrary, they have  created   more  job

opportunities for our local people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the idea of opportunities for all, that

every Singaporean should have the opportunity to give full  play

to  his  potential and be recognised for that,  is what we  have

been striving for.  Over the last three years, many of our taxi-drivers, bus-drivers, cleaners and healthcare workers have  been

picked  as model workers.  They received their awards  from  the

Prime Minister.  This year, another 100 workers from our seaport

and  airport will also be receiving the Model Worker Awards from

the Prime Minister.  How many countries honour their workers  in

this  way?  We will nurture local talents to develop their  full

potential.   But we also need foreign workers.  This is  because

we do not have enough talent.  While we make use of what we have

as  much as possible, we must also adopt an open mind to embrace

foreign talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in ancient China, bright and ambitious

scholars  sat for the Imperial Examinations to earn a  place  in

the  Imperial  Court.   Very often, the emperor  would  eye  the

scholar who emerged first or what we call the zuan yuan to  give

him  the  hand of the princess.  The emperor knew that the  zuan

yuan was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>

the  best  talent  in  the country.  Similarly,  company  bosses

sometimes  marry  their daughters to their employees  whom  they

consider  to be of high calibre.  On the same logic and  reason,

why  should  Singapore not bring in foreign talent?   I  believe

Singaporeans would understand this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the five ideas of the Singapore 21: Every

Singaporean  Matters; Strong Families: Our  Foundation  and  Our

Future;  Opportunities for All: The Singapore Heartbeat: Feeling

Passionately   about  Singapore;  Active  Citizens:   Making   a

Difference to Society; and Together, We Make the Difference  are

inter-related.   The five basic beliefs are spin-offs  from  our

Shared  Values.   The Shared Values are Nation before  Community

and  Society  above  Self; Family as a Basic  Unit  of  Society;

Community Support and Respect for the Individual; Consensus, Not

Conflict; Racial and Religious Harmony.  As we strive to realise

our  vision in the 21st century, our shared values still  stand.

We must not lax in upholding these values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of a family trip I took a few years ago.

My family went on a trip to the United States and Canada with  a

tour group consisting of about 30 Singaporeans.  Throughout  the

trip,  we  heard a constant stream of grouses among Singaporeans

of  this group.  The SIA flight we took was delayed due to  some

technical  problems.  When we arrived in the United States,  the

airline  gave every passenger a box of chocolates as a token  of

its  apology.  A Singaporean was heard saying, "They think  that

we  can be appeased with a box of chocolates!  We should sue the

company. We should fine them $300.  Get compensation from them!"

This is how Singaporeans feel about matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year we went on another trip to the Silk Road in

China.   There  were some 60 Singaporeans in  that  group.   The

train  took us through the Gobi desert.  Throughout the journey,

as  the group members took in the magnificent sights, they could

be  heard heaping praises on Singapore's policies and the way of

doing things.  My daughter asked me, "Well,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>

these  are  all  Singaporeans.  Why do they  have  so  different

views?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a reality of our society. As we

discuss  the  Singapore  21  ideas,  we  must  concede  to   the

vulnerability of the Singapore society.  Singapore is a  society

with  few communities.  Recently, the discussions on the Chinese

elite, the SAP schools and the scholarship controversy remind us

that  for Singapore to successfully move to a knowledge  economy

and realise its 21st century ideas, we must work very hard.   We

must  increase  the  common ground of our  multi-racial,  multi-lingual and multi-religious society.  Most importantly, we  need

to  go  back to our basic values.  We must not give up our basic

values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 30 years, the ideas of Singapore 21

will bear fruit.  By that time, Admiral Teo would be in his 70s.

If by then we have the chance to meet again, we will still agree

that  it  is  because  of  our  pragmatism  and  diligence  that

Singaporeans  are able to realise its vision and  scale  greater

heights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, thank you for catching your eye and

for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report by the Singapore 21 Committee which was

headed  by  our Minister for Education and 10 other  Members  of

this  House has received wide support from the public  since  it

was launched by the Prime Minister on 24th April 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a political manifesto. It is a study by

both  the  PAP  and non-PAP MPs, namely, my two NMP  colleagues.

More  than  that, it has seen the participation  by  some  6,000

Singaporeans  whose  contributions  the  Committee  has  rightly

acknowledged.   These  people come from different  organisations

and they included Members of this House.  I see the names of  Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang and Mr S. Iswaran and many other  names,  some

familiar,  some not familiar.  Sir, the contributions have  come

from community

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>

leaders, self-help groups, professional bodies and civic bodies.

In fact, they cover the mood of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been active public discussions and it should be

so.   The  public interest has been aroused.  Sir,  I  was  very

touched and impressed by last Saturday's Insight Report  by  two

Straits Times' journalists, Warren Fernandez and Chua Lee Hoong.

Both of them were in fact members of the Committee.  It reflects

the  thinking of young Singaporeans about Singapore.  With  your

permission, Sir, may I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every Singaporean must matter as an end in itself. And

every  Singaporean will matter only when other Singaporeans  let

them  feel  that they too are valued.  Put in this context,  the

ideal  that  `Every Singaporean Matters' is no  mere  motherhood

statement.   It  is  a  bold, radical,  ambitious  view  of  how

Singaporeans want society to be, and what it must do to make  it

so."

<br><br>This epitomises the values that many Members have tried to raise

in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge all political parties to join hands with

the  Government because on Singapore 21, we cannot afford to  be

partisan.  We must develop a strong sense of attachment to  this

country.  As the Prime Minister has always said, we must have  a

passion for our nation.  This is where our roots lie and this is

where our children's future lies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in seven chapters, the Committee has studied the

problems  we are facing and also provided the answer.  The  five

dilemmas that the Committee faced are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Less stressful life vs Retaining the drive;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Needs of senior citizens vs Aspirations of the young;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Attracting talent vs Looking after Singaporeans;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Internationalisation/Regionalisation vs Singapore as

Home;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Consultation and consensus vs Decisiveness and quick in

action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of these five dilemmas have come five ideas and these five

ideas are worthy of consideration by this House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for us to create a vibrant Singapore

where every citizen feels for his country and is prepared to  do

his utmost for the country.  This is our heartland.  This is our

motherland.   Citizens, whether born in Singapore or  those  who

decided  to  make this their home, have only one dream,  to  see

Singapore prosper and that people enjoy a good life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the other countries, Sir, we are a very young

nation.   Future generations of Singaporeans will look upon  us.

They will ask if we had laid a strong foundation.  If the answer

is positive, then they will credit us and strengthen the system.

If  we are weak and divided, they will never forgive us for  our

sins   of   commission.   Singaporeans  must  provide  emotional

anchors.  And let me quote from the Report:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore is home because of emotional and social anchors

in  the  country.  Family, friendship, fond memories of  growing

up,  landmarks,  well-known  areas and  buildings  -  all  these

provide  a  feeling of familiarity and comfort in the  midst  of

rapid change."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will recollect that some years ago this House

endorsed the Shared Values.  These are important values.  One of

the values is consensus building.  The Government must encourage

the  process of consultation.  Some people feel the  process  of

consultation  is  a  mere public relations exercise.   They  are

wrong.   When Government leaders do not agree with the  proposal

or   criticism,  I  urge  them  that  they  should  not   become

adversarial.   Take Catherine Lim's episode.   One  of  the  MPs

could  have  replied.  But it would occupy more  space  than  it

deserved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on another political innovation of

Singapore  which is a creature of Prime Minister Goh  Chok  Tong

and  I  refer to the GPC.  It is a very novel institution, still

young in Singapore.  I remember President Wee in his address  to

Parliament  years  back  said  that  the  GPC's  role  would  be

enlarged.   The  Prime Minister also said that  the  GPC's  role

would  be  increased to gather views from the public.   I  would

urge the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>

to  seriously  consider  how the GPC's  role  could  be  further

increased  to  reflect the public view.  I would also  urge  the

Government   to   give  the  GPC  financial  and  administrative

assistance so that it can be more effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before a Bill is introduced, the Minister would often

take  the  GPC into confidence.  The GPC could organise feedback

with  interested groups to study the issue.  This is a  valuable

institution  and  we should try to see how this  body  could  be

further strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, the House has seen two Select Committee

Reports  submitted and I refer to the Administration  of  Muslim

Law  (Amendment)  Bill and the Land Titles (Strata)  (Amendment)

Bill.  Both these committees received numerous public proposals.

It shows that our public is concerned.  It shows something more.

The  Select  Committee, the Government and this  Parliament  are

concerned with the public views.  The public views were in  fact

incorporated in the law.  Indirectly, the public has become  law

makers.  Very few countries have this institution as we have  it

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue which I would like to touch on is active

citizenship.  The Report says, and I quote again:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will benefit from greater responsiveness, more

consultation and a wider range of views and ideas.  The crux  is

how  to  do  so without losing the efficiency, decisiveness  and

collective action that has enabled Singaporeans to thrive.   How

do   we   build  more  mutual  respect,  trust,  ownership   and

participation, so that our many contributions and  efforts  will

combine together to steer Singapore to a brighter future?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consultative process has already started some

years  back  and  it is being strengthened.  Before  any  public

policy  is introduced, our Ministers, MPs and community  leaders

get the feel of the ground, listen to public views and then take

into  consideration these views when the policy  is  formulated.

This  is  a  good policy and we should see how we could  further

strengthen this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would urge the Government to do is when a public

proposal is accepted, the Government should acknowledge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>

publicly that this is a public proposal and give credit  to  the

people who have introduced it.  In this way, the public would be

encouraged to submit their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge both the Government party and Opposition

parties  to  come to terms with the fundamental values  that  we

share  in  this  country.   They are our  sovereignty,  national

defence,  multi-racialism  and  multi-lingualism.   To  question

these  values  is  to destroy the very fabric of  our  Singapore

society.   We  must take steps to strengthen  these  values.   I

remember that some years back, when the Maintenance of Religious

Harmony  Bill was introduced, some people felt that  it  was  an

infringement.  We have seen that, because of this law, there has

not  been a single case of any religious disturbance.   It  just

goes  to  show  how  farsighted the  Government  was.   In  many

countries, the opposite is the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans feel that if they do not agree with the

Government's  policies,  they would be  black-listed.   This  is

indeed very sad.  There must be mutual respect and trust between

the people and the Government.  We must allow diverging views to

appear and try to work out a consensus.  But we must at the same

time  admit  that not all views can be accommodated.   So  those

whose views are not accepted must see it in this perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can only have a vision and a dream if we have a

strong  and  stable Government.  We have seen the fate  of  weak

governments and, worse of all, coalition governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must evolve our own political culture. The British

system  is  adversarial.  We should encourage, as  I  have  said

earlier,  consensus  building.  We must  institutionalise  these

into our political process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, may I urge some change in the thinking.

In many of the former British colonies, we call the ruling party

as  the  government  party  and  the  opposition  party  as  the

opposition.   A  better  phraseology  would  be  to   call   the

Government party as the majority party and the opposition as the

minority party.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the title of the Report "Together, We Make the

Difference" is very apt.  These five words are pancharatna which

in  Sanskrit and Hindi means five jewels.  In Malay, I think  it

means the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me share my own experience with one organisation

with  which  I have been involved.  I would like to disclose  my

interest  that I am a member of the Hindu Advisory Board  and  a

former member of the Hindu Endowments Board (HEB).  The HEB  has

been  involved in many community projects.  We have seen  active

participation  by  the  Hindu  community  in  various  projects,

whether  it  is  in  the area of education, social  or  medical.

Because we have a strong leadership.  This has come about in the

last  15  years when Mr S.R. Nathan was appointed Chairman.   He

transformed the whole of the Hindu Endowments Board into a  very

dynamic  organisation.  He and his successors, like V.R.  Nathan

and  V.K. Rajan, built on this base and today, numerous projects

are  undertaken by the Board and people from all walks  of  life

have  come  to support the projects.  It is therefore  important

that  the country has dedicated leaders who can provide  impetus

and  inspire  the  community to greater  heights  to  serve  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to the subject of strong families. Although we

have  strong family ties, we cannot run away from the fact  that

the  extended families are slowly diminishing.  We must come  to

terms  with this issue and a study has to be made as to  how  we

can  resolve this problem. As economic necessity dictates,  both

parents  are working.  The children have to be looked  after  by

somebody  else, either a maid or relative.  But the maid  cannot

substitute the mother.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad the Minister for Community Development has

told  the  House  yesterday that family  ties  will  be  further

strengthened.  I am heartened by his remarks.  I also agree with

my  Parliamentary colleague that we should seriously  study  the

five-day  week  proposal.  My proposal is this.   The  rest  day

could be any day from Friday to Sunday.  If a person works  from

Monday to Saturday,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>

he  could have his rest days on Sunday and Monday.  In this way,

we  would not disturb the economic life of Singapore.  I am glad

that  some  firms  have started it.  On this  note,  I  join  my

friend,  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen, in quoting  from  the  Indian  epic

Ramayana jaha sumti taha sampti nana . which simply means  where

there  is  unity of mind, unity of purpose, there is  peace  and

prosperity.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> I rise in support of the motion

as proposed by the Minister for Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, I had a meeting with my grassroots leaders

to  discuss the S21 Report.  To my disappointment, my grassroots

leaders  told  me  that not many Singaporeans  are  particularly

excited or keen on the ideas presented in the S21 Report.   This

confirms   the   assessment  by  our  Education  Minister   that

Singaporeans scored poorly in the five ideas as proposed by  the

S21 Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore vision has apparently not sparked much

discussion  as  evidenced by the lack  of  coffeeshop  talks  or

comments in the forum page over the last two weeks.  I think the

Singapore  heartbeat  is  missing.   The  Singapore   heart   is

suffering  from  "cardiac arrest". We  need  to  take  immediate

action  to  jumpstart the heart and guide the heart to  function

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop passion for our country, we must rally the

hearts  of  all  Singaporeans  to  pursue  the  same  vision  of

Singapore  as  a home worth returning and, if need be,  fighting

and  dying for.  To achieve this, I would like to suggest  three

areas to activate the Singapore heartbeat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Singaporeans must have good hearts. As the

Chinese  saying goes, "hao xin you hao bao".  Singaporeans  must

have  good  hearts  that  show  compassion  for  others  in  all

situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, we must make a concerted effort to strengthen our

ties with family

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>

members and relatives.  The rapid nuclearisation of families and

the  fast pace of living have reduced the contact time of family

members.  This will have an adverse impact on the kinship  among

family  members   We  need  to  refocus  our  attention  on  our

families,  and  take  the responsibility  to  strengthen  family

bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned about the increasing number of cases of

family break-ups and neighbour disputes that I have attended  to

in  my  meet-the-people  sessions.  Some  Singaporeans  are  too

engrossed  in the pursuit of materialistic needs at the  expense

of  their families.  Some have relinquished their responsibility

to  look after their families to pursue their own goals.   I  am

particularly  disturbed to hear of cases of  children  "dumping"

their parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fast aging population, it is vital for us to address

this  fundamental  issue  of  family  responsibility.   Although

Singaporeans  are facing intense competition, we must  not  take

our family members for granted.  We must always remind ourselves

to  spend  time and build bonds in our families.   My  neighbour

told me this morning that at the rate we are working, all of  us

will  "wear out" very quickly and face serious problems when  we

age.   I  am  glad  that  the  S21  Report  has  emphasised  the

importance  of  family bonding.  At the  end  of  the  day,  our

families matter more than anything in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the workplace, we must build friendship with our

colleagues through care and concern.  Our hearts must  transform

our deeds into creating a caring and vibrant working environment

for  everyone.  We must learn to work in teams so as to  improve

our  work  culture,  productivity,  and  job  satisfaction.   To

succeed  in  the next century, all Singaporeans must  develop  a

Singapore  Work  Culture,  which  emphasises  on  teamwork   and

cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having a good and caring heart will enable

Singaporeans to feel passionate about his or her country and its

people.  It will make Singaporeans deeply rooted to Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singaporeans must have a positive attitude. A

good heart will develop a good attitude.  This is the key factor

of  success in life.  We must adopt a positive attitude in life.

We  must  develop an inner drive to achieve our goals  in  life.

With  a  positive attitude, we open our minds to further enhance

the  quality  of  our  lives.   From  young,  children  must  be

cultivated  to have positive attitude in learning.   This  skill

will  provide the necessary impetus for the young to  develop  a

passion  for  learning.  With a positive attitude, there  is  no

barrier to knowledge acquisition.  Singaporeans must learn  that

the  acquisition of knowledge is not only for economic purposes.

Knowledge will also keep the mind healthy and, as such,  improve

our  quality  of  life.  But how do we train people  to  have  a

positive attitude?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total approach is needed to inculcate a nation of people

with positive attitude.  It must first start from the family  to

the   school   and  finally  to  the  workplace  and  community.

Benchmarks  must be set to guide all Singaporeans to  develop  a

positive  attitude.   It  is about time  Singaporeans  took  the

responsibility to change their attitude and mindset  to  further

enhance their quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Singaporeans must lead meaningful lives.

Singaporeans must believe in doing good things for their  fellow

countrymen  and  enriching their lives.  As highlighted  in  the

radio,  today's education does not focus on the heroic deeds  of

good  leaders  and  Samaritans.  Children are not  given  enough

exposure to have mentors in their lives.  As a result, they  may

not  be able to develop a passion to pursue their real interests

and goals in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the setback we suffer in focusing on Mathematics

and  Science  in  our  education system.   A  grassroots  leader

recently  made this comment: "Singaporeans have good  scientific

minds  but  lack  the  human touch."   Our  logical  minds  have

sometimes retarded our development of friendships and pursuit of

other  interests in life.  This is aggravated  by  the  pace  of

working   resulting  in  the  unhealthy  stress   situation   in

Singapore.  So, there is a need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>

for  all  Singaporeans to redefine life.  There  must  be  ample

opportunities for Singaporeans to lead a meaningful and fruitful

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, a colleague of mine told me that he has

visited  a  retirement  village in the  United  States  and  was

shocked  to hear the conversations among the residents  in  that

village.  All the conversations by the residents were focused on

their  sad stories or regrets in life, such as not having  spent

enough time with their children, failing to achieve their  goals

in  life, having a poor attitude towards work, not having enough

friends,  regrets  for ignoring a healthy lifestyle,  and  being

left alone by their family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Singaporeans do not want to end up in such a

situation of regrets.  Since the launching of the S21 Report,  I

wonder how many Singaporeans have bought a copy of the Report or

read  it.  I would urge all Singaporeans to take the first  step

into their future by reading the Report.  Let us rejuvenate  the

Singapore heartbeat to lead a better life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to suggest a punchline for the S21

Report to guide Singaporeans to achieve their vision in the 21st

century  -  "Have a good heart, adopt a positive  attitude,  and

lead a meaningful life!"

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, ten years ago,

the Prime Minister set an agenda in "The Next Lap" for Singapore

to  work  towards  in  nation building.   Despite  the  economic

crisis,  we  can  consider that the lap has  been  completed  in

record  time.   On  the 24th of last month, the  Prime  Minister

launched  Singapore 21 to set the vision of a shared perspective

of  what  Singaporeans want, as a nation, to become in the  next

millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the last three decades, the engine that drove

Singapore  forward was provided by the Government, the Singapore

21  aims to have every Singaporean as a participating factor, so

that  they  will be the co-motivators in deciding what direction

our country should move

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>

towards.  There will be many discussions and debates in the next

few  months  on  this very ambitious but nevertheless  essential

exercise.   All this is necessary if we desire to  continue  our

success in bringing ourselves forward to become one of the  most

advanced global cities in the world.  We will aspire not only to

attain  a  high standard of living, but also become a culturally

and   intellectually  rich  advanced  country.   In  the  global

context,  the  timing cannot be more critical as  well  as  more

exciting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world-wide changes we have seen and are currently

experiencing are so phenomenal that one is hard put  to  predict

what  sort of a world we will be living in, say, 10 to 20 years'

time.   The  acceleration  of change,  especially  in  the  last

decade,  has  been so rapid that the state of the world  affairs

has far surpassed what the futuristic author, Alvin Toffler, had

envisioned  in his then ground-breaking and revolutionary  book,

Future Shock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans of this generation are very fortunate. The

world  has never had so much to offer to an individual in  terms

of  technological advancement that affects almost all aspects of

our  lives.   Also, we are living in one of the most stable  and

most  peaceful periods in our history.  This is especially  true

in   Singapore  where  we  are  moving  into  an  era  of  great

opportunities  and  excitement, the result of  many  painstaking

formative years of nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a product of the 20th century and I consider myself

extremely fortunate that my most formative and productive  years

coincide with the Singapore success story within the past  three

decades.   It has been most exciting and fulfilling,  but  I  am

convinced  that the success story is only at the beginning.   We

have  arrived at the base camp.  We still have the highest  peak

to  reach.   Singapore 21 provides the direction.   We  have  to

possess  the  courage, stamina and, above all, determination  to

reach our final destination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of meritocracy has worked well for Singapore.

The concept of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>

drawing  out  the  best  to  lead  Singapore,  whether  in   the

Government  or  in the civil service, cannot and should  not  be

faulted  and  should continue to be so.  However, in  the  past,

identifying the best has always been through assessment of their

academic excellence.  Generally speaking, I have no qualms about

that.   However,  Singapore is a very small  country.   We  must

harness every one with potential to contribute and although,  by

and  large,  if one attains high academic excellence,  in  other

words, if he or she becomes a scholar, it is logical to consider

that  he  possesses  a  certain high level of  intelligence  and

ability to excel in his various undertakings.  However, it would

be  a  big  mistake  to  ignore the fact  that  there  are  many

successful  individuals  who have  not  been  known  to  achieve

academic  excellence and yet have been able to  excel  in  their

chosen  fields.   History has proven that outstanding  achievers

are  not  necessarily top academic achievers.  Notable  examples

are  Einstein, Edison and Winston Churchill.  Bill Gates was  an

average  Harvard student who dropped out of school to start  his

own enterprise.  More revealing is that in the Fortune 500, very

few CEOs are actually scholars.  In fact, quite a number of them

were high school dropouts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have numerous examples, such as

technopreneur   Sim  Wong  Hoo,  banker  Lien  Ying   Chow   and

entrepreneur  Kwek Hong Png.  They cannot be classified  as  top

academic  achievers but nevertheless, they have  been  extremely

successful  in what they were or are doing. This is because,  to

achieve  success,  knowledge alone  is  not  sufficient.  It  is

talent,  creativity,  perseverance and,  above  all,  a  burning

desire and passion to succeed.  These are elements that drive  a

person ever forward to fulfill his dreams.  In fact, looking  at

our financial, industrial and business sectors, many individuals

who  make tremendous contributions in driving Singapore  forward

are  not  people  with  high academic  qualifications  from  top

universities all over the world, but many make up  the  lack  of

formal  education by perseverance, creativity and a  passion  to

succeed in whatever they do.  It is, therefore, very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>

important  that  while  trying to emphasise  the  importance  of

turning  out  scholars  and  high  academic  achievers  in   our

education  policy, it should not be so rigidly  structured  that

those individuals who, for whatever reason, whether the lack  of

opportunities  to attend a good school or those  who  have  been

affected by family problems in their childhood and, as a result,

were  unable to attain good academic qualifications at  a  young

age,  are  written off as non-achievers.  By doing so,  we  shut

them  out  as potentially important contributors to our nation's

progress and the Singapore 21 vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, in Singapore, anyone who has the aspiration can

have his ambition fulfilled.  I personally had to overcome great

odds  to complete my secondary as well as my tertiary education,

not  so  much  academically,  but  I  had  to  overcome  extreme

difficult  circumstances beyond my control, such as  bad  timing

and  having  missed out on the opportunity to go to a  good  and

decent  school or a top university.  Yet, I was able to overcome

all  the odds and stayed focused to pursue my own dream.  I  can

remember vividly once the whole class was asked what we  aspired

to  be  in  the  future.  When I said that I  wanted  to  be  an

architect,  my  form  teacher  sarcastically  said  that  I  was

dreaming  an  impossible dream.  In a  way,  I  did  succeed  in

fulfilling  that  dream.  For that, I have  to  consider  myself

fortunate to have chosen Singapore as my home and that gives  me

the opportunity to be what I am today.  At the present time,  so

much emphasis has been placed on education.  I believe that very

few  of  our younger generation will have to go through  what  I

have  gone  through to obtain their academic qualification,  and

finding their place in the sun.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 recognises that every Singaporean's

contribution  is  important  in the  total  scheme  of  bringing

Singapore  to the highest level that we can attain as a  nation.

The  Singapore  of  the  21st century  must  be  a  country  for

everyone.   It  should  offer  the opportunity  to  everyone  to

fulfill their dreams at whatever level and in whatever situation

they are fitted into.  I support the idea of imbuing every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>

Singaporean with a sense of belonging and that he is  not  being

left  out  as a peripheral digit or that he is just a supporting

cast in the drama of life.  We must not marginalise the ordinary

folks.  Every citizen has something to contribute to our society

and  nation, whether at the highest office in the Government  or

just  a  humble  hawker at the food centre.  We need  executives

but,  at  the  same time, we cannot ignore the contributions  of

clerical  officers.   We need engineers to keep  things  running

smoothly, but we also need artists to feed the hearts and  souls

of our people.  The satisfaction of achievement should be shared

by  all,  CEOs  and  blue-collar ordinary  workers  alike.   The

concept  of  one working for the collective good of  the  entire

nation is an empowering one and bears emphasising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has been a lot of debate on foreign talent,

but  the issue here is not whether it is foreign or local.   The

operative  word is "talent".  In achieving the target  of  equal

opportunity, no one should exploit this system, whether local or

foreign.   Real  talent must always be recognised and  utilised.

Those  who  inflate  the true worth under the  guise  of  having

talent, whether foreign or local, cannot be accepted.  We should

make  Singapore a place where opportunities are given  to  those

who  set  out to seek, work and to achieve.  This is significant

as  we  want to have a genuine foreign talent to take  root  and

flourish.  A transient foreign talent cannot add much  value  to

Singapore.   I  touch on this issue because, in  order  to  give

confidence  to  all  Singaporeans, it is  imperative  that  they

should  feel  comfortable with the idea of foreign  talent.   In

order  to enable us all to achieve the goal of Singapore 21,  we

need talent and committed individuals, whether foreign or local.

Given our limited human resources, we have no other alternative.

Perhaps that is what made the United States a nation where  most

people  around the world aspire to settle and chase the American

dream.   Perception is just as important as reality.  If  people

perceive  that the United States is a land of opportunity  where

dreams  can be made to come true, then they would go  there  and

make that as their final destination.  We should set out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>

to  emulate  and  make  Singapore a place where  opportunity  is

abundant and those who dare to dream would be rewarded, a  place

where everyone, no matter how humble their background, can  find

their pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and reach their goal

in  life.   We  will have our own Bill Gates,  our  own  Michael

Jordan and the success story of rags to riches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the Committee of Singapore 21 for coming out

with  such  a  comprehensive and far-reaching  Report.   As  the

objective  of  Singapore 21 is to harness the  best  ideas  from

every  Singaporean, the Committee should continue to  assist  in

gathering all the feedback from ongoing discussions, forums  and

seminars  to ensure more ideas and contributions, to crystallise

the  agenda that will be the pathfinder to guide Singapore  into

the next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Minister's motion.

<br>2.38 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

want  to  put  this debate on Singapore 21 (S21) in  its  proper

perspective.   When  I  asked Teo Chee Hean  to  chair  the  S21

Committee,  I saw it as part of a continuing exercise  to  build

the  Singapore  nation.   In  the  first  phase  of  our  nation

building,  we  concentrated on giving  Singaporeans  a  physical

stake  in the country.  For the next phase, we have to grow  the

emotional roots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the S21 Committee is not an end in itself.

It  must  be implemented, and strengthen the process of  nation-building.   For Singapore is not yet a nation.   It  is  only  a

state, a sovereign entity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A state is not necessarily a nation. Harvard Professor

Rupert  Emerson, in his book, From Empire to Nation,  defined  a

"nation" as:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A single people, traditionally fixed on a well-defined

territory, speaking the same language and preferably a  language

all  its own, possessing a distinctive culture, and shaped to  a

common   mould   by   many  generations  of  shared   historical

experience.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this definition, Singapore is not a nation. We do not

all  speak the same language, nor do we share the same  religion

and customs.  We have different ancestors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept the hand that we were dealt with - 600

square kilometres, no natural resources, densely populated,  and

a disparate collection of people, most of whom had migrated from

other parts of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Senior Minister and his generation overcame great odds

and   laid  the  foundation  for  the  Singapore  nation.   They

emphasised  multi-racialism  and  gave  every  race   an   equal

opportunity in Singapore.   This multi-racial country has lasted

33 years, beyond the skeptics' expectation.  But whether it will

last  the  next  100 years will depend on whether the  different

races can gel as one people, feel as one people and pulsate with

the same Singapore heartbeat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this question because it is important for us to

debate the Singapore 21 vision against the background of nation-building.

<br><br><i>Nations - Jews and Serbs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations which have lasted 1000 years have an almost

homogeneous  population sharing the same culture  and  religion,

speaking  the  same  language and practising the  same  customs.

They  descended  from the same DNA pool.   Such  a  people  will

instinctively group together when threatened.  They  will  fight

together  and,  if necessary, die together, in  order  that  the

tribe they belong to will survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jews are one such tribe. When Israel was threatened,

Jews   all  over  the  world  rushed  to  support  it.   Israeli

reservists overseas dashed back to defend the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Serbs too form a nation. However reprehensible their

ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, they are standing up to NATO as  one

Serb nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Serbs, Kosovo is hallowed ground. It is their Holy

Land.  Kosovo had been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>

Serbian  territory as early as in the Middle Ages.  It was  lost

in  a  humiliating defeat to the invading Ottoman army in  1389.

Following  the  Ottoman conquest, ethnic  Albanians  moved  into

Kosovo,  thereby displacing the Serbs who were of Slavic  stock.

The racial composition of Kosovo changed, from majority Serbs to

majority  Albanians.  Today, 600 years later,  Serb  nationalism

has reared to reclaim Kosovo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the Serbs would no more think of yielding

Kosovo  to Albanians than Jews of handing over Jerusalem to  the

Palestinians.

<br><br><i>Tito's Yugoslavia - Not A Nation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a Yugoslavia nation. The break-up of the

former  Yugoslavia  illustrates that a  nation  is  not  just  a

collection of peoples under a common constitutional framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yugoslavia was cobbled together after the Second World War

in  1945  by  Marshal  Josip Tito.  It comprised  six  republics

(Serbia,  Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Montenegro  and  Bosnia-Herzegovina) and two autonomous regions (Kosovo and  Vojvodina).

The   Serbs,   Croats,  Bosnians,  Slovenes,   Macedonians   and

Montenegrins came from the same Slavic stock, but they belong to

different  tribes and backgrounds.  Kosovars are  mostly  ethnic

Albanians.  The Albanians and Bosnians are Muslims, while  Serbs

are mainly orthodox Christians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after Tito died in 1980, Yugoslavia began to

disintegrate.   Belgrade  could not hold  the  different  tribes

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open violence broke out. Finally, independence was

declared by Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina,

one after another, between June 1991 and April 1992.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bosnians are Slavs, like the Serbs. But despite this,

Bosnia  fought a war with Serbia from 1991 to 1995,  and  became

independent  under the US-brokered Dayton peace  accord.   Islam

divides  Bosnians from the Christian Serbs.  The  Bosnians  were

converted to Islam in the late Middle Ages by Turkish occupiers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yugoslavia was not a homogeneous nation. So it broke up

after strongman Tito died.  Yugoslavia lasted only 45 years.

<br><br><i>Singapore - Racial Riots</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a homogeneous nation either. However,

there  is  one consolation, Singapore is too small to  break  up

into two or three separate countries.  But racial riots can tear

the country apart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the racial riots broke out in 1964, I had just started

work  as  an  Administrative Officer  in  the  Prime  Minister's

Office,  then housed in City Hall.  Othman Eusofe, my  colleague

from  Raffles and University, had also just started work in Land

Office, also housed in City Hall.  When news of the riots  broke

out,  the offices were quickly cleared and everyone was told  to

go  home immediately.  I went downstairs and met Othman  in  the

lobby.   Both of us wondered how to get home.  The streets  were

chaotic with cars and worried people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not know how Othman made his way home. I was then

living in a HDB flat in Queenstown.  There was a colleague in my

office  who also lived in Queenstown.  We decided to walk  home.

Fortunately for both of us, as we were somewhere  near the  YMCA

in  Orchard Road, a friend of my colleague came by in  his  car.

He gave us both a lift home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think that racial riots would never break out again

in  Singapore.   They  could be caused by chauvinistic  leaders.

They could be triggered by insensitive handling of racial issues

by an inept government.  They could be instigated from outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we need safeguards such as the Presidential

Council  for  Minority Rights, Maintenance of Religious  Harmony

Act and the Internal Security Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These legal instruments in themselves are useful. They

help   prevent  subversive  and  communalistic  acts.   But   by

themselves,  just  these  Acts  alone  do  not  guarantee   that

Singapore  would  not  be divided along communal  lines.   In  a

crunch,  where the interests of the tribe and the state diverge,

can we be sure that the sense of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>

belonging  to  a  state  will be stronger  than  the  primordial

instinct of belonging to a tribe?  Are Singaporeans of different

races prepared to lay down their lives for the sake of Singapore

if there is a divide amongst the races?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward Osborne Wilson, a Professor at Harvard University,

in his book "On Human Nature", observed that, historically, when

Maoris  fought for land, alliances were based on kinship.   They

would  consciously and explicitly expand against the territories

of  the  groups most distantly related to them.  In other words,

expansionist on the basis of how close you are in  kinship.   In

1837,  when  Hokianga warriors arrived at one fight  already  in

progress  between two sections of the Nga Puhi tribe, they  were

undecided  about which side to join, because they  were  equally

related to both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose it was the same with the Chinese in Singapore

before the Speak Mandarin Campaign.  Those in one dialect  group

would instinctively support their own members in a dispute  with

members of another dialect group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we see the same phenomenon in Indonesia. When a

Madurese  has  a  casual fight with an Ambonese in  Jakarta,  it

would soon become a general fight between Madurese and Ambonese.

The instinct of belonging to a tribe is most overriding.

<br><br><i>Singapore - Serving The Nation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have many pools of DNA. To build a nation

out  of  these different pools is not easy.  We can never remove

totally  the  divide between the different races.   The  Chinese

would not want to adopt Malay customs, culture and religion  nor

do  Malays  and Indians want to be assimilated by  the  Chinese.

The  Eurasians too are happy to be what they are.   But  we  can

work to lower the divide.  It is a long process.  It may take us

at  least  one or two generations before we can confidently  say

that  we have built a successful, multi-racial nation where  the

races will fight together to advance their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>

collective as well as each other's interests.  It boils down  to

trust  -  whether  one  race  trusts  another  to  protect   its

interests.  We must try and build up this trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be done through nice-sounding slogans and

motherhood statements.  It will be built only when we have  gone

through  fire together, and have helped one another to  survive.

The  older  generation of Singaporeans have at least fought  the

communists and communalists together.  They have also fought for

Singapore's  independence.  The bond between that generation  of

leaders  and  Singaporeans  is  strong  and  unshakeable.   That

generation also feels an instinctive moral obligation  to  serve

the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the younger generation of Singaporeans have had no

experience  of  hardships, let alone racial riots  and  external

threats.  Their lives have mostly been plain sailing.  So  their

bonds to Singapore and their sense of service to the country are

not as strong as the older generation's.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tony Tan came back from his recent trip to the US, he

explained  to  me why he had proposed tuition loans  instead  of

scholarships  for our bright students to study abroad.   He  had

met  a group of our scholars in Boston.  They peppered him  with

questions  on  how  they  could break  their  scholarship  bonds

instead  of  how and where they could serve on their  return  to

Singapore.   Tony  was  totally  dismayed.   He  proposed   that

scholarships  be  replaced  with  tuition  loans.   He  was  not

thinking  of  using  public funds.  He was thinking  that  these

scholars  would have to borrow from the banks at market interest

rates.   Then  when  they  come back,  they  can  apply  to  any

organisation to get a job, and it is up to that organisation  to

take  over the loans from the scholars.  So I understood  better

the  context of Tony Tan's proposal for tuition loans to replace

scholarships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, indeed, more and more bright students from Singapore,

more  and  more able Singaporeans think of their self-fulfilment

first, there will be no future for Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is important to do one's PhD to maximise one's

potential.   The organisation can wait.  Yes, it is important to

do  research in a world-class institution.  Singapore can  wait.

But  if  most of our ablest think that way, can we ever build  a

Singapore nation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lee Hsien Loong graduated from Cambridge University,

his  professor  encouraged him to stay back to  do  his  PhD  in

Mathematics.  He came back.  He wrote to his professor  that  he

felt his country would need his services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too wanted to do my PhD after my graduation in 1964. The

PSC  would not let me.  I was under a bursary bond.  So I joined

the Administrative Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, in 1976, the late Hon Sui Sen invited me to stand

for election.  I was not a natural politician.  I am still not a

natural  politician.  But I felt an obligation to say 'yes'.   I

had no political ambition.  But if my country needed me, I could

not  say 'no'.  Without the bursaries and scholarships, I  would

not have done so well in life.  I felt an instinctive obligation

to do national service.

<br><br><i>Singapore - A Society of Overlapping Circles</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the powerful, emotive statements of Singapore 21.

I wish to caution, however, against unrealistic expectations and

quick results.  A strong dose of realism is necessary.  A nation

is  not built in one generation, much less a country made up  of

different  races and religions, who until recently, were  living

in different racial enclaves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities

lived  in distinct neighbourhoods.  Even among the Chinese,  the

different dialect groups had their own cantonments.  So  we  had

the  Cantonese  in Kreta Ayer, the Hokkiens in Telok  Ayer,  the

Hainanese  in  Middle  Road,  and the  Teochews  in  Boat  Quay.

Staying  together according to language, race, religion, dialect

groups provided an important security and comfort zone.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today, there is still a tendency for racial enclaves

to  form  in  HDB estates.  Hence, we had to introduce  a  quota

system in 1989 to ensure that every public housing estate  is  a

microcosm of multi-racial Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may use an imagery, our society is made up of

overlapping  circles, like the People's Association  logo,  four

circles  overlapping with one another.  Each  circle  represents

one community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can do is to maximise the overlapping area of the

four circles.  This is the area where all Singaporeans, whatever

their race, work and play together.  It is an open level playing

field   with   English  as  the  common  language,   and   equal

opportunities for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside this common area, where the circles do not overlap,

each  community  has its own playing field.   In  this  separate

playing  field,  each community can retain  and  speak  its  own

language  and  practise  its  own  culture  and  customs.   This

practical  approach of nation-building whereby  every  community

has two playing fields has given us multi-racial harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach helps us to build a harmonious nation out of

diversity.  But as the divide between races is always there, the

national heartbeat may become separate heartbeats over time.

<br><br><i>Britain and Canada - Devolution of Powers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use Britain to illustrate my point. In 1707,

England, Wales and Scotland came together to form Great Britain.

They  were  joined by North Ireland in 1801.  After  almost  300

years, you would expect Great Britain, the Scots, the Welsh  and

the Irish feel more British, and for Britain to become more of a

British nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But till this day, England, Wales, Scotland and North

Ireland  still  field their own teams and compete  against  each

other   in  the  World  Cup  and  other  international  football

tournaments.   Each will cheer for its own team, not  the  other

teams.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tomorrow, 6th of May, the Scots will elect their first

Parliament to sit in Edinburgh in 300 years.  At the same  time,

the Welsh will be voting for the first elected assembly in their

history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist of 1st May 1999 said,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These developments do not signal the re-birth of Scotland

and  Wales  as  independent countries.  But  they  do  signal  a

historic and welcome shift in the way Britain is governed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why should Scotland and Wales want their own

Parliaments if they have become more British?  Can anyone be  so

sure that devolution of power would not go further and that  100

years from now, there would not be an independent Scotland?   Or

Wales?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Canada. The Dominion of Canada was formed in 1867,

more  than  130  years  ago.  But many  of  the  French-speaking

Canadians in Quebec still refuse to identify themselves with the

English-speaking  Canadians.   Their  ancestors  had  come  from

France,  not  Britain.  Quebec has held two votes on  separation

from Canada to form an independent Quebec.  In the first vote in

1980,  40% of Quebeckers voted for independence.  In the  second

vote in 1995, the percentage has risen to 49.6%.

<br><br><i>Making Singapore Work</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I come back to the basic point: the tribal instinct and

shared  DNA  are stronger than the sense of shared future  in  a

country made up of different tribes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must try and make Singapore work, and build a

Singapore nation.  This is a never-ending challenge.   The  task

is  not  going to get easier.  In fact, it is going to get  more

complicated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sustain our economy and to let our society flourish, we

need  to  import foreign talents and offer some of them  PR  and

citizenship.  Our population will become more cosmopolitan.  The

city will become more international.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newcomers every year have to be integrated into our

society.   We  have to create in them the same strong  sense  of

belonging to Singapore as the thorough-bred Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our task of nation building is enormous. But we must

persevere.   If we do, we can and we will eventually become  one

family, one people, one nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book, "From Empire to Nation", Professor Emerson

also qualifies a nation as:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a community of people who feel that they belong together

in  the double sense that they share deeply significant elements

of a common heritage and that they have a common destiny for the

future".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, over time, imbue in our diverse population a sense

of  community,  trust in each other, a commitment to  Singapore,

and  a passion to make it work.  We can maximize the significant

common  elements of our different ancestral heritage as well  as

our  common  Singapore heritage, and together,  build  a  nation

where  we  will  share  a common destiny.   We  can  create  the

Singapore tribe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. [Applause.]

Albanians by the Kosovian military?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, we have just heard a

sobering  and  challenging speech from the  Prime  Minister.   I

agree  fully with PM that for Singapore, it is fundamental  that

we have racial harmony, for without racial harmony, we could not

have  many of the things that we aspire in Singapore 21.  Racial

harmony  is  crucial  and all Singaporeans  will  have  to  work

towards this in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we enter the next millennium, we will be facing more

complex  issues  which would require us to work  together  as  a

cohesive  people  to  meet  tougher  competition  from   various

societies which also want to make progress just like  us.    And

with  limited resources available, competition will get  tougher

and  we will have to find a place within this arena.  Unless  we

concertedly work as one people, it will be difficult to  improve

our  quality  of life.  What are some of the crucial  issues  we

will be confronting?  I will name a few of them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>3.35 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will have to meet increasing aspirations of the

younger generation of Singaporeans whose life expectations  have

changed,  and it is understandable that they aspire  higher  and

through these aspirations, we hope to meet their needs.  Second,

the  decline  in  population growth  which  can  slow  down  our

productivity,  and  with the greying of our population,  we  are

bound  to face a slowing down of Singapore and we need  to  find

ways  to  address  this.   Third, the  value  conflicts  between

individual   needs   and   collective   interests   leading   to

individualism is one of the issues which we need to take note of

and  to  find ways to tackle.  Fourth, the displacement  of  the

less  skilled and able from the job market because of relocation

of  the labour intensive industries.  Fifth, the emergence of  a

new  under-class who may feel that they have problems of  access

to  education,  health and housing and our  related  provisions.

Sixth,  under-achievement can be wrongly tied up with  language,

religion and race.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take three major critical issues for us to

ponder  and to see how we can find new strategies to meet  these

challenges.  First, the danger of a growing social gap.  In  the

last  decade,  we  have  witnessed the restructuring  of  social

service  provisions.  Although the whole objective  is  to  make

services  more  efficient and to reduce  waste,  such  a  policy

direction  will  be  effective only  if  the  provisions  remain

affordable and accessible.  Sir, the danger is that these  basic

provisions will become more expensive and hence may  be  out  of

reach to the working-class.  It is therefore important that such

a   run-away  increase  can  be  moderated  and  public  service

monopolies  should be checked to ensure that their  charges  are

reasonable.   In this respect, Sir, the move towards  knowledge-based economy must be planned in such a way that the adults  and

children  of  working-class families can also benefit  from  it.

Educational  facilities and training should be both  accessible.

Various  steps must be taken by Government and other  bodies  to

ensure that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>

have  an  opportunity, like others who are better off,  to  take

advantage  of  the knowledge-based training right from  a  young

age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave the training and education of the young working-class to the dictates of the market will in the long run cause

social  divide and thus marginalise the less well-off sector  of

our society.  Translated in real economic terms, the less better

off  sector  will have less opportunity to move up the  economic

ladder.  We should seriously look at this to see what we can  do

to  ensure that there is an opportunity for upward mobility  for

people  at  the  lower rung of the society.   They  will  remain

economically trapped.  In short, the glass ceiling effect  would

be  prevalent  and this will make our society less permeable  to

those  at the bottom of the ladder.  This can become the  social

virus which can affect the social health of our society.  If  we

are not careful, the gaps between the better-off and less better-off  can widen and such a state will not be helpful to community

building.   I  feel that in such a circumstance, the  Government

must  intercede and mediate to deploy resources for them so that

they  would have a chance to make progress in their life.   This

is  tremendously important, particularly where we have  a  large

working-class base.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the effects of individualism versus

collectivism,  I would like to make the following  observations.

We  have  witnessed the consequences of the promotion of extreme

individualism  in  some developed countries.  In  these  places,

individual needs override group needs.  The collective  interest

of  the  group  is set aside.  The `me first and others  second'

type  of  mentality  has  created  serious  problems  for  their

societies.   Many  self-interest groups  are  formed  with  each

having  their own agenda and jockeying for power and  resources.

The  law  of  the  jungle  prevails  and  the  fittest  survive.

Decision-making  becomes  too  problematic  and  in   the   end,

societies  suffer because of protracted conflicts.   People  are

afraid  to do the right things that work.  I am sure we  do  not

want  Singapore to move in this direction, for  if  we  do,  our

society will be easily fractured,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>

as   we  are  more  vulnerable  to  the  pulls  of  multi-racial

sentiments.   So,  the practice of merit-based rewards  and  the

public  good approach in our public policy must continue  to  be

pursued  by us without compromise.  This is fundamental  for  us

and  merit  is the basis by which we work.  We are subjected  to

this  tremendous  pull  and push from various  quarters  in  the

community  and  pandering to group and racial  sentiments  would

lead to a divided society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the question of race, language and religion.

Failure  could  be fudged in the context of race,  language  and

religion.  We  must be mindful and always be on the  guard  from

time to time on the question of race, language, and religion  as

this  will  always be used as an excuse for one's or  a  group's

failure.  This is also very relevant to Singapore itself because

we  are  a  multi-racial  society, and hence  we  will  have  to

appreciate the underpinnings of these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, one's ethnic background, be it Chinese, Indian

or Malay, could be advanced as the cause of one's low station in

life  and  poor performance, and that is a danger  that  I  see.

This is a very tempting reason, especially in Singapore's multi-racial  society  where Indians and Malays  are  the  minorities.

Once  primordial sentiments are excited, it could lead to racial

prejudice  and dissension.  That will spell trouble for  all  of

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is fundamental that we make sure that every

Singaporean,  irrespective  of his background,  be  given  equal

access and opportunity to social provisions which will help  him

to  develop his potentials to his fullest.  I think this is very

important for Singapore, particularly in a multi-racial society.

Institutions and organisations must be seen above board and they

must  have tremendous integrity in its delivery of services  and

that  they are seen to respond on a fair and just basis  without

prejudice  towards different ethnic groups.  That is a challenge

for  the  various social institutions that we have in Singapore.

Institutions must be managed by people with integrity, who  mean

good  for  Singapore  and unless and until  we  have  people  of

integrity  in  the  various  social  institutions  and  who  are

conscious of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>

backdrop  and  problems that our PM has mentioned just  now,  we

will  have a divided Singapore and that in the long run will  be

worse  for all of us.  We will be no better.  Therefore, in  the

context of Singapore, we must ensure that we work towards ethnic

harmony,   religious  tolerance,  appreciate  one   another   as

Singaporeans, and collectively work for a common purpose so that

Singapore  will  be  able to survive and manage.   And  that  is

indeed the challenge for all of us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I first congratulate whoever put

together  this  Report  on the attractive  dressing  up  of  the

Report.   We  have become accustomed in Singapore to the  public

relations job that the Government is so competent at.  But  that

is  about all that I can find to commend in this Report.   I  am

sorry  if  I  take a view which is at odds with almost  all  the

other  speakers.   But  I have to say what  I  feel  about  this

Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Report abounds in platitudes and it echoes what

we  have  heard  from  our leaders in the Government  all  these

years.   That is not surprising if one looks at the  members  of

the  various committees.  The co-chairmen are all members of the

ruling  party  except for two who are nominated  by  the  ruling

party.  It is no wonder that ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Member if I may have the

floor to clarify a point?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Do you want to give way, Mr Jeyaretnam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, I am not. So it is not surprising that

it  should echo what we have heard all these years.  I have  not

had  the time to go through this Report from cover to cover.   I

have  been away. But from what little I have read of it,  I  can

find  no  mention of the term "an open society" as  a  desirable

goal  for Singapore, and yet this was the vision of our  present

Senior Minister when he was speaking in the Malaysian Parliament

at  the  end  of  1964.  To him, an open society was  absolutely

essential for the progress of the nation, and yet today planning

our vision for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>

next century, there is no mention of an open society as being an

essential need for our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that it abounds in platitudes. But may I first

say  a  little  bit about the way this Report has  been  brought

about.   The  Minister, in his opening statement in  moving  the

motion,  said  that the task of the Committee was to  strengthen

the  heartware  of Singapore and to develop a consensus  on  the

kind of society which Singaporeans want for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how do we develop a consensus on

the kind of society which Singaporeans want for the future?  One

would  have  thought one could only develop a  consensus  if  we

invited  Singaporeans  to  enter  into  public  discussions  and

debates  on the values and goals of the society that  they  live

in.   One Nominated Member talked about public discussions  that

have  gone  into it.  I cannot recall any public discussions  on

S21.   Were  there any meetings called for the public to  attend

and to take part in formulating what the goals and values of the

society  should be?  Nothing at all.  It is said that  views  of

6,000 people were sought, but I see that they included community

leaders and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And Low Thia Khiang!

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I cannot find Low Thia Khiang's name in the

Committee's Report as one of the members of any Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to know what the vision should be, we should get

down  to  the man in the street.  We should ask him what  is  it

that he values as a goal for the society.  We may not agree with

him  but  we at least give him a chance to speak.  And  that  is

what  Mr Lee, I think, was trying to encourage when he urged  an

open society in 1964.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in his speech, the Minister talks about the five key

ideas  and says every Singaporean matters.   I say amen to that.

If  every  Singaporean matters, then the views and  opinions  of

Singaporeans should be sought publicly and openly, and this  was

never done.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would commend to the Government - I am sure they must

have  read  it  -  an article that appeared in the UK  magazine,

The  Economist,  17th April this year.  The  article  is  headed

"Happiness is a Warm Vote".  It reports on a survey carried  out

in Switzerland by two members of the University of Zurich.  They

asked the residents how satisfied they were with their life as a

whole.   The results apparently showed up some revealing things,

and  it  showed  that  the  people who were  given  more  direct

participation  -  they call it direct democracy  -   in  shaping

the  policies  of the country were much happier than  those  who

were  given  less participation.  It is not that in  Switzerland

that  they are not given, but apparently direct democracy varies

from  one  canton to another.  In some cantons, they  have  more

direct  participation.  And it was found  that  they  were  much

happier  than  people in other cantons.  The  article  ends,  "A

happy  country  it seems is one where politics  is  not  just  a

spectator sport."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the lesson that one can learn from this survey is that

if we wish to motivate our citizens, if we wish to drive them to

greater   heights,  then  we  should  give  them   more   direct

participation  in the policy making.  And, of  course,  we  know

that in Switzerland, they have a referendum for almost every new

law  that  they wish to pass or make any changes.  The  citizens

feel  that they are part of the country and they are asked their

views on what should be done for the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report reproduces part of the Prime Minister's speech

at  the National Day Rally in 1996, where the Prime Minister  is

reported to have said, "I say to all Singaporeans, you  have  to

feel  passionately  about Singapore.  Being Singaporeans  should

resonate  in  our hearts and minds."  May I ask, when  does  one

feel  passionate about anything?  Does one feel passionate  when

one has had no hand in the creation of something of which one is

asked  to feel passionate, if one is made to feel that he is  an

outsider,  he  has got nothing to do with the creation  of  that

thing?  Or does he feel passionate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>

when  he  is invited to work together to create whatever  he  is

asked  to  feel  passionate about?  I should  have  thought  the

answer was obvious.   Singaporeans would feel passionate if they

felt that they were being consulted, they were being listened to

and they were being given a hand in formulating the policies and

goals for this society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another statement in this Report that I found amusing was

that it says that Singaporeans must all put on our thinking caps

together to find answers.  This is all, as I said, great  words.

But  the Report is abysmally silent on how we reach these goals.

How  do  we get Singaporeans to feel passionate about Singapore?

How  do we get Singaporeans to find answers collectively to  the

problems  of  the country?    The Report is a complete  silence.

And  then  it  says  again  somewhere, "we  must  become  active

citizens  who are participants, not mere observers  in  building

the Singapore we want for the future."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we agree. But what do we propose should be done to

make  Singaporeans  become  active  citizens,  participants,  in

building  the  society we want for the future?  One  would  have

expected all that in this Report, but there is nothing in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have, in this House, moved a

number  of motions, attempting to place before the House what  I

thought  were necessary for Singapore's progress into  the  21st

century.   One  of these was my motion on the removal  of  fear.

You  cannot,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker, just poo-poo  the  idea  that

Singaporeans  are  living  in  fear.   It  is  a  reality.   One

encounters  it everywhere.  And unless this fear is removed  and

Government  goes  about  it deliberately  to  remove  the  fear,

Singaporeans  will  not  participate actively  in  building  the

society.  Singaporeans will not feel passionate about the  goals

that  the Government has laid out for them.   The Minister  says

that  Singapore  21  is  not a Government  concept.   I  beg  to

disagree.  It reads very much like what the Government wants the

people  to be.  It is social engineering all over again  of  our

society  for  the  21st  century.  It does  not  come  from  the

citizens.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it would appear that the rule is: you can

only  participate within the parameters that we lay  down,  that

is,  the  Government, the ruling Party, lays down.  If you  step

outside   the  parameters,  then,  you  suffer;  you   pay   the

consequences for that.  Can you get Singaporeans to be  involved

and participate actively if that is the rule?  Yes, you will get

Singaporeans  who  are only anxious to make their  own  progress

joining  in.  But Singaporeans who feel passionately  about  the

goals  and values will not join in if they are told this is  it,

these are the four lines, and you must work within it.  No self-respecting person will want to come into that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from experience that I

have  found  from the time I went into politics  in  1971.   The

Opposition  have  been made to feel that they had  no  place  in

Singapore, they were not Singaporeans, they were the enemies  of

the  people.   When I was in Parliament in 1981 to 1986,  I  was

told  by  the present Senior Minister, then the Prime  Minister,

that I had to be destroyed because I was against the system.  Of

course, the question is: what was the system that I was against?

It was not the democratic system.  I was against the system that

was operating in Singapore.  So this is it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, and it has been over the last 40 years,

anyone  who gets out of the line, steps out, is dealt with  very

harshly.   It would appear that loyalty to Singapore is  equated

with  loyalty  to  the  Government and to  the  PAP.   But  that

conception has to be erased completely.  People have to be  told

quite  deliberately that loyalty to Singapore can mean, and  may

mean, at times differing from whatever the Government puts up as

the  goal or policy for Singapore and they would be allowed  and

given  every  opportunity to voice their  views.   That  is  not

possible  in Singapore.  So I do not know how we can talk  about

the  vision for the next century or the next millennium  without

first freeing our people from the straitjackets into which  they

have been put.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to loosen up, and that has no place in this

report at all.  We should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>

allow  public meetings.  We should not prosecute any  Opposition

politician  because he seeks to address Singaporeans  on  issues

that  concern  them, because he has not got a  permit  from  the

Police.   If that is how Singapore is going to be run,  then  we

are  never  going  to  get  Singaporeans  feeling  passionately,

becoming active participants and deciding on the goals.  We must

remove  them  from being just passive spectators, unable  to  do

anything  about deciding the country's policies and its  future,

into  people who feel that they are active players and they  can

only  do this if you remove all the restraints.  If you do  not,

we  will  continue as we have over the last 45 years,  and  this

talk  about  the  vision for Singapore 21st  century  will  only

remain  as mere words, platitudes with no political will on  the

part of the Government to bring it into reality.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, what the Prime Minister said just now  was

very touching indeed.  I  agree wholeheartedly with what he  has

said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five ideas of the Singapore 21 Vision are great ideas

that  will  guide  us  into the 21st century  with  a  strategic

direction.   They  represent the values of the  individual,  the

family, society and the country.  It is like a compass that will

guide our people of different races to work together to give  of

their  best, to go through weal and woe to build good homes  for

Singaporeans.  To do this, we must try to put these  five  ideas

into simple language to inculcate in the minds of our people  so

that  we  can all remember these ideals and translate them  into

action and reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the five ideas of S21 Vision, I would suggest 20

simple  Chinese characters to summarise them and  highlight  the

common  goals  that  we  have worked out for  ourselves  and  to

inspire  every citizen to participate in our efforts to  realize

these  ideas. These Chinese characters are: quanmin heyi, baojia

guben,  zhongzhi chengcheng, zhanchi weiguo, gongquang  yuanjin,

meaning "the entire people united as one, maintain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>

a  strong family as a foundation, unity is strength, spread  our

wings for the nation, together we create our vision."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that "Heaven has its purpose for every

person  who is born on earth". That is to say, every  one  is  a

talent.   To realize the much-esteemed personal values, we  must

persevere   in  continuously  upgrading  the  intellectual   and

educational   level  of  our  people  so  that  every   citizen,

irrespective of race or station in life, will give full play  to

his talent and give of his best to contribute to society and the

nation.   To  put  it simply, we aim to have the  entire  people

united  as  one  (quanmin  heyi) to  achieve  a  prosperous  and

peaceful Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cohesive family is the foundation stone on which the

nation  is built. To put it simply, we must have strong families

as  our  foundation.  Family is not only the foundation  of  the

country  but  also a strong spiritual pillar for the individual.

Whenever we are faced with a crisis or in difficulty, the  first

thing that we think of is the home, the family.  Therefore,  the

family  or  home is not only our residence but also our  shelter

and a place for us to rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also frequently say that "When a family is in harmony,

everything can be done well".  That is to say, the family is the

core  on  which the bonding is maintained.  It is the basis  for

our  survival.  It is also the motivating force for our success.

When we are faced with all the future challenges and changes  in

circumstances,  we  must  maintain  a  strong  family   as   our

foundation  (baojia  guben), as our  unshakeable  conviction  to

enhance cohesion in attaining our ideal goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, opportunities do not come from thin air. Rather,

they  are  the result of tons of hard work.  There is  a  famous

Hokkien  saying to the effect that we must slog it out in  order

to  win.   That is a successful motto for many business  people.

But  if you want to attain the ideal state in which everyone  is

given  the opportunities in the highly competitive 21st century,

depending only on individual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>

efforts is not enough.  As the Prime Minister has said, we  want

to  turn  Singapore into a combination of the  individuals,  the

human  resource,  the  thinking  and  other  resources  to  turn

Singapore  into  an international metropolis.  In  other  words,

what  we want is a dynamic first-class and creative city of  the

world.  It is only in such a city that everyone and every talent

will  have  the opportunity to give full play to his  potential.

Whether we can realise this idea or not, I think the part played

by the Government is very crucial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in some countries where those in power are

arrogant,  narrow-minded and very exclusive, public  opinion  is

never  taken  into account when policies are implemented.   Then

the intellectual and the wise, whether at home or overseas, will

distance  themselves  from  the tyrannic  government.   In  such

circumstances,  whatever dreams you may have  will  remain  just

dreams.   There is no chance of these dreams becoming a reality.

Although  this  is  not the style of the present  Government  of

Singapore, we must remain very vigilant to ensure that the  high

officials who are over-ambitious and impatient do not have  this

kind of a problem and completely disregard consultation with the

people.  Otherwise, we will be sowing the seed of evil  and  the

people's heart will be lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all along I endorse the

Government's   decisiveness  and   high   efficiency   for   the

development of our economy, culture and  education.  But when we

are evolving into a knowledge-based economy of the 21st century,

if  we  depend only on the Government or the few elites  in  the

Government service, we will not be able to handle the  excessive

information explosion in this IT age.  Therefore, the Government

must  adopt  a more open attitude and maintain closer  relations

with  the civic organisations in order to get more reliable  and

more accurate information and also constructive opinions for the

formulation  of  state  policies as points  of  references.   Of

course,  as  citizens, we will also benefit from the enlightened

policies of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of national interest, we should also support

the Government in its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>

meritocractic  approach.   We should not  only  welcome  foreign

talent, but  also share our experience and knowledge with  them.

This  will also enhance our expertise and skills. If we can pull

the  collective wisdom and strength of all the people  together,

we  will be able to realise our ambition and vision, and this is

the meaning of "unity is strength" (zhongzhi chengcheng).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Singapore has many citizens who are

currently   working   overseas  under  the  regionalisation   or

globalisation initiatives, or studying for higher degrees.  This

is  to ensure that they can have better lives for themselves and

their  family,   and  to  become  outstanding  citizens  of  the

country.   So a good man shall cherish high ideals to reach  out

to  the world.  This is a very true statement.  Being physically

outside  Singapore, it is inevitable that they may  be  somewhat

dissociated   from  their  homeland.   However,   so   long   as

Singaporeans, especially the young ones, can feel the esteem and

concern of the country for them, and can always keep in mind the

motto  of "spreading our wings for the nation" (zhanchi weiguo),

their hearts will always be with Singapore - our homeland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to encourage our people to manifest

their  spirit of active participation, we have to take care  not

to  induce  them  to  follow blindly, to   participate  in  some

meaningless  controversial arguments or to do things  which  may

undermine our national unity and racial harmony. Our idea is  to

create a good vision for ourselves through collective wisdom and

collective efforts.  What we should stress is to encourage every

citizen  to  take  part  actively in community  development  and

welfare  work.   Our  common goal is to create  our  own  vision

together (gongquang yuanjin).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to realise the ideals of S21 is an ongoing heartware

project.   Therefore, we should use our "heart" to  realise  the

following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) we must work wholeheartedly as a united people for the

nation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) we must have a loving and caring heart to ensure family

cohesion;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) we must have an enthusiastic heart to deal with people

and to create the collective will to build a world city;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) we must have a loyal heart to the nation, then we will

be  able  to extend our will beyond the boundary of our country;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) we must have a persevering heart to ensure that we are

able  to  give  full play to collective wisdom  and  efforts  to

create this common vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my humble suggestions will stimulate and

encourage  more views and opinions on this subject  so  that  we

will  be  able to translate these ideals into a simple  language

for  all  to remember easily and for all to realise  it  in  due

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister

for Education.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of the other Members in this House, I listened to

the  Prime  Minister's  speech this afternoon  and  was  greatly

encouraged.   The Prime Minister had taken the trouble  to  read

the S21 Report from cover to cover.  Not only that, he had taken

the time to reflect on its import and messages.  He came to this

House  and  he  encouraged us but at the same time cautioned  us

that  there  are  still  forces within  our  society,  from  our

heritage, from our history that can divide and break us up.  But

he  ended  with  an encouraging word that if we  concentrate  on

those  overlapping circles and shared interests, we can build  a

nation out of a country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I contrast this with the remarks by Mr J. B.

Jeyaretnam which sought to discourage us and to pour cold  water

on  this debate.  And the irony of it is that he admits that  he

has  not yet read the Report but has only taken a glance at  it.

He  reminds me of what a consultant once told me about why  some

meetings  are not productive.  And he says that when you  go  to

such meetings, there are only two kinds of people, those who are

talking and those who are waiting to talk.  I presume that Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>

J.  B.  Jeyaretnam has been waiting to talk and now that he  has

spoken, he has left.  But he has failed to listen and read.   Mr

Simon  Tay wanted to make some clarification.  I do not know  if

he  still wants to do it.  But if he does, I will give the floor

to him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I am obliged to the Member. A simple

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. He was making a clarification

with Mr Jeyaretnam.  He has not asked to make that clarification

now.  Can you please proceed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> I am sorry he is out of order. It is a pity

that  Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam is not here.  Otherwise, he could make

his clarification.  Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam's main point is that  we

do not have an open society in Singapore.  He complains that the

opposition  politicians  cannot speak  without  a  permit.   But

earlier  this afternoon, during the Question time, I thought  he

distinctly said that we should make sure that we enforce the law

so that people will not have disrespect for the law.  It puzzles

me  as  to what he is now advocating, whether he advocates  that

opposition  politicians should be given special  differentiation

to  disregard the law or whether he encourages them to  wilfully

disobey  the law because that is the model of the opposition  he

advocates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam says that the Report is full of

platitudes.   Indeed, if we all adopted his attitude,  it  would

only  be just that.  If we read this Report and do nothing about

the  ideas  in them, then all these statements will be lifeless.

They  would just be slogans that all of us would know about  but

none of us would care much about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we act on these ideas, then they will come alive.

The challenge for us is that every Singaporean must examine each

goal, and ask ourselves whether we truly believe what is written

in this Report.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>

When  we  say that every Singaporean matters, if we believe  it,

will we change our behaviour towards others?  If we say that  we

want  strong  families, will we set time aside, as Mr  Seng  Han

Thong does every year, to go for holidays with his family?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of our vision is about making Singapore a centre

of  opportunity.   We  have to act on this  too  to  make  it  a

reality.  At this juncture, what I would like to do is to take a

pause  and just thank all the members of my subject committee  - it  was  a committee on attracting talents versus looking  after

the needs of Singaporeans - and all the people in Singapore that

we  met  and  talked with.  It was a privilege for Mr  Seng  Han

Thong  and  myself to have led the discussions and to have  been

educated in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in practical terms, being a centre of opportunity

means making Singapore a place where every Singaporean can  have

a  good job, and do and enjoy the things he treasures the  most.

It  is  the  practical way to give meaning to  our  belief  that

everybody matters and everyone makes a contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But jobs and opportunities do not fall from the sky. We

have  to  make them happen.  Good jobs are created  by  talented

people.   But the best of our talents are mobile.  If there  are

no  opportunities here, they will seek opportunities  elsewhere.

And if they go, who will be left to create the opportunities  in

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is a circular cost and effect. If we get it wrong,

it  will be a downward spiral.  But if we get it right, then  we

can  create  good jobs in Singapore.  Our talented  people  will

stay and they will create even better jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get it right, we must be able to keep pace with the rest

of the world as it races along.  We cannot do this alone.  As  a

small  country, we will always have the problem  of  not  having

enough people to go around in every sector of the economy.  From

biochemists to bankers - we simply do not have the critical mass

to be self-sustaining.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng pointed out earlier this afternoon that

even  in  America,  with  260 million  people,  they  are  self-sustaining  in  talent.  If we go to the Silicon Valley  or  the

Boston Belt, we will find that not every talent there is made in

America, but they come from all four corners of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to succeed, we must maintain a porous border which

allows talent to flow freely in.  Yes, they will come to tap the

opportunities  which we offer.  But in that process,  they  will

create even more opportunities for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that from the newspaper reports, TV shows and

radio  phone-ins,  most  Singaporeans  support  this  policy  of

attracting  foreign talents.  This House has also  debated  this

issue  in the past, and I am glad to see that we are all of  one

mind  on this issue.  But there are still many Singaporeans  who

still have doubts on how we should go about doing this.  We must

lay these doubts to rest so that we can get on with the task  of

building our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doubt whether the people who come to Singapore are

real  talents.  Others question whether there is fair  play,  if

PRs  do  not have to do national service.  Such doubts  are  not

unexpected.   Fairness is important.  We opened up this  subject

perhaps  at the worst possible time when we are in the midst  of

an  economic  crisis and rising unemployment.  So  we  can  well

understand  the  emotions  which  welled  up  and  the  personal

interest that participants took in the subject matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it would be wrong to let our emotions overplay such

doubts.  There are controls and safeguards in place through  our

employment  permit  system.  And we must recognise  that  market

forces  will  always check potential abuses.  Private  employers

will not hire people who have no talent and who create no value.

For  them, the issue is not foreign or local, but who can do the

job, and who can create more value for the price paid?  The best

man or woman gets the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I did a radio phone-in session a couple of weeks ago,

a lady called up.  She

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>

said  she was a hairdresser and she was being pushed out of  the

market  by  cheap imports from neighbouring countries.   Sir,  I

have  been to the same hairdresser for the last eight years.   I

have  never  quarrelled with her over the price she  charges  me

and,  in fact, I often tip her.  She knows every bristle  on  my

head.   She  knows exactly how I want it cut and she  will  stay

late,  if I am running late that particular day, just to cut  my

hair.   She  gives me service and she beats out all the  foreign

competition.  This is the way we must move ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the common misconception that PRs are not required

to  do  national  service, this is not so.  Yes,  for  practical

reasons, first generation PRs are often exempted from NS, mostly

because  of  their age, and the impracticality of training  them

together with 18 year olds.  It is a bit hard for a 40-year old,

a bit heavy in the middle to keep up with the younger ones.  But

their male children, the second generation PRs are not exempt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final protest against foreign talent is that immigrants

make us work harder.  They are the cause of our lost dream.  The

better life we thought we would enjoy at the turn of the century

seems  to  have  faded away.  We cannot relax, we  cannot  enjoy

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these feelings may be real, but the logic is false.

Immigrants are not the reason why we have to work hard.   It  is

the global economy.  We compete, or we fall away.  But our dream

is  not dead.  We can still find fulfilment and satisfaction  in

life,  if  we  work hard, if we work smart, and we  broaden  the

definition of success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, blaming our problems on others would not solve

it.  If we lose out on a promotion, is it because the other chap

is  foreign,  or  because he is better?  Competition  cannot  be

avoided.   It  is better that they are here to compete  with  us

than  somewhere  else competing against us.  It is  better  that

they are here to help us build new capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basis of competition has changed. There is a

powerful new trend

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>

which we must recognise.  And to see this, we need to go back  a

chapter  in  our  history.  In the 60s, many  newly  independent

countries  had  a  sense  of new found  pride  and  nationalism.

Thinking  that they had come of age, they raised tariff barriers

and locked out the foreign investors.  They thought by doing so,

they  would protect the infant industries.  The result was  that

they lost out on investments and their growth was slow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore did the reverse. We removed all barriers and we

even  gave  incentives for foreign investors to put their  money

here  in  Singapore.   At that time, we were  called  names.   I

remember  as a young student in Australia, and this was  already

into  the  early  70s,  receiving  pamphlets  saying  that   the

Singapore  Government was exploiting its people,  that  we  were

selling  out to the big businesses and that we were prostituting

the  people of Singapore.  They called us stooges, lackeys,  all

kinds  of  names.  But the result was growth and prosperity  for

Singaporeans  and for Singapore companies.  Our local  companies

today,  local  successes like Serial Systems,  JIT  Electronics,

YCH,  would  not be around today without the MNCs, without  IBM,

without  Motorola, without DuPont, without these large companies

creating  the  baseload for their enterprise to  flourish.   But

those countries which shut out MNCs lost out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the same pattern is repeating itself. Only this

time,  the  issue is not investments but talent.  Some countries

are  shutting their doors to talents, thinking that  this  is  a

better  way  to  protect the jobs of their citizens.   They  are

wrong.  We must not fall into this trap.  We continue to attract

MNCs  to  Singapore  today because they  can  bring  the  needed

talents  to create new activities in Singapore.  If we shut  out

their  talents,  their ability to hire the  right  people,  they

would  go elsewhere and we would lose out a whole generation  of

growth.  That is something that we might never survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth for Singapore is that we must always compete to

succeed and compete

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>

we can.  We heard on May Day from Mr Lim Boon Heng that BERI and

other rating agencies have rated us the best labour force in the

world, the best for the last 19 years.  Our economy is rated  as

the  second most competitive.  Our management talents  are  much

sought   after.    Our  kids  outperform  kids  from   developed

countries.  We have good people and a good foundation from which

to move on.  Only we must never tire of learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Subject Committee made several recommendations on life-long learning which we hope will bear fruit. I am happy to note

that MOM is working out a Manpower 21 plan which will bring life-long  learning to life.  I think we can trust MOM to look  after

us.  But it takes more than just MOM and the Government to bring

about  life-long  learning.  After all, Singapore  21  is  about

everybody  acting  on what he believes.  For example,  employers

play a part.  They must focus on building strong companies,  and

not  just on raising stock prices.  One practical way to do this

is by continually upgrading the skills of their staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families can play a part too. For re-training is often

difficult   for  older  workers,  family  members  can   provide

encouragement  and emotional support for other members  who  are

struggling  to learn new skills.  But in the final analysis,  it

is  the  individual himself who must want to  learn.  We  cannot

force  people to learn just as we cannot force parents  to  send

their children to school.  The Government can provide funds  and

facilities.   But  ultimately, it is up to Singaporeans  whether

they  have  the  right  attitude towards  learning  and  towards

competing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we truly believe that our future lies in making

Singapore  a centre of opportunities for all, then we must  have

the  courage  and  the  resolve to act on  this  conviction  and

welcome foreign talents, with a Singapore 21 attitude - an  open

mind  and a big heart.  For after all, we ourselves are a nation

of  immigrants.   Take away the foreigners and new  citizens  in

Singapore  today,  and you will immediately  stunt  our  growth.

Take away

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans  of one generation ago, those of us  who  have  one

parent  at  least  who was born overseas, and  I  would  not  be

standing  here speaking to you today.  Take away two generations

and  a  third  of our civil service might well disappear.   Take

away  three  generations and the first Cabinet would  have  only

comprised Senior Minister Lee and one other Minister.  We  would

have had no Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore in the 20th century has earned itself the

reputation of being a miracle economy.  In the 21st century, our

hope is that we, an immigrant people who have made Singapore our

home,  will  earn the reputation of being a distinctive  people,

one  who  are  united in our quest to make a  nation  out  of  a

country.   And  it  is  towards that hope that  I  support  this

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, the publication of

Singapore  21 - Together, We Make the Difference is very  timely

as  we are only seven months from the new millennium.  The  book

spells  out  the ways we need to follow to achieve this  vision.

Every  one of us has a key role to play and we can succeed  only

if  all of us continue to work together.  I would like to direct

my  remarks to the Singapore Heartbeat and share with Members of

the  House a bit of my own experience.  In doing so, I  hope  to

pinpoint  the  essentials required to keep the  Singapore  Heart

beating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in China at the onset of the Second World War.

My  parents brought us to India where we stayed for four  years.

After the war, we returned to Hong Kong, my father's birthplace.

In  those days, Hong Kong was rebuilding itself from the ravages

of   war.    There   were  opportunities.    There   were   also

difficulties.  In 1955, my father was retrenched.  He decided to

come  to  Singapore to find a job and managed to get one  in  an

insurance  company. The family, comprising my  mother  and  four

sons, came over a year later.  I was also a foreigner.  I am not

too sure whether I have got the talent, but I was a foreigner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore in the mid-1950s was a turbulent place. Strikes

and worker

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>

clashes occurred almost daily.  The racial harmony that  we  see

today  was  not  in place.  The education system,  torn  between

English and Chinese, was in turmoil.  The economy was not  doing

well  and  living  standards were low.  I  still  remember  that

during  the  first  two  months of our  arrival,  the  Singapore

Traction  Company (STC) was on strike.  My brother, Kenneth  and

I, have to wait almost two hours to catch a bus operated by Hock

Lee  Bus  Company to school (St Anthony Boys' School)  and  back

home  in  MacPherson every day.  Somehow, we pulled through  the

50s  and  early  60s,  despite  the  trauma  of  self-governing,

communist confrontation, racial riots, the merger with  Malaysia

and the subsequent separation in 1965.  Things began to pick  up

in  the late 60s.  The past 30 years saw the making of Singapore

into  a  prosperous city state, with a multi-racial  and  multi-religious backdrop, in which all of us live in harmony, each one

contributing in his or her own special way to nation-building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to wonder what was on my father's mind during these

turbulent  times as he grappled with making a living to  support

the  family.   In his own time, he had travelled  worldwide  and

stayed  in  many  places.  Why did he finally choose  Singapore,

despite the uncertain and difficult conditions then?  Why did he

not move on to greener pastures as many have done?  It could not

be  that  he  became  rich, because he did  not  own  his  first

apartment  until  he  was  well  into  his  60s.   He  had  many

alternatives, yet he opted for Singapore.  In a few years before

his  death  in 1976, in reflecting on his life, he told  us  his

reasons  for  doing so.  First and foremost, he  found  that  he

belonged.   At long last, he could say that he had a home  which

he  could  call  his own.  A home is where you  have  a  family,

living happily together.  You have relatives and friends who you

can  turn to in times of happiness which you share and  when  in

difficulties,  you can help each other out.  Although  life  was

difficult and there were plenty of challenges, the support given

by the family and friends was crucial for him to shape the sense

of belonging.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father never longed for what he did not have. Rather,

he  took great satisfaction in what he had and he treasured them

and  shared  generously  with his family.   Above  all,  he  was

grateful   that  his  family  benefited  from  an   increasingly

prosperous  Singapore, which offered both  security  and  better

well-being.  All his children and grandchildren in Singapore are

in  one  way  or  another beneficiaries.   For  myself,  I  have

benefited greatly from Singapore as I have all my secondary  and

tertiary   education   paid  for  by  way   of   bursaries   and

scholarships.  Like the Prime Minister too, I was offered a  PhD

Fellowship  from the university in Canada where I  studied,  but

the PSC also called me back to serve.  I must say that I am glad

that I came back.  My father died a happy and contented man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's landscape has changed beyond recognition in the

23 years since his death.  Our economy has prospered and with it

much  higher  standard  of living.  However,  some  fundamentals

remain  unchanged  over  these years.   We  are  still  a  small

country, despite the reclamation of more land. We remain a multi-racial and multi-religious society.  As the population grows, we

find  that  we  are  getting more crowded and getting  into  one

another's  way  more  often.  As we look beyond  our  shores  to

expand our economy and seek regional and global markets, we have

become more exposed to foreign influences, not only in terms  of

economics  but,  more  importantly, the different  cultures  and

values  that  such  exposures brought along.  In  fact,  nation-building,  as  the  Prime Minister has said, which  was  already

difficult  in  the  60s  and 70s, has become  more  complex  and

challenging  as we move into the next millennium.   We  have  to

reckon  with the domestic forces at work, resolve the  conflicts

and  overcome  the  constraints, at the same time,  taking  into

account  the  external influences that affect our decisions  and

choices.   One  thing is certain, our job of nation-building  is

getting tougher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I reflect on my father's words and his deeds and reading

Singapore 21, I could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>

see some parallels.  First, the family is the foundation and  an

essential  unit in nation-building.  It is a reflection  of  the

society at large.  Without cohesive and harmonious families,  no

nation will last long.  On the other hand, strong families  will

go towards strengthening the nation especially in times of need.

The  successful  formula to a happy family is love  and  respect

among  the  members.  There has to be a large dose of  give  and

take,  and  every willingness to work together  for  the  common

good.  It is no different for society or country, except that it

is  even more necessary to recognise the characters of a  multi-racial and multi-religious society.  We have to be more tolerant

to  each  other's  ethnic background, and respect  each  other's

beliefs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was often asked by overseas visitors how all the races in

Singapore  could stay so happily together.  I have to tell  them

that  we  have to work hard at it.  Racial and religious harmony

does  not  come automatically.  In fact, sometimes they  do  not

even  come naturally.  We have to go out of our way to  make  it

work  and make sure that it continues to do so for a long,  long

time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there must be equal opportunities for everyone in

Singapore,  regardless of race, language or religion.   Only  in

this  way can we inculcate the commitment and sense of belonging

to  the  country  we all call our home.  Every Singaporean  will

then be allowed to strive to reach his or her maximum potential.

Not  all of us could achieve the same success in life, as we are

all  made differently.  But all of us should in time achieve the

same  level  of  commitment  to our  society,  to  our  country,

whatever position we may be holding in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 states emphatically that every Singaporean

matters.  I would add that every Singaporean matters, no  matter

what success he can achieve as long as he has given of his best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must play our part as citizens of Singapore

actively.   It  is  not enough to confine our attention  to  our

immediate family.  Our friends and neighbours

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>

deserve our attention, especially in times of trouble.   We  may

need  them  when  our  turn comes.  It  is  only  by  overcoming

troubles  together that we can appreciate what we  mean  to  one

another.   In  doing  so,  the bonds  between  all  of  us  will

strengthen with time and we will be ready to face new challenges

together.  In a city state where we live in close proximity with

one  another, the need to look after our neighbours becomes even

greater.  The Residents' Committees, the Town Councils  and  the

Community Development Councils are all vehicles to enable us  to

reach  out  to  our  fellow  citizens,  building  up  a  lasting

friendship and be ready to come to one another's aid in time  of

need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was too busy making a living for the family to

contribute  some of his time to society.  I guess he would  have

been  pleased  to  know that two of his sons became  Members  of

Parliament after his death, and make up in a small way  what  he

did not do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitment and belonging cannot be lectured into our hearts

and  minds.  Rather we must develop them from within.  Singapore

21,  therefore,  must  not  be just a  campaign  like  the  many

campaigns  that  we  have come across.  It is  a  soul-searching

process involving the examination of the fundamentals we hold as

Singaporeans.   We  must  open  ourselves  to  the  emotive  and

spiritual dimensions in arriving at our own decisions.  We  must

be  able  to transcend the materialistic objectives and look  at

where  our hearts take us.  We should not bemoan what we do  not

have,  but  treasure what we have already got.  The  quality  of

life  ultimately  depends not only on material well  being  but,

more important, emotional and spiritual fulfilment.  Ultimately,

citizenship  is not just a passport to vote and avail  ourselves

to  the benefits.  More important, it signifies where we belong.

Once  we  establish this belonging, the commitment to  work  and

fight for one's country will come naturally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of this sense of belonging and commitment

can take a lifetime, as one goes through the experience of trial

and error.  For younger citizens who have yet to go through this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>

experience, my advice is to open your hearts and minds, and  ask

the fundamental questions which have been posed in Singapore 21.

Consult  those  who  have  gone through  life,  especially  your

parents  and your older friends and relatives.  You may be  able

to  shorten  your learning curve.  Remember that the  grass  may

look  greener  on the other side of the fence,  but  usually  it

turns out not to be so.  Many of our younger Singaporeans lament

that they do not have the time and space to do their own things,

and  think that they can do better in other countries, including

owning  big houses and driving big cars that do not cost an  arm

and a leg.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things may be important for a while but, ultimately,

one must go back to the fundamentals of home and country.  As my

father  did  40 years ago, he chose Singapore for  him  and  his

family.   He  had  no regrets.  Those of us in  the  family  who

followed  him have no regrets either.  Ultimately, the Singapore

heartbeat  is  for all Singaporeans to maintain and  strengthen.

To  my fellow Singaporeans, young and old, only you can make the

final choice.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after listening

to  Mr Bernard Chen's moving speech, I think there can hardly be

any  doubt that the Singapore heartbeat is one which is tangible

and not merely a nice catch phrase nor a platitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one attends National Day Parades and we see the tens

of  thousands of Singaporeans in their jubilant elation and  the

celebration of our national birthday, the sense of pride in  the

country  and  its  achievements, when we hear everybody  in  the

stadium reciting the National Pledge and saying "We the Citizens

of  Singapore",  or when we see everyone standing  to  attention

when  the  National Anthem is played, we all know that something

stirs  in our emotions, and that sense of emotion and that sense

of  attachment are not merely a passing phase, an emotion of the

time,  but  that it is something real, something  tangible.   In

other  words,  the  Singapore  heartbeat  is  not,  as  Mr  J  B

Jeyaretnam said, a platitude, but I believe that it  is  a  real

emotion, a patriotism, a loyalty, to this country which we  call

home.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am in an airplane flying back to Singapore,

especially  after a long trip abroad, and when I see  the  first

buildings, when I see the greenery of Singapore, when I see  the

port,  the ships, I cannot help but feel a sense of familiarity,

a  sense  of  comfort,  a  sense that I  am  coming  home.   The

Singapore  heartbeat is all of these emotions, but  it  is  also

more.   It  is  based on an understanding that Singaporeans  are

distinctive as a people, that the Singapore culture  is  unique,

evolving, and that we have  a distinctive national identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel this most when I travel abroad, because it is very

obvious  that I do not speak with an English neither an American

accent.  And particularly when I lapse into the lah  of Singlish

in   private   conversation,  my  nationality  is   given   away

immediately.  One can spot a Singaporean a mile off whenever  he

or   she  opens  his  or  her  mouth,  because  of  our  accent.

Similarly,  I do not speak Mandarin the way the PRC  Chinese  or

the  Taiwanese do.   I speak Mandarin not very well perhaps, but

I do speak some Mandarin in a way in which Singaporeans do, with

a very unique Singapore accent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the accent. It is not just the chicken rice

nor  the  laksa.  But the very ideals and ethos of  a  Singapore

that  believes in meritocracy, in multi-racialism,  in  a  clean

government  and efficiency are as much part and  parcel  of  the

Singapore  identity, and I believe very much part and parcel  of

what  we  are, those of us who have grown up in Singapore.   All

this is part of the Singapore heartbeat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if all this is already happening, then the question is:

why the emphasis on the Singapore heartbeat and the Singapore 21

vision  for  the 21st century?  If it exists already,  then  why

this continued focus?  For two reasons: first, we cannot take it

for  granted that the heartbeat will grow stronger and, in fact,

globalisation could cause the heartbeat to grow weaker  and  not

stronger.   Second,  there  needs  to  be  a  nurturing  of  the

heartbeat,  for it is not as strong and steady now as  we  would

like it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>

to  be.   Listening  to the Prime Minister  this  afternoon,  we

realise  that there are still cleavages in our society  that  we

need  to work at, and that we need to build on, for, as  he  has

said, we may be a country, but we are not yet a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989 to 1990, I spent one and a half very happy years in

Vancouver.  It was there that I learnt how to golf and ski.  The

ski  slopes were just 45 minutes away from my house.  And during

the winter and spring seasons, the first thing I would do when I

woke  up  would be to look out of the window at the ski  slopes,

check out the weather and if fine, load the skis on my car, take

a  quick  breakfast,  and I would be at the  ski  slopes  in  45

minutes.   Needless  to  say, it is not  that  easy  to  ski  in

Singapore!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer in Vancouver, I went fishing, I went hiking.

The mountains around Vancouver are glorious, and so are the golf

courses.   My  husband and I seriously contemplated  staying  in

Vancouver, and we actually went around looking for property, but

eventually  we came back.  It was not an easy decision  to  come

back,  because life was good in Vancouver.   There was  not  the

kind  of  stress  that there is in Singapore.   So  why  did  we

return?   Because it was only in Singapore that we felt that  we

could really contribute to society as equals, and not as second-class citizens.  We felt that we were Asians and we wanted to be

in Asia where the opportunities are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I have relatives in Shanghai, cousins of about

my  age.  And I often wonder whether it is merely an accident of

history  that  I  was born in Singapore with  the  opportunities

which  I  have,  which they do not have, for each  of  my  three

cousins spent many years in the villages, in the farms, having a

very  hard life working on the farms.  Two of them did not  have

the  privilege of going to the university simply because of  the

time in which they were born, about the same time as I was born.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference? The difference is that I was born

in  Singapore, and being in Singapore, I had the opportunity  to

go to school, to go to the university and hence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>

on,  to  do what I am doing now.  And that is the reason why  we

came  back.  It is because, in Singapore, this is our  home,  we

can  contribute in this country in a way which is very difficult

to  do  elsewhere.   It is here, I think,  as  Mr  Bernard  Chen

mentioned, that we have had the opportunity, and for those of us

here  in this House, to be educated and to do what we have  done

and to be where we are now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although we feel this way, we cannot be sure that

succeeding  generations of Singaporeans will  feel  exactly  the

same.  There is definitely a generational difference.  For those

who  are  highly  skilled, highly mobile,  the  world  is  their

oyster.  Why should they return to Singapore?   And that is  the

question  that  I  think  many  young  Singaporeans  are  asking

themselves  today, particularly those who have  gone  abroad  to

study.  Why should they return to Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the S21 vision, we recognise that there will indeed be

many  more Singaporeans who will go abroad either to work or  to

study.   And  this  is  not  only inevitable,  in  fact,  it  is

desirable   because   of   the   fact   that   Singapore    must

internationalise in order to continue to prosper,  if  Singapore

companies  must go abroad in order to be able to expand  and  to

compete.   Therefore,  the Singapore community  in  future  will

comprise   not   just  the  Singaporeans  here  but   also   the

Singaporeans  who  are  abroad.  And  we  want  the  Singaporean

community  to be inclusive and not exclusive, to recognise  that

there  will  be  many more Singaporeans who will be  living  and

working abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the difference? The difference is that in our

vision,  Singaporeans, no matter where they are  in  the  world,

should  have  an  emotional rootedness to Singapore,  that  they

consider  Singapore as home, and that there  is  a  loyalty  and

attachment to Singapore that will remain with them no matter how

long  they  have  lived or worked abroad, and  because  of  this

attachment,  that they will want to contribute to  Singapore  in

some  tangible  way.   They  could be working  for  a  Singapore

company  overseas.  They could be working for a company that  is

doing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>

business  in  Singapore.  Or they could  simply  be  helping  to

promote  goodwill for Singapore.  Whatever it  is,  it  is  this

issue  of  the  emotional rootedness to Singapore  that  we  are

concerned about and we want to realise in the S21 Vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we nurture the Singapore heartbeat, so that it grows

strong and steady?  The Singapore 21 report contains a number of

recommendations  such  as consciously preserving  landmarks  and

buildings  that  serve  as emotional anchors.   It  talks  about

developing national icons.  It talks about fostering a  stronger

sense  of  national  identity.  The PM  mentioned  the  need  to

continue to build bridges among the races.  What I would like to

add  here  is  that there is one more bridge  that  we  need  to

consciously  build, and that is the bridge between  the  public,

private  and  people  sectors.   The  title  of  the  report  is

"Together, We Make The Difference".  S21 is about the  "we",  it

is  about  community, it is about bonding  as  a  society.   But

unless we are careful, this one cleavage between the public  and

the  people sectors in particular can hinder the achievement  of

the S21 Vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It saddens me when I come across civil servants who

consider  NGOs  and  other groups in the  people  sector  as  an

unruly, disorganised mass.  Likewise, it also saddens me when  I

come  across  people  in  civil society who  are  cynical  about

Government initiatives and projects, who are cynical  about  the

S21 report as yet another Government report and that it does not

signal  any real change.  In other words, there still  exists  a

mistrust  between  the public sector on the  one  hand  and  the

people  sector on the other.  This gap needs to be bridged,  and

we do need a mindset change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore heartbeat is not about many hearts beating in

dissonance, each to its own rhythm.  It is not about the  public

sector  doing  its own thing; the private sector doing  its  own

thing;  the  people sector doing its own thing.   Rather  it  is

about  many hearts beating in resonance with one another.   Each

sector has its own strengths and its own weaknesses.  We need to

support one another,

build one another up, and not criticise and tear down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot Government replies, regardless of whether they are

in the Forum page or otherwise, be polite and civil?  Cannot the

Government  acknowledge good ideas which came  from  the  people

sector  and  not from themselves?  And cannot the people  sector

forget the Catherine Lim affair, treat it as an incident of  the

past, and let us together begin a new page of partnership?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the public sector as a start to give its

response  to the recommendations in the S21 report and  to  make

these  responses  public.   In fact, to  go  one  step  further,

publish   responses  to  the  recommendations  in  the   subject

committee deliberations, so that all the efforts of the  subject

committees  themselves do not just disappear into a black  hole.

For  the people sector, I would say, be involved, be engaged  in

at  least  one  activity, people sector activity, regardless  of

whether  it  is charity or it is a group such as preserving  the

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the Singapore heartbeat is about caring - that we care for our families, that we care for our community

and  that we care for our country - this island that we call our

home.   This  caring, which is so much a part of  the  Singapore

heartbeat, is the very essence of the vision that we  hope  will

be realised in 21st century Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  in support of the motion in the name of  Minister

RAdm Teo Chee Hean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at the glossy cover of the book "Singapore 21,

Together We Make The Difference", it reminded me of two things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the confident and somewhat smiling faces of the

kids,  our future, looking out of the jigsaw window of a complex

and global environment, reminds

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>

me  of what Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew asked some time back

- whether there will still be Singapore 100 years hence.  I also

wondered  what  Senior Minister will have to  say  about  vision

Singapore  21.   We  know  that on  two  occasions  when  Senior

Minister was asked about his experience with multi-racialism and

nation   building,  he  choked,  almost  to  tears.   SM   Lee's

experience then must have been very heartwrenching.  PM Goh  has

just  shared his piece of mind with us and I totally share those

sentiments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my humble mind, what is embodied in "Singapore 21,

Together  We  Make The Difference" speaks volumes  of  the  same

concerns  PM  Goh  and  SM  Lee  have  for  Singapore's  future.

Personally,  I  am confident that we will be able  to  make  the

difference, and make a success of what Singapore stands for, not

only   for  those  children's  generation  but  that  of   their

children's too, stretching more than 100 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I sound over confident or even rhetorical, allow

me  to  remind  ourselves  that all is not  perfect,  as  things

normally  are.  There may be many trials, and even tribulations,

if we do not know how to manage the challenges that await us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure Members will remember

Singapore  is  not short of vision.  Neither were  we  short  of

challenges.   Remember the Battle for Merger, the fight  against

communism  and  communalism?   Remember  our  "Survival"   days?

Remember  The  Next Lap and Vision 1999?  All in  all,  we  have

shown that our vision statements were not mere dreams.  We  have

also  one  by  one  overcome  those challenges.   We  have  been

pragmatists,  pragmatic idealists, if you  like.   But  we  also

realise  that the challenge of nation building is  more  than  a

marathon.  In the words of PM Goh, unending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh has also sounded a note of caution, a dose of

realism, in this debate.  I think it is most timely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we not see the subtle hint of those possible 'blues' in

the cover of the book?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>

After all, as Minister Teo Chee Hean said in his opening remarks

yesterday,  I  quote, "for those who think that  conflict  is  a

thing of the past, one need only to think of Kosovo .".  And  if

I  may add, the gory picture of an Indonesian Dayak (or was it a

Malay?) carrying the dismembered head of a Madurese will  remain

vivid in our memory to remind us that the ugly head of ethnicity

is  still lurking around, even in these days of cyber technology

and KBE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I too went

through the riots of 1964 coming face to face with bloody racial

violence.   I  was in Secondary 3 then and I will  never  forget

those  senseless scenes.  It was at Victoria Street  near  where

the  Lavender  MRT  station now is that I saw Malays  or  Malay-looking  youths  being  maimed and  perhaps  even  killed,  with

bicycle  chains, iron rods and acid bulbs.  And at  the  end  of

that longest journey home for me to Geylang and Joo Chiat, I saw

Malays  hitting innocent Chinese, particularly a trishaw  rider,

with blood streaming down his swollen face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day onwards, for my sake and that of my children,

and  generations to come, I swore to do my utmost to  make  sure

racial riots and violence do not return to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation building is never easy, especially for a state whose

population  is  as  diverse as that of  Singapore.   However,  I

believe  that it is those kinds of challenges that will bond  us

together  further, if we are united in our sense of purpose  and

direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the title "Make the Difference"

also  reminds me of another sense of mission, that of the  Malay

self-help  group,  MENDAKI, in fact the Malay  community  called

"Making the Difference" (showed cover of the MENDAKI book).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the Malays are not making a claim of copyright.

Minister Teo Chee Hean should be reassured that they are instead

most  happy  to share that symphony of purpose.   For  sure,  we

share  a  common  destiny.  After all, the  slogan  "Making  the

Difference" also emanates from Prime

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>

Minister Goh's National Day Rally speech earlier this decade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Malay community or Singapore 21, the rallying

point  is  similar.  The message is clear: Let us  get  our  act

together to make a success of our `Singapore Uno'.  Together, as

a more cohesive, multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious

Singapore, we have to tackle the challenges of the next  century

and the next millennium head on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today, at the 2000 year old Great

Wall  of  China, is a Millennium Countdown Clock which calls  on

its people to "seize the moment . build the motherland".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the same sentiment about preserving and enhancing

our island state Singapore when reading the Singapore 21 book.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Singapore 21 Committee chose not to call it a

blueprint,  the possible `blues' notwithstanding, I  agree  that

the ideas around the five pillars of Singapore 21 will serve  as

an important compass to navigate our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "broad strokes" of "every Singaporean matters, strong

families,  opportunities for all, the Singaporean heartbeat  and

active citizens" all add up to the sense of unity in diversity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also reminds me of the broad strokes of calligraphy

given to me by the renowned Pan Shou called: He Xie or Harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is not to say that

there  are  no  shades  of differences or  problems  here.   For

example,  the debate over SAP schools, after over  10  years  in

existence, still lingers.  So with the question of Malays in the

army.   Or, recently, the unhappiness felt particularly  by  the

minorities about racial discrimination in employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with the official clarification given

over  such  issues.  I understand the need for SAP  schools  but

feel  reassured that more will be done to ensure  that  the  SAP

students   are   not   isolated  in  their   understanding   and

appreciation of the importance of multi-racialism.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the Malays in the SAF, I welcome the

statement  made by DPM Dr Tony Tan reassuring us  that  the  SAF

will not allow anyone to be discriminated because of race.   The

NTUC  resolution  on  May  Day last week  against  any  form  of

discrimination in employment is also timely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there will still be the need to continue to

monitor  such  issues  so  as not to allow  them  to  divide  us

Singaporeans.   Even  policies that impinge on  multi-racialism,

including  those  on racial integration in HDB  estates,  school

enrolment,    multi-racial    representation    in    grassroots

organisations,  need regular revisits either for fine-tuning  or

revision so as to facilitate better cohesion in our multi-racial

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, multi-racialism is too important a pillar for

us  to  take  for granted.  It is critical that we  ensure  that

multi-racialism prevails and be strengthened from time to  time.

It  is  an unending process.  It is a heartwarming part  of  the

Singapore heartbeat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on the motion on

the Singapore 21 Vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion and feel fortunate that I have

been  involved in the S21 process for the last 18  months.   Our

last  30  years  of nation building has been largely  successful

because  of  the  style of governance we have had  during  those

years,  where  the Government played a dominant  role  and  many

decisions  being top down driven.  The style of  governance  was

necessary  because  of the political and social  environment  of

those times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the governance of Singapore is going to be

much  more  complex than before because of a number of  reasons.

Firstly,  we  are heading towards a knowledge based economy  but

the complexity is not because of the content of such an economy,

but rather how we must be organised to participate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>

in  it.   Second, the world is becoming increasingly  borderless

and  many of our people will be able to choose to live and  work

in  most  of the appealing parts of the world.  Similarly,  many

foreigners  will  be  living  and  working  in  Singapore,  thus

influencing  the behaviour of Singaporeans.  Third,  our  people

are  more educated today, well travelled and more exposed to the

cultures, values and systems of other worlds.  They will be able

to  and will want to play an increasingly important role in  how

the country is run.  Fourth, as we progress, the needs of people

become  more  sophisticated and as we clearly know, basic  needs

like  food, shelter and job having been fulfilled will give  way

to  higher  level needs like self-esteem, individual rights  and

spirituality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, managing the affairs of the country in the future will

therefore  become  a  more difficult job because  the  focus  of

governance will become much wider compared to the last 30 years.

This  is  because new issues have to be addressed if  we  really

want to make Singapore the best home for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our past system of relying on a few good men alone will not

work  well.   We will need many more minds to come  together  to

offer  solutions.   Our  formula  of  over  dependence  on   the

Government  was  acceptable  in  the  past  because   both   the

Government   and   the   people  were  comfortable   with   this

arrangement.  Today, both the people and the Government need  to

accept that their roles will have to change and both must find a

happy  balance  of  the formula that will work  in  the  future.

Major  mindset changes need to take place first.  The Government

needs to let go while Singaporeans need to take more interest to

do  more.   This must be a joint responsibility of  the  public,

private and the people sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my subject committee studied the issue of "Singapore

as  a  Home"  thoroughly  and  the reason  is,  as  Singaporeans

internationalise, there will be increasing pressures on them  to

make  choices as to where they would live, work and raise  their

families.   We  felt  that  if we wanted  Singaporeans  to  call

Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>

their  home, a number of conditions in our country must  prevail

first.   The  most  important of these is that each  Singaporean

must  feel that he or she has a stake in the country  and  as  a

stakeholder, there must be a sense of ownership of what goes  on

here.   For  this sense of ownership to prevail,  everyone  must

participate in the running of the country.  If every Singaporean

makes  it  his  or her responsibility to contribute constructive

ideas  and  solutions and be willing to be accountable  for  the

outcome,  then  I  believe  we will be  successful  in  bringing

Singapore to a higher level of progress in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore feel that this sense of ownership and

being a stakeholder is the most important prerequisite if we are

serious  about  realising  the  Singapore  21  Vision.   We,  as

citizens,  must  have  a buy-in to the vision.   This  does  not

belong  just to the Government, not to the public sector  alone,

but to all of us.  If we cannot achieve this sense of ownership,

then  I  am  afraid we will fail in developing  this  notion  of

Singapore  as  our  Best  Home and we will  not  get  closer  to

realising our vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our subject committee, very early in the process,

identified the concept of emotional rootedness, as Dr  Lee  Tsao

Yuan  mentioned earlier on, as being the most important approach

of   developing  the  type  of  attachment  that  we  want   for

Singaporeans.   Physical rootedness of being physically  present

in  Singapore  alone  is  not enough.   No  matter  where  one's

physical  location  is,  one's  sense  of  belonging,  emotional

attachment  and  loyalty  should  be  to  Singapore.   Emotional

rootedness  refers to the degree of psychological commitment  to

the  country.  A high degree of emotional rootedness suggests  a

passionate  and  intense  sense  of  belonging,  commitment  and

loyalty to the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore globalises, a larger proportion of our

talented people who are highly mobile will grow.  The danger  is

that  their  physical absence from Singapore  might  reduce  the

emotional commitment to the country and may result in  a  higher

rate of emigration.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>

solution  therefore is to encourage a high degree  of  emotional

rootedness so that Singapore will always have a special place in

one's heart, as a home.  It is only then that we can achieve the

Singapore heartbeat that we have talked about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in developing the goal of the Singapore Heartbeat with

the  vision of Singapore as a Home, our committee focused on how

we  could  strengthen the emotional rootednesss of  Singaporeans

and we realised that there are many factors involved in creating

the sense of belonging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best home must provide the best hope for its people.

There  must be confidence and not fear of the future.  Singapore

should  offer a good quality of life, not just for those who  we

traditionally  classify as being successful,  but  also  to  all

citizens.  No matter what one's race, religion or background is,

there must be harmony, unity of purpose and a transcending sense

of  national  identity.  These common attitudes  and  attributes

will uniquely identify the Singaporean community of the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People of all races must make special efforts to learn of

the beliefs and peculiarities of each other's practices and ways

of  life.   They  must make it a personal responsibility  to  be

aware  of the sensitivities and to promote a spirit of tolerance

and understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would like to touch on a few of the

recommendations  that our subject committee made.   Firstly,  on

encouraging the community spirit to blossom through more bottom-up initiatives.  Sir, we have many grassroots organisations, the

main  ones  being Government or PA-driven.  They have been  very

successful in serving the needs of citizens, particularly  those

living  in  the  HDB  estates, through  organisations  like  the

Residents'  Committees.  The Community Development Councils  are

also  starting  to  be  very effective  in  promoting  community

bonding.   There  are  also  many  other  non-Government  linked

volunteer organisations like the Lions Club, the Buddhist  Lodge

and many others who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>

have  played  a  very  important  role  in  promoting  community

bonding.   Our  committee, however, felt that the  participation

rate  of  Singaporeans in such organisations and  in  performing

community  service is far too low.  In fact, a survey  that  was

conducted by the S21 Committee also showed this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More encouragement and latitude should be given to people

wanting  to organise themselves in community service activities.

We hope to see more community activities and civic organisations

through bottom-up initiatives with people with a common interest

getting  together spontaneously, rather than being asked  to  do

so.   These will complement the many existing organisations that

we  already have.  These organisations should not be Government-driven  and  the people sector must take the responsibility  for

forming such organisations to improve the lives of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, everyone is important and we must broaden the

definition  of  meritocracy and success.  Sir, the  practice  of

meritocracy has served us well in the past.  It has enabled  the

best  and the brightest to rise through the system, irregardless

of  race, family backdrop or gender.  However, the system may no

longer  work  as we move towards a different type of environment

where being academically smart alone is not enough.  Sir, for us

to succeed in the future, we feel that the current definition of

meritocracy  is  too  narrow,  focusing  only  on  academic  and

economic  excellence.   This  definition  and  the  practice  of

meritocracy and the way we define success along the  same  lines

does  not allow every Singaporean to develop to his or her  full

potential.  If we look back in history, the best leaders in  the

world are not all scholars.  On the contrary, many did not  have

straight `As' or impressive paper qualification.  A true  leader

possesses  many qualities consisting of both IQ and  EQ  factors

and  I  feel  that it is about time we modified our practice  of

meritocracy to include the new EQ measures, which I  can  agree,

are  difficult  to measure.  But this needs  to  be  done.   Our

current scholar

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>

system which was set in place many years ago needs to change  so

that  we  will be able to select leaders of diverse  backgrounds

and not those of the same mould to lead the country.  We have to

move  away  from  stereotype role models and include  both  non-scholars as well as those who have talents other than being able

to   score  well  in  examinations  as  examples  of  successful

Singaporeans whom we value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every Singaporean has a role to play and as long as

everyone  tries to achieve his or her full potential, we  should

be proud of them.  Not everyone will make it to the top, neither

can such a society exist because we need people at all levels of

society  for a country to function.  We therefore should respect

and give equal opportunities to everyone no matter what they  do

for  a  living.  It is about time that we practised  meritocracy

with   a   heart,  appreciating  and  recognising   that   every

Singaporean is important and must feel as such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue that I would like to talk about is one

of  racial harmony and the Prime Minister has touched about this

earlier  on.  I would like to share with the House some  of  the

issues that came about as we went through our process of getting

feedback from the various focus groups.  In the early stages  of

our  discussion, I sensed a more in-depth study  was  needed  on

this  issue,  especially from the perspectives of  the  minority

communities.  I therefore decided to conduct further focus group

discussions  with the minority communities.  I had  a  total  of

three  such  discussions and I would like to share the  findings

with  this House.  And I also feel that we need to discuss these

openly  and  address them if we truly want to achieve excellence

in  the area of racial harmony.  While legislation has been used

as  one tool to ensure racial harmony in Singapore, I feel  that

we  need  to go beyond rules and regulations to ensure that  all

races  interact  and live happily with each other  so  that  our

fundamentals of a multi-racial and multi-religious society  will

continue to exist for a long time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the minorities' point of view, there are a number

of issues.  First of all,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>

awareness  and sensitivity.  If each one of us does not  make  a

special  effort  to know the sensitivities and peculiarities  of

each  other's  way of life, the danger is that  we  may  end  up

offending  others without realising that we have  done  so.   In

this  respect, there is fear among the minority communities that

I  spoke to that this lack of awareness is starting to emerge in

our  society.  For example, one issue raised is that while  most

members of the minority communities understood the need  of  the

Speak Mandarin Campaign, some felt that it is inappropriate  for

the  members  of  the Chinese community to break  into  speaking

Mandarin  when  people  of other races  who  do  not  understand

Mandarin are present in group discussions or in a meeting.  Many

have  felt offended, but are not expressing this concern openly.

Similarly, not knowing that Muslim's food preference has  to  be

halal  could  result  in a big problem.   Sir,  a  parliamentary

colleague of mine thought that I am Tamil speaking.  I  did  not

feel  offended, but rather amused at the lack of  awareness  and

understanding  of who I am after so many years  of  multi-racial

society.  If this trend continues, we may see an erosion of  the

values that we have put in place for a multi-racial society  and

this needs to be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue that came out during the discussion with

the  minority communities was the SAP school that has been  much

debated  before.  The issue is not that the minority communities

do not support the concept of SAP school.  But the worry is that

the  future  leaders of our country would have  gone  through  a

system of education without having much interaction  with people

of  the  non-Chinese  race.  These same  people  would  then  be

responsible  for making policies that affect other  races.   How

can  they  be  conversant of the sensitivities of  each  of  the

minority  races  if they never had a real experience  of  mixing

with them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not whether SAP schools are necessary. But

with  SAP schools present, how can we resolve this issue of  not

being  aware  and  hence potentially making  mistakes  affecting

sensitive  racial  issues in the future?  Our subject  committee

recommends that the twinning of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>

SAP  and  non-SAP schools be done as a solution.   Perhaps,  all

ECAs  should  be done at a twinning level if we want  to  ensure

true  interaction.   Substantial  interaction  needs  to  happen

throughout the year if we want to make a real difference.  Doing

it once or twice a year during multi-racial day is not enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue that came up was the effect of the

ethnic based self-help groups.  Whilst the objectives are  good,

they  have resulted in less help across ethnic and racial lines.

In  fact,  the  current practice creates a real  danger  of  the

various  races being alienated from one another.   Sir,  I  feel

that   when   I  grew  up,  there  was  much  more  inter-racial

interaction and we did not highlight the differences  among  the

various  races  and  therefore  our  inter-racial  bonding   was

strengthened.  Today, our children are growing up with a greater

awareness  of  the differences because of the way  we  organise,

either  in  schools, for example, in SAP schools or  in  certain

schools  where students studying the same mother tongue are  put

in the same class, or through the various self-help groups.  Our

subject  committee  has suggested that we  promote  more  inter-racial  interaction by having an umbrella body for all self-help

groups,  so  that the various races can contribute towards  each

other's  efforts.   We all need to think and  see  ourselves  as

Singaporeans first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth issue that came out is the practice of

meritocracy.    One  unintended  impact  of  our   practice   of

meritocracy,  which  I must admit, is a transparent  system  and

applies equally to all races.  It is because the members of  the

minority  races,  the  Malays, Indians  and  Eurasians,  do  not

perform  as  well  as  the Chinese in the academic  measures  of

examinations, they end up not being selected as scholars  or  to

key  positions  in Government, because of the  way  we  practise

meritocracy  by academic excellence alone.  While the  long-term

solution  has been correctly identified as one of uplifting  the

academic performances of the minority races, which the self-help

groups  are trying to do, I believe if we can change the way  we

measure success and practise meritocracy to include non-academic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>

measures, this unintended effect can be easily resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue that I want to discuss, and this affects not

only  the minority communities, was brought up during our  other

focus group discussions, and that is our education system.  Many

Members   have  spoken  about  the  competitive  and   stressful

education system.  That, I must agree, has served us well in the

past.   Our system of education, however, needs to be fine-tuned

to  remove those elements that are not tolerant to failures  and

are  not  forgiving  to  those who are late  developers.   I  am

referring  to  the  early  streaming  in  our  schools  and  the

subsequent  streaming throughout the system which  I  feel  will

result in a class society in Singapore in the long-term,  if  we

are not careful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the intent of streaming was to segregate students

into various capability levels and let each group develop at its

own  pace,  I  feel  that in implementing,  the  educators,  the

parents and the society have created a system where emphasis  is

placed  on  making the good better, and with the best  resources

being used so that they will continue to improve and score  well

and  the school's performance will improve.  We treat those  who

are streamed into EM3 and into the Normal (Technical) stream  as

failures too early in the lives of our children.  In my opinion,

we  have  yet to see this class society developing in  Singapore

because this will only happen when the children who went through

this system become parents and have children of their own.   And

I  see real danger of this happening in the future if we do  not

put in efforts to change the system that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share with the House two real examples that

I came across.  One was during the focus group discussion that I

had  with one of the minority groups.  A young man aged mid-30s,

told  me  that  he was streamed into EM3, and then  into  Normal

(Technical) stream and he later went to ITE.  He told me that he

felt very frustrated that he was treated as a failure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>

and  as  an outcast and he felt very angry with the system.   He

even contemplated suicide at one stage of his life.  Because  of

his  frustration, he felt that he had no place in the system  in

Singapore.  However, fortunately, he self-motivated himself  and

wanted  to prove to everyone that he is not a failure, and  that

the system was wrong in classifying him as one.  Today, he holds

a  Masters  degree and he is doing well in life.   He  is  still

bitter  with the education system and fears for his children  if

they have to go through what he went through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another incident, during one of my meet-the-people

sessions,  the parents of a 9-year old boy came to  see  me  and

they  sought  my help to appeal for their son to be  transferred

from  EM3  to EM2 stream, and pleaded with me that if their  son

remained in the EM3 stream, his life would be destroyed forever.

And they made this comment in front of the child.  Our system is

not  forgiving and every one is responsible for this,  including

our educators, parents and society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of self-esteem is also a serious one and I have

seen this in the faces of those who came from the lower streams.

I  would like to refer the House to an article which appeared in

the   Straits  Times  on  12  July  1998  regarding  the  Gifted

Programme.  It reads, "Being Gifted is fine, but what if you are

Normal."    This   article  was  written  by   a   20-year   old

undergraduate who was selected for the Gifted Programme in 1998.

Let  me  quote  from the article to illustrate my point  on  our

education system:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently, a friend of mine who taught both the GEP [which

is  a  gifted  programme] and the non-GEP students as  a  relief

teacher told me she thought that they were quite different  when

it  came to self-esteem.   The GEP students were much more self-assured  and spoke up more often in class.  Girls in the  normal

stream  were vocal, rowdy but have little self-esteem.  However,

we want to say it is not true that the practice of streaming and

its  effect of slapping labels onto students does draw invisible

lines that shape our self-confidence or the lack of it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we segregate our children in the various streams, they

miss  out on the opportunity to learn from one another.  Putting

all  the  slow  learners together is a self-defeating  approach.

Let me quote from the article again:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know, there is not much interaction among the

different  streams.  It is almost an "us against them"  sort  of

mentality sometimes."

<br><br>Hopefully, allowing the students to work together will let  them

understand that they are alike in many ways.  And this was after

this writer made a recommendation that they should be spending a

lot more time together rather than separate from one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight that coming from a person

who  went  through the system, and who went through  the  better

part  of  the system and feels this way about it, speaks volumes

about the need to change.  Let me quote the writer again:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the weeding out procedure of our education system

which may be the most efficient is not entirely perfect since it

is  difficult  to measure the potential of an individual.   Slow

starters or those who do not qualify as gifted in Primary 3 or 6

miss a precious opportunity."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reality of our education system and of how all

of  us, the schools, the parents and society are treating  those

who  are not academically well-off and late developers.  We have

to  change  if  we  are  serious  about  the  notion  of  "Every

Singaporean  matters".   I  am  hopeful  that  the  Ministry  of

Education  will look into these issues when they  implement  the

"mass customisation" approach to our education system, which the

Minister for Education spoke about during the Budget debate this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to add that we have set the

stage for changes in the way Singapore should be governed in the

future.   Many recommendations we have made will require mindset

changes among all sectors of society.  We must ensure that every

one feels they have a useful role to play in the development  of

Singapore  and  that  they are valued as individuals  and  as  a

community.   While  our past approaches of nation-building  have

worked,  the same approaches cannot ensure continued success  in

the   future.   Ultimately,  we  must  all  adopt  a  sense   of

responsibility  and ownership to want to make a  difference  and

the  key  ingredient that will make this work is the trust  that

the people, public and the private sectors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>

have  in  each  other.  I am confident that  we  will  make  the

necessary changes because I see a determined PAP leadership  who

wants  to make these changes and who is sincere in sharing  this

vision that we have defined as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for being given an opportunity to be involved

in  the S21 process and in helping to define the S21 Vision.   I

believe  that the people are wholeheartedly behind this  Vision.

The  6,000 or so people we consulted, each represents many  more

Singaporeans  because we consulted leaders from various  sectors

of society, and together, I strongly believe we have reached out

to  a significant proportion of Singaporeans in arriving at  our

Vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I rise to speak in

support  of the motion standing in the name of the Minister  for

Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report by the Singapore 21 Committee could not have

been more timely.  As we prepare to face the next millennium, it

is  right that we should collectively, as a nation, take a  step

backwards  and define what we want for the country in the  years

ahead.   Although Singapore has a relatively short  history,  we

are, nevertheless, a country with our own identity, and well  on

our  way  to  becoming a nation that all of us,  whether  we  be

Indians, Chinese or others, can be proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 30 years, we as a people have gone through many

milestones  in  our  collective  memory.  We  can  think  of  us

struggling for independence or fighting with the communists,  or

overcoming   the  evils  of  communalism,  or  struggling   with

calamities and disasters, such as the Hotel New World  collapse,

and,  most recently, the SilkAir crash of MI185.  Whatever these

events,  we cannot deny that the common experience has  got  the

people  closer together, either in common suffering or in common

celebration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our achievements in the last 30 years have made

Singaporeans extremely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>

proud  of  themselves.   A  pride  that  sometimes  bordered  on

arrogance  and  is  seen  as  such  by  many  outsiders.   While

arrogance is not an attitude we want to encourage of our people,

it nonetheless reflects the pride which our people have for this

country. Taken in the right spirit, it is an attitude we want to

preserve  and  build  upon so that our foundation  as  a  nation

becomes stronger with the passing years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision statement of the Singapore 21 Committee, in all

its  component  parts,  must surely  lead  to  the  question  of

strengthening the country as a nation; a nation with an identity

that over time would become strong with a heart beating strongly

for  it.   How  do  we ensure that?  How will  opportunities  be

perceived?  The Committee has, among other things, argued  quite

rightly  that  the  Singapore of the 21st century  must  provide

every  opportunity  for  Singaporeans to pursue  their  personal

rainbows, whether it be the arts, sports, entertainment or other

areas.   Singapore of the future must continue  to  be  a  place

where opportunities abound and where we can find here, the  same

optimism as our forefathers did.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seeking to provide these opportunities, one argument is

that  we  must  practise  an  open door  to  encourage  talented

foreigners  to  come. By bringing in talented  foreigners,  they

will  be  able  to  contribute  to  our  continued  growth   and

prosperity,  and  in the process, help create  a  thriving  city

which  provides  opportunities for all.  The  logic  behind  the

argument of foreign talent is hard to fault.  I am, for one, all

in  support of us bringing in foreign talent if, in the process,

these  foreigners  can  work  towards  the  fulfilment  of   the

Singapore  dream.   However, while most  discussions  in  recent

months  centred  around  the principle of  bringing  in  foreign

talent to Singapore, little has been said of the question of who

is  a  foreign talent, and how can foreign talents be introduced

to  this  country  without unduly upsetting the  present  social

balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, nobody denies that foreign talents can make a

positive contribution to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>

the Singapore economy.  If a Nobel prize laureate were to set up

home  in Singapore, he would indeed qualify as a foreign talent.

Alternatively, if Bill Gates decides to migrate to Singapore, he

too  would  qualify as a foreign talent.  Realistically,  it  is

unlikely  that  Singapore would be attractive  enough  for  such

people.   For them, they are successful and there are  very  few

reasons  why  they want to pull themselves out and  relocate  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not talking about people in this class, one would

suppose  that we are talking about those who are good  in  their

respective fields but who are not necessarily in the  top  band.

Nonetheless,  these people may have the skills and expertise  to

make  a  contribution to Singapore.  If, by definition,  foreign

talent   refers  to  these  people,  the  question   that   many

Singaporeans have asked is, how can we identify these people  as

the  kind  of  people with the talents we want.  In  its  common

usage  in  recent months, foreign talent has come to be  loosely

treated as being synonymous with those who have studied at  some

respected universities overseas and may have, perhaps,  acquired

some  working experience which may be of relevance to Singapore.

Possibly,  some  of  these people may have  also  acquired  some

proven  track  record as well.  And so it is that over  time  we

have  welcomed into our country many of these people from  China

and India and elsewhere who possess these qualifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, I have no objection to foreign talents

coming  to Singapore to make a contribution.  However, one  must

be  very  careful in the way in which we collectively understand

what  foreign  talent  means.  If foreign  talent  merely  means

taking  on board someone with a post-graduate degree, with  some

relevant working experience in some ritzy merchant banking house

or  manufacturing concern, I am not sure if these  people  would

qualify as true talents who can make a positive contribution  to

our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue, as some Singaporeans have seen it, is one of

acquiring the relevant experience and expertise that Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>

needs  to  propel  the  country into the 21st  century.   If  to

acquire  the experience and expertise would mean going  overseas

to  study  and  gaining the necessary working experience  before

returning  home as a talent, then we may be sending a  different

message  to our people that it is not good enough to go  to  our

local  universities and start their working career  here.   This

could well be an unintended effect of what we want to achieve in

the   long  run,  and  would  put  the  local  graduates  in   a

disadvantaged  position, vis-a-vis those who  went  overseas  to

study  and  to  work.  The irony deepens even further  if  as  a

result  of  his  inability  to  qualify  for  a  university   in

Singapore,  the  person chooses to study  overseas  and  make  a

success  of it, acquires the relevant experience and comes  back

as  a talent.  We may well ask how different is this person from

the  local  boy  who  spends his time faithfully  in  Singapore.

Unless we have a proper yardstick to define who a foreign talent

is,  we  may  all  be deceiving ourselves if we merely  employed

someone  with some qualification and treat him as a talent  when

our own people can do the job just as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are not able to carefully sift between the

foreign  talent and those who merely want to come here  to  seek

out  opportunities for work, we may sadly end up in a  situation

where  Singaporeans  may find themselves out  of  a  job  simply

because  foreigners  have displaced them  by  having  the  right

assets, even if they may not be true talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign talents, most Singaporeans would readily accept

the  position  if a foreign CEO was brought in to  run  a  local

company.   However, one must realise that a foreign CEO  who  is

asked to take charge of a company must have capable officers  to

help  him fulfil his mandate.  A foreign CEO, who is brought  in

to  run an organisation, would more likely than not be forced to

replace  the middle management with his own appointees as  well,

since   he  needs  to  perform  to  prove  his  worth   to   the

organisation.  The CEO's appointees may not necessarily be local

employees.  In fact, they will, in all likelihood, be foreigners

whom he is familiar with.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>

These  managers who come in would equally be encouraged to  find

their  own team members who can help them achieve their mandate.

And  so  the displacement may just go down the corporate  chain.

The  question  is,  how can we ensure that  in  the  process  of

seeking  these foreign talents to create opportunities  for  us,

we,   by   our  own  actions,  are  not  unwittingly  displacing

Singaporeans  who are equally able and capable  of  doing  these

jobs?    In   trying  to  create  a  vision  where  we   provide

opportunities for all, the Government must be clear as   to  who

these  foreign  talents  are, the type  of  opportunities  these

foreign  talents can create for Singaporeans and  the  assurance

that these are true opportunities and not lost opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Singapore, it is very important that the

perception   of   opportunities  remains   among   Singaporeans.

Singapore  should  be  a place where opportunities  continue  to

abound.   Otherwise,  it  would  be  very  difficult  indeed  to

maintain  the strong heartbeat for Singapore that  we  want  all

Singaporeans to have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home is where the heart is, and home is also where

opportunities are made available.  Where the members  feel  they

do not belong, it is no longer home, and where there is no home,

there is no heartbeat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us speak passionately about Singapore and its

future.  I can understand this as Singapore is the only home  we

know.   Like  it  or  not, our destinies as a  people  are  tied

together.   We have to make a success of this nation.  There  is

no alternative.  I agree with the call of the Government that we

must  continue to keep the heart beating strongly for Singapore.

As  our  people go overseas to work or to study or even migrate,

the  diaspora of Singaporeans around the world does  not  matter

for  us  as  long as wherever they are, whatever they do,  these

people can continue to know and remember their place of origin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turtles go to the beaches of Trengganu, I am told, to lay

eggs once a year.  And after the eggs are hatched, they will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>

scramble to the sea and travel all over the world.  But wherever

they  are,  the turtles always know their place of  origin   and

will  make  the  journey back faithfully to lay their  eggs,  to

perpetuate themselves for posterity.  Equally, the Jews and  the

Chinese are spread all over the world.  They will always have  a

deep   remembrance  of  their  place  of  origin.   It  is  this

association and connection with their place of origin  that  has

built  up  the  bonds  and the ties that will  hold  the  people

together in a crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want Singaporeans to develop a stronger sense of

belonging and commitment to this country, whether they  live  in

Singapore  or overseas.  We must embrace this common  vision  of

what this country stands for, what its values are and whether it

is  worth  returning if one needs to.  At the end  of  the  day,

there  must be a conviction that this country is a country worth

fighting and dying for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that all of us can actually play a part in shaping

this  country.  The more successful Singaporeans must carry  the

additional duty for other Singaporeans to help them embrace this

common  vision.   This vision of Singapore as a  place  we  call

home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was at a constituency dinner recently. The function

was  organised  for  the  purpose of  bringing  together  senior

citizens  from old folks homes to Tampines Central  for  dinner.

And  I  can assure Members of this House that we did not  charge

them  $300 for coming to Tampines.  Anyway, the elderly citizens

who are residents of these homes are there because they have  no

one  to  turn  to.   They  are essentially  abandoned  by  their

children.  Although they are abandoned by their children,  there

was  no  lack  of  love  that was shown for  them  by  the  many

volunteers  who  were  there to help.  I  could  see  how  these

residents  tenderly  looked after and gently  escorted  the  old

folks  whenever they needed to leave the table.  These  are  all

volunteers  who  give their time freely for  community  service.

And it is impressions like these that essentially

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>

warm  my  heart and make me realise the true meaning of  calling

Singapore  home, a place where we all feel as one big family  in

this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans living overseas, we must endeavour to keep

the  heart  beating  beyond  the first  generation.   Singapore,

unfortunately, does not have a history long and deep enough  for

it  to  have  a cultural DNA that Singaporeans, no matter  where

they are, can pass from one generation to another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the first generation of living overseas, children

born  of Singaporean parents would no longer have any attachment

to  Singapore unless they spend some time at home.   If  we  are

prepared  to  accept a diaspora of Singaporeans,  then  I  would

encourage and urge our Government to give some attention to  see

how we can keep this heartbeat going for Singaporeans overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our gathering here today marks a milestone in our

national history which signifies renewal as well as change.   We

alone hold in our mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of

ill-will and distrust among fellow Singaporeans, and all  manner

of  differences in the name of a much better future we  want  to

create for ourselves and our children.  These commitments spring

forth from the beliefs for which our forebears fought so hard to

establish.   We dare not forget today that we are heirs  of  the

first revolution.  The revolution brought on by our pioneers has

given us life in Singapore as we know it.  Let us go forth  from

this  time and place to tell our friends and our foes alike that

we  intend to keep the heart beating strongly for Singapore  and

for  many  more generations of Singaporeans to come.  Let  every

nation  know whether they wish us well or ill that we shall  pay

any  price,  bear  any  burden, meet any hardship,  support  any
