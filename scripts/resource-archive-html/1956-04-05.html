<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question - [4th April]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly affirms, in the name of the

people  of Singapore, its belief in the principle  of

"the  basic right of peoples to governments of  their

own   choice",   as  enunciated  in  the   Washington

Declaration   signed  by  Sir  Anthony  Eden,   Prime

Minister   of  the  United  Kingdom,  and   President

Eisenhower,  President  of  the  United   States   of

America, on the 1st of February, 1956;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its belief that the long term welfare of

Singapore lies in close and friendly cooperation with

the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth territories;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Assembly instructs its All-Party

Delegation to the forthcoming Constitutional Talks in

London to seek forthwith for Singapore the status  of

an independent territory within the Commonwealth, and

to  offer  an  agreement between the  United  Kingdom

Government  and the Singapore Government whereby  the

Government of the United Kingdom would in respect  of

Singapore exercise control over external defence  and

give  guidance in foreign relations other than  trade

and commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

receiving notice of this motion, I pondered for  some

time  considering what I could and should  say  which

might  be  a useful and constructive contribution  to

what ought to be and must be an important debate.  On

the  one  hand, it would be easy and,  no  doubt,  to

many,  emotionally  satisfying to  shout  Merdeka  in

happy  concurrence and then to sit down. On the other

hand,  it  would  be easy and cheap to  dismiss  this

motion  as  a piece of eyewash because the  All-Party

delegation  has, in fact, already given its  approval

to  what  is  before us. Neither course seems  to  me

satisfactory  or helpful, for, in taking  a  historic

decision - and  indeed, it will be a historic  decision

for Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>

- it  is  as  well to remember what, in fact,  we  are

doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the position of Singapore today,

hovering  as it does on the brink of self-government,

my  thoughts go back to the India of ten  years  ago,

because,  by a curious coincidence, I lived in  India

for the last ten years of the great country's life as

a  dependent  territory, just  as  I  have  spent  a

similar  period in Singapore, and several  points  of

comparison occur to me between the India of 1946  and

the  Singapore of today, poised, both of them, on the

eve of achieving independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that, whereas Britain was about to cede

to  the Indian peoples a vast country which had  been

theirs  for  hundreds  of years  before  the  British

appeared  on the scene, in the case of Singapore  Her

Majesty's Government is about to cede a territory for

which  all  the communities, including  the  British,

have  had, one might say, a more or less equal  share

in  building  up. Or to put it another  way:  whereas

nobody  could seriously question that India  belonged

and  always  had  belonged  to  the  Indians  as  the

indigenous  race,  there  could  be  some  legitimate

argument on that score regarding Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that whereas India was and is a vast sub-continent measuring thousands of square miles,

Singapore  is a small island of 220 square  miles  or

thereabouts  which  one perhaps  might  compare  with

Bombay Island in point of size and population, though

it  is a place of far greater strategic importance to

the free world than is apparent from its size.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that whereas India had considerable

experience  of  democratic rule  and  of  elected  or

partially  elected provincial and local  governments,

in   some  cases  going  back  decades  before  1946,

Singapore   has   had  little,  indeed  insufficient,

experience of this sort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, that whereas India had just emerged from

the  Second  World War in which its army  had  fought

victoriously  and with the greatest distinction,  and

in   which   it  had  been  geared  industrially   to

contribute immensely to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>

war  effort,  thereby having in  her  hands  adequate

strength  to  maintain internal security,  Singapore,

for various reasons, is by no means so fortunate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, fifthly - and this is a point of similarity as

much  as  of  difference - whereas  the  problems  of

communal bitterness and strife were, to some  extent,

solved  by the division of the country into Hindustan

and Pakistan, no such solution is possible in a multi-racial  Singapore  which, though relatively  peaceful today,  is nevertheless dominated in numbers  by  the Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> What is wrong with that?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I make these points for one single over-riding reason in order to make this plea - that we go

forward to implement this motion, represented  as  we

in  this  House are of all the major communities  and

voted  into  this House by all those communities,  in

all    humility,    conscious    of    the    immense

responsibilities  we  are asking  to  be  allowed  to

undertake  and  of  the  considerable  risks  we  are

facing.  It  is  an  old  truism  that  the  people's

character  is formed by the land and the  climate  in

which  it  lives.  This is true of  people  like  the

English,   who   are  what  they   are   from   their

geographical  position as islanders  and  from  their

rigorous  climate.  It is true  of  people  like  the

Indians;  but  it  is  not  true  of  the  people  of

Singapore who have still to assimilate this land  and

this  climate  and  to call it their  own;  in  other

words,  to call themselves Malayans. Therein lie  the

risks  and  the responsibilities. We are  seeking  to

govern,  by  ourselves,  a territory  for  which  the

people  as a whole have not yet and cannot  have  the

deepest  loyalties,  and  thus  a  territory   which,

because of its handy size, might so easily be  seized

by  a  dictator or by another form of colonial  rule.

Because  of  all these factors, which I have  stated,

the more thoughtful people on this island, on the one

hand,  deplore  the emotionalism and the  intemperate

language  which  has  been  recklessly  indulged  in

recent weeks, and, on the other hand, fear that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>



the  ceding  to Her Majesty's Government  of  control

over  external defence is insufficient  security  and

consider  that the problem of internal  security  has

not been squarely faced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say this about emotional and intemperate

language.  Anybody who read the Congress-owned  Delhi

newspaper, the Hindustan Times, during the war years,

would consider that some of the Members of this House

had  still  a  lot  to  learn regarding  the  art  of

vituperation,  but I do not say that in  exoneration.

In  a small almost parochial place like Singapore, we

cannot  afford inflammatory speeches.  If  you  shout

abuse  in  Bombay, by the time it gets to Nagpur,  it

sounds  a  little hollow, and in Calcutta,  it  seems

merely silly. What Manchester roars today will  sound

like  a still small voice in London tomorrow?  But  a

Marshall thunderbolt, dropped out of the apple  tree,

will reverberate round the island -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Even to Tanglin?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> - to be savoured in the clubs and in the

coffee-shops  till  it sounds more  heroic,  or  more

despicable  according  to one's  reactions,  than  it

really  is, and in a small island like Singapore,  it

encourages hatred and passion with no safety valves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of internal security, it should be

clear  from what I have said that much calm  thinking

is  needed. In this motion, we agree that we are  not

strong  enough  to defend ourselves against  external

aggression.  But  what about the  Trojan  Horse,  the

enemy  within our gates? Admittedly we are not strong

enough  to  defend our shores, but have we sufficient

resources  in time of riot and civil commotion,  such

as  we  have seen in 1950, in 1955, and been reminded

of  by the recent Kallang disturbance? At the moment,

we  must  be honest enough to face the fact  that  we

have  not got the strength, and it seems to  me  that

there  are only three ways of overcoming this problem

and of ensuring that the people of this land can go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



about  their  business knowing that their  lives  and

property will be fully protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first possibility is to strengthen and enlarge

the police force very considerably, making it more of

an armed force than it is at present, but recognising

that  control  of  the police must  remain  with  the

Council of Ministers, as it does now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that we raise and maintain our own

locally recruited defence forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is that we agree to safeguards whereby we

can call upon British or other Commonwealth forces in

the event of grave public disorder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first possibility - a more heavily armed police

force - I reject. In the hands of the wrong government,

the police force could become a weapon of oppression,

and  Singapore a police State. Even today the  police

are   being   subjected   to  undesirable   political

pressure.  That  does  not mean  that  I  am  against

strengthening  the police force on  the  lines  along

which  it  has  been developed. It is essential  that

everything  is  done  to build up  and  maintain  the

morale and esprit de corps of our police force at the

highest  levels. They must be incorruptible and  must

have  such  a  high reputation that  members  of  all

communities will be proud to be policemen. No  modern

state can survive without a police force of the  best

standards, but, nevertheless, we must stop  short  of

turning it into a military force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second - that of raising our own defence forces - is

the  ideal to aim at, but it is folly to suppose that

it  can  be done overnight or that the money  can  be

found  immediately to pay for it. The Hon. the  Chief

Minister has stated that the Government is attempting

to raise a Singapore battalion by April 1957. This is

as unrealistic as so many of the present Government's

pronouncements. A normal infantry battalion  consists

of  about  800  men,  of whom 600  bayonets  are  for

effective  strength and 200 to man and  maintain  the

vehicles to transport them and so on. In the event of

island-wide  disturbance, a  single  battalion  would

soon be swallowed up and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



lost. Experts naturally differ, but I think that  the

expert  opinion given to me, which states  that  five

battalions  would be needed as an adequate protective

force,   making  up  a  mixed  brigade  of  infantry,

armoured  cars, signals, engineers and so on,  should

be   heeded.  How  otherwise  would  the  island   be

adequately  protected  in an  emergency;  the  power-station  and the water supply maintained and  manned;

the  petrol supply to essential vehicles ensured; and

the  petrol  dumps  guarded  and  so  on?  I  am  not

exaggerating  when  I say that one  modern  battalion

costs  £1 million to equip, and five battalions  will

therefore  cost  us something like $50 millions - money

which we have not got, quite apart from the fact that

it will take a number of years to raise and train and

officer  this force of 4,000 men to the proper  pitch

of  efficiency. And if it will cost $50  millions  to

equip,  what  will it cost to maintain from  year  to

year?  This  therefore  has  to  be  rejected  as  an

immediate  solution, and indeed  the  Government  has

already  ruled it out by cutting down on  defence  in

the  1956  Estimates. The P.A.P. may pooh-pooh  these

details  as  alarmist  and bellicose,  but  the  hon.

Members  opposite know very well that  the  Communist

menace  is  such  that  we  must  be  strong  in  our

determination  to  defend  ourselves  and  have   the

weapons to do it with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, one turns to the third possibility,

negotiation   with   Her  Majesty's   Government   of

safeguards whereby we can call upon British or  other

Commonwealth  forces  in the event  of  grave  public

disorder.  That,  for the time  being,  is  the  only

solution  until we can build up our own resources  or

until   a  link  with  the  Federation  changes   the

perspective.    The   Liberal-Socialists    see    no

alternative to this as a practical solution and  will

in  no  circumstances  accept  anything  less.  If  a

Defence  Council,  consisting of Service  chiefs  and

others on the one hand and of the Chief Minister  and

one or two colleagues on the other, is acceptable  to

the  Federation, we see no reason why  it  cannot  be

acceptable   here  because,  for   one   thing,   the

Federation  and Singapore, let it not  be  forgotten,

are fighting the same enemy -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



Communism.  Let  us remember that Merdeka  means  not

only  freedom from British rule, it means freedom  to

rule  democratically.  It  also  means  freedom  from

intimidation and oppression, and the first freedom is

of no value whatever without the other freedoms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most difficult periods in a country's

history  is  when it emerges from being  ruled  by  a

foreign power and stirs itself to take over charge of

its  own  destiny.  Once that movement  has  gathered

momentum, let no one try to stand in its way, because

it cannot be withstood. And because it is a difficult

period,  when tempers can fly and hateful things  can

be  said, let us in this Assembly remember that if we

can keep cool heads and reasonable words, we shall be

setting an example which the country can follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the All-Party delegation success in its

mission  and  may  come  back  from  London  with  an

independent  status granted which is  worthy  of  the

desires  and the dignity of our people,  and  at  the

same  time  which, when granted, we can  protect  and

make flourish to the greater glory of this island and

to the admiration of the free world.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I confess that I am a little reluctant to make a

speech  on this motion, but having, as it were,  been

spotlighted  by  the  Chief  Minister  yesterday,   I

suppose  I  must  say something, if only  in  my  own

defence.  I must however take some comfort  from  the

fact  that  I  have over the past year acquired  some

promotion in this House, though not through intrinsic

merit. In one of the early debates in this House,  we

were  reminded by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr

Lee  Kuan Yew) that nominated Members spoke only  for

themselves.  So I represented nobody. Then  from  the

lips  of the Chief Minister I became the "Member  for

Tanglin  Club" - a  phoney  constituency - so  that,  I

suppose,  must  have  been  demotion.  However,   the

appellation   resulted  in  the  House   for   months

afterwards  being  treated to some fine  examples  of

what  Mr H. W. Fowler calls "worn-out humour". Then,

by inference,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



I   had  some  connection  with  the  notorious   and

peripatetic  Colonel Blimp! But now  I  find  myself,

according  to the Chief Minister, "the representative

of  British capital interests"! I did not know I  was

that. I wish there was a night school that I could go

to  learn  just  what  I am! But  certainly  that  is

better,  though quite honestly, Sir, I do  not  think

the  cap fits. It is true that in a speech I made  in

this  House on 22nd July, 1955, I said that I thought

I  might  claim  to speak for the British  expatriate

community, although I had no mandate from them to  do

so.  My  claim,  Sir, may have been unjustified,  and

therefore I should like clearly to state that on this

occasion  I  am  speaking merely  as  an  independent

Member of the House and I would ask the House not  to

regard me as the mouthpiece of any community.  If  my

views  happen to coincide with some of  those  of  my

compatriots, that is all to the good - or to  the  bad,

depending on how you look at it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, I find this motion quite

unexceptional, couched as it is in very  wide  terms,

and  I  was cheered, as I am sure many British people

who  read  it  must have been cheered,  to  read  the

reference to "close and friendly cooperation with the

United  Kingdom and the Commonwealth territories".  I

listened with very great interest indeed to the Chief

Minister's speech yesterday and again found myself at

one  with  him on a great many points. On  others,  I

would  differ but did not consider any useful purpose

would  be  served  by a non-Party Member  giving  his

views   on   such   matters  as  internal   security.

Nevertheless, I wish I were as certain as  the  Chief

Minister that  in  the  future  an  independent

Singapore  would have a viable economy. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I do not intend to offer outright opposition  to

this  motion, and accordingly I would like to explain

the  apparent inconsistency of having on  22nd  July,

1955, said No to a motion calling for immediate self-government  and my present attitude. I am  afraid  it

does  not  mean that I have been wholly converted  or

that my views have utterly changed.

In  a speech made by the Chief Minister in this House

on 9th February of this year, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have seen in a solemn moment the expression of

our   deepest  feelings,  a  single - Member  Party - Mr

Sutherland - standing up and saying that, on behalf  of

the  English  expatriate community, he  deplored  our

desire  for immediate self-government, and  he  voted

against it and is working against it."



<br><br>The  last  five  words  are  my  italics.  I  do  not

understand  what the Chief Minister meant  by  saying

that I was working against self-government, but I can

assure  him  that  outside of this House  I  have  no

connection  whatsoever  with politics.  I  have  been

lobbied  and attempts have been made to drag me  into

the  political net, but I have always turned  a  deaf

ear  to  those who importuned me. But let us  examine

the  words  of the Chief Minister - "the expression  of

our  deepest feelings" - in its relation to "our desire

for immediate self-government". It must be remembered

that  on 22nd July, 1955, there was no motion on  the

Order   Paper  for  immediate  self-government.   The

relevant motion referred to the determination of  the

people to end colonialism. It was the counter move of

the  then  Progressive  Party calling  for  immediate

independence,  which I thought very little  of  then,

and the passing months have not changed my views;  it

was  this  gambit that forced the Chief  Minister  to

move an amendment calling on Her Majesty's Government

for   the   transfer  of  power  for  self-government

immediately. Now be it noted that there  was  nothing

in  this amendment to define self-government as such.

In  my opinion, it was a trifle inchoate, yet because

I  did not say Aye to the motion, I came in for  some

contumelious  criticism from  all  Parties.  That,  I

suppose, is all part of the cut and thrust of  debate

and  I doubt if, at that time, many Asian Members  of

this   House   would   really   have   expected    me

pusillanimously to yield to the majority and vote for

a  motion that I obviously did not believe in at  the

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that the present is a far more solemn

moment  and  would  say that I am  not  incapable  of

understanding the aspirations of the locally born and

indeed in these matters my ap-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



proach, I think, is quite objective and I cannot, nor

indeed,  I am sure, would Members expect me  to  work

myself  up  into a passion over them.  Neither  do  I

wish,  through sheer recalcitrance like the  Russians

at  Lake  Success  or  Geneva, to  say  No  on  every

possible occasion. The record will, in point of fact,

show  that only on one occasion have I voted  against

the Government. No, Sir, if it is indeed the wish  of

the  people  of Singapore that they should  be  self-governing now, -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What do you think?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> - I am not going to attempt to put

my  little spoke in their wheel. After all,  in  free

countries,  people  usually get the  government  they

deserve. For my own part, I should have thought  that

for   sensible,  free  people - and  the  people   of

Singapore are free, in spite of those who talk  of  a

century of slavery - the question was not one of desire

for  self-government but fitness for self-government.

All  this talk about primordial urges and psychiatric

reasons  for rebellion - a favourite line of  the  hon.

and  learned Member for Tanjong Pagar - should  surely,

at  least  to some extent, be discounted? Surely  the

leaders of the people could persuade them to restrain

their  urges  for just a little longer. Last  July  a

government  which had been in office for only  a  few

months demanded immediate self-government. How  could

this have been the expression of the deepest feelings

of  the people? I do not know whether or no those who

then  demanded  immediate independence and  immediate

self-government  had a mandate from their  electorate

to  do so. I should have thought not, but I know that

another school of thought is of the opinion that  the

elected  Members of the people have carte blanche  to

act  as they please according to their views. Be that

as  it  may, was it so very unreasonable to challenge

their fitness to govern themselves when they had  had

little or no experience and had not been subjected to

any  corroding test? At that time a very considerable

measure  of self-government had already been  granted

and  had not been given a fair trial. Goaded  by  his

opponents, the Chief Minister took a line



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



which some people, including me, believed was not  in

the  best  interests of Singapore. Did not the  Chief

Minister very recently say that twelve months ago  he

and his Ministers knew nothing about self-government?

He  said  it at a time when he was praising  the  men

around  him. I submit, Sir, that if he did  not  know

anything about government twelve months ago, he could

not  have  known a great deal about it  eight  months

ago. I think I could guess fairly accurately when the

people  of  Singapore  first began  to  desire  self-government.  But when, I wonder, did they  "graduate"

to self-governing status? Was it in 1900, 1939, 1946,

or   was  it  just  last  year?  Is  there  a   faint

possibility  that the proponents of  immediate  self-government  could be wrong and that a further  period

of   tutelage   is  necessary?  Would   the   British

Government gain so very much were it to postpone  the

granting  of  self-government for a relatively  short

period?  Could  they not be acting in the  very  best

interests  of  the  people  and  not,  as  has   been

suggested, be making a last ditch stand in their  own

interests? Sir, the point may be academic  and  these

questions rhetorical, for if it is simply a  question

of  kicking  out the colonial power now,  the  people

will demand it, however complicated the issue may be,

involving as it does the future of this great trading

post  which  also happens to be a Gibraltar  for  the

defence  of  the free peoples of South-East  Asia.  I

have been reassured to hear the Chief Minister saying

on  a  recent occasion that he does not want to  kick

the  British  into  the sea. But what  of  his  Yanko

dancing  opponents of the future? He might find  that

he himself needed swimming lessons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read recently the following in the Chinese

Press, in translation, of course:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Britain should understand that since it is

impossible   to   restore  the  pre-war   system   of

colonialism,   she  might  as  well  generously   and

immediately  promise  the  people  of  this   country

independence.  Moreover,  our  claim  is   only   for

independence  in the first stage. In  effect,  it  is

only  complete internal self-government with external

defence and external relations still remaining in the

hands of Britain."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that perhaps for "promise" we should

read  "grant" for I can hardly believe that a promise

would  satisfy those who are crying for independence.

For  the  rest,  the writer need not  worry.  Britain

understands  the position very well The  problem,  of

course, is when, in the best interests of the people,

should the transfer of power be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am every bit as anti-Communist as the Chief

Minister,  and  I  can comprehend fully  what  he  is

driving  at in his argument that any putting  of  the

clock  back would be disastrous. I wish I  had  heard

all  that  the  seconder of the motion  said  in  his

speech  so  that I could correlate it  to  the  Chief

Minister's,  but  unfortunately  he  spoke  over  the

microphone most of the time and a great deal of  what

he  said was lost to me, in spite of my proximity.  I

know that another member of the P.A.P., according  to

the  vernacular  Press, said at a recent  rally  that

they should be friendly with the British. If that was

sincerely said, I am mighty glad to hear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that certain Chinese newspapers now

refer  to  the "colonialists" (and the term does  not

only   include  expatriates)  as  if  they   were   a

formidable  section  of  the  community  opposed   to

immediate self-rule. What do these colonialists feel?

I  do not know, Sir, precisely, but I do know that it

is  utter rubbish to talk about them as traitors. One

thing   emerges  quite  clearly  from   the   Merdeka

campaign,  and  that  is, that there  are  very  many

people in this island not in favour of immediate self-government. For all I know, the numbers may run  into

hundreds of thousands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what of the overseas British in Singapore?

Heaven forbid that I should speak for them again, but

this  is  the  position  as I  see  it.  The  British

community  here is not keen on the British Government

relinquishing its authority immediately, but it looks

as  if  they  must take a chance and do so.  A  point

frequently  forgotten  by the present  Government  is

that  the  local British community have, up  to  last

year,  been associated with every step towards  self-government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Oh, come, come!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> The overseas British here - I am not

speaking of the Government officials - are part of  the

whole  that  is Singapore. They have been here  since

the  time  of Raffles and have a local as well  as  a

national outlook. They have not in the past hesitated

to criticise the Colonial Office if it were sought to

introduce measures which might prove unpopular.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> To capital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Quite naturally, in view of the

events of the past year, some of them have doubts  as

to  the efficiency of self-government tomorrow, while

others are alarmed at the speed at which changes  are

taking  place.  Why? Because they are convinced  that

for  Singapore to maintain its position as a  trading

centre  second  to none in South-East Asia,  it  must

have security and stability. In that connection,  Mr

Speaker,  I am sure that all sections of the business

community  would  welcome  an  assurance   from   the

Government that, in not requiring guidance  from  the

United  Kingdom Government in matters  of  trade  and

commerce,  no thought has been taken of  leaving  the

Sterling area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar said yesterday that so

much had happened in the last year that he felt as if

decades,  instead of months, had passed, or words  to

that  effect. How true! The passing of time, however,

has not lessened his hostility to the colonial power,

but  the Chief Minister, I was glad to note, was much

more  moderate in his views. I did not feel quite  so

badly  as  I did on previous occasions when  I  found

myself  murmuring to myself - "Truly the  sins  of  the

fathers  are visited on the children unto  the  third

and  fourth generations" - and thank God I have not got

any!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Confession is good for the soul!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Sir, I am on record in the local

Hansard  as having said on several occasions  that  I

was  not  opposed to self-government when the country

was ready for it, and I can assure the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



Minister  that I associate myself with the  views  of

those business men who have written to him when  they

say,  "We will co-operate with the Government on  the

basis  of  whatever decision may be  reached  in  the

London talks." I will indeed, Sir, wholeheartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that I have neither the wit nor the

competence to deal adequately with all that was  said

in  the  two speeches yesterday; but in conclusion  I

would express my regret that I cannot say Aye to this

motion, involving, as it does, radical alterations to

the  constitution  under  which  I  was  appointed  a

nominated  Member  of  this Assembly,  and  I  think,

therefore, that the correct and proper course for  me

to take is to abstain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

the  one  responsible for starting the  Merdeka  bail

rolling in this House - a move or a gamble in which the

hon.  Mr Sutherland has not forgiven me and may  yet

cancel my overdraft at his bank, I and my Party  want

to  make it clear what we stand for. In the main,  we

agree  with  what the Chief Minister  said  yesterday

except  on  the  question of  internal  security.  We

particularly  agree  with  him  when  he  said   that

provision  must  be made to look after  the  minority

interests. Indeed, it is the duty of every government

and   every  political  Party  to  look  after  small

sections  of  the  people who may not  have  adequate

representation in this House. We are glad also to see

the  stand  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar  when  he

seconded the motion. He made it quite clear  that  he

was  doing  so not because of choice, but because  it

could  be used for something else - as a stepping - stone

to  something  bigger and better.  We  know  what  he

stands for and what he wants. His aim now is to  down

British  colonialism. When that  bogey  is  finished,

another  one will be created, and so on,  until  this

form  of  government will be changed by  another  so-called  democratic government of  his,  which,  I  am

quite sure, is unknown in the free world today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise that you can put back the hands of a

clock, but you cannot put back the march of time. The

pace has been set for colonies in Asia and Africa  to

be  independent, and we have to follow; and the  pace

has been quickened by the very successful mission  of

the Federation to London a few months ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily for us we do not have to fight, nor indeed,

threaten  or  shout for independence.  We  have  been

invited by the Government of the United Kingdom to  a

conference this month to discuss in a friendly manner

our request to be master of our own fate in the light

of a year's working of the present constitution. This

invitation we have accepted, and it is for us now  to

examine our assets and liabilities accrued during the

year. Frankly, I must admit the balance sheet is  not

a  very  encouraging one. We have passed  legislation

for improving the working conditions of a section  of

the people, but on the other hand, we have had nearly

300 strikes, one riot, one near riot, and an increase

in  crime,  particularly that organised by gangsters,

such as extortion and kidnapping.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is your worry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Well, they came from your area!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And they are directed at the

Progressives!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> The tempo of public business, due

to  uncertainty  in the future of this  service,  has

slowed  down considerably. There has been no increase

in  the  number  of  factories, but  unemployment  is

increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened at the Kallang Rally on Sunday, 18th

March,  has  caused great concern, not  only  in  the

minds of people like ourselves in this Assembly,  but

also  of  the  small people who frequent the  coffee-shops  and  hawkers' stalls-except, of course,  those

who shout Merdeka with clenched fists and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



turned  the  rally into a riot, the only  provocation

being,  from  what I could see, a few  songs,  a  few

dances, and a few drops of rain. If such disorder can

happen  when  the  Party  concerned  had  a  hand  in

organising  the rally and the leaders did  try  their

best  to quieten the crowd, what could not happen  at

uncontrolled gatherings? The Chief Minister has tried

to make this incident a minor one. It was a minor one

only  because of the magnificent manner in which  the

police handled the situation - with firmness and  with

restraint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is talk in the coffee-shops that, under such

circumstances,  only  hooligans and  gangsters  would

benefit  from Merdeka - a Merdeka conceived in  hatred,

bred  in  strikes, and ruled by mobs  and  gangsters.

Many  people have expressed the same opinion  in  the

Press. They are beginning to realise that the cost of

independence  is  a heavy one, and  independence  for

Singapore,  a trading centre producing only  a  small

percentage  of our daily food and daily requirements,

will be an illusory one without absolute security. We

live  by trade and trade can be diverted without  the

slightest  difficulty.  Without  security,  we  shall

never  get the capital to finance our new industries.

Indeed, many industrial firms are marking time  until

the political atmosphere is cleared and some are even

considering closing down. Without trade and industry,

we shall have poverty, misery and chaos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this, I have not changed my mind, but I

maintain  that we can only have Merdeka with  certain

safeguards   until  such  time  as  we  have   gained

sufficient   strength  to  guard  not  only   against

external forces, but against subversion and threat to

our internal security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the motion before the House today, we are

offering,  by  agreement,  to  entrust  our  external

defence to the United Kingdom. When we ask the United

Kingdom to look after our external defence, I do  not

see  how we can possibly say that she can have no say

in  our  internal  defence. What is there  to  defend

against  externally when there is nothing  to  defend

internally?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not agree with the Chief Minister when he said

that  it  would  be  a mockery  if  we  were  to  get

independence but did not get exclusive control of our

internal  security. For today internal  and  external

security is inextricably bound together. There is  no

clear   demarcation  between  external  and  internal

defence  when the threat to our system of  democratic

government  is by subversion, like white ants  eating

into  the very foundation of a structure and you  can

only  find out when it has collapsed - like that  which

happened  on that memorable Sunday when the  platform

collapsed  under the very feet of the Chief  Minister

and the crowd got out of control and over-ran it.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He survived it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> We must approach the Merdeka

conference  with soberness and without bitterness  in

our  hearts, and with only one objective in  view - the

welfare of our beloved Singapore. We are but a  small

country in this world, which is growing smaller every

day  because  of  rapid  means of  communication.  No

nation today can truly say that it can be independent

of others and stand by itself, for even great nations

have entered into alliances and pacts and allowed the

use  of  naval and air bases in their territories  by

their  allies  in  times of war and  peace.  If  this

happened two or three decades ago, such nations would

be  called  vassal  states. If it is  true  of  great

nations,  it  must apply with much more  force  to  a

small  one like ours. With whom, then, shall we stand

when  we  get  our independence? Naturally  with  the

country   which,   in   spite   of   accusations   of

exploitation   and  colonialism,  has  been   largely

responsible  for the Singapore as we know  her  today

and  who is prepared to offer us a partnership in the

Commonwealth of Nations if we are able to look  after

ourselves. The Liberal-Socialists are confident that,

with a proper approach and in a spirit of good faith,

reasonableness and trust, we shall achieve Merdeka, a

Merdeka  in  which  we can all live  happily  and  in

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to  support the motion before this Assembly.

This  motion requires no clarification and should  be

understood by all Parties concerned. We want  Merdeka

and  we are fit for it. But, Sir, I wonder if  I  may

touch upon an aspect of this motion which has brought

about  some misgivings amongst some sections  of  the

community. I refer, Sir, to the unbecoming activities

of  a  small  group  of people who have,  during  the

course of the last few days, attempted to bring about

discord  amongst  the people of  Singapore  over  the

question  of  Merdeka. As one of the leaders  of  the

Malay community and head of the United Malay National

Organisation in Singapore, I and my Party would  like

to   dissociate   ourselves  completely   from   this

disgusting  and retrogressive movement.  Fortunately,

Sir,  those  who are at the head of this anti-Merdeka

movement do not command the following -



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Point of order, Sir. The Minister is reading his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I have not quite noticed

that  the  Minister is reading. He has probably  been

referring to his notes a little too frequently.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Fortunately, Sir, those men do

not receive the support of the majority of the people

of  Singapore,  as  some quarters would  have  it.  I

would,  however,  like to thank the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  for  having  brought  up  the  question  of

minorities   with  regard  to  the  constitution.   I

believe,  Sir,  this  is a very  wise  move,  as,  in

drawing  up constitutions, it is absolutely necessary

for  safeguards to be embodied in them; more so  when

we  realise that the minority, to which I belong,  in

Singapore are the indigenous people of this region.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



The   Malays,  Sir,  are  not  only  a  minority   in

Singapore,  but  they are also the indigenous  people

and  they  are also an economic class by  themselves.

There is very little difference between the Malays in

Singapore and the Malays in Malacca and Penang. Their

economic position, their cultural position and  their

political  position are about the same,  that  is  to

say,  they  are  the most backward when  compared  to

other  races  living in these three territories,  and

yet  these are the very three territories which first

had contact with Western civilisation. I must say  it

is  not a credit to the colonial powers who have been

running these territories for the last few centuries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one other aspect in the Chief

Minister's   speech   which   should   require   some

consideration,   and   that  is   the   question   of

citizenship.  This, Sir, is a very delicate  problem,

but, given goodwill on all sides, I do not see why we

should not solve this problem in the interests of the

people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, the people of Singapore call for Merdeka.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> How about Seletar?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> The motion submitted to this Assembly by

the  Chief  Minister is the most innovatory  of  all.

Here  is  a  challenge through which  the  people  of

Singapore express their wishes and aspirations to the

Government of the United Kingdom and the world. There

is no longer any suspicion in the minds of everybody,

either  in Singapore or outside, that the people  and

its elected representatives have any doubts that they

are  ready for independence. What remains to be  seen

now  is the sincerity of the British people and their

Government in implementing their oft-repeated promise

of independence to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, Sir, had its first election to the

Legislative  Council  in  1948.  In  1951  there  was

another  election  to the Legislative  Council,  this

time with an increased number of elected Members.  In

1955 a general election took place as a result of the

Rendel Constitution Commission, on the recommendation

of which this Assembly has been constituted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of local government also, Singapore had

its first election to the City Council in 1948. Since

then there have been elections every year and it  has

been  proved  beyond  all  doubt  that  there  is   a

responsible local government in Singapore today.  The

future  of  lo, cal government in Singapore  is  very

bright. We all know that the Government is likely  to

accept  the  Report  of  the McNeice  Commission  and

therein lies the essence of democracy in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Rendel Constitution was accepted by the

people of Singapore under protest in the hope that at

the  earliest date it would be modified. The time has

now   come   for   a  constitution  focused   towards

independence. Apart from a desire for a  constitution

focused  towards independence, we have a moral  claim

to  it,  because, with the attainment of independence

in  the Federation, we are left as the only non-self-governing territory in Asia. This situation is not in

the  mutual interests of Britain and Singapore. There

is   a  strong  feeling  among  the  people  of   the

Commonwealth  countries  that  Singapore  should   be

granted  independence, especially so in the interests

of  world  peace and security. The potentialities  of

easing world tension and the prospects of stabilising

world peace are greater if Singapore -

because  of  this that hon. Members  have  been  very

Perhaps  they can try not to refer to their notes  so

frequently.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I have said that if Singapore attains

self-government and is allowed to govern herself, the

prospects  of world peace and security will increase;

and  this  is  particularly so if she  is  given  the

opportunity  of  being an equal  partner  within  the

British Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much discussion in regard to the

internal  security and defence of Singapore.  We  are

aware,  Sir, that in freeing ourselves from  colonial

rule  our  people  have greater responsibilities  and

more  important  duties. I have  no  doubt  that  the

people of Singapore will sustain themselves in  their

new  role. The independence formula suggested by  the

Chief  Minister  has  placed  upon  the  people   the

responsibility of maintaining internal  security  and

internal defence. Sir, this is not a problem peculiar

to Singapore. It is probably a problem that faces any

country  attaining  self-government.  There  may   be

elements  now  who appear to jeopardise the  internal

security of the country, but with the achievement  of

independence  and  the control of  internal  security

changing hands to a government of the people  by  the

people and responsible to the people, the problem  of

internal  security should not be detrimental  to  the

interests  of  the people. On the contrary,  all  the

antagonism now existing towards the police force will

vanish  when  once the control of the  police  passes

into  the  hands of an elected Minister.  The  police

will  then  be  regarded  as closer  friends  of  the

people. One might think that I am very optimistic  in

making  this statement, Sir, but I am guided  by  the

history   of   other  nations  which  have   attained

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of our defence has been dealt with by

the  Chief  Minister.  It can  be  hoped  that  added

responsibility   vested  with  a  popularly   elected

government  will  pave the way for a  strong  defence

force  in  Singapore. Until such time as  we  have  a

Singapore army, I believe our soul force should serve

against  any internal disorder. We Asians  believe  a

great deal in the soul force and non-violence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true also, Sir, that in some quarters fears

have  been  expressed as regards the  future  of  the

minority  communities. These may be just  or  may  be

unjust.  We  have in Singapore today a population  of

which approximately 85 per cent is Chinese. It may be

impossible for any other community to outbid them  in

number.  In a democracy the majority shall rule,  but

it  should  have  due  regard to  the  interests  and

welfare of the minorities. The Chinese, as I see  it,

can  make  or mar the future history of this country,

but  in  all  sincerity I believe that wise  counsels

will  prevail in the body politic of this country  in

the interests of all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about our being an equal

partner within the British Commonwealth. As I see it,

Sir,  with the achievement of independence,  being  a

member  of  the  British Commonwealth  has  an  added

advantage  to Singapore. Speakers suggested yesterday

that  countries like India, Ceylon and  Pakistan  had

chosen  to  become equal partners within the  British

Commonwealth. When I was in Australia last  December,

Sir,  many  people told me this - that  the  people  of

Australia  desired Singapore to attain  independence.

What next? They felt that in justice and fairness  to

the British Government, Singapore should remain as an

equal partner within the British Commonwealth. It may

be  desirable, at the outset, to be an equal  partner

within   the   British   Commonwealth   because   our

neighbours  like  India, Pakistan, Ceylon,  Australia

and  New  Zealand  are  all members  of  the  British

Commonwealth.  We will not lose anything  at  all  by

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while associating myself with all the

sentiments  expressed by the Chief Minister,  I  wish

the  Merdeka mission which is leaving for London will

come  back  with a victorious decision which  can  be

hailed by the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like, if

I  can, to focus attention on what seem to me some of

the true objectives of Merdeka. Merdeka in itself  is

only  the opening of a door through which we can pass

into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



the  unknown, and it is important, I think,  that  we

should  realise this and look beyond  the  door  even

before  we  pass through it. We have in  this  debate

concentrated considerably on the dangers of  Merdeka.

One  of  the dangers particularly mentioned has  been

Communism.  I  have  spoken my mind  about  Communism

before  in this Assembly and I should like to  expand

my attitude towards it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am anti-Communist. I do not like Communism, but I

do   not  think  that  in  itself,  as  a  system  of

philosophic  theory  or  as  a  system  of   economic

practice, it has today any commanding attraction  for

people.  It has the attraction of great achievements.

The  investment programme under Communism  in  Russia

has   been   enormous  and  the  rate   of   economic

development has been tremendous. The result  is  that

people  see something there which they would like  to

emulate,  but that is simply a question of technique,

a  question  of  deliberate  political  practice  and

economic  practice.  It  is  not  a  matter  of   the

essential theory of Communism. Although Communism has

made  considerable contributions to  human  progress,

both  by  its  achievements and by  its  follies  and

errors, it is today an out-of-date system. It can  be

compared  to  the industrial revolution in  Victorian

England. It carries a great burden of accumulation of

past  practice which it finds it difficult to disown.

It  is doing its best at present to get away from its

own  past and to compete with the Colombo Plan  which

is  a very laudable objective perhaps; but I think it

rather diminishes the sense of menace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what is menacing in Singapore are the general

historical  facts.  We  have a  great  port  and  any

reading  of history will show that a great  port  and

trading  centre  is  the place where  new  ideas  are

continually  coming in, where there  is  a  continual

intellectual  ferment, and where  people  can  fairly

rapidly  change their ideas and their  attitudes.  We

have also in Singapore an enormous percentage of very

youthful  people, and we are also living in times  of

very  rapid change. Any study of sociology will  make

it   clear  that  in  these  circumstances  you   can

reasonably expect to have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



situation which could explode if a match were  to  be

applied in the right place. No doubt Communism is one

of  the  numerous matches which could be applied  and

which could cause an explosion in Singapore. That  is

the menace of Communism. It is not in itself, but  in

the  fact that it might precipitate trouble which  is

there potentially anyhow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I could illustrate some of the dangers from

the  speeches made yesterday in this House by a  very

able  and distinguished Member - the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew). I am rather happy that  he

is  not in the House - his enthusiasm for Merdeka  does

not  extend  to listening to speeches on  Merdeka  by

other  Members  - because I am afraid that if  he  heard

what  I  have to say, it might hurt his feelings.  It

might  be a good thing for him, but I do not like  to

hurt  people's feelings, although I am convinced that

what  I  have  to  say is useful and  deserves  wider

attention. I would not waste my time, Mr Speaker, or

your time, on the Member for Tanjong Pagar if he  was

just  an  isolated  individual; but  he  is  not.  He

typifies, to my mind, very much of what is  best  and

also  what  is  most explosive in Singapore.  He  has

obviously great potentialities for good, but he could

also bring disaster.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He needs principles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I listened yesterday to two very lengthy

speeches  by the Member for Tanjong Pagar. I listened

with  admiration for his ability but with a continual

sense of frustration and regret for the fact that his

whole approach to the problem was so very trivial and

superficial.  I  would  like  to  deal   with   three

particular  aspects that struck me as I  listened  to

him - three things that were outstanding in what he had

to  say and which seemed to me to be typical of quite

a   large  section  of  the  younger  generation   in

Singapore  - and the younger generation is liable to  be

the  master generation and therefore they do  deserve

our attention when we are dealing with Merdeka.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing about him was his excessive timidity

with regard to his Merdeka colleagues. He reminded me

of a young girl attending her first dance and looking

nervously   around  and  blushing  because   she   is

convinced that every man who comes near her is  going

to  make improper advances! He seemed to fear that if

he  once let himself get into the virile embraces  of

the   Labour  Front  he  would  lose  his   political

virginity and perhaps be cast out from the  bosom  of

his happy family. That sort of distrust and suspicion

and nervousness is terribly infectious. When a man of

standing  and repute and powers of leadership  allows

himself  that feeling that he cannot safely  put  his

hand out just for a while to co-operate; that he  has

got  to hedge and qualify it and give notice that  it

is  only  a very temporary measure; it does  tend  to

build up a feeling of emotional insecurity, and  that

is a real danger in Singapore today and I shall refer

to it again later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a certain timidity in his approach to his

Merdeka  colleagues, it seemed to me also that  there

was  a  serious  timidity in  his  general  political

thought.  He  struck out - I have never yet  heard  him

strike  out  anything at all which is new.  He  looks

always backwards and not forwards. I am not referring

to  his  summaries  of  world  history  in  which  he

indulged  yesterday and which, to my mind, were  very

superficial and very inaccurate. He quite  failed  to

see  the true course of progress, the changing forces

in  the  British  Empire which dated  from  the  last

century - a   century  when  the  investment  programme

decreased - and not from the Second World War. I am not

referring to his historical outlook but to  the  sort

of things that he wishes to put before the public. He

gave  us  yesterday what I presume was an intentional

preview  of the two main vote-winning planks  of  his

Party's  next  electoral  programme -  and  they  were

Merdeka  and  Malayanisation.  Those  are  no  longer

aspirations  of the future. They are  here  and  now.

They are in our hands. They are practical jobs to  be

done  in a businesslike way and I have no doubt  that

they will be done in a businesslike way, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



we can start to look much further ahead than that.  I

remember once in 1942 seeing a Japanese soldier  with

his  rifle  and a bayonet at the end of  it;  he  was

dancing  around  and threatening an unarmed  prisoner

who had already surrendered. This little Japanese, I

am  sure, was not driven by any malicious or sadistic

impulse.  He  just  quite failed  to  adjust  to  the

changed  situation. He could not  think  of  anything

else to do. He saw before him a man who had been  his

enemy  and  so he kept bouncing about him and  waving

his  bayonet under the impression that he  was  still

engaged  in a fight. I am afraid that the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar has tended to proceed rather on  those

lines  too. He barks like a puppy at the heels  of  a

departing colonialism instead of standing up  like  a

man to face his problems which will come with the end

of  colonialism. You can win elections perhaps on  an

out-of-date political platform, but you cannot  serve

the  needs  of the people. You cannot build  for  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third significant thing which we heard yesterday

from  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar's  very  forceful

rhetoric   was  something  to  this  effect, - he   was

speaking about power - I think I have got roughly  what

he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power is not a thing to be bargained for or

accepted, but a thing to be fought for and seized!"



<br><br>All  right, it is a point of view if you like it, and

if you like fighting better than amicable discussion;

but  whether it is a right or a wrong point of  view,

it  is certainly an incomplete point of view, because

power  is  not a prize to be won, it is an instrument

to be used. It is not an end in itself, it is a means

of  service.  You  can  use  power  like  you  use  a

badminton racket - to have a pleasurable and, no doubt,

healthy  (in  its  way) display of your  skill,  your

athletic  prowess,  in  batting  the  shuttle   quite

fruitlessly  through the air; or you  can  use  power

like a changkol, getting down to earth patiently  and

humbly  and  seriously and steadily cultivating  good

seed   and   eradicating  the  weeds.  Anybody,   any

political Party, any politician who is seeking  power

in  Singapore must see it as a changkol and not as  a

badminton



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



racket,  because  on  the use of  power  when  it  is

obtained will depend the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Pick and shovel!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is purely coincidental, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  our Party badge is called a changkol.  It

had  not  occurred to me until this moment.  Now  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar has never yet given, by what

I  can recollect, any sign at all of having seriously

thought about the use of power when he has got it, or

about the use of Merdeka when Singapore, please  God,

has  got that. Occasionally he has offered us various

apparently  off-the-cuff suggestions  and  they  were

highly  unsatisfactory suggestions. I recollect  once

he  interjected into a debate saying that if  he  got

into  power he would dismiss the Judges and  get  new

ones. I am sure he was speaking thoughtlessly. He did

not  mean  anything. He was just saying something  in

order  to  interrupt  and it  was  not  to  be  taken

seriously. But it is irresponsible for a man  of  his

importance to throw out that sort of comment, that he

would dismiss the Judges - just like that! It is not  a

thing that any leading politician should say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in a prepared speech at one time he tried to

deal  with  the proper defence policy for  Singapore,

and his policy, in summary, was that "we should spend

every  cent  we have got and we should  mortgage  the

future up to the hilt." I commented on it at the time

and  said that it was an extraordinarily silly  thing

to   say - if  that  is  Parliamentary  language,  Mr

Speaker!  I am sure again he did not really mean  it.

He  had not thought about it. He was just striking an

attitude,  saying  something that  was  superficially

effective, but it was said before a crowded  gallery.

It was said in the presence of the representatives of

the  world  Press and he apparently was quite  casual

and  quite careless as to the effect which  it  might

have  on  the good repute and stability of Singapore.

He  did not seem to be concerned with anything beyond

making what was in its way a forceful statement,  but

clearly  one which, if anyone attempted to  carry  it

out, or if anyone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



thought he could carry it out, would be most damaging

to  the future of this territory. I have enlarged  on

this  because, Mr Speaker, failure to  envisage  the

use  of power before you have got it can be extremely

dangerous.  Singapore  cannot  assume  power,  assume

control  of  its  own  affairs,  and  assume  Merdeka

lightly and irresponsibly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have spent so much time on these aspects

of  the Member for Tanjong Pagar if timidity, a  lack

of  forethought  and  a lack of a  serious  long-term

purpose  were  peculiar to himself; but unfortunately

these  are  faults into which all human  beings,  and

especially  all politicians, can too easily  fall  or

too  easily  be  led.  They are  thoughts  which  are

dangerous   at  any  time  anywhere  and   they   are

particularly dangerous in Singapore today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already referred to the difficulties and the

dangers. I should like to say and to stress  that  it

rests  with  us - those who are now present  in  this

Assembly  and  those who have left it  for  the  time

being - whether  we turn our difficulties  and  dangers

into  opportunities and achievements. We can  do  it,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. I have no doubt at all that we can

overcome  the  difficulties, and in the  difficulties

there  is  the  potentiality of great prosperity  and

great happiness; but we shall not do it easily and we

shall  not  do it unless we set ourselves  to  purify

ourselves  from  our weaknesses and our  defects.  We

have  got  to  hold with courage to a  wise  national

purpose. We can achieve nothing if we allow ourselves

to  be  dominated by a senseless fear of  our  fellow

Singaporeans. Nor can we achieve anything if  we  are

dominated  by  the equally senseless consequences  of

senseless fear, and that is the vain conceit that our

own person, our own Party, our own community or class

contains in itself all that is wise and all  that  is

trustworthy and all that is worth while.  It  is  not

so.  I  disagree  with  many  people,  but  I  always

recognise in them that they have some good intentions

and  that  they  have some wisdom; and  we  must  all

recognise  that.  No doubt we shall often  profoundly

disagree. We shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



criticise each other. We shall attack each other, and

it  is  right that that should happen because  it  is

part  of  the natural basis of democracy. But beneath

all  that  criticism and attack on the  Party  system

there  does  lie an absolutely fundamental  sense  of

national brotherhood, a sense of mutual trust in each

other's good intentions. We have got to hold fast  to

the faith that our political opponents are trying  to

do  what  is  right, even when we are  convinced,  in

fact, that they are doing what is wrong. We have  got

to  accept that, at bottom, they too are seeking  the

welfare  of  Singapore, and not its destruction.  Any

politician  or  Party  or community  which  tries  to

separate   itself   from  the   sense   of   national

brotherhood and to retire into suspicion and distrust

and  self-conceit  is  blind  to  the  challenge   of

Merdeka.  Besides  its essential  basis  of  national

unity  and  good faith, we have got, as I  have  said

before,  to look most seriously and most purposefully

to  the future. We do want to stop nagging about  the

past. Only harm can come from people who would go  on

rubbing  at  old sores, weeping over old wounds,  and

grumbling about what happened to their grandfather in

1900  or their father in 1930, or about the promotion

they  did not get in 1948, or the opportunities  that

were  denied  them in 1954. Those are  past.  Whether

they  are  bad or good, never mind, because they  are

past,  and we do need to look to the future. To carry

a  bagful of bitter memories in our hands is  a  poor

way to approach the glorious dawn of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Assembly with all its defects

and  its  weaknesses  yet has  the  duty  of  guiding

Singapore at a most critical and important time,  and

that is a thought that should make us all humble.  On

our wisdom and our good purposes depend the lives and

happiness  of more than a million souls,  and  depend

also  many  more unborn whose future and  whose  fate

will  be  decided by what we do. In the past  I  have

worked and now I give my voice in support of Merdeka,

because   I   believe   that  Singapore   needs   the

opportunity to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



carry the burden of its own responsibility. Our  city

at   present  struggles  under  a  great  weight  of

poverty,  waste,  muddle,  inefficiency,  corruption,

sickness  and  suffering. These are all natural  ills

which  are  accumulated in all  human  societies  and

under which human societies collapse unless they  can

make  a  new  start  and  shake  off  the  ills   and

reconstruct themselves. That is a task that calls for

courage and wisdom. Merdeka to me is the opening of a

new  era  and a new life. In freedom we can face  the

efforts of reconstructing our society. We can  endure

the  sacrifices which will undoubtedly be called  for

if  we are to provide properly for the future. We can

make our city clean and healthy and happy, and we can

stand  straight in the glorious sunlight and  breathe

deeply  the sweet air of freedom. It is with profound

hope, Mr Speaker, and with profound humility that we

should all give our voices in support of our Merdeka mission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise to speak in support of the motion. Since  all

men  are  born  equal, it is not  proper  nor  is  it

tolerable for anyone or any nation to hold sway  over

another.  Independence  is  our  birthright,  and  in

demanding  the right for self-determination,  we  ask

for nothing more or less than what was agreed upon by

the  leaders of the two great democracies - Britain and

America.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonialism is dead and has no place under present-day conditions. It is no use kicking a dead horse.

But  I  share the concern expressed yesterday by  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar that the  consequences  of

failure  to  obtain independence by the  date  agreed

upon will be dreadful to contemplate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opponents of Merdeka were not slow to make capital

out  of the disturbances at Kallang and to point  out

that  Singapore is not yet ready to govern itself.  I

say  that  an  impartial analysis of the  causes  and

effect  of  the disturbances will prove that  it  had

nothing to do with the desire for Merdeka. I am aware

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



of  the  feeble  attempts  made  by  the  stooges  of

colonialism to discredit the desire of the people for

independence.  But to that I say, let the  spirit  of

Merdeka never be modified nor subjugated. It  is  our

firm desire that we should be able to choose our  own

form  of  government and to take our  rightful  place

among the free nations of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who claim that we are anti-British, the

answer  can be found in the second part of the motion

where we seek to affirm our faith in Britain and  our

desire to remain a member of the British Commonwealth

of  Nations after gaining independence. I may venture

to  say  that  we are not ungrateful to  Britain  for

raising  Singapore to its present state of prosperity

and commercial importance, and there is no reason why

our  friendship towards Britain should  not  continue

after  Singapore has attained its status  as  a  free

nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Singapore has expressed on many occasions the  desire

to  have  independence. Indeed I view the problem  in

this light - all men are born free. This principle  has

been  recognised by every free nation in  the  world,

and  even by other nations which may not have such  a

concept. If that is a principle that is recognised by

all, then indeed we need not fight for it. It is  our

birthright.  It is right that we should  receive  it.

There  is no one in this world who should say to  us,

"You are not free. You are not fit." But it is up  to

us  to pronounce our own judgment. Today Singapore is

under the control of Britain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of the problem like this. The freedom that

is  the right of this country is only kept in custody

by  Britain. I compare it with a bank. I  compare  it

with  an  inheritance that was  left  to  us  by  our

forefathers  in  the bank. The bank acts  only  as  a

trustee, and as soon as the child is of age, as  soon

as  he is able to take over his own affairs, then  he

has  every right to ask the bank to give him that sum

of  money.  But whether he should want  to  have  the

whole sum, or half the sum, or part of the sum,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



the  decision should come from him alone. However,  I

do  not deny that such trustees have a great deal  of

experience. They have some wisdom and they can advise

the person who is going to draw out the money. On the

other hand, if you are to draw out that money and  it

is  going to be given away to you on demand,  because

it  is  your right, then we should exercise  caution.

We,  or the person who is drawing out the money, when

we take that money out of the bank, should be certain

that  there  are no highway robbers or  somebody  who

might  stick  us  up and rob us of  that  money.  The

freedom  that is ours, the freedom that we are  going

to  get, the freedom I know that must be given to  us

must be safeguarded. It is no use -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I will come to that. It is no use -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He is a schoolmaster!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - going all out to ask for

freedom  only  to lose it the next day.  You  may  be

impatient to know what is in my mind but I hope -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My God!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - after one whole day of talk

about  Merdeka,  you  will have  a  little  bit  more

patience.  If  you are impatient, you have  lost  one

good  quality.  In Singapore there are  a  number  of

people  who are afraid of freedom. I would  say  that

they are afraid of it not because they do not want

it.  They  are afraid that when Merdeka  comes  along

they  will lose their job; there will be no security;

business  might be bad, and so on and so  forth.  But

may  I give an assurance to people who think in  this

trend  that if we have independence and it is in  the

hands  of  a democratic government strong  enough  to

look after the interests of all, strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



enough  to have security, then there is no chance  of

these  people  losing their jobs, or  their  business

suffering: and if we can give such guarantees to  the

people of this island who cry out for no independence

now, then I think we will win them over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section of the people who are afraid of

Merdeka are the minorities. They are afraid that they

will  be  swamped when independence comes. Of course,

if  we  happen to be amongst the majority races  like

myself,  we may not, generally speaking, be  able  to

see their point of view, but I do see that clearly. I

have this to say. At the present moment, when we  are

still  not  independent, have we got  safeguards  for

these minorities? Are they contented? If we have  our

independence, what safeguards do we want for them?  I

believe  that every single person who claims  loyalty

to this land must have equal rights with anybody else

and  he must also have equal responsibility. I do not

believe that since they are the minority groups  they

must  be  placed on a pedestal and be  given  special

privileges.  I  believe that if we continue  in  this

trend of racial harmony - and it has been the case with

Singapore for a very long time - we will have  no  such

fears.  Today  we have the majority as  well  as  the

minority  races in Singapore. The elections conducted

last  year  brought  in  the elected  representatives

sitting in this House now. It shows that Singapore is

not racial-minded. The people chose the best men. The

minorities should not therefore be afraid of Merdeka.

However,  I would like to assure the minority  groups

that   our  Party - the  Liberal-Socialists - will  guard

their  interests  too, and prevent  any  law  enacted

which is especially disadvantageous to them. We  will

see  that  they  are placed on a par  with  everybody

else,  on a par with regard to privileges as well  as

responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the whole of last year and this year, we

have  heard many shouts of Merdeka. We have  gone  to

many  election  rallies. We have gone to  many  other

rallies   after  that,  and  we  have  heard   people

explaining to the crowds as to what Merdeka means. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



am  a little disturbed by the meaning or Merdeka that

has  been given to quite a section of the people.  It

has  been said by some leaders shouting Merdeka  that

as  soon  as  Singapore  gets its  independence,  the

hawkers  will be able to sell right in the centre  of

the  road;  the police will not be allowed to  arrest

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What leaders? The Progressives?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We have heard another section

telling the crowd, "Look at the C.I.D. there. Why are

the people inside there locked up? When Merdeka comes

along, the police will have no right to arrest  them.

They  will all be out!" We have also heard that  many

other things will happen. We can do whatever we  like

when  we  have  Merdeka. To the  business  people  an

assurance has been given that taxes will be reduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not by the Labour Front.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, not by the Labour Front,

but  the  news has been circulating. I mix  with  the

people. I know them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You sit in coffee-shops all the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar

knows  only  one section of the people,  and  I  know

their views. They are not too good views. But I would

like  the  people to know that when freedom comes  to

Singapore,  law  and  order will  still  have  to  be

maintained;  the police will still have to  do  their

work;  taxation  will still have to go  on,  and,  in

effect, -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - and, in effect, we might be

faced  with heavier taxation to run the country,  but

we have to weigh -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the hon. Member given way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> No. But we have to weigh the

pros  and  cons of it. It is worth while to have  all

these  extra  responsibilities, more  taxation,  more

work, and even perhaps we have to sacrifice our lives

to  defend this country? Weighed against freedom,  is

it worth while? I say it is worth while!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Hurrah!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am here to correct the views

that   have   been  passed  on  to  the   people   of

Singapore - not  anything else.  Those  have  been  the

wrong  views. If we had given them the correct views,

probably  we  might  have been  spared  that  Kallang

incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Merdeka comes to Singapore, we can have many

types  of  government under the name of democracy.  I

witnessed  one  form of democracy that was  practised

during  the occupation of Singapore. They  called  it

the "Co-prosperity Sphere".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> "Spear".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> During that time we had no

riots.  We  had no disorders. The country was  indeed

very  peaceful. Thefts and robberies were few.  Today

we  have a bit of rioting and quite a number of  acts

of  thuggery. But during the time of the  occupation,

the  police were strong and it was difficult for  one

to  express  one's opinions openly in the public.  We

were  living  in a police state. Under democracy,  if

there  is meddling with the police, if the police  is

subjected  to  the whims and fancies  of  the  ruling

Party, we will come to that state; and if we come  to

that  state,  we will lose what we are  fighting  for

today. Everyone of us will lose our personal freedom,

the freedom of the individual. We want safeguards  on

that.  We  want to see that we have Merdeka  and  yet

every  person in Singapore must be allowed freely  to

express  his  views without fear. The Press  must  be

given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



the freedom to criticise the views of all leaders, as

it is doing today. That freedom must be retained, and

the  individual  must be given every opportunity  and

every chance to know that if he acts within the  law,

he  is  not afraid of anybody in Singapore, even  the

Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Nobody is afraid of the Chief

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I hope they respect him.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Amen!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The next type of democracy

which  we  may  have will be one where  everybody  is

free.  I  would like to compare this type of  freedom

with  that  in  countries  like  Britain,  India  and

Australia.  That  type  of  democracy  must  come  to

Singapore. In order to attain that, what must we  do?

It  is  important that the police must be independent

of  the  ruling Party to some extent. We must have  a

strong  police  force  that is  able  to  resist  the

meddling  of  politicians.  We  must  have  a   Legal

Department that is going to defend the rights of  the

individual without fear of the Government. That  must

be written into the constitution before we can really

have a democratic Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this question of Merdeka again, today we are

fighting for political freedom and I know we will get

it.  But there are also other important freedoms that

we  must have. We must have economic freedom. We must

be  able to feed the people on this island. We cannot

say  that because Singapore is flourishing today,  it

will  keep  on  flourishing forever. We  know,  as  a

matter  of fact, that there are a number of factories

that  have stopped their expansion schemes.  We  know

also  that capital has been shifted from this country

to  other places, and that trade has more or less not

been  flourishing for quite some time. If this  state

of  affairs does not progress, and our population, on

the  other  hand, keeps on increasing every  day,  we

will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



faced with the problem of unemployment. We must  have

a strong government. We must have a stable government

to  be able to help the people of Singapore. We  must

have a government that can negotiate on behalf of the

people  of  Singapore with our neighbouring countries

for  better  trading  conditions.  We  must  have   a

government  that is able enough to infuse  confidence

into  everybody in Singapore and make the worker feel

that he is safe to work in any factory he likes,  and

to make the people who have the money to want to come

and  invest their money in this country and to  start

new  industries. A weak government will never be able

to  secure  for  us all that we want,  and  I  always

believe  that  in the matter of a democratic  set-up,

the  power is always vested finally with the  people.

It  is  the people who elect the government  and  the

people  should  be educated further to  know  how  to

exercise the very valuable privilege called the  vote

which  will send in people to represent them  in  the

government. The people always deserve the  government

they elect. It may be a good government. It may be  a

bad government. We have gone through that a number of

times, and I think the people are starting to wake up

on this matter. However, on this motion, I would like

to  assure  the  House that we, the Liberal-Socialist

Party, want independence and we will go to London  to

negotiate with Her Majesty's Government for a Merdeka

that will be acceptable to all in Singapore.

Minister  on  his statesmanlike speech yesterday.  He

gave  very  strong reasons why Singapore should  have

Merdeka  now, and he outlined in clear terms what  he

meant by this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore want Merdeka, not because

they  want  to get rid of the British but because  of

the  human  urge  to  be  free  of  the  shackles  of

colonialism. They want to be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



raise  their  heads amongst the free  people  of  the

world   and   be  better  able  to  discharge   their

responsibilities. They want to feel that this land of

Singapore is theirs to have and to fight for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt in my mind, Sir, that this motion

will  receive the unanimous, support of the  Assembly

and I hope -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> One abstention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mak Pak Shee:</b> - that the united voice of the

representatives of the people of Singapore will  bear

fruit  in  London and that the Merdeka  Mission  will

bring    back   to   Singapore   the   long-cherished

goal - Merdeka.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  necessity for independence in Singapore has been

so thoroughly stressed by the Hon. the Chief Minister

and  other  able speakers before me on  this  subject

that  I think it is rather unnecessary for me to take

up  more  time  of  this House to elaborate  on  this

subject   but  I  am  afraid  on  matters   of   such

importance,  I  might be accused by some  mischievous

persons that I have more enthusiasm for a holiday  in

London  than  for  working for  Merdeka.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion deserves the whole-hearted support of every right-thinking citizen of Singapore. The few who oppose it

are  mainly those whose interest is not in  Singapore

but   in   Whitehall  and  those  who  enjoy  special

privileges  obtained from the colonial masters.  They

are  those  who, due to the past educational  system,

have lost all self-respect and have no confidence  in

themselves or the people. The Alliance is against the

principle of sacrificing the interests of the  masses

for any privileged class and has every confidence  in

the  ability  of our own people to govern  ourselves.

Therefore, I strongly support this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech yesterday, Sir, the Hon. the Chief

Minister clearly pointed out that Singapore satisfies

the   two   conditions  outlined  in  the  Washington

Declaration. I have, Sir, on many occasions  publicly

stated that the speed at which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



Singapore attains independence is not to be geared to

the wish of Whitehall but is to be geared to the will

of  the people of Singapore, and if it is the will of

the people of Singapore to have Merdeka now, there is

nothing  that Whitehall can do to stop it. Similarly,

if  the  wish  of the people is not to  have  Merdeka

immediately, there is nothing that Whitehall  can  do

to force it down our throats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we who believe in parliamentary democracy

maintain  that the will of the people should  prevail

unless one is to make a mockery of democracy, and  in

the  light of the Washington Declaration, Sir,  I  am

stirred  by  the  conviction that  the  task  of  the

Merdeka  Mission in London will not be one of  trying

to  wrest  the sceptre of colonialism from  Whitehall

but rather a task in which both parties sit down in a

spirit  of  comradeship to endeavour to formulate  an

agreement  whereby  the  two peoples,  that  is,  the

people  of Singapore and the people of Great Britain,

can continue to remain the best of friends within the

Commonwealth each respecting the rights of the other.

Whether  this  happy state of affairs in  our  future

relationship with Great Britain can be brought  about

or not is a matter that is entirely the choice of the

Colonial Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wording of the motion, Sir, is very clear. The

Merdeka  Mission is not going to London to fight  for

independence  but  to seek what  is  our  inalienable

right and in this task, the Mission is instructed  to

give due weight to our obligations. The approach then

is  one of facing the realities of the situation  and

is  definitely  not anti-British. This  approach  can

only  be made by a people who are conscious of  their

responsibilities and their obligations and I  suggest

that  the  Colonial  Office  should  profit  by  this

friendly  approach. Here again, Sir,  the  choice  is

with the Colonial Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one newspaper conducted an anti-Merdeka

campaign and it would have the outside world  believe

that the people of Singapore do not want Merdeka now.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> This Assembly, Sir, is the proper

forum of public opinion and I am sure that when  this

debate is wound up the voting will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



unanimous  with  the exception,  of  course,  of  one

Member who says that he will abstain and the vote  of

this Assembly will portray the will of the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told, Sir, that it is the sincere

desire of Her Majesty's Government to see a fusion of

Singapore  and  the Federation of Malaya  so  that  a

strong  united Malayan nation can emerge. I have,  as

yet,  no cause to doubt this sincerity. Her Majesty's

Government  has agreed to grant independence  to  the

Federation  by August next year and unless  Singapore

attains nationhood also, the question of fusion  will

be made more difficult, for how can a colony sit down

at  a  round-table  conference as an  equal  with  an

independent territory to discuss terms and conditions

for a merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister has touched on the

fears  expressed  in some quarters that  independence

will  mean  the  domination of  other  races  by  the

Chinese,  and  he  expressed his  confidence  in  the

Chinese  in that they will play their part  as  loyal

citizens of Singapore. The history of the Chinese  in

Singapore, Sir, is one that should give no cause  for

such fears. We now have automatic registration and in

almost   every  electoral  division  the  votes   are

predominantly  Chinese, and if these  fears  had  any

foundation,  the Member for Stamford, an Indian, the

Member  for  Seletar, another Indian, and the  Member

for Katong, a Eurasian, would not have been returned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> What about Israel?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Cairnhill, yes,

would  not  have been returned to this Assembly.  The

Chinese  in  Singapore  do not  indulge  in  communal

politics.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You forgot Tanglin..



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> And here, Sir, on the front

Benches  are  represented  all  kinds  of  races   in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communist threat has been touched on by a lot of

Members  here - by speakers on the other side  and  on

this  side - and  it  is  a real  and  a  live  one  in

Singapore. The best answer to this threat is to  give

Singapore  independence,  for  then  the  people   of

Singapore  will arise to meet this threat with  their

heads  held high and with their hearts in the  fight.

It  is then a fight for their very existence, and not

a  fight for the preservation of colonial rule.  Sir,

the  Labour Front sincerely and honestly believe that

Merdeka is the only answer to political stability and

with   political   stability   will   come   economic

stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) said something

about  those people in Singapore who do not  describe

themselves as Singaporeans but there is one  thing  I

would  like to say here and now - that as far  back  as

1948  when I travelled overseas, I felt proud to  put

in the hotel register "Malayan" as my nationality and

it  confused a lot of people, and if we, the  Merdeka

Mission,  were to go to London in April and  describe

ourselves  as  Malayans, we will come  back  as  true

Malayans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In reply, Sir. Sir, I would

like to deal with a few of the aspects that have been

brought out in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin, Sir, asks us to remember

that the people of Singapore are not true Malayans. I

consider  that a libel upon the people  of  Singapore

although it may well be true of new Malayans like the

Member  for Tanglin, and I reject that as an accurate

analysis of the loyalties of the people of Singapore.

It  may  be  that the air of Tanglin does  not  breed

single  loyalty to this territory - but other parts  of

Singapore  do  and  the majority  of  the  people  of

Singapore are loyal Malayans, loyal to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin deplores emotionalism. Sir,

he is not the only,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



he  takes  the  cue  from another very  distinguished

expatriate - it  seems  it is  all  right  for  Winston

Churchill  to be emotional - he is a great  Englishman - but  for any Malayan to be emotional is really  quite

improper and a ghastly and an unpleasant spectacle. I

would  remind  the hon. Member that we  Malayans  are

human  beings. We are not a desiccated,  dehumanised,

subjugated  race  whatever the efforts  of  the  hon.

Member's  compatriots  in  the  past,  and  as  human

beings,  Sir, we are proud of the fact that  we  have

emotions. Let me go back a few thousand years to  the

time  when  the hon. Member's ancestors were  wearing

woad.   There  was  a  gentleman  by  the   name   of

Mencius - you must have heard of him -  the great disciple

of   Confucius   and   he  said   once,   Sir,   that

"emotionalism is the greatest moral force for good in

the  world."  Perhaps the hon. Member  will  remember

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had hoped that at least whatever the hon.

Member's   views   were,  he  would   not   seek   to

misinterpret what we did say or what I did say in  my

address to the Assembly yesterday. At least one thing

we  can  be  certain  of is that he  understands  the

English   language   and  he  has   no   excuse   for

misinterpreting. Yesterday, I made  it  as  clear  as

could  be,  in the simplest possible syllables,  that

the  external defence of Singapore was a misnomer and

that it was not a question of defending Singapore. It

was a question of utilising Singapore for the defence

of  other members of the Commonwealth, including  the

United  Kingdom, but we have the Member  for  Tanglin

saying  today, "We agree we are not strong enough  to

defend   ourselves.  Therefore,  we  ask  the  United

Kingdom to defend us." The Member for Paya Lebar (Mr

Lim  Koon  Teck)  supports him  with,  "We  agree  to

entrust  external defence to the United Kingdom."  We

agree to no such thing, Sir. We do not agree that  we

are not strong enough to meet our own defence. If the

question  of our own defence only were at  issue,  we

might have made other arrangements. Sir, there are a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



very  large  number of independent territories  which

are  members of the United Nations which are  smaller

in  population and in income than Singapore  and  yet

which  survive. So would Singapore, Sir,  if  it  had

only  to  seek its own defence. It is important  that

the Liberal-Socialists should recognise this fact: it

is not that we are entrusting our external defence to

the  United Kingdom; it is that we recognise that  we

cannot deprive the Commonwealth of the utilisation of

Singapore  as  a  port and there are some,  including

myself, who agree that we should not, that is to say,

we  are prepared to sacrifice ourselves for the  good

of  the  Commonwealth  and not  for  the  defence  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has suggested that we have cut our Defence

Estimates for 1956. I had thought it was amply  clear

at  the  time  of the debate that the Estimates  were

tailored  to  the maximum extent at  which  we  could

spend  the  money  and that none  of  our  plans  for

expansion of defence had been curtailed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> For a battalion?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The question of a battalion has

arisen, Sir, and we are assured that it can be  done.

It was suggested that it will take three years. There

is  now  a concerted effort being made to produce  an

operational battalion by April 1957. I am  told  that

it can be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect, Sir, of the speeches from

the  Liberal-Socialists to which I must refer with  a

sense of deep regret. I am in the position, as leader

of  the  All-Party Delegation, of having to  maintain

unity  of front in dealing with the Colonial  Office,

and  that unity of front has to be maintained amongst

a  very  different-minded group of people.  It  would

have  been a matter of elementary courtesy, Sir,  for

the Liberal-Socialists to indicate to the leaders  of

the other Parties - we have had several meetings of the

All-Party  Delegation - that  they  had  any   specific

reservations  in  respect  of  internal  defence.   I

consider it damaging and regretful that they  should,

here, for the first time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



in  an  amorphous  fashion indicate  their  so-called

reservations on internal security. I asked the leader

of  the  Liberal-Socialists how he wanted to  protect

this  internal security and the Member for  Serangoon

brushed  me  off with, "That will come later",  as  a

teacher would, and he never did explain but I  gather

from  the Member for Tanglin that it is the intention

of  the  Liberal-Socialists to insist that the United

Kingdom  retain at least equal power of control  over

our internal security as the local Government. Let me

say  this  flatly: If that is so, we go in vain.  The

Labour  Front  will  not accept any  such  compromise

about internal security. Now we have our disagreement

public and I do not know where we go from there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sutherland who does not know his status and

wants  to go to a night school, does not have to.  He

can  write  to  Sir John Nicoll and he will  discover

that  nominations  by the Governor under  the  Rendel

Constitution  take  the  form  of  following  certain

specific principles and one of the principles is  the

appointment   of   a   Member  representing   British

commerce. This was debated in full before the  Rendel

Commission -  the  question of representation  of  the

Chambers - and the Chambers were assured that if  there

was  a  representation  of  business,  representation

would  be through nomination. Mr Sutherland is  here

as a representative of British capital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> You never said it before.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I did not appoint you. I would not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I can understand that.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the Labour Front has, at

all  times,  despite the slander, the  malicious  and

vicious  attacks to which it has been  subjected - this

goes  back to more than a year on the part of certain

British  sections - always been deeply  convinced  that

the future welfare of Singapore lies and can only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



lie  within  the Commonwealth in close  and  friendly

relations with the United Kingdom. It is with  regret

that  we  have  watched this proud British  community

with so many fine members in it, leaderless, covertly

hostile, without a single man of stature to  give  it

cohesion,  purpose and understanding.  Last  week,  I

received a letter from a group of responsible British

merchants and so anxious am I that we should seek  to

wash away this unpleasant antagonism that exists  and

build  a  relationship of goodwill and trust  that  I

promptly  said  to them that I was  glad  to  receive

their letter and would they permit publication, which

they did. Yesterday, Sir, despite the views that I do

hold about the illogical conduct of Mr Sutherland in

the past in divisions in this House, I refrained from

referring  at  all to his past conduct.  I  gave  him

every possible opportunity and I pleaded for just one

act  of  statesmanship on the part of this  community

and  the capital he represents. I swept the path  and

laid  down  the  red carpet and blew the  fanfare  of

trumpets and did a statesman come forth? A grey mouse

came forth - a blind grey mouse -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I appreciate the

excitement  of  the moment but I must rule  that  the

word "mouse" is unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I accept your ruling, Sir, and

I  apologise.  I used the word "blind"  in  order  to

emphasise, Sir, this timorous fear and incapacity for

deciding  which way to go. He will go  neither  North

nor  South nor East nor West because he is afraid  of

action. It is pathetic and if this is the way British

capital acts in this Assembly, then I say this,  Sir,

and I hope it is heard in the headquarters of British

capital, that the primary duty of British capital  in

Singapore  today is to come off the pink  gin  clouds

whereon  lie  their incumbents, or some of  them,  to

come to earth and establish friendly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



and honest co-operation with the people; and if it is

found, as no doubt it will be found, that some of the

local  incumbents are quite inadequate for this  duty

of restoring and maintaining goodwill with the people

of Singapore, British capital should take early stock

of the need for replacing their local incumbents with

some  of  the very fine Englishmen whom we  so  often

meet  in  England  and  whom  we  would  welcome   in

Singapore,  not  corrupted by the  over-pampering  of

decades of colonial rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will not have unanimity. Let it be so, Sir. A

division will be taken and I hope you will allow  it,

Sir. I hope the voice of the people of Singapore,  at

least, will be heard - the Malayans for Merdeka and  no

internal  security  in the hands of  anybody  because

that is no longer Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly affirms, in the name of the

people  of Singapore, its belief in the principle  of

"the  basic right of peoples to governments of  their

own   choice",   as  enunciated  in  the   Washington

Declaration   signed  by  Sir  ANTHONY  EDEN,   Prime

Minister   of  the  United  Kingdom,  and   President

EISENHOWER,  President  of  the  United   States   of

America, on the 1st of February, 1956;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its belief that the long term welfare of

Singapore lies in close and friendly cooperation with

the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Assembly instructs its All-Party

Delegation to the forthcoming Constitutional Talks in

London to seek forthwith for Singapore the status  of

an independent territory within the Commonwealth, and

to  offer  an  agreement between the  United  Kingdom

Government  and the Singapore Government whereby  the

Government of the United Kingdom would in respect  of

Singapore exercise control over external defence  and

give  guidance in foreign relations other than  trade

and commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly affirms, in the name of the

people  of Singapore, its belief in the principle

of  "the basic right of peoples to governments of

their   own   choice",  as  enunciated   in   the

Washington  Declaration  signed  by  Sir  ANTHONY

EDEN,  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,  and

President  EISENHOWER, President  of  the  United

States of America, on the 1st of February, 1956;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its belief that the long term welfare of

Singapore  lies in close and friendly cooperation

with  the  United  Kingdom and  the  Commonwealth

territories;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Assembly instructs its All-Party

Delegation   to  the  forthcoming  Constitutional

Talks  in  London to seek forthwith for Singapore

the status of an independent territory within the

Commonwealth,  and to offer an agreement  between

the  United Kingdom Government and the  Singapore

Government  whereby the Government of the  United

Kingdom  would  in respect of Singapore  exercise

control  over external defence and give  guidance

in   foreign  relations  other  than  trade   and

commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection(4) of

section  12 of the Military Manoeuvres  Ordinance

(Chapter   103),   resolves  that   the   Raffles

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion seeks approval of the Rules

contained  in  Sessional Paper No. 15  which  has

been laid before this Assembly and those Rules in

turn  arise out of a previous Paper No. 14  which

contained a Proclamation declaring a new  bombing

range in the vicinity of Raffles Lighthouse. That

range having been proclaimed, it is now necessary

for the Air Officer Commanding, who is the proper

authority, to make these Rules for the safety  of

persons  in  that area and the approval  of  this

Assembly  is required for those Rules.  I  should

perhaps  add,  Sir, that before proclaiming  this

new  area,  we have had very detailed discussions

and  consideration involving all the  departments

which  are interested. Those are the Rural  Board

on behalf of the islanders, the Master Attendant,

Shipping,  Marine  Police,  Civil  Aviation   and

particularly  the Fisheries Department;  and  the

upshot  of the discussions is that this area  has

been agreed as a suitable one for a bombing range

and it has been agreed that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>



will be no inconvenience or danger to people  who

live  or  have their livelihood in the  vicinity.

Accordingly,  I ask this Assembly's  approval  of

those Rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that we had

laid before us some time ago the Second Report of

the  Select  Committee  which  was  appointed  to

inquire  into the conditions of service  and  the

establishment of the Assembly Staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chief Secretary. Have

you  signified  the Governor's recommendation  or

consent? I am afraid I did not hear it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I am obliged to you, Mr Speaker,

Sir. I  am afraid I did omit to do so. I should,

Sir,  formally convey to this House that  I  have

the  consent  of His Excellency the  Governor  as

required under Standing Order 33 to proceed  with

this  motion. I apologise for not having  started

with that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Sir, Members of the House will,

I    think,   be   aware   that   some   of   the

recommendations  in  that  Report  have   aroused

considerable   controversy  and   it   has   been

necessary for the Government to give considerable

thought  to those recommendations before deciding

how far we could in conscience move that they  be

implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion that stands in my name this

afternoon, Sir, contains the decisions  which  we

have  so  far made and for which I now  seek  the

approval  of  this House. Hon. Members  will  see

that    we    have   accepted   many    of    the

recommendations, though some have been  modified.

We have accepted the recommendation that the post

of  Clerk  should be of what is called Superscale

status but we have put the appropriate salary  at

$1,670  and  not  $1,950 as  recommended  by  the

Select  Committee. We have accepted in  full  the

recommendation of the designations of the post of

Clerk Assistant and Second Clerk Assistant and we

have  accepted the salaries recommended for those

two   posts.  We  have  also  accepted  the   new

designations  of Chief Reporter  and  Editor  and

Reporters and we have accepted the salary  scales

recommended  except  that we have  curtailed  the

upper  limit.  The  Select Committee  recommended

that  the Chief Reporter's scale should go up  to

$1,000  and we are proposing that it should  stop

at  $940  and they recommended that the Reporters

should  go  to  $940  and we consider  that  they

should stop at $880.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one further important point that I

should  mention  and  that is  the  motion  seeks

approval  for these new scales and salaries  with

effect  from  the 1st of April,  1956.  Now,  the

Report  of the Select Committee recommended  that

the changes should be made from the 1st of April,

1955,  in recognition of the additional work  and

responsibilities undertaken by our  staff  during

that  period. That recommendation, Sir, raises  a

very real difficulty to the Government in that it

impinges  on the principle of back pay.  We  have

for   some  time  now  tried  to  establish   the

principle   in   the  Government   service   that

alterations of salary scales should not  be  made

retrospective but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



should come into force from the date on which they

are  approved  and it is likely to be embarrassing

to us and indeed, I think, perhaps to the Assembly

if  we  depart from that principle in the case  of

our  own  staff.  I  am  pursuing  an  alternative

suggestion   of   finding  some   other   way   of

recognising  the  services  that  our  staff  have

rendered to us. That suggestion I should  like  to

leave  without prejudice to an ultimate  decision.

But in the meantime, Sir, it is important that  we

should  get  the present salaries of  these  posts

fixed so that we can proceed to appoint the proper

officers to the posts, and for that reason, I seek

approval  today for the new scales to be effective

from  the  beginning of this  month,  the  1st  of

April,   without   prejudice  to  any   subsequent

solution  we  may  wish to bring  forward  to  the

representations for recognising the work  done  in

the past. Sir, I move accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I rise to second the

motion  and reserve the right to speak at a  later

stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I happened

to  be on this Committee. It should be noted  that

in  all  Select Committees, the Members are chosen

in  such  a manner that there is always a majority

of  Government  Members. In this Committee,  I  am

sure,  Sir, you being the Chairman, know a lot  of

the   details.  Decisions  on  such  matters  were

reached  usually  after voting and  the  decisions

taken  at that time were done when there were  two

Government  Members and one on the Opposition.  It

seems,  Sir,  that  if  in a Select  Committee,  a

simple  thing as salaries of personnel  cannot  be

agreed  upon  between Members  of  the  Government

Benches  themselves,  it does  show  us  that  the

Government  is vacillating one way and the  other.

It  has  no definite idea as to what is  best  and

what  is  not  as good. This is a  clear  case  of

Government indecision!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to say is that at

that  time when the decisions were taken, we  were

not  thinking  about  personalities  but  we  were

thinking only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>



about  the  work and the responsibilities  of  the

officers,  and it was agreed by all  present  that

they  were doing a great deal more work than other

officers  receiving the salaries  they  were  then

receiving, so that there was a recommendation that

they should be given a higher scale. I do not  see

what  difference  there is or  how  much  it  will

benefit  Government and save its money by  cutting

down  the maximum of $940 for Reporters or  $1,000

for the Chief Reporter and Editor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations made by the Select Committee in

this case are of no use and if decisions taken  at

Select  Committees can be treated in this manner,.

then   we  might  as  well  do  away  with  Select

Committees.  We might also say that the  Hon. the

Chief  Secretary  be  allowed  to  make  his   own

decisions  because  in  this  Report  here,   hon.

Members will notice that the only person who  said

"No"  to  these various schemes was just the  Hon.

the Chief Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has always talked about democracy.

Government  has always talked about rule  by  the

majority. Government is now falling back on such a

matter.  It is no more the voice of the  majority.

It  is, "Where the majority voices an opinion that

suits  us, then we will implement that and  if  it

voices  an  opinion that is not to our liking,  we

will throw it away and fall back on what you might

call  red  tape colonialism which we will continue

to make use of, if it pleases us."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Democracy is not ruled by a

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I must oppose this

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I,

fortunately, was not present at any of the Select

Committee meetings which deliberated on this staff

matter. That was not because it would have been

without any purpose. But I am now in a better

position to put my point of view and my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



Party's  point of view. I support the proposal  of

the    Government,   which   varies    from    the

recommendations  of  the majority  of  the  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a tendency, and

it  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  Liberal-Socialists  support  this  tendency,   that   with

independence, everybody grabs something more. That

is  not  the spirit of Merdeka. With Merdeka  will

come  greater  responsibilities,  harder  work,  a

greater sense of purpose and a sense of endeavour.

We  must  resist this tendency that Merdeka  means

grabbing  the white man's job, grabbing the  white

man's  house,  grabbing the white  man's  car  and

shaking  legs  like he used to shake legs  before.

That  is  not our idea of Merdeka. I am sure  that

the  Assembly staff will forgive me if I say this,

that  whilst  they are not being handsomely  paid,

they  are  adequately remunerated more  than  they

were in the last Council and, as the years go  by,

if  the conditions of work should become more  and

more onerous as the responsibilities and duties of

this  Assembly become more and more enlarged,  the

matter  could be reviewed. For the time being,  it

is  fair that the Clerk of the Assembly should get

what is known, as the Hon. the Chief Secretary has

said,  as a superscale post and not the equivalent

of  a Permanent Secretary's post. The other scales

of   the   Clerk   Assistant,  the  Second   Clerk

Assistant,  the Chief Reporter and  Reporters  are

fairly evenly graded out taking into view that  at

the top of this pyramid is the Speaker at $3,500 a

month.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member does not

know  what  the  Speaker's salary is.  It  is  not $3,500.

<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION POLICY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon.

Members  will recall that when the Report  of  the

All-Party  Committee  on  Chinese  Education   was

tabled at the February sitting of this Assembly, I

promised that Government would be issuing a  White

Paper  based  on that Report. This  Paper  on  the

education policy is now in your hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise, however, at the very outset

that  the first part of the Paper, from paragraphs

1 to 7, furnishes only the background to the whole

problem  and if one might disagree here and  there

on  questions  of  assessment or  opinion,  it  is

really  not  worth  while to go  over  old  ground again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has had favourable Press notices and

a  few  adverse  reactions have been  confined  to

those who have, I am afraid, not quite studied the

implications  or, having studied them,  they  have

not  risen above sectional consideration to higher

motives of national interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to have the basic structure for

retention  of  all  the four  major  languages  in

Singapore  equally respected and permitted  to  be

used   in  debate  in  our  Councils,  both  local

government  and  central government,  we  must  encourage,  to  the  greatest possible  extent,  the

study  of  these four languages. By  insisting  on

bilingualism in the primary schools and  providing

for  trilingualism in the post-primary  stages  of

education, the secondary school, Technical  School

and the Polytechnic, we will have very soon people

conversant in at least two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



of  those  languages  and the problem  of  finding  a

common  language  will, it is confidently  hoped,  be

satisfactorily solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important than that, the main objective of

such  bilingual and trilingual education is the over-riding  consideration to build up a Singapore-centred

consciousness  and a common Malayan  loyalty  in  our

schools.  As  school  pupils grow  up  in  watertight

compartments, only being taught in the medium of  one

language, there will not be that sufficient diffusion

of  the  best  teaching  talent,  that  breakdown  of

communal barriers, and that sympathetic understanding

and  respect of other people's cultures and languages

which  are necessary factors in building up a  common

loyalty. The All-Party Committee Report expressed the

dangers  of  the two streams of education  proceeding

without a common objective and with no provision  for

intermingling,  thus  producing youths  unsympathetic

towards each other and even on occasions antagonistic

in  their attitudes on matters on which there  should

be  no grounds actually for conflict. The Report  has

sufficiently  stressed the grounds, whether  real  or

fancied,  why  the  Chinese stream  feels  that  past

neglect  and  indifference  has  contributed  towards

evoking a sense of discrimination in that stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper seeks to implement immediately

those  sections  of  the All-Party  Committee  Report

which  advocate equal treatment being  given  to  all

schools  under  exactly  equal  conditions  and  hon.

Members   will   agree,  I  am  sure,   that   speedy

implementation   of   those  proposals   specifically

mentioned  in paragraph 25 of the Paper  will  dispel

the   suspicion  and  distrust  which  have  hitherto

existed on that score.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of grant-in-aid for Chinese

schools,  it  is unfortunately not possible,  if  the

general education policy is to be carried out as laid

down  by  the Government, for some schools to receive

partial aid and others full aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the main aim of Government is, through its

education  policy,  to  build a  Malayan  nation,  it

should  not  support  any  schools  which  lack   the

emphasis on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



a  common Malayan loyalty. Communal schools as  such,

whilst  retaining the content and attributes  of  the

basic cultures, must therefore give way to and become

as speedily as possible national schools in the sense

of  using  similar  Malayan-centred syllabuses,  with

textbooks  specially written in the various languages

for  this  purpose,  providing bilingual  tuition  in

those  syllabuses.  It  is  hoped,  therefore,   that

sectional  and communal interests will see that  this

is  of  vital importance and that they will  speedily

accept  the  full  aid  with the conditions  attached

thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be misgivings on the part of certain

teachers in vernacular schools, that the new  deal will affect them adversely. Let me give a categorical

assurance, once and for all, that the recommendations

it  is  proposed to implement will not result in  the

retrenchment of any teacher. Teachers, in fact,  will

be  needed  in ever increasing numbers and there  are

more  vacancies  even  at  present  than  there   are

existing  teachers  to  fill them.  No  teacher  will

suffer  by  the proposals put forward.  It  is  quite

likely   that  many  chosen  teachers  of  vernacular

languages  in  English  schools  or  of  English   in

vernacular  schools will get slightly enhanced  rates

of  pay once qualifications and experience have  been

properly assessed; and let me assure teachers even on

this score, that the assessment will be done with the

greatest possible latitude, especially in the case of

those with very many years of experience. We can  ill

afford  to  lose  such teachers in the  face  of  our

expanded programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I might stress strongly is the

security  which teachers in vernacular  schools  will

now  enjoy.  They  will  get  permanency  of  tenure,

regular  increments and an adequate scale  of  salary

and  allowances.  If  a  teacher  wishes  to  undergo

further professional training, he will be enabled  to

do  so  without any cost to himself and he  can  then

attain  higher skill or be promoted to a  grade  more

important  or  carrying better  allowances  than  his

former   one.   I  intend  to  see  that   bursaries,

departmental  scholarships and all other  educational

opportunities be henceforth the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



same  for  Government schools  or  aided  schools,

including  vernacular schools.  No  more  teachers

will  be  forced to supplement their  income  with

other uncongenial part-time occupations. They will

not  be  at  the whim of an impecunious management

committee where the school is actually a small one

and  depending  on  fees  alone  supplemented   by

uncertain contributions to pay the salaries of the

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all the Chinese schools accept the full aid

offered,  there will be immediately an improvement

in  the  staffing position and an  easing  of  the

burden  of those parents with several children  in

school  at the same time, as fees will be remitted

if they are all of the proper ages for the classes

they attend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to paragraph 17 of the Paper, it is

definitely   not   intended  to   prune   language

syllabuses  in  such  a  way  as  to  touch  their

cultural content. It was stressed in the All-Party

Committee  Report that nothing would  be  done  to

hurt  the culture of the Chinese and that includes

the  Chinese  language. Any pruning will  be  done

after full consideration and consultation with the

school  authorities  concerned  and  after   their

objections have been carefully weighed, there will

be no steam-rollering over these objections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the All-Party Committee Report,

audio-visual aids will be used extensively to make

up for deficiencies in language teaching and there

will  be no shortening of courses at the sacrifice

of standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to remedy an inadvertent reference, in

paragraph 37 of the Paper, to the Chinese  schools

which  might give the impression that  only  these

schools  are to have a Disciplinary Sub-Committee.

It  is, of course, Government's intention to treat

aided schools and mission schools exactly alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for consideration, therefore, to see what

practical  measures  may  be  adopted  to  provide

better  accommodation and profit  by  the  capital

grants  under the full aid system for  schools  in

rural   areas  or  in  overcrowded  urban   areas.

Generally, the system of such aid will be ap-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>



plied in a sympathetic manner and aid will be more

readily  given in the case of those  schools  with

poor  resources  without  insisting  too  much  on

compliance with too many conditions all at once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the last sentence in paragraph 16,

the  rate of progress depending on recruitment and

retention  of high quality staff, my attention  is

drawn  to the possible implication that this might

be  taken  to  mean that there will  be  delay  in

Malayanisation  because of this. I have  therefore

to  correct such a misapprehension. Malayanisation

will be carried out as quickly as possible and  in

the spirit of the Commission's Report if agreed by

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I stress, in the strongest possible

terms,  that it is not the Government's  intention

to  do  anything  to  endanger  any  one  culture.

Henceforth,  not  only will the  culture  of  each

racial group be respected but positive steps  will

be taken to associate the various groups in such a

way as to enable them to understand and appreciate

each other's cultures. Whatever my officials and I

can  do  in  the  Ministry of Education  in  close

consultation with other Ministries to bring  about

this  cultural  enrichment to wider  contacts  and

positive  encouragement,  hon.  Members  may  rest

assured that we will do our utmost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these essential drastic reorientations

of  thought in preparation and in objective, there

must  be sections and individuals who do not agree

with  the recommendations made. I can only  appeal

to  these groups of persons to rally round and  to

forget, in the interest of the nation that is  now

being built, their own individual preferences.  If

Singapore  is  going to emerge as  a  free  living

country  to  be worth living in, it must  also  be

worth    sacrificing   for.   Parents,   teachers,

community   leaders,  Government   officials   and

voluntary workers must all work together  to  make

our education policy a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may inform the House that the Singapore

Chinese Schools Committee Teacher Association  had

an  interview with me the day before on  questions

touching  on  the  White Paper and  the  All-Party

Committee Report. They touched on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



several  points,  one of which is  the  age  limit

proposed by the White Paper, and I have given  the

assurance  that  evening classes  and  more  adult

classes  will  be provided to give  facilities  of

education to those who are not allowed to go  into

either the primary or the secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a fear that the powers of the

school  management committees, if they  come  into

the full aid scheme, will be wrested from them and

vested  in  Government. I give them my categorical

assurance  that  that is not the  intention.  They

will  still have their powers and they will  still

continue  to  exercise them,  although  there  are

safeguards  on  the  principle that  teachers  and

principals  must  be  protected  from  impecunious

management    committees   who   either    dismiss

principals or teachers at their whims and fancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also that fear that their

qualifications and teaching experience will not be

recognised,  as  only recently,  the  Ministry  of

Education  announced  recognition  of  only  eight

Chinese University degrees. I can assure the House

that the Ministry is still considering recognising

other Universities and when the process of sifting

the  various  University degrees is  finalised,  I

will  announce  the  Universities  which  will  be

recognised by my Ministry. Sir, I beg to move  the

motion that stands in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House approves the adoption of the

Education  Policy outlined in the White  Paper  on

Education  Policy as contained in Sessional  Paper

No. Cmd. 15 of 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Sir, I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That debate on this motion be adjourned in

accordance with Standing Order No. 20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, representations have been made to us from

various educational authorities that they have not

been able to secure copies of the White Paper from

the Government Printer. In fact, I was informed by

the local English papers that they received a copy

of  the  White  Paper on 30th March  and  then  in

between came the Easter Holidays.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



On  Monday, the Chinese copies of the White  Paper

reached some Chinese newspapers and the first time

the  public  knew of the existence  of  the  White

Paper could not have been earlier than the 1st  of

April in English and later in Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living today, Sir, in what we like to

call  a democratic country where the views of  the

people are allowed to be ventilated and where  the

people  should  know what exactly  the  Government

will  want  to do for them. We should  make  known

what  this House wants to do to the public  for  a

length  of time that would enable them to  comment

in  the  papers or write to us. If  we  publish  a

Paper  and  then  keep it until  the  last  moment

before we let it out to the public giving them  no

chance  to comment on it, then there must  be  one

reason  or another. One reason probably  would  be

that the Paper is defective.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Shame!

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Make your comment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We will, later on, when the

able  to take criticism and we must be able to  be

benefited  by criticisms. What is good  should  be

taken  in and what is not good we have every right

to  reject, but if we want to cover up our  faults

and carry on in this unholy haste -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

probably  dancing on the fringe of Standing  Order 31 (6) which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Member shall impute improper motives to any

other Member."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has been presented by the Minister

for Education and, as I say, the hon. Member seems to

be dancing on the fringe of that Standing Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you for drawing my

attention to it, Sir. I always thought that  a  Paper

is  presented  after the Council  of  Ministers  have

given consent to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, I think the

hon.  Member must realise, will make it worse because

the  Council  of  Ministers are all Members  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Well, Sir, today we live in

this   world  where  we  agree  that  we  will   rule

democratically,  where  we  say  we  must  not   have

dictatorship  and  if we have a Bill  rushed  through

without its being considered properly by every person

concerned, especially the people who are affected and

who   are   best   versed   in   it - the   educational

authorities - then we are not doing our  duty.  Sir,  I

beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I rise to support my hon. Friend as

seconder. In the last 24 hours, I have also  received

representations  from  educationists  from  different

schools  complaining  that  they  had  not  time   or

opportunity  to study the White Paper.  There  is  no

denying the truth of these representations. Copies of

the  White Paper, if available at all, could not have

been  obtained  until the last  two  days  after  the

Easter  Holidays. It stands to reason therefore  that

the  teaching profession has not had adequate  chance

to express their considered opinions upon it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is all wrong. The Government is asking

the  House today to approve a fresh education  policy

for the country before the education authorities have

had  a proper chance to examine it. If the Government

does not wish to give the impression to the education

authorities and to the public at large that they  arc

trying to steam-roller this White Paper through  this

House,  they should give a chance to persons  in  the

schools  and in the education world to express  their

opinions and that is why we wish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>



to see this motion adjourned until a later date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education had ample opportunity to

take  out the White Paper earlier than he did and  to

make  available ample copies to study and  indeed  it

was to have been tabled at the March sitting. Why  he

has  chosen  this method of sending it to Members  of

this Assembly without releasing it simultaneously  to

the Press and public is something for him to explain.

The  Member  for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon  Mong)  has

said  and as the Hon. the Chief Minister stated  only

yesterday, we believe, as he believes, in democratic

principles and we feel that in this case, there is  a

possibility   of  criticism  that  these   democratic

principles are being overlooked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the debate be now

adjourned."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  let us get some facts straight. On the 24th  of

March,  that  is to say, a fortnight ago,  the  White

Paper  was distributed to all Members. The  delay  in

giving  it to the Press, Sir, arose out of  the  fact

that  we  wished  to  have the  Chinese  translations

available  at  the same time for the  Chinese  Press.

They were made available to the Press on the 30th  of

March. So there has been, in fact, an interval of six

days



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also remind the Assembly that there has

been  a  nine-man Committee of the Assembly from  all

Parties  engaged  in studying this  question  and  in

making a Report and that the White Paper is based  on

it.  I would also remind the Assembly that it is  the

Assembly   that   governs   the   country   and   not

associations   outside  the  Assembly  and   pressure

groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to say this: that when I

received  the request for an adjournment, I tried  to

find  out  the  reason why, and it may surprise  you.

Sir, as I am sure it surprises every intelligent  and

reasonable  person,  that  there  should  be  made  a

request  without any suggestion of criticism. Neither

the mover nor the seconder has had a single objection

to  this  White  Paper.  No  major  aspect  is  being

objected to. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



is  nothing that requires further study. Why this

excuse,  Sir? Is it a desire to mount  opposition

along  the  lines of last May?  If  that  is  the

desire,  Sir,  we  will  meet  it.  It  is  being

camouflaged,   Sir.  You,  as  a   lawyer,   will

appreciate this: you cannot go to Court  and  ask

for  an  adjournment  unless there  is  something

substantial in the way of a defence which you wish

to  be  heard  at a later date. Here,  no  single

indication  has been given on any aspect  of  the

White  Paper to which objection can be taken.  In

fact, we are very proud of this White Paper, Sir.

There are three legs, Sir, to our efforts to seek

equal  justice for all communities. The first  is

multilingualism.  The second is equal  facilities

for  the  main basic cultures of this country  in

our  education system. The third which will  come

is citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken considerable care and given

considerable   thought  as   has   the   nine-man

Committee but, Sir, the question is now placed on

a  basis of democracy - we must give an opportunity

to these schools to make representation. You have

heard  from  the Minister that he has,  in  fact,

received  these representations. If that  is  not

enough,  right, Sir, I accept this motion  and  I

name  the date - the 12th of April - for the  hearing

of this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask your guidance, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can the Chief Minister explain further?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I would like to ask, Sir,

whether I am right in reading Standing Order  No.

20  (1)  as indicating that Government can accept

the  motion and can name a date for the adjourned

hearing.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will read the relevant portions of Standing Order 20 (1):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At any time before the conclusion of the

consideration of any item of business any  Member

may  move "That the debate be now adjourned"  ...

and  if such motion is agreed to the debate shall

be  adjourned.The  Speaker shall  call  upon  the

Member in charge of that item of business to name

a  day  for  its  resumption and the  item  shall

thereupon become an order of the day for the  day

so named."



<br><br>It  is  quite clear, then, that if the motion  is

accepted  by  the  House,  the  debate  will   be

adjourned. Then I will call upon the

a  date  and  I  take it that the Minister  or  a

tomorrow  (if  the sitting carries  on  tomorrow)

that at its rising the Assembly do adjourn to the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons why these supplementary votes are

required are explained in considerable detail in  the

Command  Paper.  The  great  majority  of  the  items

referred  to  are unforeseen revotes  of  expenditure

approved  in  1955. It had been hoped to submit  this

list  of  revotes  at  the February  sitting  of  the

Assembly, that being the first opportunity after  the

Budget sittings in November last year. Unfortunately,

certain unexpected difficulties arose which made this

impossible.  It  is hoped that, by the  end  of  this

year, all necessary arrangements will have been  made

for  the  submission  of  these  revotes  either   in

December or at the first sitting in 1957. This  year,

where  necessary,  the old-established  practice  has

been followed and work has been financed by means  of

advances below the line, pending the approval of  the

Assembly. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I have one point that I

wish  to ask on this particular item, which is  given

as  item No. 12 in Command Paper No. 18, it being, as

I  understand it, one of 28 items under the "Schedule

of  Applications for Supplementary Provision approved

under   authority   delegated  by   the   Legislative

Assembly". If I understand it aright, these items are

covered by a resolution of the Assembly passed on the

25th of May, 1955, empowering Government to authorise

expenditure on new services up to a limit of  $10,000

in  each  case.  At  the time, if  I  understood  him

aright,  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary  gave  an

undertaking that this delegation of authority by this

Assembly to the Government would not be exercised for

the  creation of new posts. Now, this item under Head

14, Chemistry, may not be very important - the creation

of  a  post  of  Typist for the Inspectorate  in  the

Department of Chemistry - but unless I am mistaken,  it

is  a  violation of the undertaking given.  If  I  am

wrong, I am sure my hon. Friend will correct me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am grateful to the Member for Tanglin

for  drawing  the attention of the Assembly  to  this

mistake in the drafting of the Command Paper.  I  did

give  an  assurance that the authority given  to  the

Government by the Assembly last year for the approval

of  votes  under  $10,000  would  not  apply  to  the

creation  of  new appointments. That is the  position

and   these  items  are  wrongly  included  in   this

particular section of the Command Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will you name the items, Mr

Financial Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Items 10 and 11 -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have dealt with items 10 and 11.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, when we come to the items

separately. The position, as I see it, is that  these

items,  although wrongly placed, can be voted  either

for  or against, and if they are voted against, then,

of  course, it is up to the Government to  find  some

means of rectifying the mistakes.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  think  there  is  no  real  mistake  except,

perhaps,  in  the heads under which these  items  are

presented  in pursuance of a resolution  approved  by

the Assembly last year, but the items themselves,  to

which  objections are being taken, are new  items  in

respect of which we seek the approval of the Assembly

and on which no expenditure has as yet been incurred.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am glad the Chief Minister has

pointed that out. My impression was that appointments

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I distinctly got that

impression myself, because the heading under  Command

Paper  No. 18 says "under authority delegated by  the

Legislative Assembly", and some of these appointments

are  with  effect  from  the 1st  of  March,  1st  of

January, and so on. Naturally, I am only too glad  to

accept  the assurance of the Hon. the Chief  Minister

that this is incorrect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $639,033 for Head 16 stand part of

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in item 71

under  Head 16, I see there is provision for $203,000

apparently   in  respect  of  12  flats  for   Junior

Officers.  I  seek information as to  the  nature  of

"Extension - $133,000"  and  whether  this   is   for

additional flats or an enlargement of those flats. If

it  is  for 12 flats only, then the total expenditure

of $433,000 would work out at $36,000 a flat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think, Sir, I should say, first of all,

that the word "Extension" should not be used here.  I

discovered  its  use only when I saw the  message  in

type.  The word should be "Supplement" or "Addition".

In the 1954 Defence Estimates, there was a block vote

for  shore accommodation for the Royal Malayan  Navy.

This  block  vote  was broken up departmentally  into

various  items and a sum allocated to each. A certain

latitude  to  switch funds between items was  allowed

provided  the  total provision was not  exceeded.  In

1955  the  block vote was broken down into items  and

shown on this form in the Estimates. Consequently  in

asking for revotes, it is necessary to show additions

and  subtractions which have been made  to  and  from

each  item  in the course of the past year.  This,  I

hope,  explains  the reasons for  the  deletions  and

additions  shown  in the Defence Service  revotes  in

this  schedule.  The  total  cost  of  the  flats  is

$433,000  or  $33,000 more than  the  original  rough

estimate  under  the block vote.  It  represents  the

basic cost of the 12 flats constructed as planned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, once again, I have to

protest against the enormous expenditure of $36,000 -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now "labouring" under

new Standing Orders, and if any hon. Member wishes to

debate any detail of this Command Paper, he will have

to  do  that  in  the  Public Accounts  or  Estimates

Committee  and  not  in  a  Committee  of  the  whole

Assembly.  Information may be asked for  and  may  be

obtained - that is quite in order - but the debate should

be  along  the  lines laid down in our  new  Standing

Order 69 (11) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On any question in the Committee of Supply debate

shall  be  confined to the policy of the service  for

which the money is to be provided and shall not  deal

with the details of expenditure, but may refer to the

details  of revenues or funds for which that  service

is responsible."



<br><br>Representations as to the cost of flats and so on,  I

think, can properly be dealt

estimated  expenditure  outlined  in  the  Command

Paper.  The Party will consist of fourteen Members

of  the  Assembly, including my  hon.  Friend  the

Attorney-General. Seven officials  will  accompany

the  Party  including the Director  of  Personnel.

Members of the Mission will be the guests  of  Her

paid  a  subsistence allowance to cover meals  and

other   essential  expenses  during  their   stay.

Arrangements   are  being  made   to   lodge   the

officials,  who  are accompanying the  Mission  on

duty,  in  the  same block of  flats  but  at  the

Singapore Government's expense. The officials will

also  be  paid  a subsistence allowance  to  cover

essential expenditure. Provision is made  for  the

payment  of an outfit allowance to each Member  of

the  Mission  and officials who have  no  suitable

warm  clothes  to  wear in Spring  in  the  United

Kingdom. Provision has been made for the  fees  of

three  lawyers  who  will advise  the  Mission  on

constitutional matters. It is unlikely that actual

expenditure  on this item will be as much  as  the

estimate.  The  other items are  self-explanatory.
