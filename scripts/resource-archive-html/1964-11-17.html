<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead 2260.§



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has boasted about the

establishment of T.V. services as something great  for  them.  I

would  like  to  remind all that T.V. programmes  have  a  great

influence   on  the  morals  of  our  people  and   our   future

generations,  and  will  affect  our  future  trends.  With  the

extension of television services, more and more of the  audience

will  be influenced by the programmes. Most of the audience  are

young boys and girls who cannot think and decide for themselves.

They are still not matured and are wont to imitate what they see

and hear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since television has an immediate effect on the lives of the

audience,  we  should  not  under-estimate  the  effect  of  its

function on the minds of the people. We should consider  whether

we want to educate them into good citizens or into bad citizens,

like  rogues. We want to educate our children to be  law-abiding

citizens  with a high moral sense. Or do we want  to  make  them

into people who imitate the ways of cowboys and Western rascals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents have raised criticisms about this and have expressed to

me that they have no confidence in the future of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



next  generation because of the influence of T.V. on  them.  Now

that  T.V. is an added entertainment, it further increases  the

worries  of  parents because, after viewing  the  programmes  on

murder,  arson,  and robbery, their children  will  imitate  the

villains or heroes of the films, thus affecting the conduct  and

character of the children, who will become lax in their studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what we regret most is that the Government

has  not censored evil films which are detrimental to the mental

attitude of the audience. If we describe all the T.V. programmes

as  bad, it will not be justified, because there are also useful

programmes.  But  here  I would like to raise  a  question:  why

should  bad  films  which are detrimental to  the  thinking  and

mental  attitude  of our future generation be  mixed  with  good

films?  Does it mean that there are no healthy programmes  which

have  both an educational and amusement value? Mr Speaker, Sir,

yellow  culture is detrimental to our mentality and our thinking

because  it makes us degenerate to a great extent. For instance,

the  detective  stories appearing on T.V. stress  the  theme  of

revenge  by  heroes.  These stories are  filled  with  fighting,

rogues, villains, robberies, and things like that. Superficially

the  theme  of the whole film may be right, but the actual  film

will cause the people to degenerate. The villains and heroes  of

Westerns  and  detective  stories are worshipped  by  the  young

audience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from this, we also see certain filthy

films  on  comedy. These films are not really humorous  but  are

just  travesties which perhaps might be liked by Western people.

But to the people of the East, these films are not suitable.  It

is  not  that we strongly oppose such films. What we  oppose  is

such  films that will drive our young people to hysteria.  These

films  are  films prevailing in the West and depict Rock-n-Roll,

the Twist and others.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has promised to wipe out yellow

culture. I would urge it to do so. Let us remember that in 1959,

when the P.A.P. assumed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



office,  juke boxes and filthy music were banned. But today  the

P.A.P. Government is allowing more and even worse yellow culture

to  intoxicate our innocent youths. We hope the Government  will

take in more healthy films both from abroad and locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to appeal to the Government to see

that the T.V. programmes, no matter how good or bad they may be,

should  be  thoroughly scrutinised and investigated.  It  should

seek opinions from cultural and educational organisations. There

should  be a Review Committee set up composed of representatives

from  these  organisations  to review the  programmes.  Personal

feelings  and  likes or dislikes should not be the criteria  for

such a review of T.V. programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, newspapers, for instance, like the Utusan

Melayu  and the Berita Harian used to print criticisms  levelled

by  religious and cultural bodies against the Twist and

Rock-n-Roll films on T.V. We should not ignore such criticisms. Here  I

would advise the leadership of the Government to think well  for

the future generation, to stop yellow programmes on T.V., and to

allow  more healthy programmes which are more beneficial to  the

people as a whole to be shown, and not to spend public funds  on

publicity  and  propaganda for the Party in power.  They  should

introduce programmes which are of an educational nature and of a

high  standard. They should not try to economise at the  expense

of the quality of the films.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Koo Young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson):</b> I am waiting.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I would

like  to  say something to supplement what the Member for  Bukit

Merah  has  said.  We are very surprised that  the  standard  of

culture in Singapore is getting lower and lower. We can  see  in

the  newspapers nowadays that night clubs have come out into the

open and have made a lot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



of publicity in the newspapers. As Members must have read in the

newspapers, there was a fight over some girls at a certain night

club.  I  do not know what the Government's attitude is  towards

this  incident. I hope it will curb this kind of activities  and

not allow them to spread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some healthy cultural societies, I would like to point out to

the  Government,  put up certain items at the Victoria  Memorial

Hall.  They were branded as yellow culture. The curtain suddenly

descended.  I  was told that the police finally  cancelled  some

items  in  their programme. That forced the show to  come  to  a

sudden  stop. This cultural body was putting up a  show  at  the

Victorial Memorial Hall. We can see the magazine of this musical

society.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on T.V. programmes. Not on night life and

restaurants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, I wish to speak up to this point only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, television is

rather  a  new  achievement.  As  far  as  Asian  nations, are

concerned, only a few are able to introduce T.V. But we are  one

of  the pioneer nations in South-East Asia to make use of it for

educational  as  well  as entertainment  purposes.  It  is  very

amusing indeed to watch the Barisan Sosialis stand up and accuse

the   Party  in  power  of  allegedly  abusing  T.V. for  party

propaganda.  If there were one iota of truth in it,  the  public

would not clamour for more T.V. programmes and more T.V. sets. A

casual glance at the statistics available at T.V. dealers' shops

in  Singapore clearly indicates that day by day more orders  are

placed  for  T.V. sets and that practically every  middle-class

home  in  Singapore  has  one T.V. set in  order  to  enjoy  the

programmes presented by responsible men from  the  Ministry

of Culture. In other words, the programmes presented to the  public

through the medium of T.V. have become very popular. It has been

realised  by  one and all that the P.A.P. has succeeded  in  its

attempt to provide entertainment and educational programmes  of

a high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



calibre to the masses in Singapore. Further, foreign dignitaries

who  have  had  the  opportunity to visit our T.V. studio  have

appreciated the excellent standards maintained in Singapore. The

Barisan  Sosialis, of course, will refuse to believe it, because

it is difficult to educate the uneducable. Since they are living

in  a  state  of mind of their own creation, I fully  sympathise

with them, but I request them to wake up even at this late hour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bukit Merah is

the  most  reasonable man of the lot in front of us, because,  I

think,  he  is a bit more intelligent than some of his  comrades

who  do not know what they are talking about and where they  are

going.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, unfortunately it is difficult to answer him because

he was talking in platitudes. As you know, Sir, it is difficult

to answer platitudes. I agree with him that T.V. programmes

should be good; T.V. programmes should be healthy. They should

be less yellow. But having agreed with him now, it is up to him

to tell us what programmes he considers unhealthy, what

programmes he considers yellow; and what does he mean by saying,

for example, that there is too much fighting; there are heroes;

there are villains, there are robberies depicted in films. Sir,

I have seen what they would call progressive films - Soviet

films, Chinese films from New China - and they show heroes and

villains fighting against Japanese invaders. I remember there

was a traitor called Wang Chingwei. He was trying to betray his

country to the Japanese. I have seen a film where these national

traitors were depicted as villains, and the revolutionary forces

were depicted as heroes. The average cinema-goer would identify

himself with the patriots, the people who defend their country

against traitors and villains, against robbers and purveyors of

violence. Sir, in any film and in any novel, any art form, these

things have been depicted. You cannot produce a good film or a

good novel or a good play without showing the various aspects of

human nature - villainy, thuggery, treason, unpatriotism. These

are depicted as bad forces contending with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



more progressive forces like heroism, patriotism and virtue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it is difficult to answer the Member for

Bukit Merah until he indicates what particular programme and what

particular film or series of films are bad. For example, he says

that detective stories are no good. A few weeks ago somebody sent

me a list of translations of popular authors in the Soviet Union

- Agatha Christie is a popular writer. Her works have been

translated into Russian. There are good detective stories and bad

detective stories. Detective stories in themselves are not bad.

But if a detective story glorifies murder, and if it is shown,

and if the Member for Bukit Merah can point out such a film, then

I will rectify the matter. I myself am concerned that some of the

films do show too much violence. With that end in view, we have

transferred censorship of T.V. films to the Film Censors. They

are a group of people who are experts in censoring films with a

view to seeing that morals are not lowered. They are also experts

at detecting subversive propaganda which may get into some of the

T.V. films. I believe this censorship job has already been

transferred to the Film Censors. I have seen them, and I think

they do portray too much of violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan object to cowboy films. But I am told that even

progressive people view the cowboy as a folk hero. He is of the

people. He is not of the ruling class.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a cattleman, a peasant. So you are glorifying a man

who fights against oppression, against villainy, against people

who do not respect law and order. Most of the Western films show

the cowboy as the man who stands up for law and order, not people

who want to break law and order and then get into trouble.

Therefore, Sir, I agree with the platitudes expressed by the

Member for Bukit Merah. But unless he specifies his grievances,

it will be a bit difficult to answer him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Tampines, I do not know whether the

association he has been talking about is the same association

that I have in mind - that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



we ruled out some of the programmes

- healthy programmes as he calls them - put forward by a certain

cultural  organisation. It was in connection with the  Keng  Leh

Musical  Association, I remember, Sir, that  that  incident  did

come up. They were putting in Communist items, and therefore  we

struck  them  off.  They were trying to sneak  them  into  their

programme. So their souvenir programmes were withdrawn. When  an

association applies to the Ministry to put up a show, and if  it

gives certain guarantees that it is not going to transgress  the

law,  then  it should adhere to its undertaking and not  try  to

sneak  in a few items in the hope that people, either the police

or   whoever  goes  and  sees  the  show,  will  overlook  them.

Therefore,  Sir, I hope that the Barisan Sosialis  Members  will

view some of the T.V. films which do teach two things - respect

for law and order and respect for truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of

all,  I  would like to thank the Minister for Culture. He should

not  be  so courteous and, at the same time, sarcastic. We  have

raised  these  questions because it is the  right  and  duty  of

Opposition  Members  to do so. We want to offer  the  Government

some  food  for thought, to consider which films  are  good  and

which  are bad. I have also said that the merits or demerits  of

the  films  should he reviewed by a Censors Board or committee.

But  if  the  Minister for Culture wants me to pinpoint  certain

programmes as bad or good, then I will mention them. They are my

personal  views.  The Minister for Culture has  said  that  some

detective  films are very good. I do not deny that. But  in  our

T.V. programmes every week, there are too many detective films.

Let  us  just open this Chinese copy of T.V. and Radio Magazine.

On Monday there is a Hitchcock detective ---

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member identify the document from which

he is reading?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, T.V. and

Radio,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



published  by  Radio  Singapore  Broadcasting  Department.  On

Tuesday,  there  is again a detective story  on  Channel  8.  On

Wednesday, there is Perry Mason, a detective film. On  Thursday,

another  detective story. On Friday there is none. On  Saturday,

on  Channel  8,  "77 Sunset Strip". On Sunday another  detective

story - The Case of the Kiss. I think there are too many detective

films. The scenes will be mostly fighting and violence. I  feel

that  this is not too good. As to what good films should he used

to  replace  them,  I  would suggest that,  for  instance,  last

Saturday, there was a French film, "The Beauty and the Beast". I

think  the Minister for Culture should try to introduce more  of

such films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer to what the Minister for Culture has

said,  that fighting might not be necessarily bad, and that  war

might not he necessarily bad. But we should see what kind of war

or  fighting  it is. What is the use of fighting over  women  or

using violence in robbery? We should see for what purpose  that

war  or fighting is staged. I do not oppose the type of fighting

or  war on T.V. programmes depicting the Second World War  which

is  more  serious than the cowboy type. Such fighting  scenes  I

think I may welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the judging of whether a film is good or had

should not he based on personal criteria. Since the Minister for

Culture wants me to give some definite examples, that is why  I

am giving him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ready now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

say  a  few  words  about T.V. programmes.  They  have  a  great

influence on the people of Singapore. The Minister for Education

has  not studied this problem. Therefore, he is ignorant of  the

effects of T.V. programmes on the pupils' studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister for Culture has asked us to suggest some

good films and programmes. I can give a few examples. There  are

certain Filipino fighting films. The hero dresses like a cowboy,

but wears drainpipe trousers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



He fights over women and is involved in robbery or kidnapping.

This  kind of a story or theme is a burden to our society.  That

it  should appear on T.V. may be beneficial to the Minister,  but

it is not beneficial to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of fighting pictures are those from America. Most

of these pictures depict how the Americans fight against the Red

Indians and glorify the white people. There is a strong note  of

racialism  in  these  pictures.  There  is  also  discrimination

against  the  Red Indians. These pictures are not good  at  all.

They are no good to our younger generation and to those who want

entertainment, because they have always depicted  the  Americans

as  heroes. One shot from their gun can kill two people, whereas

the  Red Indians cannot kill any person with even 10 shots. This

is  an  insult  to  the Red Indians and to the coloured  people.

These  so-called hero pictures are no good at all. After  giving

these examples, I hope the Minister will review these programmes

and not talk about Russian and Chinese stories and pictures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as regards the cowboy, I have seen Barisan

Sosialis  shows,  Communist shows, with Chinese  dressed  up  as

Cossacks.  Sir,  there is nothing wrong if a Filipino  wants  to

dress  up as a cowboy. In fact, they will be interested to  know

that in Malaysia we have cowboys. In Sabah there are cowboys who

are dressed in - what are they called?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Bajaus.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Bajaus. Surely, Sir, they are not going to

insult  them by saying that they should not adopt a dress  which

is  really  Spanish. There is nothing wrong in that. It  is  not

whether  a  Filipino dressed up as a cowboy is bad, but  whether

the  film  itself is bad. There is one valid point on which  the

Member  for  Thomson did make representation, and that  is  that

they show Western films where the Red Indians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



are  shown as savages. In fact, there are one or two such films.

Instructions have been given not to show Western films depicting

the Red Indians as barbaric and backward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this apart, Sir, the Member says that a detective film is

shown  practically every day. But that is not the point.  Is  he

objecting to good films being shown every day? Is the detective

film  bad  or  good? The moral is quite clear  in  many  of  the

Hitchcock films which we show. That crime does not pay. You  can

say  there is too much love drama every day, because most  films

deal  with very basic themes, like crime or love or humour. They

say.  "I  do  not like it. There is a humorous film  every  day.

Therefore, out with it." The point is whether that film is  good

or  bad. In fact, about six months ago we withdrew two detective

series.  There were complaints. I think "The Saint"  series  has

recently come off because our contract has expired. People  have

been  writing  in,  asking.  "Why has  my  film  programme  been

withdrawn?"  Sir, in a T.V. programme running for  six  hours  a

day,  we  must  plan  programmes with a view to  satisfying  the

unsophisticated as well as the Member for Bukit Merah who  likes

"The  Beauty  and the Beast". This film is a very  sophisticated

one  and would not be appreciated by more than a minority of the

audience. We have to satisfy everybody. Some people like  cowboy

films,  some like cartoons, some like news, some like  comedies.

So  we  have to plan out a programme each day. We have a  little

bit  of  everything. Some people like detective stories,  so  we

plan to provide four or five a week. Some people like humour, so

we provide that too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see that the Member's objection is not that detective

films are bad. At least he has not said so. He says there  is  a

detective  film almost every day. But some people like detective

stories and, therefore, we have to satisfy all tastes.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions on the amendments put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no matter how the Minister for Culture wants

to  argue, the fact remains that his Ministry is not fair in its

treatment  of  news. I would like to state one  example  of  the

biased  treatment of news over the radio and on T.V. An  obvious

example  is  the Assembly which deals with the problems  of  the

people  and which is the only place where the Opposition Parties

can  criticise the Government. The proceedings of every Assembly

sitting are specially broadcast over the radio. But how does the

Government  go  about it? The Ministers and their  Back-benchers

get more coverage of their speeches than the Opposition Parties.

Sometimes  the Opposition Parties do not get any radio  coverage

of  their  speeches in the Assembly. The people are  anxious  to

know  how the struggle is carried on in this House, and in order

to   enable  them  to  have  confidence  in  the  constitutional

struggle,  they have a right to know what is actually  happening

in  this  House. The reports of the proceedings  of  this  House

should  not  be prejudiced against the Opposition Parties  whose

speeches  are  not  reported over the radio.  It  is  only  when

Opposition  Members are accused by the Ministers that  they  are

mentioned  in  the reports. There have been occasions  when  the

news  was distorted in an attempt to lessen the time of coverage

of  the speeches of the Opposition, such as reporting fictitiously  that  the Opposition Parties were so stunned by a Minister's

counter-attack that they did not know what to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the reporting of news over the radio and on T.V.

should not be made to serve the purpose of the Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

going to speak on the other amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it is curious how one can anticipate

precisely the complaints that the Barisan Sosialis will bring up

on any issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that the News Section was going to be discussed

today,  my feeling was that the Barisan Sosialis were  going  to

bring up the complaint that the Opposition do not get fair play.

So  in order to provide myself with an answer, I asked the  News

Section to find out for me how much of the time was given to the

Opposition  and  to the Government Benches since  the  last  few

Assembly  sittings began. The Barisan Members are only seven  in

number  and mathematically they should be getting less coverage.

But according to the News Section, for example, on 4th November,

the  Opposition  were  given 105 lines and the  Government  were

given  76  lines.  On 5th November, the Barisan  were  given  60

lines. On 12th November, the Opposition were given 142 lines and

the Government were given 68 lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the news period is about ten minutes. We have to get not

only  the  proceedings of this Assembly into  the-news  bulletin

but,  more  important, news of what Soekarno is going  to

do  - whether  his boys are coming to blow up this place as  they  did

yesterday. This is also important news, and the people  want  to

hear  it  too. So we have to apportion the news time. It depends

on  what  the  Opposition  say. The News  Section  have  trained

newsmen; they judge. They do not report somebody just because he

has spoken. They report people if they have something to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has complained of distortion in last

night's  news  because one of the reports did mention  that  the

Opposition Members were too stunned to reply to a question  that

I  asked. I have the transcript, Sir, It is factual and accurate

reporting. Yesterday I asked the Barisan to name one book  which

they thought was healthy literature and which had been banned. I

am  quite prepared to run through the transcript. There  was  no

reply. Therefore, any news reporter would say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



"Well,  a  pointed  question was asked to  which  there  was  no

reply." How can that be distortion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I suggest that if Members want to get a little more

time  over  the  radio  or on T.V., they  should  say  something

interesting, something to catch the eye of the newsmen, and  not

repeat  things which they have been saying for the last  two  or

three  years. The newsmen will also get tired and they will  say

that  it  is  no use reporting them on T.V. because the  Barisan

further complain that the television programmes are dull.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  Culture has said that the  News  Section  of  the

Ministry  of Culture has reported fairly and justly the  proceed

ings of the Assembly. In fact, when people compare the T.V. news

report  on the proceedings of the Assembly and what they see  in

the Chinese newspapers, they know that there is a certain amount

of  bias.  The  reports in the Chinese newspapers are  different

from  those  put  over  the  radio.  On  T.V. the  reports  are

politically biased in favour of the Government. Our suggestions,

refutations and strong points in the debates are not  broadcast,

whereas the speeches of the Government Members are reported. The

Government's weak points which come under fire from us  are  not

broadcast, so that the people do not know anything about them at

all.  The  Government  talk  about the  apportionment  of  time.

Although the Opposition Members are few in number, they speak on

facts.  It is not fair to compare the time with the contents  of

speeches. If the Government take up more of the time, then  what

will be left for us?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan

Sosialis should be thankful  to  the Government  for  the time

given over the radio to  report  their comments  made  in  this

Assembly. If  we  were  in  Peking  or Indonesia  or  Moscow,

the  Opposition  would  not   have   the opportunity to voice

their opinions over the radio.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Jurong has accused the Government Back Benchers of not being

able to speak. In other words, all the Government Back-Benchers

are dumb.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that Budget time is more or less

referred to as Opposition time. This is the time when Opposition

Members  make concrete and constructive criticisms  against  the

Government  so that the Government can rectify its mistakes,  if

there  are  any.  Instead,  the seven Barisan.  Members  on  the

Opposition   side  have  talked  nonsense  without  making   any

worthwhile criticisms.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Mr Speaker, I would refer to what the Member

for Thomson has alleged - that news over the radio and on T.V.

was distorted and that it was more or less biased. But as the

Minister for Culture has pointed out, in its ten minutes of

report on the proceedings in the Legislative Assembly, they have

got to give a wide coverage and they have to summarise the whole

proceedings in just under ten minutes. So these reporters know

what their job is. Those points worth bringing home to the

people of Singapore will be given coverage. And no absolute

falsehoods uttered will be carried because they are not

constructive criticisms - one Opposition Member after another

accusing Government of this and that. Well, you do not expect

people to just waste their time listening to the news. What is

the news for? That is the most important programme, when people

will be informed not only of what is happening around them but

in the whole world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also said that the Chinese newspapers

have given them wide coverage in their daily reports on the

proceedings of the Assembly. But the Chinese newspapers are not

in the hands of the State Government. We are not controlling

them. It is up to them to publish whatever Members opposite

talked for publication in the Chinese newspapers. They have

enough space. That is the point I am trying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



to  bring  home - that the Back-benchers of the Government  side

are  not  just sitting clown here keeping quiet, hut are  giving

them  time  to make their constructive and well-supported  criticisms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, from what the

Member  has just said, we can find out the faulty points of  the

Government, especially when they themselves have disclosed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Punggol has said just now that Budget

time  is the time for the Opposition to air their views.  We  on

this   side  have  been  trying  to  air  our  suggestions   and

criticisms,  but  the Minister for Culture has said  that  there

should  be  a  certain ratio in giving coverage to  speeches  of

Members on both sides of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as to the point whether there is any value in what we

say in this House, who should be the judge to say whether the

points we raise in this House are of any news value? Is it for

the Minister for Culture to decide, or is it for the audience to

decide? Speeches made by Opposition Members are not liked by the

Minister. So it will be most unfair for the Minister to judge

our speeches. I would ask him what he considers valuable? When

ever he opens his mouth, he says "Marxism" and "Communists". And

if we were to talk about these things, we would only be wasting

the time of this House. So are we going to utter

such mad talk or even to emulate him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another very important point. Just now the Member for

Punggol has said that Chinese newspapers are not under the

control of the State Government. So they can report at random,

and even report unnecessarily. This will show their weakness in

regard to the ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Point of order. I did not say that the Chinese

newspapers can report anyhow and at random.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. What is the point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I did not say that the Chinese newspapers ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The point of order is that the Member is

distorting what I have said just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the distortion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I did not say that the Chinese newspapers

could report at random or anyhow.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Thomson was saying that you have

said that the Chinese newspapers are not under State control.

That was the point. Mr Koo Young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you. Mr Speaker. This will

make us look at the picture more clearly - that whatever they

can control, they will suppress the reporting. When they cannot

control the Chinese newspapers, when reporting in the Chinese

newspapers gives more coverage, then they become fussy and say

that they report haphazardly. So from this we can clearly see

the picture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the points raised was,

"Well,  look  at the Chinese papers. They give more coverage  to

the  Opposition Members than does the radio or T.V." As  I  have

said,  over the radio, at the most the regular news bulletin  on

the  whole proceedings of the Legislative Assembly may  take  no

more than five minutes. And that would mean perhaps no more than

300 or 400 lines. If we give the same coverage as newspapers, it

will  probably  take half an hour or even three-quarters  of  an

hour.  So  the  problem over the radio or on T.V. is  the  time

factor  -  how  to  condense  the  essentials  -  not  only  the

essentials but things of interest to the public - within  a  few

minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they have said is true, Sir, - that one of my colleagues

has  revealed  that  the Chinese newspapers are  not  under  our

control. And they took it up. Yet from time to time they keep on

saying that we control Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



newspapers.  Now at last they admit that Chinese newspapers  are

not  controlled. I think it was the Member for Thomson who  took

up  this point saying, "There you are. You see, we can get  more

space  in  Chinese  newspapers because the Government  does  not

control  them  but the radio." That is true, we do  control  the

radio  and  television. We are the Government. I ask them:  they

control  the Barisan newspaper. What is it called? The Plebeian?

No,  the  Barisan Express, which is supposed to be  running  non-stop.  Will  they publish Dr Lee Siew Choh's reply to  them  in

their  newspaper?  They  are controlling  their  newspaper  and,

therefore, they have the perfect right not to publish Dr  Lee's

reply.   And  Dr  Lee  has  been  complaining  that  they   are

undemocratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they really want to know how to catch the headlines of

the  newspapers  or  over the radio, I will  give  them  a  good

instance  of  how  to  do it. Say something  sensible,  and  say

something that catches the eye of the public. For example,  Sir,

in  today's newspapers we know that the police are still hunting

for  Indonesian infiltrators - people who come here with

hand-grenades, tommy guns and sten guns, not to kill Indonesians  but

to kill our people. If the Barisan come out tomorrow and make  a

statement  that they condemn it, then I am quite sure they  will

catch  the headlines of every newspaper. That is the way to  get

your views published in newspapers, over the radio, on T.V. and

even  over Radio Indonesia. In fact, Sir, I have looked  at  the

Monitoring Digest of 14th November. It contains a report on  the

proceedings of the debates here. There is great prominence given

to  the Barisan Sosialis. It does mention one thing that is very

interesting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Malaysia our agents report ---`.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our agents" these are the gentlemen, Sir [indicating].

Fortunately  for  them,  we  have done  them  a  favour  by  not

reproducing  this over our radio. Therefore, they  should  learn

that  newsmen are always obliging. They want a good  story,  and

they  can get a good story tomorrow if the Barisan come out  and

say they condemn the Indonesian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



infiltrators who come here with hand-grenades and tommy guns  to

kill  our people. If they say that, Sir, the newsmen will  black

out  every  other item of news, even the Budget  proceedings  in

this Assembly, and give them space.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what we have

been  talking  about  is  the  coverage  given  by  the  Chinese

newspapers,  which is quite extensive compared to  the  coverage

given  by T.V. and the radio. We do not say how many lines  T.V.

or  the radio has given or how many lines have been given in the

Press.  We  are not talking about that. We are also not  talking

about other things. What we say is that the radio and T.V. have

given  more  publicity to the speeches made  by  the  Government

side. In spite of this, the Chinese newspapers are influenced by

the  Government to a certain extent. As to the inside  story  of

this  state of affairs, I think the Minister for Culture is most

aware  and  clear  about.  After  comparing  the  difference  in

coverage  between the radio and T.V. and the Chinese newspapers,

we  can  also look to the Hansard of these proceedings and  find

that  even the Chinese newspapers are not reporting as much  and

as  accurately  as  what is reported in the Official  Report.  I

think this phenomenon can be well understood by the Minister for

Culture. He is the only person to understand what is the  reason

for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, many of our speeches made in this House were not

published in the Press. Even the Member for Jalan Kayu  and  the

Member  for  Bukit  Merah did not have many  of  their  speeches

reported.  From this I think that perhaps this has something  to

do  with the influence of the Ministry of Culture or the Special

Branch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banck-benchers on the Government side have been asking us

whether  we  will report the material supplied by Dr  Lee  Siew

Choh. What we want to say is that T.V. and the radio are run  on

public funds, and they should report fairly. We do not ask  that

our speeches be given full coverage in their P.A.P. organ.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are not prepared to give us any coverage on anything we

say,  in  other words, if they want to silence us, they  are  at

liberty  to  do so. If they wish to resort to such  action,  let

them  do  so. The Government Ministers, especially the  Minister

for   Culture,  are  wont  to  shout  about  "Communism",

"pro-Indonesia",  and so on. They criticise us and harp on  the  fact

that  we  are repeating old tunes. We have heard this  time  and

again  in  the  House. After uttering such words, the  Ministers

would  sit  down.  Their  speeches  would  then  appear  in  the

newspapers, over the radio and on T.V. As a result,  they  black

out  the  speeches made by us in this House. When they use  such

tactics, our speeches are not given a fair coverage. We are  now

faced with such a situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, following on what my

colleague, the Member for Punggol, has said, if you had allotted

the  time  in such a way that one Opposition speaker is followed

by  one on the Government side, the Opposition Members would not

have so much time to repeat the same things over and over again.

Not  every one of them would have a chance to speak, remembering

that there is a "guillotine" time for each amendment. As it  is,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, you are giving the Opposition Members  every

opportunity  to have their say, and rightly so, because  it  is

Budget time. Therefore, the Member for Jurong's reference to the

Government Back-benchers as being dumb is most unfair.  If  they

prefer  to  take turns, that is, one speaker from the Opposition

is  followed  by one from the Government side, then  they  might

like to inform you, Mr Speaker. I am sure ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member is now transgressing on

the  functions  of  the Chair. Will he get on with  the  subject

under debate?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui</b> remained in his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the P.A.P. Government controls all the media of news

reporting. They are very clear about this. The people of

Singapore know this very well. In debating the Budget today, we

have criticised the inappropriate manner in which the P.A.P.

have handled the radio and T.V. in reporting news. We are

speaking on behalf of the people. We hope that our criticism

will be adequately aired over the radio. This is our

responsibility. I can give a very simple example. One night last

week, the Member for Paya Lebar spoke during the adjournment

debate, and during an adjournment debate there should not be any

argument. The radio has transgressed the rules of this House. It

has confused the people. This mishandling by the radio is not

good. For example, there is a controversy between China and the

Soviet Union. In order to maintain their policies, the

respective countries do not allow their people to tune in to

foreign stations. We hope that the radio in Singapore will give

a fair coverage of the proceedings here. This will enable the

people to understand fully the actual situation in Singapore.

Our arguments with the P.A.P. involve issues which are connected

with the people's livelihood; for example, the issue of merger.

We want our views to be judged by the people. It is the only

correct thing for us to do. I hope that the P.A.P. will be fair

in its news reporting. The radio has not been fair at all in the

coverage of news.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has talked about the difficulties of the

commercial  Press. We have had sittings for a whole week.  There

is  not much news in the Press. We feel that the speeches reported  in  the newspapers are quite fair. But what we want is  that

all  the views expressed from this side and front the Government

side  should be aired and presented to the people. I  hope  that

the Minister will do something to improve the position. What  we

are saying here concerns the people's livelihood. If what we say

is not correct, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



it  will be judged by the people as such. There should be a fair

presentation of the views from this side of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, the Opposition has

spoken  about the allocation of radio time. In fact, we allocate

the  radio  and  T.V. time  on  the  basis  of  the  number  of

Assemblymen.  If  we are dictatorial and wish  to  suppress  the

Opposition's  views,  then we should adopt  the  principle  that

since  we  are more in number we should be given more time.  The

Prime  Minister,  the  Finance Minister  and  the  Minister  for

Culture  have  to  make important statements on  the  Indonesian

invasion and aggression, saboteurs, and so on. We should  inform

the people of this important news which is of national interest.

We  have not controlled the allocation of radio time. We  should

have  more time because we have over 30 Assemblymen on our side.

But as we are a democratic Government, we have sometimes allowed

the  Opposition  more  radio time. Just now,  the  Minister  for

Culture has mentioned the number of lines given to them over the

radio.  This  shows  that  we have given  them  much  more  time

although they are outnumbered by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the news value of their statements, they have

said  that  they  should  not  be judged  by  the  Ministers  or

Government Assemblymen. They say that they should be  judged  by

the  people. If the people had supported them, they  would  have

had more seats in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pointed out Dr Lee Siew Choh as an example. As a

member  of the Barisan Sosialis, he should have been allowed  to

put  forward  his views in his own Party organ. If there  is  no

democracy  in  the Barisan Sosialis itself, how can  the  people

expect democracy ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is not democracy of the Barisan

Sosialis that is under discussion. It is T.V. news. Let  us  get

back to T.V. news.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b> remained in his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  democracy, everyone should be free to air his views. But  in

today's debate, the Opposition have levelled only criticisms  at

the  Government. All this is quite in order. The Government will

have  to  consider and reply to the criticisms of the Opposition.

The  reply  from  every Minister responsible is a  matter  which

affects the welfare of the public. Therefore, it is only  proper

that  the  Minister's policy speeches are given wider  coverage.

The Barisan say that their speeches in this Assembly are for the

public to judge. I believe that you yourself, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

know that the Leader of the Barisan Sosialis held the record for

the longest speech made in this Assembly. He spoke for more than

seven  hours. If the speech, which lasted for seven  hours,  was

merely  to mention the weak points of the Government,  it  would

have  been  welcomed. But as a result of his speech lasting  for

over  seven  hours, the Barisan Sosialis lost in the referendum!

It  is  the policy in any country that the time given to  report

speeches  over the radio is allotted according to the number  of

candidates in the Party. If there are many Members, more time is

allowed  by the radio. The speeches of the Opposition  sometimes

make  no sense. On the other hand, every syllable uttered  by  a

Minister is a matter of policy. It is important for the  welfare

of the people.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important for the people to know exactly what

the  Government policy is. The Opposition should well understand

this point. As I have said earlier, they should be grateful that

their criticisms do get ample coverage, unlike in Indonesia  and

in Peking where the Opposition have no coverage at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to supplement my

statement  on  the News Section of the Ministry of  Culture.  By

what  criteria does the Head of the News Section decide what  is

to be reported and what is not to be reported to the people? Let

the people have full reports on what is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



said here and let them decide whether there is anything of value

or  not. The Ministry of Culture have admitted that in reporting

the  news they have the media of T.V. and radio. The purpose  of

reporting  is  to propagate the publicity work of the  Party  in

power;  they have admitted this. The speeches made by us contain

important  points with regard to certain mistakes  made  by  the

Party  in power but they are usually omitted by the Head of  the

News  Section.  I  have described just now the  attitude  to  be

adopted in reporting our speeches made here. We should know that

such  people  are getting salaries out of public funds  and  yet

they are doing work to benefit the P.A.P. which is the Party  in

power.  The Assembly does not belong to the Party in power,  and

the  radio  and  T.V. are paid from public funds.  They  do  not

belong  to the P.A.P. Since the Assembly, T.V, and radio do  not

belong to the P.A.P. as the people have to pay for them and  the

purpose  of  the  existence of the Assembly is to  exercise  the

democratic system, we say that such reporting is not in  keeping

with the spirit of democracy. Whatever the P.A.P. have said just

now  cannot  fool the people, because how we deal  with  matters

concerning  intra-party  democracy is  our  business.  What  the

Government side has said about this can only cause laughter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think they know what

exactly they want, unless by fair report, they mean just  report

Barisan speeches. Is that what they mean by fair report?  Or  as

the Member for Jurong has just suggested, report it in full.  We

start at 2.30 p.m, and finish at 8.00 p.m.; so it will take just

as  long; that is practically the whole day's T.V. programme  to

be  given over to reporting the speeches from the Assembly. That

is what I understood from the translation---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I was talking about the

News Section which deals with the reporting of our speeches. I

never mentioned that we should have reporting coverage of the

full proceedings from 2.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m., as suggested by

the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In other words, at least there should not be

full  coverage. Therefore, we must decide how much coverage  the

Assembly  proceedings should get, and out of that, how much  the

Opposition should get. So by and large, Sir, as I have said,  we

have  only  about  5 or 10 minutes, of which  probably  3  or  4

minutes are devoted to Assembly proceedings. So by and large  it

is  a  process of elimination. What is said from 2.30 p.m.to 8.30 p.m.

has to be drastically reduced to 3 or 4 minutes.  The

News  Editor  therefore decides. He has got  the  whole  report

before  him and practically 95 per cent of it must be left  out.

The  Member  for Jalan Kayu complained, "Oh, there  is  no  free

speech,  because  an adjournment speech by the Member  for  Paya

Lebar was not reported." But I can tell you. Sir, if that is the

basis,  then I say I am not getting free speech because  neither

the  Straits Times nor the Nanyang Siang Pau has today published

what I said yesterday ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I said last week that the

Member  for Paya Lebar spoke on the adjournment debate  in  this

House. Later the Minister gave his reply. Now, this is not a controversial matter and there should not be any dispute  over  it.

Radio  Singapore reported that after the Minister rebutted  what

the  Member  for Paya Lebar had said, the Member for Paya  Lebar

was  unable to give any reply to the Minister. That  is  what  I

said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is not a clarification. That is a long

speech.  As  I  have  said earlier, I can  complain  that  Radio

Singapore  has been unfair to me, or that the Nanyang Siang  Pau

and the Straits Times have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



unfair  to me, just because they left out my speech. But I  know

very  well  that they have good reasons why they cannot  get  in

everything  that is being said here. But sometimes  we  do  give

full  coverage, Sir, even for the Barisan, to the  exclusion  of

everything else. We have done it from time to time. For example,

Sir,  on  12th  September, the Barisan were  going  to  stage  a

demonstration in favour of Indonesia in Chinatown.  We  gave  it

wide publicity over the radio and on Television, saying that the

Barisan  pro-Indonesian, pro-Communist elements  were  going  to

have a demonstration ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Members on the Opposite

Bench  were  complaining  of  that. They  complained  about  the

reporting  of proceedings in the Assembly. Let us come  back  to

the reporting of proceedings in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, again let me point out the

unreasonableness of the Barisan. We can give an accurate  report

of  what went on today and make the Member look a bit silly. All

I have got to do is to ask the Head of the News Section tomorrow

to  report  his speech complaining that there is no free  speech

because  his speech is not reported. If it is reported  tomorrow

in  the  7  o'clock  news, saying that the Member  for  Tampines

complains  that there is no free speech in the Assembly  because

he is not being given adequate time over the radio, he will look

a  bit  foolish. Because then the people will say, "How  foolish

can  a man get?" He is being allowed to say and disprove himself

that  there  is  no  free speech, no fair reporting  over  Radio

Singapore because his speeches are not reported. If I  do  that,

tomorrow, next time or next year, they will complain again  that

the  Ministry of Culture has not been fair to them by  reporting

it.  So,  therefore, Sir, these are matters of judgment.  I  can

assure  them  that  I  do  not go after this  meeting  to  Radio

Singapore and sit down and tell the Head of the News Section  or

the  reporters  there what they should report of the  Opposition

speeches.  If they think it is interesting, if they  think  they

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



said something worthwhile, they will report it. But as everybody

knows, not everything that they say - in fact, Sir, in my view as

a former newspaper man, probably 95 per cent of what they say is

not  worth reporting. I know why newspapers do not give adequate

coverage  to some of the Opposition speeches. If they  do  that,

they  will lose circulation because nobody is going to read  the

tripe.  They  select, polish it up, sometimes  they  improve  on

their  speeches  and make them appear better speakers  and  more

intelligent men than they are in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are matters of judgment. You can go on arguing what

is  fair and what is accurate reporting. But, by and large,  the

people  in  the News Section are experienced newsmen. They  have

seen many politicians come and go. They know what interests  the

people  better  than the Barisan. The Barisan do not  know  what

interests  the people. The newsmen know. So if you say something

intelligent,  something catching, something  picturesque;  as  I

have  suggested  earlier, if you get up and say something  about

Indonesia,  then people will think, "Well, at last  these  chaps

are  sensible," then I am quite sure they will get adequate  and

complete  coverage over the radio, on T.V. and in the newspapers

and, probably, even over Radio Peking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Minister for

Culture  has said that had we made speeches of value,  then  the

reporters  would  have reported them and they  would  have  been

broadcast  over  the radio and on T.V., because the  journalists

know  what  news is of interest to the people. The Minister,  in

saying so, seems to argue that what we have been saying in  this

House  is  of  no interest to the people. Had that been  so,  or

whatever  we  have  said is useless, then I will  say  that  the

Government's purpose and intention underlining all the  speeches

made by the Government side is for their own interest. Is it not

to  the interests of the Party in power to report more on  their

own speeches than on ours? In fact, in the present system the

so-called  democracy is controlled by the Party in  power  and  the

selection of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



news  is  also  in accordance with such a purpose.  So  this  is

really a political issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

boasted  about this. But what kind of a journalist was  he,  and

what  newspaper  was he working for? He was a  journalist  on  a

colonial newspaper. He was a cultural worm in that newspaper,  a

cultural rogue in a colonial newspaper.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Will the Member confine his speech to the

motion before the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, to the

Minister  for Culture, everything that we say here is  valueless

and  useless,  and  that  is why it is  not  given  coverage  in

reporting.  Of course, in a colonial newspaper like the  Straits

Tunes,  we  cannot find reports of speeches of an  anti-colonial

nature. Today we have such a Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. What is being debated is "news" and not

the Straits Times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was saying that

the Minister for Culture claims to have been a journalist in the

past  and has boasted about this. He has also said that all that

we  have  said here is useless for reporting. This has something

to do with his experience as a journalist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to give my comments on the speeches made by the

Back-benchers  of  the  Government. Their speeches are  not  reported

because they are also of a useless nature. The people know today ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must inform Members of the Opposition

that  if  they  excite  a debate from the Back-benchers  of  the

Government  side, it is they who are at the losing end.  Whether

they  understand that or not, I do not know. I do not mind  that

sort of a debate. But if Opposition Members excite a debate from

the  Back-benchers, it is they who will suffer because a  number

of their amendments will then stand undebated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I was talking

about the claim made by the Minister for Culture and his attacks

on  us.  I have been defending our position, as I feel that  the

speeches made by Opposition Members have been attacked. At  this

time,  we  find  it necessary to counter his attacks  which  are

facetious.  Today  the Minister has described  our  speeches  as

useless. But, according to what we know, the people of Singapore

fully  understand that in the present day society of  Singapore,

the  speeches made by Opposition Members, whether reported  over

the  radio  or  on T.V., are severely curbed. This  is  an  open

secret.  If our speeches were useless and of no value,  then  at

least  the  Minister  need  not utter such  fierce  threats  and

exercise such suppressive control over reporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the facts that I want to mention in countering what

the Minister for Culture has said.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  I  would  like to say a few words  on  this.  Whatever

speeches that are made in this Assembly are for the good of  the

people.  Television is a good medium for the people,  especially

at  a  time when we are faced with confrontation from Indonesia.

T.V. and  radio are run by the Government, and the speeches  of

Members are given coverage over them. If the Opposition wish  to

have  a full coverage of their speeches over the radio and T.V.,

that  will take a lot of time. It will, therefore, leave  little

time  for other programmes of entertainment. If Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis make speeches that are of no  value,  then  it

will be a waste of time to give them a wide coverage. Time could

be put to better use.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the matter under

discussion  is  whether  or not the  P.A.P. has  been  fair  in

reporting our speeches made here. Just now we have been  talking

about  whether the apportionment of time is based on the  number

of  Members here or otherwise. Secondly, whether the contents as

reported  have been distorted. This interests me  most.  I  feel

that  when Radio Singapore reports our speeches, it is  entirely

distorted.  It gives the listeners an impression that Opposition

Members  are  unreasonable,  and  that  the  Ministers  are  all

justified in making their speeches, and sound in their reasoning

too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give an example. On the 13th of this month when we were

debating  the Budget, I said that in dealing with the matter  of

land  the Government had taken action to reclaim a certain piece

of  land  from the sand quarry operators and had also  mentioned

the farmers affected. The report that came over the radio was to

the  effect  that - I heard it in the Amoy language -  when  the

Minister  asked  the Member for Bukit Panjang to  give  specific

examples,  the  Member was unable to give any. In  fact,  I  had

given  all the necessary facts in detail. On the previous  day's

debate,  the Minister for National Development asked me to  give

specific examples on a certain matter, and I did so. Yet in  the

report  over the radio, there was no mention of it. If they  are

to  continue with this way of reporting, then I suggest that  no

report should be given at all of the proceedings here.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Opposition  Members are very clever in talking about  television

and  the  radio. Generally, the radio and T.V. are entertainment

media for the public. If that is the case, we cannot allow it to

be  used  specially  for the Barisan Sosialis.  The  public  are

paying  $12 and $24 licence fees. But what the Barisan  Sosialis

want  is that publicity should be given to them. If we do  that,

the Government will be in difficulties. The radio and television

are for the public, and not for the Barisan Sosialis. Therefore,

we cannot accept their suggestion. We have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



let  the  people  know what is going on, and that  is  what  the

P.A.P.  Government  is  doing.  But  the  Barisan  Members   are

repeatedly talking about these things, and I ask them to  put  a

stop to such nonsense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4)* standing in the names of Mr

Lim Huan Boon and Mr Koo Young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be reduced by $10 in

respect of subhead 2053.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government, in carrying out any

cultural  programmes or schemes, is unilateral in its  approach.

It  is  not  willing to listen to the views of  those  who  have

experience  and  who  differ  from  them.  Therefore,  this  has

resulted  in  schemes  being a flop or having  only  superficial

success.  Such an attitude of the Government means  a  waste  of

public money. It does not help the propagation or interfusion of

culture.

Mr Speaker, I would like to cite an example of the Dewan Bahasa

Dan  Kebudayaan  Kebangsaan. This organ is  very  attractive  in

name.  Judging  by  its  name, the Dewan Bahasa  Dan  Kebudayaan

Kebangsaan, this Institute is to guide the nation's culture  and

language  in a healthy direction so as to enable them to  spread

widely  and  flourish and to enable research on them  to  be  encouraged and fully promoted.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in any country, such an Institute has a very heavy

responsibility  to  discharge  and  a  very  important  task  to

perform.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we regret to  say  that  the  Dewan

Bahasa Dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan has not properly shouldered its

responsibility.  It  is only a cultural  ornament  for  the  Government.  It is a sort of cultural ornament which is rather  out

of  date. Originally it was in a big show-case. But now  it  has

been shifted to a small show-case. It has been shifted from  the

library to a small room in the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



of  Culture.  Ever since the inception of the Dewan  Bahasa  Dan

Kebudayaan  Kebangsaan  more than three years  ago,  the  yearly

estimate of expenditure provided for this Institute is, if I  am

not  mistaken,  about $610,000. For example, the  sum  spent  on

research,  on the Director, on publications and other items,  is

about  $296,000. Mr Speaker, Sir, this sum of money may not  be

very  big.  But the question is, after spending this  amount  of

money,  have any real results been achieved so far? I  hope  the

Minister for Culture will give this House a satisfactory  reply.

On this issue, there are suspicions in the Press and the public.

For  example,  in the Berita Harian of the 12th of  this  month,

there  is an article by "Irama" which criticised this Institute.

I  will  now  translate this article into Chinese.  The  article

runs:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Unfortunately nobody knows what this organ has done up to the

present  time.  The officers responsible have  been  moved  into

another office.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the research and publications by the Dewan

Bahasa  Dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan are deplorable. For  the  past

three  years, apart from publishing two or three reference books

on the customs and the history of the Malays, this Institute has

only  published  booklets  on Malay conversations  and  booklets

about the public entrance examination for Standard I Malay. Such

publications  are  plentiful on the market.  They  are  of  many

kinds. Therefore, I feel this Institute should not publish  such

publications. It should publish more important books which  will

give guidance to our culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publications should meet the tastes of the readers. The

teaching of language should meet the various objectives  of  the

people. There is a direct method and an indirect method  in  the

teaching  of  a  language. The former  method  is  suitable  for

children  and  for those who live in such language surroundings.

The second method is suitable for adults, and for those who make

use  of the language as a second language. Mr Speaker. Sir,  in

order  to  popularise  Malay  we  must  study  such  conditions.

Otherwise no results will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



achieved. In some of the advanced countries English is taught as

a  second language. Many scholars have written books on  methods

of  teaching from their own experience. They have based them  on

their  own research. Books written according to those principles

are easy to learn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this Institute is going to popularise

Malay and Malay culture, it should imitate and study the methods

of teaching languages from these advanced countries. They should

do  more research into the methods of teaching Malay, Tamil  and

Chinese so as to develop them into a special field of knowledge.

They should publish books adopting these modern principles so as

to meet the demands of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the vote provided for the Dewan

Bahasa Dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan, it seems that our Minister  is

not  going to carry out his duties. There is a reduction in  the

vote.  We  can see very clearly that in 1964 the money  provided

for this Institute was $140,000. But next year the provision  is

only $36,000. If the Ministry of Culture wants to carry out  its

work properly, it will not achieve anything if it can only spend

such  an amount of money. If they like, they should do away with

this  sort  of cultural ornament and not waste any more  of  the

public funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am more and more convinced

that  the Member is a reasonable man. First, some of the  things

he  has  to  say about the Dewan are quite valid, especially  in

regard  to  the  teaching  of  the national  language.  This  is

probably  because he is something of a student of  the  national

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem about the Dewan is this, Sir. With the advent of

Malaysia, we had to decide whether there should be two  Dewans,

one  a  very elaborate one which has been in existence  for  the

best part of 8 or 9 years in Kuala Lumpur, and whether our Dewan

should  duplicate those functions. Or should we decide, in  view

of Malaysia

-  and  I  hope, Sir, this time they will not use this and  say,

"There you are.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia has brought about further disasters for us!" It is  not

disaster,  Sir. We have decided that with Malaysia we  can  save

some  money  and  use the $100,000 that we have  saved  to  more

effect.  The  immediate  problem, as  we  see  it,  Sir,  is  to

inculcate in our people, especially the non-Malay adults, a knowledge of the national language. Therefore, the functions of  the

Dewan should not be to surpass the Dewan in Kuala Lumpur. We aim

for  a  more  modest  objective of trying to get  the  non-Malay

adults  to learn the national language as soon as possible.  For

this  reason,  the provision for next year has been considerably

reduced. In fact, the staff ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon:</b> Only one editor left!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> There is one research officer, one editor, a

typist  and a clerical officer. Their job now is to try to  help

to  propagate the national language over the radio, on T.V. and

in  their publications. I hope that this will be accepted  as  a

very reasonable decision. It is no use our spending money to  do

something which Kuala Lumpur is already doing and is experienced

in doing. That is the reason why the provision for next year has

been reduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for Culture has just given a reply to the Assembly. I would like

to  ask a question. Since there is an Institute of Language  and

Culture  in Kuala Lumpur, and also since several projects  which

had  been  launched  have  to  be  removed  from  the  Singapore

Institute  to  the Kuala Lumpur Institute, I wonder  whether  we

should  still spend over $30,000 to support this Institute.  Why

should we not close down this Institute? We can make use of  the

money for some other fields of cultural activities.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I do not quite understand the Member for

Bukit Merah. Earlier on in his speech, he said how we should try

and propagate the national language. Now he says, "Let us not do

it. Let Kuala Lumpur do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



it."  I  am assuming that he is all in favour of our making  our

own  effort  to  propagate the study of the  national  language.

Therefore, the functions of the Dewan have correspondingly to be

reorientated.  It  is  not  spending  thousands  of  dollars  in

research. I think the provision is a thousand dollars  for  next

year,  mainly on research in regard to how to better  teach  the

national  language, especially through the medium of T.V. which

we think is a very effective and powerful medium for propagating

the  national language. The fact is that there is a Dewan  which

publishes textbooks and so on, and therefore we agree that there

is  no need for us to enter the book publishing business because

Kuala  Lumpur can do it better. They have got all the resources.

So,  because  of this, we have decided to reduce the  staff  and

change our objectives to a simple, immediate and more useful one

of popularising the national language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one Assembly sitting last year the Party in power amended

the  Registration  of  Societies Ordinance.  At  that  time,  we

pointed  out  that their motive was to suppress those  societies

which were not supporting P.A.P policy. After



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



only  a  few  months  the  P.A.P. used  this  amendment  in  the

Ordinance to victimise old boys' associations. Over 30 old boys'

associations  have existed for a very long time, over  8  or  10

years.  But  in the last few months, they have been notified  by

the  Registrar  of Societies to alter their regulations  or  constitutions.  This  is  the  so-called democracy  by  the  P.A.P.

Government. They do not even respect the right of members of the

old  boys'  associations. They notified them by order  to  alter

their constitutions, not allowing them to express their opinions

as  to  whether they agree or do not agree. They say if they  do

not  agree,  the organisations will be banned. This  is  a  very

serious matter. This will make the P.A.P. democracy a farce.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> I will say a few

words, Mr Speaker, in answer to the Member for Thomson.  It  is

not  true  when he said only 36 old boys' associations  received

notice  from  the Registrar of Societies asking  them  to  amend

their  constitutions. There are altogether in Singapore  54  old

boys'  associations.  All  of them  were  given  notice  by  the

Registrar  to  amend  their constitutions according  to  certain

requirements in the law, which was amended, as mentioned by  the

Member  for  Thomson, last year. One of the reasons  for  making

amendments  to  the  Ordinance concerning  the  registration  of

societies  is  to  assist them in maintaining public  peace  and

helping them to run their societies according to the objects  as

stated in the constitutions of the associations. Every organiser

of  a  society,  whether it be an O.B.A. or a  musical  society,

knows   very   well  that  before  the  society   is   permitted

registration, it has to satisfy the Registrar of Societies  with

regard to certain requirements and has got to state very clearly

the   objectives  of  the  organisation.  Now,  an   old   boys'

association,  or any social organisation, obviously  will  cater

for  the  interests and welfare of its members. But in our  past

experience, old boys' associations, or at least some  old  boys'

associations,  are  not as simple as they would  appear  to  be.

Brass  gong societies do not only beat brass gongs, but they  do

something more damaging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



than just creating a lot of noise. Old boys' associations do not

only  meet once a year to take their annual dinner, but they  go

out taking part in political activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if any association wishes to participate in the political

affairs of the State, then it is very obvious that such  a  body

must  register itself quite separately as a political Party  and

not  pretend that it is an association catering merely  for  old

boys.  It  has come to our knowledge that some of these  O.B.A.s

have   shamelessly  acted  as  front  organisations.  They  have

agitated  against conversion of the educational  system  in  the

Chinese  stream.  Some of them, too, took part  in  calling  for

blank  votes in the referendum campaign organised by the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see very well indeed why the Member for Thomson expresses

anxiety  that these O.B.A.s have been asked to conform  so  that

they  will adhere solely to the objectives of their associations

as  stated  when they applied for registration.  Some  of  these

O.B.A.s admit as members students in schools. Students who  have

not  even passed out and could barely claim themselves to be old

boys,  are  already  members of old boys'  associations.  It  is

through these members of theirs that the O.B.A.s seek to  extend

their  influence  into the schools, or, for  that  matter,  into

institutions  of  higher learning. It is not  our  intention  to

suppress  any  association  if it is organised  solely  for  the

objectives  for  which  the  association  was  registered.   But

certainly  we cannot pretend to allow any organisation  to  wear

false  colours, as it were, to hang up a sheep's head  and  sell

dog's  meat. That is a little Chinese saying, Mr Speaker.  That

is  what some of the old boys' associations have been doing. The

amendment  to  the  Societies  Ordinance  made  last  year   was

necessary,  and,  in  accordance  with  it,  the  Registrar   of

Societies  has acted. I am glad to say, Mr Speaker,  that  from

our knowledge, quite a number of the old boys' associations have

agreed to make the necessary adjustments to their constitutions.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before the tea-break, we were on Head 0901

- Ministry of Social Affairs; amendment (1). I think Mr Chia Thye

Poh was waiting for a chance to speak. Mr Chia Thye Poh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, my colleague just

now  has  mentioned that the Registrar of Societies has  ordered

some  old  boys'  associations to make  some  changes  to  their

constitutions.   The  purpose  obviously  is   to   curb   their

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Deputy Prime Minister said that the constitutions

of  certain old boys' associations are out of date and that they

should  be amended to meet the present situation. The amendments

sought  will  not  only curtail the rights  and  powers  of  the

Central  Executive Committees of the old boys' associations  but

also  affect  the  exercise of their rights in some  activities,

such  as  inviting members of the public to take part in certain

social  activities. The amendments to the constitutions  of  the

old  boys'  associations will affect the powers  of  these  associations as well as those of the higher institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to say that the amendments sought by the

Government will curb the exercise of the powers of the old boys'

associations  and that what the Deputy Prime Minister  has  said

is,  in  fact, to hide the real intention of the Government.  In

fact,  the  constitutions  of the old  boys'  associations  have

proved  to  be good and they have been in force for many  years.

Some  of these associations have existed for 20 to 30 years  and

their constitutions have proved to be useful, without being  out

of date. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



activities  of the associations have been praised by educational

circles.  At  the present juncture, the activities  of  the  old

boys'  associations have been directed towards the promotion  of

healthy  educational and cultural activities, such  as  concerts

and  shows which are partly for the amusement of their  members.

These concerts and shows have usually been staged openly and  as

far  as  their contents and techniques are concerned, they  have

won  the  praise  of members of the public. Such activities  are

actually  of  value and use to society. We cannot  see  anything

that is detrimental to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to make is that the activities of these

old  boys' associations can help in the matter of education. For

instance,  when  certain  schools find themselves  in  financial

difficulties and are in need of public donations, the old  boys'

associations launch a campaign for donations from the public  to

help  these  schools.  In  this way, the  "mother"  schools  are

greatly  assisted. This also helps the growth and  promotion  of

education in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also seen certain members of the old boys' associations

becoming  teachers or even directors on the board of  management

of  their  "mother" schools, and thus being  of  great  use  and

service  to education. Therefore, I just cannot see the validity

of the Deputy Prime Minister's contention that the activities of

these  old  boys'  associations have been  deterimental  to  the

interests of society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that these associations have issued statements

on  political matters. In this respect, I say that it  is  their

right  to  express what they think will be in  the  interest  of

Singapore. It is not only the right but also the duty  of  every

responsible   citizen  of  Singapore  to  express  such   views.

Moreover, the statements made by the associations have not  been

irresponsible.  It  is not right to say that these  associations

should not express their opinions on important matters of State,

because  organisations and educational bodies under the  control

of  the  P.A.P. have also made statements on political  matters.

Educational and cultural bodies of the P.A.P. have issued



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



statements expressing their views on political matters. So it is

unfair  for the Deputy Prime Minister to accuse these old  boys'

associations of such action. Unless the P.A.P.'s intention is to

suppress all freedom of expression, I do not see anything  wrong

with  members  of  the old boys' associations  expressing  their

rights as citizens of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Deputy Prime Minister has also described the

associations  as  putting up heads of sheep  and  selling  dog's

meat.  But  I  say that the P.A.P. is burning a big  fire  while

prohibiting  other people from lighting lamps. I also  say  that

the  amendments  sought to the constitutions of  the  old  boys'

associations  will  not  help in resolving  the  matter.  It  is

intended  that old boys who want to join higher institutions  of

learning  should  not be allowed to become members  of  the  old

boys'   associations.  By  doing  this,  the   Government   will

undoubtedly  be curbing their activities. These  old  boys  have

every  right to join the old boys' associations since they  have

graduated  from  those  schools.  The  authorities  should  not,

therefore,  try to deprive them of their right  to  join  up  as

members of the old boys' associations. If the Government were to

issue orders to the effect that former students should not  join

the  old  boys'  associations, I would say that this  is  not  a

matter  within the power of the Registrar of Societies,  because

there  are parents to look after their children. In fact,  there

are  parents  who  are  proud and happy to  see  their  children

joining  the  old boys' associations, because these associations

can give them plenty of help. For instance, I know that some old

boys'  associations conduct classes to teach the  more  backward

students,  thus  providing  a great  service  to  the  students.

Therefore,  I  feel that there is nothing wrong  in  the  pupils

joining the old boys' associations. There are even people in the

P.A.P. taking part in the P.A.P. activities, and some old  boys

of  the P.A.P. group are also invited to take part in the P.A.P.

activities. So, why should the Government now accuse  others  of

joining old boys' associations, when the P.A.P. themselves carry

out  such  activities?  There have been  such  activities  where

P.A.P. members have become members of old boys' associations. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



therefore say that the Government should not abuse its powers by

curbing the old boys' associations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it now

seems  that  the Opposition Member is very clever in  distorting

the facts. I want to rebut every point that he has raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the name "old boys' association" we know what such an

association  is  meant for. If we were to  change  the  name  to

"students/old  boys' association", according  to  what  was  suggested  by the Member for Jurong, then students will be  allowed

to  join the association as well. But, in actual fact, according

to  the  present  name, such an association is  only  meant  for

students who have already left school. That is why it is  called

old  boys'  association, because it is not  meant  for  students

attending school.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding what the association is meant for, we can

understand why the Government is asking for changes to  be  made

in the constitutions of the old boys' associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four points. First, all those students who had in the

past  been  studying in one particular school can join  the  old

boys'  association of that school. Students who left the  school

before  completing their studies in that school cannot join  the

old boys' association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, old boys' associations should not be used for

political  purposes. The P.A.P. Government does not  oppose  the

establishment  of  political Parties. Neither  does  the  P.A.P.

Government fear political argument. If they want to  set  up  an

old  boys' association, then its activities should be within the

purview  and  constitution  of the  association  and  not  those

touching on political matters. So we are of the opinion that old

boys' associations should not indulge in political activities or

be made use of by political Parties for political purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the funds of the old boys' association, the Barisan

Sosialis  and  their united front want to use such  funds  under

cover of the name of donations to help the Communist Front in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



its  activities. The Government is aware that association  funds

have  been  misused for political purposes and would advise  old

boys'  associations  not to use such money for  activities,  but

should use the money within the confines of the constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, statements issued by the old boys' associations

should  be approved by the supervisory committee or the  central

committee of the associations concerned. We stress on  this.  We

do  not  say  that  it  should be passed by the  P.A.P.  Central

Committee.  It  should be passed by the committee  of  that  particular  association. In the past, we have seen many  statements

issued in the names of certain associations without their  being

properly approved by the associations. They were merely  chopped

with  the  association's stamp. We know  that  every  old  boys'

association  has its own stamp and it is not possible  to  affix

its chop on to one particular statement. There have been over 30

chops  affixed to a statement of a political nature in the past.

So  I  hope that the stamps of the old boys' associations should

not  be  made use of by certain irresponsible people. Therefore,

we  say  that  before any statement is issued by any  old  boys'

association, it should be properly approved by the committee responsible.  After it has been approved by the committee,  it  can

then be published. So far, some old boys' associations have been

quite irresponsible in issuing statements ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, last year during the debate on the

Estimates  there was a fire. If I remember correctly,  the  fire

occurred  one day after Deepavali. It seems a coincidence,  when

we are debating the Estimates this year, that there should be  a

fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire at Pulau Minyak, in Lorong 1, deprived 1,000 people of

their  homes. When we were debating on the subject of  the  Fire

Brigade  last year I suggested that the Government should  think

of  ways  and  means to prevent outbreaks of  fire.  Every  year

hundreds  of attap houses go up in flames. These houses happened

to  be in areas under eviction orders. This is a coincidence. If

this is arranged by God, we would rather say that it is arranged

by  the  P.A.P.  Last  year  I requested  the  Minister  to  pay

attention to this matter. I requested him to help the people  in

areas with many attap houses against fire. Only people living in

villages  can prevent outbreaks of fires, if we rely  on  P.A.P.

members to fight fires, I believe more fires will occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lorong 1 the fire victims did not receive the same benefits

that  were obtained by the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims.  I  know,

when  I mention these things, what the reply is going to  be.  I

know  they are going to say that they give free housing. I  know

that the fire victims are being moved to Housing and Development

Board  flats. They were also given $35 per family.  I  know  all

this.  But  this  is not an honourable thing. I know  that  many

Housing  Board  flats  are empty and yet the  P.A.P. are  still

building them. These flats are built to prepare for the victims.

Most of the victims had their own houses. They were required  to

pay  only $5 per month. But now they are made to pay more.  This

would give more revenue to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  That  is why the P.A.P. is happy in doing these  things.

The  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social  Affairs

said  they were going to give milk, etc. and some money  to  the

victims,  saying  that every victim could get  $10  -  $5  being

donated  by  the Relief Committee and $5 by the Lee  Foundation.

The  money collected by the Relief Committee was collected  from

the  public  during  the  Bukit Ho  Swee  fire.  This  time  the

Government  could not appeal to the people to  donate  money  as

before,  because the people have already lost interest  in  what

the  P.A.P. is doing. Therefore, the P.A.P. has to make  use  of

money  collected before. Victims of the Bukit Ho Swee fire  have

complained  that  shoes donated for the victims  have  not  been

given  to them. They have also complained that the money donated

to  them  has not been distributed to them in full. And now  the

Government is using this money for the victims of this fire. The

indications are that many more houses will he burnt in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, another matter I would like to stress

is  that  these  victims should be looked after  properly.  Some

victims were running provision stores before the fire. I know no

insurance  company would insure attap houses. When these  houses

go  up in flames, the occupiers lose everything. They can hardly

open  another shop to earn a living. It is not possible to  open

shops  in Housing and Development Board shops because the  rents

are so high. In the past, they paid a rent of $10 or so, but  in

the  Housing  and Development Board shops, the high  rent  is  a

great  problem.  They  have to pay  a  rent  of  $300  or  more.

Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should pay more attention

to  this  problem. He must also pay more attention to  the  fire

victims  and  appeal to the public to help the victims  and  not

rely on the Government alone.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe

that there is no one smarter than the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



in distorting facts. According to what the hon. Member has said,

it  seems that the P.A.P. started the fire. However, the victims

knew  that  it  was  caused by some careless people.  There  was

evidence   to  prove  this.  What  the  Barisan   say   is   not

substantiated.  Whatever  we say or  do,  we  have  evidence  to

support us. The Government is happy to receive criticisms and it

will help the people to improve their lot. But we are faced with

difficulties   because   the   Barisan   criticisms   are    not

constructive.  It  would appear that the  Barisan  Sosialis  are

mewing for dead rats. They say that they are sympathetic to  the

fire  victims. I myself, after the fire, went round to see  the

victims.  At that time, the House was in session and  the  Prime

Minister  went  there  too. The Minister for  Health  also  went

there.  They went there to pacify the victims. They  asked  that

relief work should be started immediately to help the victims to

rebuild their homes again. It is not our intention just to  come

here  to say some good words in order to win their votes in  the

next election. We do not want to add oil to the fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of time, I am unable to reply to the hon. Member's

questions point by point. The Barisan do not debate on principle

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member says that our flats are too expensive. The

Government let the victims stay in Housing Board flats,  and  we

give them an allowance of $7.00 per person, subject to a maximum

of  $35.00 per family, and a subsidy of three months'  rent.  If

anyone  can  say that the Government is not helping the  people,

then  I  say that in the whole of South-East Asia, or  for  that

matter  even in the whole world, there is no such Government  as

ours.  Can  one point out any country in South-East  Asia  which

gives  such generous allowances to the victims? Of course,  this

is  so in Indonesia! In Indonesia, if your house is destroyed by

fire, the authorities will ask you to eat rats!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Fire Brigade, I am the adviser to the Fire Brigade.

If  I  cannot do the work properly, they will not want me. There

are  in Singapore 51 fire brigades with good fire-fighting equip

ment. If there is a fire in any place,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



the  fire  brigade teams go there to help the people  fight  it.

These  are  facts  which we cannot refute.  If  you  go  to  any

village,  you  will  see  such arrangements.  I  ask  Opposition

Members to give me facts to prove otherwise. They are unable  to

substantiate what they say. What they say is just nonsense. They

blame  the radio for not broadcasting their speeches made  here.

In  every  village, there are 71 fire-fighters. For example,  in

Toa Payoh, every one can see that there are fire-fighting teams.

If  the  Barisan  say  that the P.A.P. is not  working  for  the

people, then what are they talking about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the hon. Member says that it is very

strange that fires usually break out in places where the  people

are  faced  with eviction orders. He even says that  the  P.A.P.

helped  to cause the fire. Such utterances are irresponsible.  I

have  just  rebutted  that by saying that some  careless  people

caused  it.  There were witnesses to substantiate that.  We  can

prove that the Barisan Sosialis have been spreading rumours  and

distorting facts to the villagers to make them misunderstand the

Government.  The reporters at the scene of the fire can  testify

that  we asked the fire victims whether they would like to  move

to Tanjong Rhu, and most of them say that they would, because it

is  a  very cool place. The present accommodation is better than

their  former accommodation. When they were speaking, they  were

smiling. The Barisan did not think of the people when they  were

speaking.  They were just speaking to the audience  outside  the

House. I believe they would be happier when there are more  fire

victims. We moved these people to Tanjong Rhu, to better houses,

and  gave them $10 per person, so as to restore their confidence

and to enable them to live as ordinary people. This is a task of

the  Government and we are doing it. We are not playing politics

when  we do this. We do not have to do propaganda work. We  know

that  they  went  there and said that they were members  of  the

Barisan. When they opened their mouths, they mentioned they were

members of the Barisan. They did not go there to work. They went

there and told the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



people  they represented the Barisan. If they really  cared  for

the  people, they would have taken out some money to help  them.

We  did not receive any donations from them. These victims would

be  happy to receive donations. But the Barisan did not give any

donations. They did not say they were sympathetic and that  they

would  give  their $500 allowance to them. They  only  paid  lip

service.  Did  they go to the scene to console the victims?  No,

they did not. Yet in this House ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Social Welfare Department in

Singapore,  I  believe, is quite busy at present,  because  this

Department  is  one which reflects the ills of society.  If  its

work  is getting heavier and heavier, then, relatively speaking,

there  are more and more people receiving aid from it  and  more

and  more  people  are suffering from misery. That  means  after

Malaysia  there are more and more people who require  help  from

the  Government  and the Social Welfare Department.  The  P.A.P.

Government cannot boast that it is able to help many  people  in

Singapore. In fact, the P.A.P. should be ashamed of itself.  All

over the world, under enlightened leadership, governments try to

prevent  the occurrence of misery and suffering in society.  But

the  P.A.P. does not belong to this category of government.  The

P.A.P. will try to create misery and suffering and then try  to

show that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



as  merciful as the Goddess of Mercy by helping them, so that it

can  tell the world how it helps the poor people in society  for

their publicity purpose. They do not have the courage to mention

the  cause of misery in general. I can give you some facts.  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, to illustrate my point. For example, the Social

Welfare Department does not say what type of people are eligible

for  aid  and how these people are eligible for it. I have  some

facts  to show you. One, the P.A.P. Government is wasting public

funds  by employing the police to arrest people so that  members

of their families will be rendered helpless, and their source of

financial  income  cut off. As a result of the  arrest  of  some

breadwinners,  a lot of people have to go to the Social  Welfare

Department.  This  accounts for a part of the  people  receiving

relief from the Social Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Demolition Squad is responsible for

this.  They  abused  the  law and pulled  down  the  houses  and

hawkers'   stalls  of  the  poor  people  without   paying   any

compensation.  This happened in Choa Chu Kang  and  it  is  well

known to the people that this is due to the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawker stalls are pulled down in Aljunied Road, in Queenstown,

and  this is a common sight. This action against the poor people

forces them to go to the Social Welfare Department for aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, more serious still, is the question of racial

disturbances.  Some people lost their lives  during  the  recent

disturbances, thereby rendering the members of their family helpless. They have to go to the Social Welfare Department for help.

The  Government should be held responsible for the loss of  such

lives.  Instead, it takes pride in being able  to  give  aid  to

members  of  the unfortunate families. That is why I  have  said

earlier  that the P.A.P. tries to create misery, and then  tries

to help the people afflicted and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



takes  pride  in  it.  All the present  misery  is  due  to  the

formation of Malaysia, in short.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring out is that all the facts that I

have mentioned show that there are more people in Singapore  who

require relief, but, on the contrary, we can see that the relief

by  the Social Welfare Department has been cut down. Some people

have had their allowances cut down or completely stopped. I have

been  informed by a Parliamentary Secretary in this  House  that

some  1,100-odd persons have had their relief stopped, and 1,280

cases  have  had  their relief reduced. This is  very  puzzling,

because, on the one hand, we have more and more people requiring

aid,  and,  on the other hand, the Social Welfare Department  is

cutting down on the allowances drawn by these people. The reason

given  is  that  some recipients do not make accurate  and  true

reports of their financial circumstances. But how can we account

for  the  great number of such cases? Another point is concerned

with the stoppage and reduction of relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see from the newspapers that the Prime Minister said on

the  14th of this month that more and more beggars are appearing

in  Singapore.  Some beggars come from hundreds of  miles  away.

That  is  what  the  Prime Minister said. This  shows  that  the

economy of Singapore is going to the dogs, so that more and more

beggars  are appearing in our streets. There are some  who  come

from  the Federation. I cannot imagine that Singapore has become

a  paradise to beggars so that beggars from other territories in

Malaysia are attracted to our place. The so-called New  York  of

Malaysia is the collecting centre of beggars! In the Federation,

the position is quite different. So the beggars have to come  to

Singapore. But this is a problem which concerns Singapore and we

have  to give our attention to it. The Prime Minister says  that

some of the beggars are from the Federation. I think he is right

by  half  of  what he says. I believe that most of  the  beggars

actually suffer ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I will try

to  finish as soon as possible. There is one other point I  must

bring up in this House. On the 14th December last year, when  we

were debating this item, I asked the Minister for Social Affairs

to  pay  attention  to  the inmates of a certain  temple  in  my

constituency,  but  so far more than one year  has  lapsed,  and

nothing  has  been  done.  I wrote to the  Minister  for  Social

Affairs  on the 19th June this year, but so far I have  received

no  reply.  On  the other hand, the Government  claim  they  are

sincere  in  wishing to relieve the people. But the  question  I

have brought up over a year ago is still not being attended  to.

This  shows  that  they are only concerned  with  publicity  and

propaganda  when  they  do  relief work.  When  relief  work  is

required to be done without any publicity, they would not care.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if I were to give the

House statistics of the amounts of public assistance which  have

been  given  out  by the Social Welfare Department,  the  public

would  be  in a better position to understand how much care  and

concern the Government has for those who are unemployed and  for

those whose families have suffered hardship either on account of

some  persons being disabled or the breadwinner of the household

being  detained  under  the Criminal Law (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance. In 1961 public assistance was $7.21 million; in 1962,

$4.49  million; in 1963, $9.72 million; in 1964, $9.40  million;

for  1965  we are asking in this Budget sitting $10 million.  It

can  be  seen that year by year the sum which has been allocated

for  public assistance is increasing, not diminishing.  For  the

sums  given  to  patients who have been receiving  treatment  on

account of tuberculosis, the figures are as follows: 1961, $1.89

million;  1962, $2.14 million; 1963, $1.88 million; 1964,  $2.20

million, and 1965, $1.90 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may ask the Member for Bukit Panjang. "Which country in Asia

doles out so much assistance per capita?" Let the Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis remember that somebody has got to pay  towards

the  contributions  for  public assistance, it  is  the  public

eventually who have got to stump out the money which is given to

assist  those  persons who are suffering from hardship.  And  as

caretakers  of  the  public  money, it  is  necessary  that  the

Government  should  see to it that the sum  of  money  which  is

devoted to public assistance is carefully spent. In fact,  after

the  PAP. Government assumed office in 1959, the rate of  public

assistance  allowance to the heads of households  was  increased

from  $15 to $16 per month; and to the wife from $8 to  $10  per

month.  In  January  1962  the rate  of  allowance  was  further

increased  for  the head of the household from $16  to  $21  per

month.  Now it has also come to our attention that a  number  of

recipients of public assistance do not fairly report changes  in

their  financial circumstances. It has been found that a  number

of  these  recipients  tend to conceal their  other  sources  of

income,  for  example, income derived from part-time employment,

hawking, or piece-rate earnings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure in respect of education for next year amounts

to  some $107 million. This occupies approximately one-third  of

the entire expenditure of the Government for next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  the Party in power takes pride in saying that  their

education policy is the most progressive policy in the whole  of

South-East Asia. As a matter of fact, I am afraid that this  old

refrain  makes  one fed up. As far back as last year,  when  the

education  policy of the Government came under  debate  in  this

House,  I drew the attention of the House to the defects of  the

education  policy  of  the Government.  However,  one  year  has

passed,  and  the Ministry of Education has taken  no  steps  to

remove  the  defects.  On the contrary, they  still  persist  in

implementing the wrong policy in education, which is to continue

the whole colonial educational structure. Mr Deputy Speaker, in

the  past few years, one must note that the expenditure  on  education has been around $100 million. This is quite a big sum.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that this money comes from the taxpayers by

way  of  revenue paid to the Government and that  the  taxpayers

have the right to hope that the Government will make proper  use

of  this  money so that our younger generation may  be  educated

properly  and  trained  to  shoulder their  responsibilities  as

citizens  when  they grow up. But what are the  facts?  Has  the

Minister  for  Education made good use of the hard-earned  money

given  by  the taxpayers? No, he has wasted it. I wish  to  give

some illustrations to explain this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the Ministry of Education is spending some

$107  million  on  education. A part of it is to  pay  for  free

primary education, but while, on the one hand, the Government is

paying  so  much  for  free education, on the  other  hand,  the

students who have received six years of primary education mostly

fail  the  Primary School Leaving Examination. We  can  see  the

number  of  failures during the past three years or  so.  Almost

every  year,  some  40  per cent of all the  students  fail  the

examination.  As a result, they have to leave school.  Can  they

then get any job? No, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



they  are  too  young to take up employment.  Can  they  go  for

further  studies? No, because they have not passed  the  Primary

School Leaving Examination. So the only thing for them to do  is

to  roam about the streets and do nothing. Finally, they end up,

under  the  leadership of our Minister for Culture, as  yankees,

hooligans and, even worse still, as members of secret societies.

These  yankees  wear  trousers similar  to  those  worn  by  the

Minister  for Culture. As a result, crime is on the increase.  A

lot  of the taxpayers' money is spent on educating them but they

do  not  reap  any benefit. So the money is wasted. Furthermore,

the  taxpayers have to pay more money for the maintenance of the

courts, the reformative training centres and even the prisons to

accommodate these misled students. As a result, there has been a

double  wastage  of public funds. Perhaps the Minister  for  Education  may say that this state of affairs is inevitable because

these unsuccessful students are unable to further their studies,

as they are stupid, useless and good for nothing.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what can one do about it? In my opinion, if the P.A.P.

Government  gives up the idea of monopolising  education  as  an

enterprise,  particularly if it stops suppressing  educationists

and  inducing some of the people in educational circles to serve

its  interests,  then  the educational workers  will  have  more

confidence  in their work and a greater sense of responsibility,

and  they will carry out their duties more efficiently. If  this

happens,  then  the whole situation will change. If  educational

circles  are not respected by the Government and are treated  by

them  as tools, then they will not have any confidence in  their

work.   They   will  not,  under  suppression,  oppression   and

humiliation, contribute their share to society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the results of the students, whether good or bad,

mainly  depend on the teachers. I will give you an  illustration

of this point. When the results



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



of the public examination are announced, one will notice that in

some  schools the percentage of passes is as high as 90 per cent

or  even  100 per cent, but it is sad to say that the percentage

of  passes in some schools is only 20 to 30. Why should there be

such a great difference? Why is it that some schools are able to

score one hundred per cent passes while others can only score 20

to  30 per cent passes? Why should this be so? Does it mean that

some  schools  have  students  who  are  extremely  intelligent,

whereas  other schools have students who are stupid? Of  course,

the  answer  is in the negative. So the undeniable  facts  prove

that  the  students  can improve and get better  results.  As  a

result  of improvement, less students will fail, and we  do  not

have  to  turn  a lot of them away from school and waste  public

funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are many parents, students and even teachers

who  are  beginning  to suspect that it is  the  policy  of  the

Government to eliminate the students on a large scale by holding

a public examination which is not intended to measure the merits

and  standard of study of the students. So I urge the Government

to  review  the present system - or better still, to abolish  it

entirely.  Perhaps in order to improve these students'  results,

another question arises and this brings us to the second  point.

That is, if there were only some 60 per cent of students passing

from  the public examination and this figure is raised to  more,

say,  70  or 80 per cent, then there would not be enough schools

to  accommodate them when the greater number of passes go on  to

further studies. As a result, if we are to build more schools to

accommodate the extra passes, then the Minister for  Finance  or

the  Minister for Education may say, "Since we are spending some

$100  million on education, if we allow more students  to  pass,

does it not mean that we have to spend more money on education?"

The Government will say it is not in a position to shoulder such

a  burden. But I would like to tell the Party in power  that  we

should  not  worry about this point. I can tell them  that  they

need  not  pay  extra money towards this end. In fact,  it  will

reduce the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



expenditure  on education and have more students going to  school.

But there is one pre-requisite, and that is, the

P.A.P. must  give up the idea of monopolising  education  as  a

matter  of enterprise. I mentioned last year in this House  that

the  Government  was trying to monopolise education  and,  as  a

result, a lot of disadvantages and defects arose. But the  facts

now  show  that they are not prepared to give up  this  idea  of

monopolising education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the Government is prepared to do this, as I

suggest,  then  it  can  do  better  by  encouraging  vernacular

education,  education in schools run by the  people  themselves.

There are some wise businessmen who are prepared to pay for  the

management  and maintenance of schools run privately.  In  fact,

the  poorer  people of Singapore are also prepared to contribute

their  share  towards  education. The establishment  of  Nanyang

University  is  one  clear  example. Thousands  of  people  have

contributed  towards  the setting up of Nanyang  University  and

thousands have contributed towards its maintenance. The  hawkers

have  sold  their wares, and contributed the whole  proceeds  to

Nanyang  University. But the situation at the present moment  is

quite  different.  In the past, during the colonial  days,  when

there  were  many  Chinese schools in existence and  established

under  this  system, one will remember that the  maintenance  of

such schools depended on the financial contributions made by the

poor  people and the business community in Singapore.  But  ever

since  the Government assumed control of Nanyang University  and

aided schools and refused to respect the Board of Directors, the

whole  situation has changed. Members of the Board of  Directors

have  received no respect from the Government and so they  would

not  contribute  any  further  towards  education.  This  is   a

reasonable reaction. As a matter of fact, education run  by  the

people  is  good  so  far  as  it helps  to  train  our  younger

generation. In fact, it helps the Government to run education in

a better way and help education to flourish.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  just now the Member for Thomson has talked  about

matters  relating to our education system and has  alleged  that

the  system  of public education is to eliminate students  on  a

large  scale  so that young people are forced out of  school  to

roam  about  in  the  streets. Mr Speaker, this  falsehood  and

unfounded  criticism has been repeated over and  over  again  in

this  House  and  outside this House. If  we  allow  these  wild

utterances  to  be  repeated  without  any  rebuttal,  then  the

impression may be created in the minds of some people that  such

utterances  may have some truth in them. So it  is  my  duty  to

answer such wild utterances and allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has said just now that the percentage of

passes in the Primary School Leaving Examination is about 60 per

cent  and  the remaining 40 per cent have to be eliminated.  But

this statement is not in accordance with the facts.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the public examination are improving year by

year.  In  fact, the percentage of passes is raised every  year.

For this year, in the Primary School Leaving Examination, 63 per

cent  have  passed, which is higher than that for last  year  by

almost  5  per cent. Mr Speaker, the remaining percentage  that

have  failed are still in school. As a matter of fact,  we  have

not  dismissed  them. They are not eliminated. Taking  the  1963

figure  of unsuccessful candidates in the Primary School Leaving

Examination,  60 per cent were successful, and of the  remaining

40 per cent who were unsuccessful, 24 per cent had to repeat the

Primary  VI  classes in preparation for this year's examination.

Another  15 per cent of the remaining 40 per cent were  sent  to

vocational   schools  for  two  years.  So  the  actual   figure

eliminated  was  1 per cent, because students in  this  category

have reached the age of 16.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said time and again that the minimum school leaving age

is  16  years. We never ask a child of 11 or 12 years  to  leave

school.  Every  primary school student who  has  failed  in  the

Primary   School   Leaving  Examination  has   more   than   two

opportunities  to  make the grade. He can sit  for  the  Primary

School Leaving Examination twice, and if he should fail again he

will be asked to join a vocational school to receive another two

years of education. This has been the practice over the past few

years. I am surprised to note that the Member for Thomson should

repeat  the old refrain and falsehoods in this House. If he  did

not  do so deliberately, then it only shows his ignorance of the

actual situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the minimum age for leaving school is 16 years. In

Asian countries, and even in England, this is the objective  yet

to  be achieved. But in Singapore we have already achieved  this

objective  by raising the school-leaving age to 16. If  this  is

not  an  unprecedented achievement, I do not  know  what  is  an

achievement.



The  Member for Thomson also agreed that we should spend a great

deal  of money on education. For last year and this year we have

spent  about  $105 million. In fact, in the Estimates  for  next

year,  the  vote  asked for amounts to some $107  million.  This

figure  is  enormous  and  it is about one-third  of  the  total

expenditure of the State. Mr Speaker, no country in  the  whole

of   South-East  Asia  can  excel  Singapore  in  the  field  of

education. We spend so much money on training and educating  our

next  generation  and  turning  them  into  useful  citizens  of

tomorrow.  We do not have to go to a far country for  a  factual

comparison.  Just look at Indonesia, which is a close  neighbour

and which is a country admired by the Barisan Sosialis. How much

do they spend on education every year? Is it 5 per cent of their

total  expenditure or less? We spend so much money in  order  to

educate our next generation and to make them nation builders  of

the  future. But in Indonesia, the situation is different.  Some

70 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



cent  of  their  Government expenditure is  spent  on  armament,

military expansion and on the purchase of ammunition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Thomson also said just now that we

tried  to  monopolise education. I do not know what he meant  by

that,  because  up  to  now  anyone  who  is  enthusiastic   and

interested in education and is prepared to donate or establish a

private  school is always welcomed. No one will object  to  this

kind  move  and charitable inclinations. So when the Member  for

Thomson said that we monopolise education, I really do not  know

what he meant. But if he says that we restrict the activities of

pro-Communist elements in schools, then I admit that this is so.

If  he says that restriction of activities by Communist elements

in schools is to monopolise education, then my reply is that this

is what it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also touched on Nanyang University

which,  before  the reorganisation, received generous  donations

from  the  public,  such as from trishaw  riders,  hawkers,  and

members of the business community. He also said that these  donations  are  not forthcoming any more. I have to tell the  Member

that,  in  fact, such donations ceased before the reorganisation

of  Nanyang University because the enthusiasts were aware of the

domination of Nanyang University by Communist elements, and they

were quite dissatisfied with the anti-national activities of the

pro-Communist elements in the University. So even as far back as

a   few  years  ago  before  reorganisation  took  place,   such

contributions stopped. No one contributed any more.  We  do  not

have  to  mention trishaw riders and hawkers to  illustrate.  We

only need to mention the business community and the sponsors  of

Nanyang  University. They have lost confidence in the University

and  they  did  not contribute any more to it. I  can  give  two

illustrations. Take, for example, Tan Lark Sye,  who  agreed  to

donate  some $5 million. He has actually paid only $2.3 million,

although he has agreed to donate $5 million. Whether he wants to

contribute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



further or not. I would not know. Another example is the Nanyang

Siang  Pau, which is also one of the sponsors. They have  agreed

to donate $1 million by instalments of $100,000 a year. Now what

happens  to  them? Up to date they have only paid  $100,000.  In

fact, when they agreed to donate $1 million, great publicity was

given to it. But what happens today? The situation is clear  for

everyone  to see. A further example is Shaw Brothers Ltd,  which

have  agreed  to donate $250,000, but have actually  paid  about

$50,000. So enthusiasm in Nanyang University has dwindled. If he

says  that the dwindling of this enthusiasm is due to  the  fact

that  Nanyang University is under the control of the Government,

then  we  have  to refute it. No one can put the  blame  on  the

Government. If he says that the loss of enthusiasm is  connected

with  the reorganisation of Nanyang University, then how can  he

account  for  the facts I have already given? Even the  sponsors

themselves  have  not contributed what they  already  agreed  to

contribute  before the reorganisation. This,  of  course,  is  a

matter entirely left to the donors themselves. No one can  force

anyone to contribute or donate. But one can assume that since  a

certain  person has agreed to contribute a certain sum, then  it

is  his  responsibility  to pay up whatever  he  has  agreed  to

donate. I have already given examples to show certain people who

have  not  paid  up  the amounts they agreed to  before  the  reorganisation.  All this deadening of enthusiasm is  attributable

to   the   activities  of  pro-Communist  elements  in   Nanyang

University.  They  organised  anti-national  activities  in  the

University campus. That accounted for the loss of confidence  of

the  people  in the University and their refusal to pay  up  any

further. If you want to find out the cause of the faults, then I

will  say that Members of the Barisan Sosialis are wholly to  be

blamed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the Minister

himself  has  admitted  the fact without  our  asking  him  that

sponsors of Nanyang University have not been paying up under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



present  Government.  In  fact,  Mr  Tan  Lark  Sye  has   paid

$2,300,000  and  the  Nanyang Siang Pau has paid  [Interruption]

more  than $100,000 and Shaw Brothers have paid $50,000 although

they promised a larger sum. I would like to ask the Minister for

Education  this  question:  have  these  sponsors  notified  the

Ministry of Education that they would not --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The topic under discussion is the policy

of  the  Government on education. In passing. Nanyang University

was  mentioned  by the Member, and in passing the  Minister  has

replied.  I  will  not  allow a debate  to  develop  on  Nanyang

University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I was talking about

education by the people themselves. If the Government  does  not

monopolise education, then this will benefit the people. If  the

Government  takes  this advice, then the money  can  be  put  to

better  use,  such  as  improving the lot  of  the  people.  For

instance, in the case of Nanyang University, the donations could

have continued. But up to date the Government has not encouraged

community education. It is because the P.A.P. want to monopolise

this field.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has blamed the pro-Communists and the

anti-nationals for this mess. I will talk about this later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch upon a certain mistake the Government has

made.  The  P.A.P.  Government is  not  willing  to  change  the

colonial  type of education even up till now. Has the Government

planned the students' future after they have left school? During

the  colonial  period, the students were faced with unemployment

after  they left school. Today the situation is still the  same.

Their parents have spent a lot of money on their education.  Now

after  leaving  school, they have to spend  their  time  on  the

roads.  The  P.A.P. Government will have to solve this  problem.

Many  pupils  find  it  difficult to get  any  employment  after

leaving  school.  In this respect, the P.A.P. Government  should

try to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



abolish  the  colonial system of education. They should  develop

community education, that is education by the people themselves.

They  have  been in power for one year. They have not given  any

help  to solve the problem of unemployment. Even when Sabah  and

Sarawak  are  short  of  workers,  they  recruit  workers   from

Hongkong,  the Philippines and Taiwan. They are not  willing  to

recruit our school leavers who are unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is this. The P.A.P. Government is looking down

upon  community education - education by the people  themselves.

This  is  a well-known fact. Even in recent years, according  to

the  Government's  statement on the number  of  primary

school-leavers  joining  secondary schools, there has been  a  definite

effect  as  a  result  of  their  policy  to  destroy  community

education.  There  were  32,000 primary  school-leavers  in  the

English  stream. In the Chinese stream there was  an  equivalent

number. I would urge the Minister for Education not to carry  on

with  this policy of discrimination any further. I will  explain

later on the increase in the number of entrants into the English

stream. In respect of Chinese schools, there was a fewer  number

of  pupils, and as a result, teachers were retrenched because of

redundancy. Last year, the Ministry of Education sacked a number

of   teachers   on  account  of  their  so-called  anti-national

activities. The total number is 200. This year, 18 teachers in a

certain  primary  school were said to be redundant.  In  another

primary  school, 14 teachers were said to be redundant. I  think

there will be more redundancy in the other primary schools.  How

will  the Minister for Education deal with this matter? Will  he

retrench  more  teachers on security grounds? They  have  talked

about pro-Communists and Communist activities as an excuse.  All

this  is  a  bluff  in order to pacify the public.  Perhaps  the

Minister for Education has other plans to deal with this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the Minister for Education announced that there

will  be a second language to be studied as a compulsory subject

in the schools. I think the purpose is to absorb those redundant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



teachers from Chinese schools into English schools. I would  say

that  if the policy in regard to Chinese schools is not changed,

then the number of Chinese schools will dwindle in future. There

will  not  be  enough  English schools to absorb  the  redundant

teachers  from the Chinese schools. So the basic remedy  is  for

the Government to strike at the root of the problem. This is  to

implement  their self-proclaimed policy of equality of treatment

to all the four streams of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education said a few days ago that the choice

of a school lies in the hands of the parents concerned, and that the

Government has no right to interfere. But, in actual  fact,

the   Government  has  not  built  enough  Chinese  schools   to

accommodate the number of pupils who are willing to study in the

Chinese  stream. When the parents find that there is no  Chinese

school in the neighbourhood, they have to send their children to

the  English  schools. The authorities concerned are  making  it

difficult  for the parents to enrol in Chinese schools.  In  the

city  areas,  the  Government have been  building  many  English

schools  in  the midst of quite a number of Chinese schools.  In

the  satellite towns there are no Chinese schools. The residents

there  are finding it impossible for them to send their children

to  Chinese  schools.  As  a result, they  have  to  send  their

children to English schools in the neighbourhood or inside  that

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving school, there is no equality of employment

opportunity for the different streams of education, it  is  not

possible  for  school-leavers from the Chinese schools  to  find

employment. I think the Minister for Education has given  a  few

figures just to bluff the people. He says that about 40 per cent

of   primary   school  students  have  failed  in  the   primary

examination,  and that a certain percentage of  them  have  been

admitted into vocational secondary schools. Some have been asked

to   stay  back.  The  actual  number  of  schoolleavers   being

eliminated  is  very  small. It is one  per  cent.  Nobody  will

believe the claim made by the Minister for Education that  about

one per cent of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



pupils was eliminated. The P.A.P. is exercising its power to

strangle community education. I can give more examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the P.A.P. do not want to build more primary schools,

they   send   primary  school-leavers  to  join  the   so-called

vocational  schools. What the Minister for  Education  dare  not

disclose  is the fact that they will conduct courses at  random.

There  is  no  advanced  preparation, either  in  the  field  of

technical  education  or  vocational  education.  Thus  no  good

results  are obtained from this kind of education policy.  There

are  other  difficulties, such as the shortage of classrooms  or

teachers.  I  think of giving another example to illustrate  the

fact.  The  Government  is  trying to  develop  industries.  For

instance, in Toa Payoh, there is a school called Chi Hua Chinese

School.  This  school has received orders from the Minister  for

Education to close down. This is most unreasonable on  the  part

of  the  Minister, if the Government want to make  use  of  that

piece of land, they should try to get another piece of land as a

substitute to build this old school. They should not just  close

it  down.  For  instance, on the 8th October,  1964,  a  certain

school was broken into by Government authorities. They have thus

left  the Chinese schools no choice. The pupils especially  have

no chance to study in the schools. All these are concrete facts.

The  Minister cannot deny this. They are trying by  every  means

possible to destroy community education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a trade unionist. The

Member for Thomson is a school teacher - an exschool teacher. The

speech he has made today in this Assembly seems to tell us  that

he  is  a great protector of Chinese education. He has expounded

to  us how to educate the people. The Barisan Sosialis have four

Members  in  this  House at the moment. With only  four  Members

here,  you  are going to protect Chinese education! I think  Mao

Tsetung can do better. China is a great country with 700 million

people. If these people cannot protect Chinese education, do you

think four of you are going to protect Chinese education?

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member must address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am sorry. Sir, doubts may be lurking in the

minds  of  a  few Members of the Barisan Sosialis while  we  are

debating the vote of the Ministry of Education. Any State  which

wants to prosper should necessarily pay enough attention to  the

budding  generation so that in a matter of a decade or two,  the

quality  of  the  population would  necessarily  be  of  a  high

standard and the State's programme for industrialisation will be

carried  out in an efficient manner by skilled intelligence  and

enlightened   manpower.  Singapore  has  one  of  the   youngest

populations in Asia, and as such, more attention must be paid to

the  budding youths who are going to be leaders of the  country.

Naturally education should be of paramount importance. No effort

should  be  spared  to see that the children receive  sufficient

education to equip themselves, before they attain manhood,  with

sufficient  knowledge to tackle any situation and  to  implement

constructive  programmes of development of  the  State  but,  of

course,  not  to propagate the Soekarno line and  the  Communist

line.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the colonial era, sufficient emphasis was laid on a good

education  policy  and  the  little amount  that  was  spent  on

education   was  to  train  a  microscopic  group  of   colonial

orientated white-collar workers who would necessarily  form  the

third  rank of the British bureaucratic machinery and who  would

necessarily  have  to  safeguard  the  economic  and   political

interests  of Her Majesty's Government. The attainment  of  full

internal  self-government and the eventual formation of Malaysia

has  resulted in the realisation of the necessity to  train  the

youths  to  shoulder the nation's responsibilities and  also  to

reorientate their thinking in terms of one nation. The  People's

Action  Party  has already succeeded in infusing the  spirit  of

nationalism  during the past decade and after  coming  to  power

through   the  ballot  box,  we  decided  to  implement   social

programmes and policies. As part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



of  Malaysia,  we will strive to achieve industrial  prosperity.

But  man-power resources are equally important for any  plan  or

programme to succeed. Otherwise, the blue-print will continue to

remain  in  cold storage. Sir, that exactly is the  reason  why,

apart from encouraging education through the English medium,  we

have  also  decided to give equal importance to the other  three

streams  of  languages spoken by the three  different  races  in

Singapore.   The   colonial  approach  of  encouraging   English

education  resulted  in creating a small  minority  of

western-orientated  gentlemen,  while the masses remained  ignorant  and

naturally   submissive   to   the  colonial   power.   But   the

implementation  of  the various plans of the P.A.P. during  the

past few years has resulted in the renaissance in this State,  a

renaissance  which perhaps can be favourably compared  with  the

renaissance in Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are marching forward and this estimate of expenditure for

the   Ministry  of  Education  provides  further  proof  of  our

determination  to educate the masses along the right  lines  and

also infuse the spirit of nationhood, the spirit of progress and

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we have succeeded so far, we cannot understand why

we  should  not  succeed in the immediate future.  This  is  the

spirit  in  which the Barisan should welcome the  withdrawal  of

their  amendment. It is possible that some of the  pro-Communist

elements,  who  have no faith in democracy, but  who  happen  to

remain  in  this  democratic institution, will  turn  round  and

accuse  and  abuse  the Government of some  omissions.  We  have

withstood  such destructive criticisms earlier and we  can  very

well  afford  to  tolerate them since we  know  full  well  that

Soekarno's  running dogs bark, but the democratic  caravan  goes

on.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Member for Thomson moved

the amendment to reduce the whole amount allocated

to  the Ministry of Education, we would have thought that he had

something constructive to suggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



or  to  propose  in the matter of policy. But  the  very  feeble

attempt  to  criticise  minor aspects of the  general  education

policy, which was started in 1959, only shows the bankruptcy  in

the  thinking of not only the Member for Thomson, but of the lot

of  the Barisan Sosialis Members opposite. If I heard the Member

for  Thomson right, he said that the Government was monopolising

education. Like the Minister for Education, I was also wondering

what  he meant when he said that the Government was monopolising

education  in  Singapore.  I  was  also  wondering  whether,  by

monopoly  in education, he meant that the Government was  taking

very firm and positive action against subversion in the schools,

or  whether  he meant that the Government was carrying  out  its

obligations  to open up schools for the people, to  find  places

for  all  children who need places in schools, giving capitation

grants  to  schools  in all the four language  streams,  capital

grants for new schools. If he interprets all that as a monopoly,

then it is a monopoly whereby the Government is carrying out its

duty  and its obligations to meet the educational needs  of  the

people of the various races in Singapore, giving equal treatment

to  the schools in the four language streams. If, of course,  by

monopoly  he meant that we were taking firm action as we  should

and  we will do in future, then that is also monopoly. For  that

matter,  he  mentioned  also  about  200  teachers  having  been

dismissed from the schools last year. I have no doubt whatsoever

that  if more of the types who were dismissed last year were  to

make  their  appearance  in  the  future,  they  will  also   be

dismissed. If that is monopoly in education, so it will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member had nothing constructive to offer.

Since 1959, we have promoted an education system which is moving

slowly  and  steadily towards a national education system.  Much

has  been done in the way of removing the colonial aspect of the

old  education system, and the first aspect which comes to  mind

is,  of  course, the syllabus content. There is today  a  common

syllabus content in the schools of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



the  four  language  streams. There are no  more  geography  and

history  and possibly literature, whether in the Chinese schools

or  in  the  English schools, which were orientated  to  foreign

countries. Much has been done also in the fields of science  and

mathematics  which  have all gone towards promoting  a  national

education  system. The Member for Thomson is either ignorant  of

these things, or he is afraid to mention them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of equal treatment for the four language streams of

education  in Singapore has won the support of the people.  This

is  best  illustrated in the results of the last elections  when

the  people  overwhelmingly supported the Government  and,  more

particularly,  because in the last three years since  the

anti-national and the pro-Communist elements had decided to go  where

they  belonged, there has not been any serious criticism of  the

Government's education policy of giving equal treatment  to  the

four language streams. The incidents of 1955, 1956 and 1961 were

completely  out  of  the picture in the last  three  years.  The

Member  for  Thomson also very conveniently forgets about  this.

The  education policy which we are carrying out in Singapore has

the   widest  possible  support  of  the  people,  because   the

contradictions  which used to exist in the education  policy  in

those  days before the P.A.P. came to power have, by and  large,

been removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member for Thomson's criticism of the children

who  he imagines have to leave school when they fail the Primary

VI  School  Leaving Examination, he also does not seem  to  know

that  the  minimum school-leaving age in Singapore today  is  15

plus  years  and it goes on right until 16 plus,  if  the  child

prefers  to  remain  in school. He tries to say  that  what  the

Minister  has said about the one per cent who have had to  leave

school in the last two or three years as something which he  can

not  believe.  Well,  whether the Member for  Thomson  wants  to

believe  it  or not, of course, is not for us to decide.  If  he

does  not want to accept the truth as truth, then he can believe

in all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



things he wants to believe. Probably if Indonesia says that  the

percentage  there is higher and he wants to believe the  figures

dished  out  by  Professor  Priono,  who  is  the  Minister  for

Education  there,  then  he  can jolly  well  believe  what  the

Indonesians want to tell him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, throughout the speech of the Member for

Thomson,  I heard the term "community education". I do not  know

whether the translation ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Communal.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche A. Rahim Ishak:</b> --- was accurate. It is as the Minister for

Health  has said a moment ago - "communal education". The Member

for  Thomson is only interested in communal education.  Probably

he used a Mandarin term which meant "racial education", which is

no  better.  We  talk of a national education  system.  We  work

towards  the  promotion  of  a national  education  system.  But

everytime he opens his mouth to talk about education, it is "community  education", which, of course, as far as he is concerned,

is Chinese education in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy which we have carried out for the last five years

gives equal treatment to all the four language streams. As  much

as  we  talk  of  education in the English stream,  the  Chinese

stream, the Tamil stream, or the Malay stream, we want to  bring

progress  and improvements in education and teaching  standards,

and  increase  the number of teachers to meet the  shortages  as

they arise. We give thought to all streams of education and  not

only  to  one  stream. Where one particular  stream  is  lagging

behind,  as  in  the  case of the Malays where  they  never  had

secondary  education  in the whole long  history  of  Singapore,

then,  of  course, secondary education is provided for them.  We

bring  equitable treatment to all streams. With us there  is  no

such thing as talking about one communal stream alone.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing more which the Member for

Thomson,  or for that matter any one of them on the other  side,

can  offer  in  a constructive manner for the education  of  the

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore.  At  best they can only try to criticise  without

really  being able to offer constructive suggestions  which  are

really  for the benefit of the people. Whatever amendments  they

are  going to make will, for the rest of the evening, run  along

the same lines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

Members  have  not given me satisfactory answers to  the  points

which  I  raised.  They have raised other issues,  like  pro-Com

munists and Indonesia. These are not pertinent to the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now when I raised the point of community education, the

Government side confused it with communal education. I  did  not

say  "communal  education" but "community education".  Community

education  applies to Chinese education and Malay  education  as

well.  How  much  has  the Government  done  for  this  type  of

education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk on what the Parliamentary Secretary has said

about  the support given by the people to the Government on  its

education  policy.  I  ask  him  to  forget  about  last  year's

elections. Malaysia is a disgraceful thing. If that  is  a  true

reflection  of  the people's wishes, then Ngo  Dinh  Diem  would

still be the President of South Vietnam today. In every election

in  the past, Ngo Dinh Diem received the majority support of the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us forget about the past. Let us talk of facts. In regard

to   the  P.A.P.'s  monopoly  of  education,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary said he did not understand what I was saying.  It  was

because I was picking out some unpleasant facts for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year about 200 teachers and principals were dismissed. We

can  talk  about these things. After this happened,  the  P.A.P.

members  straightaway wanted to become principals.  This  is  an

open secret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jurong, there are some schools where the principals are now

P.A.P. supporters and relatives of P.A.P. members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Their names, please?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Do they want me to reveal the

names? In Upper Serangoon there is a Chinese school whose

principal is now a P.A.P. member. He was previously an Arts

teacher. This is clear evidence of their monopolising of

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Thomson area there is a school. The ex-principal was

detained  and a P.A.P. member was put in his place as principal.

This individual was a member of the preparatory committee of the

P.A.P. concert held there. Do you want me to reveal names? I can

do so. This clearly shows that the Government is misusing public

funds to employ their own people in the education field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Federal elections last year, the schools in

Singapore  were  not on vacation. There were  some  school  principals who went to the Federation to do electioneering work  for

the P.A.P. They forgot about their schools. I have got the facts

and  evidence, if they want me to reveal names, I can do so  one

by one. If this is not monopolising education, what is?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I go? I was not a teacher. I could go. I was not using the

Government's money. These are facts which they cannot refute.  I

do  not  wish  to  follow the P.A.P. practice of  saying  things

behind the backs of people. I do not wish to reveal the names of

these people. If they can accept my challenge, I will repeat the

names one by one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About constructive criticisms, just now I have given my

criticisms  and  some  suggestions. Are these  not  constructive

criticisms?  I  requested the Government to encourage  community

education.   Is  this  not  constructive  criticism?   Community

education will bring benefits to the country and the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Primary school-leaving examination, my suggestion

that  it  should be abolished is another constructive criticism.

They talk about Jakarta, Soekarno, Russia, China. We are fed  up

with these things. If they can explain all the points raised  by

the Opposition, we will be satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we have already

said a few moments ago - in answer to the allegation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



of  the Member for Thomson that enrolment for the  Chinese

schools  is  lower  in number from year to year,  and  that  the

Government  is trying to strangle vernacular education - that  we

have  already  implemented  equal treatment  for  all  the  four

streams of education. It is entirely up to the parents to choose

what  stream  of  education to send their children  to.  If  the

majority  of parents see fit to send their children  to  English

schools  or  other schools, then it is entirely up  to  them  to

decide.  We have no right to stop them. We cannot force  parents

to  send  their  children  to any particular  school - a  Chinese

school,  an  English  school or a Tamil school.  The  choice  is

entirely in the hands of the parents themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member concerned has also mentioned just now that parents

wanted to send their children to Chinese schools but found  that

there were not enough Chinese schools to accommodate them.  This

is  another old refrain. I can give figures to prove  it.  Since

1959, the  Government has built 14 new Chinese Primary  schools

and  12  Chinese  secondary schools. In 1959,  school  enrolment

numbered 2,500. In 1964 ---
