<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether

a  Malayan Officer who had been promoted to the post of

Director   of   Special   Branch   as   a   result   of

Malayanisation has asked to retire on terms  under  the

Retirement from the Public Service (Compensation)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance,  1956, and on what grounds  is  the  request

made;  and  whether  he will make a  statement  in  the

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Sir, the officer in question, who

holds  his appointment by the approval of the Secretary

of  State,  made  representations to the  Secretary  of

State  in 1957 under Section 18 of Ordinance No. 43  of

1956.  The Secretary of State, after considering  those

representations,  expressed himself satisfied  that  he

had reasonable grounds for anxiety regarding the future

of  his  career  in  the  public service.  The  officer

thereupon became an entitled officer and the provisions

of   the  Ordinance  applied  to  him  accordingly.  In

November  1958,  he  gave five months'  notice  of  his

intention  to retire under Section 3 of the  Ordinance.

His retirement will therefore be effective next month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation to which he will be entitled under

the  Ordinance  will not be based on the emoluments  of

his  present rank of Senior Assistant Commissioner, but

on   the   emoluments   of   his   previous   rank   of

Superintendent,  since he will not have  completed  two

years  in  the  higher rank as provided in  the  Fourth

Schedule  to  the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order  in

Council.

Tax Department but subsequently stopped, and whether he

will make a statement on the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have examined

the matter referred to and am satisfied that the

liability to tax of this account was properly examined

and that there is no truth in the allegation that

investigations were stopped.

that interview investigations were dropped?

<div align="center"><b>LEAKAGES OF EXAMINATION PAPERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the December

sitting  of  this  Assembly I made a statement  on  the

English  Secondary Schools Entrance Examination leakage

and   the   Government  Chinese   Senior   Middle   III

Examination  leakage  and promised  to  make  a  fuller

statement  on  the  Chinese  Examination  leakage,  the

investigation of which was not completed at that  time.

A   thorough   investigation  of   the   administrative

arrangements for the setting of papers and the printing

has revealed the following facts:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The seven question papers were set by seven

different  persons, five of whom were in the  Ministry,

one  in  an  English secondary school and  one  in  the

Teachers' Training College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The seven question papers were given to a

professor  from Nanyang University for the  purpose  of

moderation by certain professors in the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The seven question papers were moderated by six

professors of Nanyang University, each of them  dealing

with only one paper with the exception of one who dealt

with two papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) On the return of the question papers from Nanyang

University,  the  persons who set  the  questions  made

certain  amendments to the questions and in  one  paper

which  went  up  to Nanyang University in  English  the

questions were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>



translated into Chinese in the Ministry. The final form

of  the  questions was determined in my  Ministry  only

after   the   questions  had  returned  from   Nanyang

University,  and  thus  the  professors   up   at   the

University  did  not  know  the  final  form   of   the

questions. The questions that leaked out were in  their

final form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) All these question papers were sent to the

Government  Printing  Office for printing.  The  proofs

were checked by the setters themselves and returned  to

the Printing Office for final printing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The packing of the printed papers was supervised

by  three  officials of the Ministry  at  the  Printing

Office  and  brought back personally  by  them  to  the

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) During this period from the setting of the first

questions  until  the delivery of the  printed  papers,

they   were  kept  in  the  custody  of  the  Assistant

Examinations Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Government Printer has accounted for all the

papers printed by him either in proof or in final form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revelation of the above facts should have brought

about  the  exposure of the culprit  or  culprits,  but

unfortunately  this  has been made  impossible  by  the

attitude of the witnesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal to students and others to come forward to

give  information with regard to the leakage  has  been

disappointing.  Although many pupils who  had  been  in

possession of the questions had been interrogated, none

of   them  was  prepared  to  speak  the  whole  truth.

Invariably  the  final answers were  either  that  they



obtained   the   questions  anonymously   through   the

telephone, through the post or from collective  copying

in a coffee shop or at some other place. Even those who

had  come  forward to surrender some of  the  questions

before  the  examination  were  not  prepared  to  give

further information. They said that their object was to

prove  to the Government that there had been a  leakage

of  questions so that the dishonest students would  not

get  their qualifications through foul means. They said

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>



their  objective had been achieved and they,  therefore,

did not want to go further to put anybody in trouble, in

face  of  this attitude no one can force any of them  to

say  anything against their will but I want to take this

opportunity,  not  to  condemn the  perverted  sense  of

loyalty  to  friends among the Chinese school  students,

but  to  ask  them to sit back and reflect whether  they

were  doing the right thing as citizens of this  country

and  whether the loyalty and sincerity they  learned  in

the  classics  taught  them to  shield  those  who  have

conspired  to cheat in an examination at national  level

and frustrate the efforts of the Government. I hope that

our  educationists will take note of this and see to  it

that  our  children do not misinterpret the  meaning  of

loyalty and sincerity.

<div align="center"><b>TRADE MISSION TO INDONESIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>Commerce and Industry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members will

be  happy  to  know  that as a result  of  a  series  of

negotiations, a joint Chambers of Commerce Trade Mission

from  Singapore  has  been invited  by  the  Chamber  of

Commerce  of  Indonesia  with  the  concurrence  of  the

Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade  to  visit  Indonesia.  The

Mission will leave on 8th March and the visit will  last

one week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission will comprise about 15 members, headed by

Mr K. M. Abdul Razak, Chairman of the Indian Chamber of

Commerce.  I am attaching two of my senior officials  as

observers to this Mission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission will have the opportunity to discuss fully

and frankly all matters of mutual interest to Indonesian

and  Singapore merchants with the object of establishing

closer  trade  ties. The Mission will be  able  to  make

valuable personal contacts with the leaders and  members

of  the  main  commercial associations in Indonesia  and

also   hold  discussions  with  various  Ministers   and

officials.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the Mission will be able to foster

closer   mutual   understanding  of   trading   problems

affecting the two territories and that this will lead to

further consultations on trade matters to the benefit of

both territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the Mission's visit might pave the

way  to  the establishment at a later date of a resident

Singapore trade representative at Djakarta.

<div align="center"><b>KAMPONG TIONG BAHRU FIRE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Labour and Welfare)</b></div>



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as stated in my

reply  to the Member for Tiong Bahru, I wish to  make  a

statement  now on the disastrous fire which occurred  on

Friday, 13th February, and devastated a large section of

Kampong   Tiong  Bahru,  rendering  some  5,000  persons

homeless  and  causing considerable loss and  damage  to

property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily only one person died although there were 58

casualties, nine of whom were admitted to hospital. Hon.

Members will have this tragic event still fresh in their

minds  and  I need not go over the harrowing details  of

this  tragedy  which has called forth the sympathy,  not

only  of  the  whole  of Singapore, but  also  from  our

brothers  in  the Federation and Brunei and sympathisers

from  the  United Kingdom. In this account, I intend  to

confine  myself purely to the sober statistical  details

of this fire, the largest Singapore has experienced, and

to an account of the measures which Government has taken

or intends to provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the scheme for undertaking emergency

measures whenever a fire or other calamity occurs, apart

from  measures  taken  to fight  the  fire  and  provide

immediate medical care and attention to the victims, the

Government  set up a relief centre under the control  of

the  Social  Welfare Department at  the  Kim  Seng  Road

School.   The  Social  Welfare  Department   staff   and

voluntary workers manned the relief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>



centre  day  and  night.  Donations  of  food   and

clothing  and goods immediately poured in from  the

ever    generous   public   and   from    voluntary

associations in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these donations the Singapore Council of

Social  Services have to date distributed  $154,140

in  cash  to  the fire victims through  the  Social

Welfare Department while that Department itself has

paid  out $26,060. The Singapore Council of  Social

Services  has spent a further $10,000  on  feeding,

the  Social  Welfare Department another  $2,000  on

equipment,  the Public Works Department have  spent

$12,500 on works carried out, while health services

and milk were provided by the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these measures provided immediate relief to

the  victims, it was necessary to consider  the  no

less urgent problem of their future accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning following the fire, a team from

the Estates Department of the Singapore Improvement

Trust,   by   liaison  with  the   Social   Welfare

Department,    obtained   basic   information    in

connection  with rehousing requirements.  Including

late registrations and additions made subsequently,

it  was  necessary to consider rehousing 115 single

persons and 920 families amounting to approximately

4,500  persons  in all. On Monday,  16th  February,

Government directed the Singapore Improvement Trust

to  provide  temporary accommodation for  the  fire

victim  families at Kallang Airport Estate  and  to

prepare schemes for the immediate redevelopment  of

the  area  devastated by the fire. On the following

day,  Sir,  I  announced the Government's  decision

that  the  victims of the Kampong Tiong Bahru  fire

would  be  accommodated free of  charge  for  three

months  and  that a large number of low-cost  flats

would be built to rehouse all the victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move of all persons living within the school

premises  and the majority of those who have  found

accommodation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>



outside the school was completed on Thursday,  26th

February.  During the 13 days, from  the  time  the

Trust  was  first  directed to  take  part  in  the

operation,   779   units  of   accommodation   were

allocated   and   occupied  by  approximately   900

families  and single person groups. The total  move

involved more than 4,000 persons. Lettings  of  779

units  in normal times would take some two  months.

The  organization  and effort  contributed  by  the

staff  who condensed the volume of work into a  few

days  has  been possible only because of  continued

working  by the staff on the site until late  hours

each day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I must come to the Government's intentions in

regard  to  the  redevelopment  of  the  fire  site

itself.  It  is  considered  that  only  a  planned

redevelopment  of  the site with permanent  housing

should be carried out and that haphazard rebuilding

with  attap or timber barrack buildings  should  be

strongly resisted and prevented. Government has now

accordingly gazetted for acquisition the full  area

of  the  fire site itself together with  additional

lands around it for satisfactory redevelopment. The

proposals   are  that  the  fire  site  should   be

developed  by the erection of 240 two-room  single-storey units and 500 two-room units in multi-storey

blocks. The single-storey units will be constructed

to  a  simple but durable structure by the  use  of

wood   wool  slabs  and  concrete  hollow   blocks.

Individual  water supply and electricity  would  be



laid on to each unit. The overall cost of these two-room  units, including a proportion of  site  work,

would  be $2,500. Such two-room units could be  let

complete   to  larger  families  or  be  split   to

individual rooms for allocation to small  families.

The  redevelopment of the higher  portions  of  the



site,  having good load bearing capacity  would  be

with  seven-storey  buildings containing  units  of

almost   identical  plan  to  the   single   storey

structures  but having balcony access.  Such  units

could   again  be  let  out  complete  or  as   two

individual rooms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the cost of 500 units of the two-room units in the multi-storey blocks will be

approximately $5,000 each or $2,500 per single room.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanction will be sought at the next sitting of this

Assembly   for  the  provision  of  additional   monies

amounting  to  approximately  $3.3  million  for   this

development. In the meantime, the Singapore Improvement

Trust  is being authorised to proceed immediately  with

site  works  in  anticipation of  Legislative  Assembly

approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that, after the carrying out of the

necessary  site works, the first phase  of  the  scheme

resulting  in  the completion of the 240  single-storey

units  would  take  three months, while  the  remaining

phases   of   the  scheme  would  result   in   further

accommodation  being available by the completion  of  a

possible 200 units in the multi-storey buildings at six

to eight weeks intervals thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to end this statement by voicing the

thanks  of this Government and, I am sure, the  victims

of  this fire will wish me to do so on their behalf, to

all  persons  who  worked long  and  devoted  hours  to

alleviate the plight of the afflicted victims,  and  to

the  very  willing co-operation and assistance rendered

by  all  bodies  and  organizations,  both  public  and

private,  from  the  City  Council  and  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust to the Council of Social Services and

other relief organizations. Last but not least, I  must

not  forget  the very generous public of Singapore  and

our  friends in the Federation, Brunei and  the  United

Kingdom whose donations and contributions and more than

this,   the   thought   behind  these   donations   and

contributions,  have  warmed  our  hearts  and  brought

solace to the unfortunate victims.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main value of the amendment proposed lies in

clauses  2  and  3  the result of which  will  be  that

married  couples will be enabled to adopt  and  give  a

proper  status to an illegitimate child of one  or  the

other.  There  are  cases  where  the  mother   of   an

illegitimate child marries the natural father  of  that

child and it is desirable that some proper means should

be  provided for the child to be adopted jointly by the

husband  and  wife without the undesirable  fiction  at

present resorted to whereby the mother has formally  to

give  up  her parental rights before an adoption  order

can be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill will allow for adoption in this

very small class of case where the mother marries a man

less  than  21 years older than the child.  Usually  in

such  cases  the man, married, is in fact  the  natural

father.   These  two  clauses  will  allow   of   these

arrangements  which I suggest are proper and  desirable

to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth clause of this Bill makes a minor

alteration  to  section  9  of  the  Ordinance,   which

provides  for  rules to be made. At present  there  are

rules  providing for adoption orders to be made not  in

open  court  but  in Chambers. Strictly,  interlocutory

applications should be dealt with in open  Court.  This

has  not  been  the  practice in the  past  and  it  is

desirable  that  provision  should  be  made  for   the

existing practice of dealing with interlocutory  orders

in Chambers to be regularised and put completely beyond

doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final clause of the Bill adds a definition

section  which  is now desirable so as  to  distinguish

between fathers of legitimate children and the natural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>



fathers  of  illegitimate children, and is consequential

on the provision that will be made by clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Tun Lim Yew Hock):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of constitutional changes and of

experience  gained  over  the  past  few  years  in  the

administration of the Immigration Ordinance, 1953, it is

imperative that certain amendments should be made in the

law   to  meet  changed  conditions  and  to  close  the

loopholes  that have been discovered over a  period.  To

this end there have been several consultations with  the

Federation Government at ministerial as well as official

levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> are aware that since 1953 the policy on

immigration  has been Pan-Malayan, and  I  am  happy  to

report  that as a result of these consultations it  will

continue to be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is an independent territory now and

Singapore  will soon have internal self-government,  but

despite   the  difference  in  status,  the   Federation

Government has agreed to maintain a Pan-Malayan approach

to  this  very important legislation. There will  be  no

change  in  the  freedom  of movement  between  the  two

territories along the Causeway other than in the case of

those  citizens who are specifically prohibited by order

of either Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions incorporated in this Bill are the

result  of consultations referred to by me. A  new  Bill

incorporating these amendments was passed by the Federal

Legislative   Council  about  a   fortnight   ago.   The

Federation Government is now awaiting the passing of our

Bill  so  that the new law can be brought into operation

simultaneously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference to the Explanatory Statement to the Bill

will disclose the reasons for the proposed amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, the most important clause, seeks to amend

the provisions of section 7 of the Immigration Ordinance

in  that  the right of entry is now confined to citizens

of  Singapore and of the Federation, and  I  am  sure

hon.  Members will welcome this move. Persons other than

citizens of Singapore and of the Federation will have to

apply  for  a permit or pass in order to enter Singapore

from  outside  Malaya. I wish to stress that  this  will

refer  to  those who will be seeking entry  into  Malaya

after  the  coming  into force of this  amendment.  This

amendment  will not affect persons already  resident  in

Singapore on entry permits or passes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to those categories of persons who at

present are entitled to enter by virtue of section 7 (1)

(b)  of  the Ordinance, namely, persons in the  specific

employment  of  the Government or of the  City  Council,

consular  representatives or members of  the  Diplomatic

Corps,  and  members of Her Majesty's Forces serving  in

Singapore,  they  will  be  covered  by  an  Immigration

(Exemption) Order which it is proposed to make  if  this

Bill  is passed. This Exemption Order will be authorised

under section 55 of the Ordinance as amended. Clause  27

of  the Bill seeks such an amendment to section 55 so as

to   empower  the  Minister,  when  he  makes  an  Order

exempting  any  person  or class  of  persons  from  the

provisions  of  the  Immigration  Ordinance,  to  impose

conditions on such exemption. It is intended  that  such

an Order, when made, will make it obligatory on the part

of persons qualified for exemption to apply for an entry

permit or pass, if the specific reason for the exemption

ceases to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>



hold good. Such persons could then be treated as if they

were  applying  for first entry into Singapore  if  they

wish  to  remain here after their diplomatic or consular

status ceases, or their service with the Armed Forces or

the Government or the City Council is terminated, as the

case may be. The Government feels that this amendment is

vitally  necessary in order that when the new  Exemption

Order  is introduced, there will be a system of control,

which   will  enable  it,  in  consultation   with   the

Federation Government if need be, to have the  power  to

refuse or to allow such persons to remain in Malaya when

the  reasons  for exemption have ceased to be  valid  in

their  cases. The present law gives no such  power  once

they   have  entered  Singapore  under  the  entitlement

conferred  under section 7 (1) (b) of the Ordinance.  It

will  therefore be in the interests of Singapore to have

this  control  in  order that permission  to  stay  here

either on an entry permit or pass would be regulated  by

considerations of contributions which such persons would

make  for  the  economic  betterment  or  otherwise   of

Singapore or of Malaya as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore now has overwhelming problems of a fast

expanding population and of a totally inadequate  number

of employment opportunities created from time to time to

absorb  the  large numbers of young persons coming  into

the  employment market every year. At the same time, the

Government is only too conscious of the need to  attract

capital   and  technological  know-how  for   industrial

development,  and to expand and improve the productivity

of  existing industries, while maintaining to  the  full

the  enviable position which we have gained through  our

entrepot  trade. It is, therefore, necessary that  there

should be a balance struck somewhere between the need to

curtail  the  entry  of  persons seeking  employment  in

Singapore and the necessity to have recourse to steps to

invite foreign capital or experts, whether it is in  the

scientific, technological or professional spheres, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>



could  contribute  to  Singapore's economic,  social  or

industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this control, Sir, emphasis

will be placed more and more on the economic benefit  of

Singapore.  Positive  steps will have  to  be  taken  to

encourage  people to invest in Singapore and to  protect

that   investment  with  their  presence  here.  As   an

important corollary to this better system of immigration

control,  it  is  proposed that the present  Immigration

(Prohibition   of  Entry)  Order,  which  includes   the

category  of persons under paragraph (b) of the Schedule

to  the Order enabling a contract employee to be granted

an  entry  permit  if  he has a contract  of  employment

guaranteeing a salary of $500 per month for  two  years,

should  be  replaced. Accordingly a new  order  will  be

issued, deleting paragraph (b) of the Schedule, as  well

as  another  category in paragraph (c) which  refers  to

skilled  artisans being allowed entry for employment  in

the  trade  or  occupation if there are  not  sufficient

skilled artisans already resident in Malaya, and if such

entry is in the economic interests of Singapore, and  to

cover  these two categories of persons by the  issue  of

Employment  Passes.  Such  Employment  Passes  will   be

authorised under new Immigration regulations which it is

also  proposed to make. Such an Employment Pass  may  be

issued  by  the Controller to any person  other  than  a

prohibited  immigrant who satisfies the Controller  that

he  wishes  to  enter  Singapore in  order  to  take  up

employment in Singapore under a contract for  a  minimum

period  of  two years and up to a maximum of five  years

(with extensions to be granted at the discretion of  the Controller)  with

a  company  or  firm,  such  contract

guaranteeing  an emolument of $1,200 per  month.  It  is

further  proposed that there should be  a  proviso  that

where   the  Controller  is  satisfied  that  no  person

resident   in   Singapore  is  available  to   undertake

employment of the kind referred to in such contract  and

that  it  will be unreasonable to expect an employer  to

pay such a salary in the particular circumstances of the

job or post, he may waive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>



the  requirements  of  this  stipulation  that  the

employee  should  be paid a salary  of  $1,200  per

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must ask hon. Members to bear

with  me if I appear to dwell too long on this part

of  the  proposed provision. There  has  been  some

considerable disquiet on the part of the commercial

and   trading  community  as  to  the  Government's

intentions,  and I hope this statement  will  allay

the fears that the Government is seeking to exclude

contract employees altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the necessity to provide and

preserve employment opportunities for local people,

there  is of course the recognized need to maintain

confidence in the ability of Singapore to cope with

the  demands  of what we hope will be an  expanding

economy.  Contract  employees  will  therefore   be

allowed  entry  and  even  welcomed  if  they   are

personnel of a high calibre of attainments that are

not  to  be found amongst local qualified  persons,

and if they will bring special talents, whether  it

be  in  the  business,  industrial,  scientific  or

technological fields. In the process of raising the

figure from $500 a month to $1,200 a month,  it  is

the Government's hope that indirect inducement will

thus be offered to firms and companies to encourage

or  promote local persons to take the places of the

junior  executive  grades  whom  they,  up  to  the

present,   find  it  expedient  to   recruit   from

overseas. We believe that many firms of repute  and

standing  in  Singapore have  already  embarked  on

programmes  of training local people to  take  over

posts  of  responsibility  even  without  any  such

inducement. Therefore, I wish to give an  assurance

to   such  firms  and  to  others  which  recognize

sympathetically the need of Singapore  to  preserve

employment opportunities as far as possible to  its

citizens,  that  there is no present  intention  to

influence  them to Malayanise the senior  executive

posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need hardly stress that if this proposed

immigration  control is exercised over  the  coming

years  with the broad imaginative objectives  which

we  have  in  mind,  there  will  be  much  greater

appreciation   of   the   benefits   of   Singapore

citizenship, and communities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>



will become close-knit and integrated. The building

up  of a Malayan consciousness and loyalty will  be

greatly  accelerated thereby. With the  Federation,

this  Government  agrees that at this  juncture  we

will  not  be unduly restrictive over the issue  of

Employment Passes provided that employers can  show

that  they are making genuine attempts to cooperate

with  the Government to see that as far as possible

local  people  are being employed or being  trained

for  higher  posts, so that the need  for  overseas

recruitment  is  reduced to  the  minimum.  As  the

proposed   orders   to  be   made   will   not   be

retrospective but will come into force on the dates

they  are  made, persons already resident on  entry

permits,  whether  they  be contract  employees  or

specialists   or  professional  consultants   under

paragraph (a) of the Schedule to the Prohibition of

Entry order, will not be affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 of the Bill proposes an amendment

to  subsection (2) of section 6 of the  Immigration

Ordinance  in  order  to prohibit  the  entry  into

Singapore  from the Federation of any person  other

than a citizen of Singapore who has been prohibited

entry  by  order  made  under  section  9  of   the

Ordinance,  or  who has entered the  Federation  of

Malaya on a pass issued under the provisions of any

written  law  for the time being in  force  in  the

Federation,  and  endorsed as not valid  for  entry

into  Singapore. Hon. Members will appreciate  that

this  amendment will enable the Government to  have

the  right,  which  it  is  hoped  will  be  rarely

exercised,  to  exclude visitors to Singapore  from

the  Federation,  whether  for  security  or  other

reasons, because their presence is objected  to  in

Singapore,   but   not  in  the   Federation.   The

Federation  Bill has such a parallel  provision  to

exclude visitors from Singapore to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to amend section 10 of

the  Immigration Ordinance to make the issue of  an

Entry Permit discretionary instead of mandatory.  I

have  already  explained that this will  now  prove

absolutely necessary if immigration control in  the

interests  of  Singapore which we  seek  is  to  be

implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 similarly seeks to amend section 11 (2) of the

Ordinance   to  make  the  issue  of  Re-entry   Permits

discretionary instead of mandatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 seeks to repeal and re-enact section 15 of

the Ordinance to give power to the Controller to declare

the presence of a person who has entered Singapore on  a

permit  or certificate to be unlawful after his arrival,

if  it  is  proved subsequently that he obtained  either

document by misrepresentation or that he is a prohibited

immigrant.   The   certificate  in   question   is   the

Certificate  of  Citizenship status  issued  to  someone

outside  Singapore  who  claims  to  be  a  citizen   of

Singapore  by birth or otherwise. This power  to  cancel

will  be  exercisable within two years of  the  person's

arrival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 proposes an amendment to section 16 of the

Ordinance  to make it quite clear that once  a  person's

presence in Singapore is declared unlawful, it would  be

unlawful for him to remain here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 seeks to amend section 48 of the Ordinance

to  make  the  master, owner, charterer or  agent  of  a

vessel  or aircraft liable for expenses of removal  from

Malaya of persons illegally entering Singapore from such

vessel or aircraft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 reinforces this provision by seeking to

amend  section 49 by increasing the period of  liability

to  return  a person illegally entering to his  port  of

embarkation from three months to one year from the  date

of  entry. This latter provision is to ensure  that  the

necessary lengthy enquiries that may be required in some

cases  do  not  result in the owner  of  the  vessel  or

aircraft repudiating liability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 introduces a new section to facilitate

interrogation  and investigation in cases where  persons

are liable to be removed from Singapore under any of the

provisions of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish, in conclusion, to acknowledge with

gratitude  the part played by Tunku Abdul Rahman,  Prime

Minister  of  the Federation, in all this. I  must  also

thank Dato Abdul Razak and Dr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>



Ismail  for  the friendly understanding  and  close  co-operation in many problems which we have had to  discuss

and  solve over these matters. It is an example of close

consultations  which we hope will be  achieved  in  many

other  fields where the two territories inevitably  have

to  examine the plans in the light of interdependence of

one  on the other, and to give effect to the over-riding

considerations of maintaining a Malayan outlook, so that

to  the greatest extent possible we will be marching  in

step with each other, and to our mutual benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.51 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every

Singaporean will no doubt support the protection of  the

interests of Singapore citizens in getting employment in

his own country. I have no objection to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister mentioned in his

speech  that  he  wants  foreign capital.  I  think  all

Parties  need it, and have already spoken about it.  But

how  is foreign capital going to come? Unless you  allow

the  managers or partners to run the business. They  are

not  going  to  send capital here and hand  it  over  to

somebody  and say, "Look here, you take this capital  of

$100,000,  and  run the business for us."  That  is  not

possible, because those who invest their capital in this

country  want  to see their capital under their  control

and invested in lines of their own interests. This being

the case, the managers and partners should be allowed to

stay here to manage the affairs of their businesses.  Of

course,  they will have to employ local men in  the  big

businesses,  especially the industrial  side,  and  they

must  also train the local people in order to  form  the

majority of the employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have one more question. Many firms have been

established  here for years. Their businesses  are  vast

and  they have branches in many parts of the world, with

their   managers   or  their  partners   running   these

businesses. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Government, whichever Party is  in  power - of

course,  the  present Government will soon  be  out  of

office -  must  know that, in order to keep  investments

in  this  country and to attract investments into  this

country  from outside, they must allow the partners  or

managers  of these businesses, whoever they choose,  to

stay  in  this  country.  Of  late,  many  people  have

approached me saying that they want to send  their  own

partners  here  to  manage their  own  well-established

businesses.  If  these partners  or  managers  are  not

allowed  to stay here, the only thing that will  result

is  that  the  businesses, and with the businesses  the

capital  too,  will  move  out.  This  difficulty,   of

course,  after  persuading the Immigration  Department,

is  generally  solved; sometimes it goes  to  a  higher

level, but it is solved. But I must at this stage  draw

special  attention  to this fact - that  most  businesses

here  have been established before these rules, or this

Ordinance,  came into force. Therefore, my first  point

is  that these partners or managers - when I say managers

and   partners,   I   mean   those   who   manage   the

businesses - must be allowed to stay in this country.  My

second  point  is that those who want to establish  new

businesses for the benefit of Singapore must also  come

within the same category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Bill.



<br><br>10.55 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Bill,  as  presented  to  us  by  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister,  makes it quite clear that this is a  measure

which  should receive the support of this House and  of

everyone  in  Singapore. Although  we  are  politically

separated  from  the Federation, we are physically  and

economically one, and it would be unthinkable  to  have

two sets of immigration laws - one of the Federation, and

the  other  of  Singapore.  This  would  give  rise  to

difficulties in going from Singapore to the  Federation

and from the Federation to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of raising the minimum salary of $500 to

$1,200,  there  has  been considerable  disturbance  in

firms  whose managements are outside Singapore. But  on

the  whole, they realise that times have changed.  When

the minimum of $500 was fixed many years ago, wages and

the cost of living then were very much lower, and it is

only  right that the minimum should be raised to $1,200

today,  because  anyone fit to be a manager,  assistant

manager  or  partner, should be worth over  a  thousand

dollars,  if he should be allowed to come to Singapore.

He  should have the experience, the knowledge  and  the

know-how  to  justify that salary before  he  could  be

allowed  to  come and take away a job from one  of  our

local  men. One of the greatest difficulties and causes

of  dissatisfaction in business management, and even in

the  public services, has been the importation of  very

junior  men.  People  who have  just  passed  out  from

college or have received superficial training - young men

of  just  over  20 years - come to Singapore  and  become

assistant managers and are placed well over the head of

those  who have been working here for years and  years;

clerks who have worked 20 years or more and who are now

in the position of chief clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to a few years ago, there was not much attempt to

train the local senior staff to bring them to the stage

where  they  could  take  over  the  manager's  or  the

assistant   manager's  job.  One  can  well   see   the

dissatisfaction that is caused in an office  where  you

have a junior man suddenly thrown over you and you have

got  to  take  his directions when you  know  that  his

directions  are  not correct as he does  not  know  the

local conditions, but you still have to serve him. That

surely  lowers the morale of the whole office. I  think

it is only right that posts which carry up to $1,200 in

pay  should be given to local men to encourage them  to

take  over all these positions so that they can  become

managers in later years and take part in the running of

our Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.01 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one

accepts this Bill as inevitable as one welcomes the

fact that the Federation and Singapore continue in line

on these measures. The emoluments - I think that is the

word and I would like the Hon. the Chief Minister to

confirm that it is the word "emoluments - $l,200" that

was used - on the whole may .not be unreasonable in the

circumstances which are likely to exist in the future.

I may not have heard the Hon. the Chief Minister

correctly, Sir, but there is the point that was made in

the Federation, and stated by the Acting Prime Minister

there. He gave an assurance that entry was allowed on

an employment pass - that the holder, once he got in,

could look forward to a continuing career in this

country. I think that is quite an important point,

because if it is necessary to bring someone in, they

are brought in for a very good reason. To seek for a

person, and when you find him, and all that you can say

to him is, "You may come in for two years", may be

damaging to the economy of the country, possibly not in

the long term, but certainly in the short term.



<br><br>11.02 am.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the

point raised by the last speaker, I stated in my speech

on  the  Second  Reading that, in regard to  Employment

Passes, these will be given and that extensions will be

granted  if  the  employers could  produce  a  contract

guaranteeing that such persons will continue  in  their

employment.  Perhaps  the language  used  is  not  very

clear,  and thus it has caused some doubts in the  mind

of the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the Member for Telok

Ayer,  I  would like to explain something  which  I  am

afraid has not been properly grasped. Under the present

law,   any   person  who  could  produce   a   contract

guaranteeing his employment for two years on an  all-in

emolument of $500 cannot be denied permanent entry into

Singapore. That definitely is wrong. And the  amendment

proposed is to see that persons who seek



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>



employment in Singapore should only be given Employment

Passes  and  not permanent residence, and his  stay  in

Singapore will therefore be tied to the length  of  his

employment with his employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of $1,200 that has now been fixed is to

ensure  that  only  persons of senior  status  will  be

allowed  Employment Passes. But I did say  even  in  my

speech  just  now  that  if the employers  can  make  a

satisfactory  case to the Controller  that  it  is  not

possible  to  find  local men to do a  particular  job,

which  job  does not require the payment  of  $1,200  a

month,    the    Controller   will   give   sympathetic

consideration to the granting of an Employment Pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Telok Ayer then mentioned the

encouragement  of  foreign capital,  and  that  foreign

capital  will never be interested in coming  in  unless

they  are  allowed to bring in their own  people.  Sir,

under  the proposal here, anyone whose entry is in  the

economic   interest  of  Singapore  will   be   granted

permanent stay, and along with him will be his  family,

that  is,  his wife and children up to the  age  of  18

years. That is a great encouragement to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the senior jobs as managers and

accountants, they will be allowed Employment Passes  if

they  can produce a contract showing that these  people

are  being  employed for a certain period at a  certain

figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit more difficult, Sir, in regard to

partners. Now, partners can be sleeping partners.  They

need  not  be  interested  in  the  management  of  the

business. But just by reason of the fact that they  are

partners  and  that they should be allowed  entry  into

Singapore is, I submit, not in the best interest of the

economy  of  Singapore.  If before  a  new  venture  is

started  they  are partners, they will, of  course,  be

allowed  in,  but not for already established  business

which  desires  to  bring  in their  friends  or  their

relatives, by just transferring some shares to  someone

outside  Singapore, and then claiming that that  person

should have a right of entry by reason of the fact that

he  owns some shares in that business. I think in  such

cases it

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, the hon. Member knows that

two clear days' notice of an amendment must be given. If

no  notice is given, then the hon. Member must seek  the

assent of the Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member indicate what the

satisfied, then I will not move an amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The procedure is a bit

complicated  but  I  think, if the hon.  Member  is  not

satisfied  with  any part of clause 5, he  should  first

seek  permission to move an amendment. After  permission

has  been given, he can move his amendment. After  that,

if he is satisfied, he can ask for leave to withdraw his

amendment. Perhaps if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>



will indicate the nature of his amendment, I can assist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, the nature of the amendment is

this.   In   place   of  the  words   "any   established

government",  I  wish  to  substitute  "any  established

friendly government".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it the hon. Member is now

seeking the assent of the Members of the Assembly?

Member  for  Farrer  Park  be given  leave  to  move  an

amendment. The amendment is, in page 3, line  24,  after

"established" to insert "friendly". Do hon. Members give

their assent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: No.

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps now the hon. Member would like

to comment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I think the Hon. Chief Minister will

agree  with  me  that Communist China is an  established

Government.  If  it  is so, and if this  amendment  goes

through,  it  would mean, if the principal Ordinance  is

amended  according  to  the  Bill,  that  a  person  who

believes  in  or  advocates the overthrow  by  force  or

violence  of  any established government  in  Malaya  is

therefore a prohibited person. So, if Communist China is

an  established  Government, then the Americans  or  the

Formosans who are trying to overthrow the Government  of

Communist  China are prohibited persons. So, is  it  the

intention  of  this Government to exclude  Americans  or

Formosans  from entering Singapore? If  it  is  so,  the

Chief  Minister should inform this House. Or is  it  the

intention of this Government that those people  who  are

already established here - the Americans and Formosans who

are  already here - will be repatriated? If it is so,  the

Chief Minister should inform this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the proposed amendment to

bring   in   "established  government"  is   to   state

categorically that Singapore does not wish to encourage

any kind of politics which is foreign to Singapore.  It

does not play favourites with one side or the other. If

anyone  indulges  in the overthrow of  any  established

government by violence or, according to the words here,

Sir,  "by force or violence", such a one should not  be

allowed entry into Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry, Sir, but I do not

understand what the Chief Minister says. I see he  does

not  understand what I have said. If it is proved  that

any  foreign  government  or  a  member  of  a  foreign

government  goes  against  any established  government,

that  person  will  not have any right  of  entry  into

Singapore. If it is also proved that Communist China is

an  established  Government, then  Formosa  is  against

Communist  China. Then Formosans should not be  allowed

entry  into  Singapore. America  is  against  Communist

China.  Therefore the Americans should not  be  allowed

entry  into  Singapore.  You must  delete  "established

government".  You say: "Ah, we must not interfere  with

political   intentions."  If   America   went   against

Communist China, we must declare that Singapore  should

have  nothing to do with them. But when you say:  "When

any government goes against an established government",

then  it  is admitted that Formosa is against Communist

China,  and America is against Communist China  because

Communist China is an established Government,  and  you

treat  those persons as prohibited persons. There  must

be  some proper explanation. Sir, either you delete the

words  "established  government"  or  you  admit   that

Communist China is not an established government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Chairman is

responsible for drafting the Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member will address

the Chair.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Chairman, I am sorry I do

not  understand this point. I want an explanation  from

the  Chief  Minister.  If any foreign  government  goes

against an established government, that government,  or

the  citizens of that government, will not have a right

of  entry  into  Singapore. Perhaps the Chief  Minister

will  make  me  understand. Then, if it is  established

that Communist China is an established government, then

America  is  against Communist China,  and  Formosa  is

against  Communist China, and naturally  the  Americans

should not be allowed here and the Formosans should not

be  allowed  here.  Or, Mr Chairman,  Government  must

admit  that  Communist  China  is  not  an  established

government,  which this Government is not  prepared  to

admit. Some vital amendment is necessary on this.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I too had great

difficulty  in understanding what the hon.  Member  was

trying to say! But, anyway, I will try to reply to what

he  said.  This is an Immigration Ordinance to regulate

the  entry of persons, but not of governments  at  all.

Any person who, in the view of the Government, believes



in  or advocates the overthrow by force or violence  of

any  established government shall not be allowed  entry

into  Singapore. That is in plain language! If he wants

to  start overthrowing any established Government, then

let him go and do it elsewhere!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I put the Question, will the

Chief Minister direct his attention to page 3, line 31?

Should not the word "between" read "within"? The  words

quoted  are  from  the Ordinance  itself,  and  in  the

Ordinance  the  word  "within"  occurs-unless  I   have

misread the Ordinance!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.26 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance came into

operation  on 1st March, 1951, and there  has  been  no

decrease   in  the  illicit  traffic  of   opium   into

Singapore.  This  calls  for  the  necessity  for   the

imposition  of sterner measures to ensure the  complete

eradication of this evil. The proposed amendments  have

been framed with a view to closing certain loopholes in

the  law  made  apparent in the light of its  practical

working. They provide for more stringent action against

opium  smugglers, dealers and vendors, and  also  ship-owners  and  masters, when responsible ships'  officers

are  shown to have been negligent in supervision,  with

the  result  that  their  vessels  are  used  for  drug

trafficking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 gives statutory definitions of "pipe" and

"utensil", used in opium smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 are drafted to combat difficulties

which  have  been encountered in the interpretation  of

the  word  "possession". Section 6 of the Ordinance  is

expanded by the addition of the word "Keeps". Section 9

(1)  (b)  is  similarly expanded by  adding  the  words

"custody or control".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 10 of the Ordinance by

substituting  the words "is found in or  escaping  from

any  place" for the words "frequents any place", as  it

is  found  to be extremely difficult to prove frequency

of  visits  to  places where opium is consumed.  It  is

expected that only a nominal penalty will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>



be imposed in cases where the Court is satisfied that a

person  found in an opium den is there for an  innocent

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 11 of the Ordinance to

empower  the  Minister to amend Part III of  the  First

Schedule  to  the  Ordinance, either to  secure  strict

control  of any dangerous drugs not hitherto listed  in

the Schedule, or to delete therefrom any drug which has

been exempted from control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, which amends section 12, makes it clear

that  the  unauthorised possession of drugs  listed  in

Part  III of the Third Schedule to the Ordinance is  an

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8, which expands section 15, is designed to

make persons found escaping from premises used for  any

of  the  purposes listed in section 13 of the Ordinance

liable to punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 empowers the Minister to authorise the

temporary removal from a ship or an aircraft, for  safe

keeping,  dangerous drugs in transit through Singapore.

Such  powers are particularly necessary in the case  of



air freight consignments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magistrates, Justices of the Peace and senior

officers  of  the  Police are at present  empowered  to

issue  search  warrants  and to  conduct  searches.  In

former  times senior officers of the Customs Department

were appointed Justices of the Peace, but this practice

has  now  been  dropped, and clauses 10 and  11,  which

amend respectively sections 27 and 27A are designed  to

permit  such officers of the Department to issue search

warrants  and to conduct searches, since the Department

still plays a major part in suppressing the traffic  in

dangerous drugs, and frequently needs to operate  under

a search warrant at night. Clause 10, in addition, also

enables  these officers to board aircraft  as  well  as

ships in the course of their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12, which amends section 28, makes an attempt

to  dispose of case property as much an offence as  the

actual destruction of such property.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 is intended to prevent the removal of any

conveyance  which  has been used for the  transport  of

dangerous drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 brings section 30 of the Ordinance into

line  with  similar provisions relating to seizure  and

forfeiture contained in the Customs Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has also been taken in clause 15 to

clarify  the  meaning of section  35  (2)  (b)  of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 strengthens the presumptions under section

37 (c) of the Ordinance. It follows a similar provision

under the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance, and makes  it

possible to take proceedings against persons who  erect

obstructions against legal entry into premises for  the

administration  of dangerous drugs.  Paragraph  (b)  of

this  clause extends the presumption in section 37  (d)

of the Ordinance to cases where a person has custody or

control  of anything containing a dangerous  drug,  and

the  opportunity  has been taken in  paragraph  (d)  to

remove  an  ambiguity  under  section  37  (h)  of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 is designed to make the owners of premises

exercise greater responsibility and to prevent the rise

of   their   property   for  purposes   involving   the

administration  or  smoking  of  dangerous  drugs.   It

empowers  the police to take action against owners  and

magistrates  to  order the demolition  of  obstructions

erected  to  faciliate the administration of  dangerous

drugs or smoking or other consumption of such drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 amends section 38 (1) of the Ordinance, to

make  owners and masters of vessels jointly liable  for

the   negligence  of  any  responsible  officer,  which

results  in the vessel being used for the smuggling  of

dangerous  drugs. This clause is based upon the  United

Kingdom Customs and Excise Act, 1952.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has the support of all the authorities

concerned  with  the  suppression  of  the  traffic  of

narcotics, and of the Director of Medical Services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation with regard to narcotics smuggling into

Malaya  is  grave,  and it demands vigorous  and  early

action.  During  1958,  there  were  no  less  than  23

discoveries of illicit opium on board ships calling  at

Singapore, but because of the weakness in the  existing

provisions of the Ordinance, it was not possible in one

single instance to arrest those implicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Minor Offences

Ordinance  seeks to control a variety of  misdemeanours

and  nuisances  of  a minor character.  Experience  has

shown  that  the  provisions  of  this  Ordinance   are

inadequate to control certain of these offences and the

present Bill is designed to remedy that position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the amending Bill relates to Part II of

the  principal  Ordinance which deals  with  rules  and

orders  as  to assemblies, processions, etc. It  amends

the  definition  of  a "public place"  to  include  any

building or other place to which the public or a  class

of  the  public  have for the time  being  access.  The

amendment  is  required because at the present  time  a

meeting  held  in  a building or in an  enclosed  space

cannot  be  defined as a public meeting even though  it

may in fact be so by virtue of the fact that the public

or  a  class  of  the  public have access  thereto.  In

consequence, the police at present have no authority to

require  a permit for a public meeting which  is  being

held   in   a  building  or  an  enclosed  space.   The

opportunity is also taken to bring the definition of  a

"place of public resort" into line with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>



the    definition   now   contained   in   the    Public

Entertainments   Ordinance,  which  has   replaced   the

Theatres Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill makes provision for the control

of  catapults and similar weapons to which at present no

provision exists. Catapults are in common use  by  small

boys,  and  while it is not intended to  interfere  with

this  pastime,  provision  must  be  made  against   the

discharge  of such weapons in circumstances which  might

bring injury to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 12 of the

main  Ordinance  which deals with offences  relating  to

animals.  It  is at present a common practice  with  the

owners  of  animals to tether them on  private  land  or

Crown  land without the permission of the owner  of  the

land  or the Crown. It is desired to put an end to  this

practice.  The second subsection of this clause  of  the

amending  Bill is designed to ensure that herdsmen  keep

their animals under proper control when driving them  on

the highway. There have been many instances of accidents

occurring  on  public highways as a  result  of  animals

being  permitted to wander when supposedly  under  their

herdsmen's    charge.    This   new    section    places

responsibility for the control of the animals firmly  on

the herdsmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first subsection of clause 5 of the Bill relates

to  the  obstruction of public roads and  footways.  The

existing  section  makes reference to "goods"  but  this

word  has no proper grammatical definition, whereas  the

word  "article" can be clearly defined. The use  of  the

word  "goods" in the existing Ordinance has in the  past

resulted  in  ambiguity  and, in consequence,  cases  of

obstruction have been dismissed by the courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second subsection of this clause makes it an

offence to cause obstruction on a public road by  carts,

wheelbarrows,  bicycles,  tricycles  or  other  vehicles

which  can  effectively cause obstruction. The  existing

Ordinance makes no provision for this offence, which has

been shown in the past to occasion considerable nuisance

to the general public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third subsection of this clause makes it an

offence  to place any projection over or along a  public

road  at a height of less than 8 feet. It has been found

that  owners of property abutting on the public  highway

have  erected  such projections which  are  not  only  a

nuisance but may be dangerous to passers-by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 6 of the Bill is designed to increase

the  maximum fine for wilful trespass from the  existing

figure  of $20 to a sum of $100, which is considered  to

be  more in keeping with the present scale of fines  for

minor offences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This Bill does not come within the

province  of our Minister for Communications and  Works.

Is it proper for him to move



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>



this  Bill  when, in fact, the Minister for  Health  was

well enough to attend the banquet for the Duke?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order. It

is  not  within my province as to who moves  Bills.  Mr

Nair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. Domiciliary

midwifery is extensively practised in Singapore and,  as

all  hon. Members are aware, our birth rate figures  are

rising  and  will  continue to  rise.  It  is  therefore

essential  that midwives be experts in that field,  both

for  the  safeguarding of the lives of  the  mother  and

child and for maintaining their professional standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Midwives Board, constituted under the Midwives

Ordinance,  find it therefore necessary to  redraft  the

rules  which  govern  the  registration,  training   and

supervision  of  midwives. In order  that  this  may  be

effected, the Midwives (Amendment) Bill makes  a  number

of amendments to the Midwives Ordinance, Cap. 192, so as

to give the Board powers to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opportunity is taken to make the amendments so

that reference to Christmas Island, the Cocos or Keeling

Islands,  is omitted and to correct the designations  of

the members of the Board so as to bring them up to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Midwives

Ordinance to remove the word "Central" in the  title  of

the  Midwives Board, as the Midwives Ordinance will only

apply  to  Singapore,  and to amend  the  definition  of

"local  supervising authority" to bring it in line  with

the reorganisation of local government in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill repeals and reenacts section 6 of

the  Ordinance  in  order  to define  more  clearly  the

persons  who  are  entitled to be registered  under  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 7, to correct the

designations  of the persons who are to  constitute  the

Board.  It  also gives the Board power to act  when  any

vacancy  occurs  in its membership and to  appoint  such

committees  as it thinks fit to execute the  duties  and

responsibilities on behalf of the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, which amends section 8, gives power to the

Midwives Board to make such rules as may be required  to

be  prescribed under the Ordinance. It also enables  the

Board  to prescribe the fees to be paid by midwives  and

pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 13 of the

Ordinance so as to enable the register of midwives to be

ready for publication in the Gazette in January of  each

year.  The  opportunity is also taken to make amendments

and correct minor errors in the Midwives Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 deletes a provision of section 5 of the

Midwives  Ordinance,  which  should  more  correctly  be

included in section 6 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 10 of the Bill make minor corrections to

the Midwives Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

do not have the Minister for Health present today. I had

remarked that if he was fit enough to attend the banquet

for the Duke, then he ought to be fit enough to move the

Bill  in  the Assembly. However, since he is  not  here,

could the Minister for Communications and Works tell  us

what  is  the  purpose  of clause  2?  It  says  in  the

Explanatory Statement - if I could help him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Midwives

Ordinance to remove the references to Christmas  Island,

the  Cocos or Keeling Islands and to the Singapore Rural

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> The amendment is brought about as a result

of the reorganisation of local government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Surely the Minister did not expect

to  get away with that? What is this reorganisation  of

local  government? How does this amendment  bring  into

effect  changes  in  the  law  to  line  up  with   the

reorganisation  of local government? If,  in  fact,  he

does  not understand this Bill, may I suggest that  the

debate  be postponed to a further day when the Minister

responsible can be present to attend to this Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Sir, the language of the existing section

2  is somewhat curious and refers to the Ordinance  not

coming into force in Christmas Island, or the Cocos  or

Keeling  Islands or in any part of the Singapore  Rural

Board  area without the Island of Singapore until  such

date  or dates as the Governor by notification  in  the

Gazette appoints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now desirable to remove the Christmas Island

and  the  Cocos or Keeling Islands provision - I  do  not

think   the   hon.  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar   will

misunderstand that - but this reference to  any  part  of

the  Singapore Rural Board area has become  unnecessary

because,  by clause 3, the local supervising  authority

is now being changed. At present the law has a somewhat

complicated provision for providing that in  the  Rural

Board  area  the officer performing the duties  of  the

Chief  Health Officer and in any other area the officer

performing the duties of Health Officer in that area is

by  definition, the local supervising authority. Now we

are changing that and simplifying it, so that the local

supervising authority within the City remains the  City

Health  Officer;  but  outside  the  City  it  is   the

Assistant Director



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>



of  Medical Services (Health) - just one person. So we do

not  need any reference to parts of the Singapore Rural

Board  area.  The phraseology of the new section  2  is

perhaps  a little unusual, but it seems that an attempt

was  made  to  make as few changes as possible  in  the

Ordinance.  The Christmas Island and Cocos  or  Keeling

Islands  references have been cut out and  so  has  the

reference  to parts of the Singapore Rural Board  area.

It is now unnecessary to have any reference to parts of

that  area. It is unusual, but I think the hon.  Member

will  find  that,  if he looks at this clause  together

with  section  3 of the Ordinance as it  will  be  when

amended,   it  is  in  fact  in  order  and  reasonably

satisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indebted to

the   Attorney-General  for  a   very   elaborate   and

complicated explanation. But I would like to make  this

point  before we pass on to the other clauses.  When  a

Bill is moved in this House, Members have the right  to

expect that the Minister who moves it knows what he  is

moving, otherwise we shall be making a mockery  of  the

whole solemn process of legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you have been at pains to maintain

the  dignity and the solemnity of this House. Those  of

us  who want to see this Chamber retain its dignity  in

the eyes of the people are also anxious to see that  we

are  not made into rubber stamps. When a Minister comes

forward to explain what he is doing, we expect,  first,

that he knows what he is explaining; secondly, that  he

is in a position to elaborate further on anything which

he  has  failed to explain, and, lastly, that  he  will

have  the  courtesy to study his brief before he  comes

into this Chamber. It is not his business-

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I just want to make one comment. It is

now  clear  that the hon. Member has raised  his  point

intentionally and I do not believe for a moment that he

did not understand it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>

thought  that I would refer to it later when we come  to

clause  3  (b)  where  it  is specifically  stated  that

outside the City of Singapore, the Assistant Director of

Medical Services (Health) will be responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have come to the Assembly after reading very

carefully  through the Bill and I hope that  I  will  be

able  to satisfy the Member on any question that he  may

raise.  I hope that minor omissions of this nature  will

not  be  raised by the hon. Member who fully understands

the meaning of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I complete my observations? When

the Minister for Communications and Works-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think all this is completely

irrelevant to the clause. I think the hon. Member has

gone as far as he ought to, and I think the Minister has

answered as far as he has been able to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

thought,   before  this  matter  was  raised,   that   I

understood  this but I now feel that I do not.  Could  I

have  it  clarified for me - that the effect of  the  new

clause 2 is that the Governor will have to notify in the

Gazette before the Ordinance operates in Pulau Tekong or

in  the  Southern  islands or in  any  of  the  outlying

islands? Is that the effect of the new clause or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> That is so, Sir. That is one effect of

this change in clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 7 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I give an opportunity to the

Minister to show how well he understands this Bill?  Why

is it necessary, according to the Explanatory Statement,

"to give the Midwives Board more extensive power to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>



rules in order to enable it to carry out its duties  and

exercise its power under the Ordinance"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, the powers requested under this Bill

are  that the Midwives Board may act notwithstanding any

vacancy  in  its  membership, and,  when  it  thinks  it

necessary, may appoint from among its members Committees

to  act on its behalf. The Midwives Board may also  make

any  rules  that may be required to be prescribed  under

the  Ordinance. The Board may prescribe the fees  to  be

paid by midwives and pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, in the best interest of the service and

of  the  efficient working of the Board, it is desirable

that the Board should have these adequate powers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I rephrase the question in a more

simple  way?  There  are certain existing  powers  given

under the existing Ordinance. The note at the bottom  of

page 4 of the Bill says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clause 7 of the Bill amends section 8 of Midwives

Ordinance  to  give  the Midwives Board  more  extensive

power  to make rules in order to enable it to carry  out

its duties and exercise its power under the Ordinance."



<br><br>As  a  Member of this Legislature whose duty it  is  at

least  to  understand what we are supposed to legislate,

may  I ask the Minister for Communications and Works why

the  former powers were inadequate and in what way  they

were  found lacking so that this amendment is necessary?

It is very simple.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I have not been able to look into the

working  of  the Midwives Board, but I am  advised  that

they  want  to  have  adequate power for  the  efficient

working  of the Board. I assure the hon. Member  that  I

will  look  into  this  question and  I  will  give  the

information to him in writing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I must apologise for putting the

Minister to such inconvenience. I would like to find out

when  he  was so advised. Was it this morning before  he

was asked to read his speech in this Assembly, or was it

some  time  before that? Was there sufficient  time  not

only  to  digest but also to assimilate the matter  that

was placed before him?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I think I have answered the question

clearly. I have made an honest admission that I have not

looked  into  the  particular question before.  I  never

thought for a moment that the hon. Member would not  be

aware of these things, but if the hon. Member can accept

my  assurance that I will look into it, then this matter

can  be  closed. But if he wants to question  me  as  to

whether I understand the problem seriously, I think that

is a different matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is some little time

since  I  personally had to consider section  8  of  the

Midwives  Ordinance, but if my memory serves  me  right,

some  doubt has been cast on the powers of the Board  to

prescribe fees to be paid by persons who are not in fact

midwives,  and  that  I believe is  the  reason  why  an

alteration is being made to paragraph (j) of  section  8

of  the Ordinance - by the addition of specific power  to

prescribe fees to be paid by pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I must confess that I cannot at the moment

remember  the  precise details of why  all  these  other

alterations  have to be made, but I do know  that  there

was  close consultation with the Ministry of Health  and

with  the  Midwives Board before this Bill was put  into

its  final form. I observe in the present Ordinance that

there  is  not  the general provision now sought  to  be

given  by  the additions referred to on page 4  of  this

Bill  as  paragraphs (k) and (l), although there  is  in

section 8 power to frame various rules and to do various

acts - the two things are separated. There is power to  do

acts  reasonably necessary for the carrying out  of  the

provisions of the Ordinance, and then there is  specific

power to frame rules, but those powers are limited,  and

the  addition  of the new paragraphs (k)  and  (l)  will

undoubtedly  make  for  more  freedom.  I  believe   the

Midwives  Board has, in the past, found that its  powers

have  been too closely circumscribed, and it is for that

reason  that  they are now seeking to have their  powers

widened.  There is nothing unusual in the  widening  now

proposed. It is something that is quite common  in  most

of our Ordinances, but

perhaps the position was slightly different in 1923 when

the Midwives Ordinance was first enacted.

bring  them  to this House to move and second  it,  have

shown  in  the course of this debate that  they  do  not

not  think all those remarks are related to the contents

he  ought to confine his remarks to specific clauses  in

with  that word. But the context in which I had intended

to  use  that phrase was some legislative approbium,  to

Communications  and Works could tell  us  why,  in  the

first  place, the Bill was tabled, why it has  suddenly

been  decided to withdraw it, and whether we can expect

in  the  not  too distant future the First  Reading  of

another  Bill of precisely the same character. I  would

like  to add, since I see that the Attorney-General  is

extremely eager to help his unfortunate colleague, that

whatever  the  duties of the leading Counsel  for  the

Crown  are,  they  do not include the lifesaving  of  a

drowning elected colleague.

I   think  it  may  assist  the  House  to  know   that

publication  of this Bill after it had  been  read  the

First time has resulted, as one always hopes it will in

the  expression of ideas and constructive criticism  by

members  of  the  public. In this  particular  case,  I

believe  constructive suggestions were made by  members

of the medical profession. Those suggestions go further

than  what was originally proposed in the Bill,  and  I

can  assure the House that a fresh, bigger and a better

Bill  is  already in preparation. I confidently  expect

that  this  bigger and better Bill which  has  resulted

from  the assistance given by the medical practitioners

who   read  this  Bill  on  its  publication  will   be

introduced into the Assembly at some convenient date.

are  called  Lists  (A)  and (B)  in  respect  of  the

register  for  the  Assembly  Elections  and  of   the

register for the Local Government Elections. List  (A)

consists  of those persons who have died  or  for  any

other  reason have to be struck off the register,  and

List  (B)  consists of those persons who  have  become

qualified  to  come  on  to  the  register  since  the

previous year's register was prepared. Now that it has

been  agreed  that there shall be a common  franchise,

this  enables  a combined register to be prepared  for

both  sets  of elections, and if an order is  made  to

provide for a combined register, then it is clearly  a

saving  in  time and work to provide that  there  need

only be one set of amendments to the previous register

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of having a combined register instead

of   two  registers  will  be  one  register  for  all

electoral  purposes,  and  since  there  is   separate

provision  or  will  be separate provision  under  the

Assembly  Elections  Ordinance  and  under  the  Local

Government Ordinance for electors who fail  to  record

their  votes to be struck off the register, it follows

that  if this sanction has to be applied under  either

of the Ordinances, then the name will be expunged from

the  combined  register  and  it  must  therefore   be

rejected for both purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I explained in moving the Second Reading of

the  Bill, it is proposed that the operation  of  this

section,  which provides for the Returning Officer  to

check  which  electors  have failed  to  record  their

votes, should be implemented from the marked copies of

the  registers  kept at the Polling  Station.  As  the

clause is at present drafted, it is not clear that the

purpose  is  to  enable  these marked  copies  of  the

registers to be retained by the Returning Officer,  so

that  if at any future date there is a dispute  as  to

whether  or  not any particular elector  recorded  his

vote,  then the record will be available for scrutiny.

That  is  the  purpose of this amendment  and  of  the

following amendment+ which I shall shortly be moving.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+The amendment is as follows:-

and  gone  may  still be found in the  register.  Now,

there is a penalty imposed on those living people  who

do  not  come  to  vote, but how  will  the  Returning

Officer  know  that  such a person has  purposely  not

voted, or that he is dead, or has left this country?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the explanation which the hon. Member

for Telok Ayer requests is to be found in clause 17 of

the  Bill  which  sets  out the  procedure  after  the

conclusion  of the elections. The marked copy  of  the

register will be passed to the Returning Officer,  who

prepares  a list of the registered electors  who  have

failed to record their votes. That list is then passed

on  to the Registration Officer who expunges the names

of  all those persons from the electoral register.  In

the  case  of persons who are already deceased,  their

names  will remain expunged. In the case of those  who

are  still  alive,  if they wish to have  their  names

restored  to the register, they are required to  apply

to  the Registration Officer in writing and to furnish

an explanation as to why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>



they  failed to record their votes. If the explanation

is acceptable to the Registration Officer, their names

will  be  restored without penalty. If the reason  for

failing  to  record  the  vote  is  not  regarded   as

satisfactory, then a penalty of $5 is imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment made: In page 5, line 30, after "section",

to  insert  "and of any inquiries connected therewith"

<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

names  shall be restored to the register at  the  next

ensuing revision of the same.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is a purely

practical one. As I explained just now in reply to the

hon.  Member for Telok Ayer, it will be open to  every

person  who has failed to record his vote to apply  to

the  Registration  Officer  at  any  time  by  written

application to have his name restored to the register.

It would clearly be quite impracticable if, when a by-election  was in progress, a large number  of  persons

should  apply at that time to the Registration Officer

and have the right to have their names restored to the

register.  It would be quite impossible  to  make  the

necessary   arrangements  for  the  by-election.   The

purpose,  therefore, of this amendment is  to  provide

that  these names shall be restored at the  time  when

the election registers are next revised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause, as amended, will stop at line 35 on the

word  "family".  The  words to be  left  out  are  "or

borrowing a motor vehicle from a member of his  family

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is to be a prohibition on

the  use of motor cars as an inducement to get  voters

to the polls, then I feel it right and proper that the

word  "family"  should  be restricted,  otherwise  the

provisions  will  be circumvented by people  allegedly

lending their motor cars to alleged members of a  very

big class of persons who are defined in sub-clause (3)

as  "family". Together with this amendment is the one*

which  I  shall  be moving shortly, in which  "family"

will  be  restricted to mean only a  person's  spouse,

parents  and  children  instead  of,  as  at  present,

including  grandparents, grandchildren,  brothers  and

sisters. I do not think I need further say anything as

to  the  purpose of the amendment. This is  an  agreed

amendment.  The intention was agreed.  The  draft  has

also  been  agreed  between the  Attorney-General  and

to make is that whilst the original draft was based on

the  English  Representation of the  People's  Act,  I

consider  that in the context of the society  that  we

have,  the  word  "family" becomes so elastic  and  so

omnibus  a  phrase that almost anybody is a member  of

someone's  family. If we are to prevent the  wholesale

flouting  of  the laws regarding transport,  then  the

word  "family"  must be restricted  to  the  immediate

family,  which  is  really the purport  of  the  whole

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(4) Between the

hours of 8.00 am and 8.00 p.m. on polling day no

person shall park a motor vehicle within one hundred

yards of any polling station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Any person who contravenes the provisions of

subsection  (4) of this section shall  be  liable  on

conviction  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  one  hundred

hereinafter  provided,  arrest  without  warrant  any

person  in charge of or driving a motor vehicle,  who

has committed or is suspected of having committed  an

offence under this section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The power of arrest under the preceding

subsection shall not be exercised if either-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) such person on the demand of the police officer

produces  his  driving licence so as  to  enable  such

that  a  name  or address so ascertained or  given  is

false he may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary

in  this  subsection provided, exercise the  power  of

arrest under the preceding subsection.".".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this somewhat comprehensive provision is, in

short,  designed  to ensure that the entrance  to  any

polling  station shall not be blocked or cluttered  up

by motor vehicles. This is a new provision. The reason

for  its  introduction is that in  past  elections  we

found that polling stations were invariably obstructed

by  motor  vehicles  parked in front  of  the  polling

station.  Although we shall not be having  competition

to    provide   free   transport   for   the   voters,

nevertheless, it is quite possible that people who own

cars  will  still  park  their  cars  outside  polling

stations,  thus  causing  general  congestion.  I  had

originally  drafted the amendment by way of  reference

to the Road Traffic Rules so that to park a motor car

within 100 yards of the polling station, shall  be  an

offence within the Road Traffic Rules, like parking  a

motor  car  within so many feet of a fire hydrant,  so

many feet of a bus stop, or so many feet of the corner

of  a  street.  But  I am told by the Attorney-General

that  he  considered the Road Traffic Rules  a  highly

inelegant  piece  of  subsidiary legislation,  and  he

intends, in the not too distant future, to dispose  of

it.  That being the case, he has helped to draft  this

very  comprehensive, elaborate, but I am sure  equally

effective,  series of clauses to make it  possible  to

impose  a  penalty  if  anybody  should  breach   this

provision. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, may I ask this question? It

appears  that  if one parks within 99½  yards  from  a

polling station, one creates an offence for which one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>



can  be  arrested. Who is going to be responsible  for

carefully delineating this boundary of 100 yards?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the same persons who

are  responsible for measuring 30 yards  from  a  fire

hydrant,  for  a motorist who parks on  a  road  which

contains a fire hydrant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I make one comment on what the mover of

these amendments has said with regard to the drafting?

One  of my objections to the draft originally prepared

was that it was putting an offence into this law by  a

cross-reference  to  another  law.  It  is,  I  think,

undesirable  that  we should seek  to  amend  laws  by

references made in other pieces of legislation. When a

piece  of  legislation is unsatisfactory  or  requires

amplification   or  an  amendment,   that   piece   of

legislation should ordinarily be itself amended. It is

only  confusing  to  do it by, as it  were,  a  cross-reference.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I wish only to say one thing in

connection  with  the  amendment.  It  does  impose  a

further  duty on the police force. In connection  with

the  remarks made by Sir Ewen Fergusson, I would  wish

to  reiterate what I said in moving the Second Reading

of  the  Bill, that the success or otherwise of  these

provisions  which are being made will  depend  on  the

voluntary  observance  by  the  people  concerned.  We

cannot  expect the police force who have only  limited

numbers  to  cover all their duties and to  cope  with

very   substantial  or  numerous  breaches  of   these

different  provisions which we are making  under  this

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Regarding the point raised by Sir

Ewen  Fergusson, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do  not  see  any

difficulty arising on that score. It is a common sight

along  any street to find a "No Parking" sign  with  a

blue background, a white "P", and a red line across it

meaning  no parking, and an arrow indicating "Starting

from  this  point". I can trust the  police  force  to

measure  accurately and fairly. All that  they  really

need  do  is  to  take two such posts and  place  them

outside a polling station.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Ordinance may be defective

and  it is the Government's duty to put it right.  But

in  the meantime, there is no reason why we should not

accept  this  amendment specially for the purposes  of

this election. As such, I support this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Chief Secretary says that it will be an

additional  duty on the police force. One  should  not

forget that an election is held once in four years and

this will be the most important election so far. Every

precaution  should be taken to see that no one  abuses

the  loopholes that are left, and the purpose of  this

amendment is to plug those loopholes in the  cases  of

motorists  who  possibly  and  intentionally  try   to

obstruct roads and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, I am not saying that

this  amendment is no good. But what I want is a point

of  clarification.  I do believe that  there  are  car

owners  who  do live within a radius of  100  miles  -

[Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so sorry. It is 100 yards. If such owners do

normally park their cars within 100 yards of a polling

station, it may be just in front of their houses.  Are

we to prohibit, or are the police or some authority to

see  that  they should take their cars away  from  the

frontage  of their houses? If this is so, then  should

it  be covered in this amendment or not? And if it  is

not  covered in this amendment, I think it is  subject

to  abuse, because car owners can claim that they have

the right in that they do pay road taxes to have their

cars  parked  in front of their houses. I  would  like

this to be clarified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was of the fond opinion that when

I dealt with the Chief Minister, I dealt with a person

who  had the necessary credentials to speak on  behalf

of  the  S.P.A. I am sorry to learn today that he  did

not  speak  on  behalf of at least one member  of  the

S.P.A.!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am quite sure that the leader of the S.P.A.,

namely  the Hon. the Chief Minister, is a man  who  is

quite circumspect in these matters, and has considered

the  possibility of inconvenience to people  who  have

motor cars and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>



who  happen  to  park them continually  outside  their

houses,  which may be within 100 yards  of  a  polling

station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these things have been properly considered, on

one   occasion  not  only  by  the  President  of  the

S.P.A. - or  is  it  the Chairman? - but also  by  another

accredited leader who has just entered this  House.  I

should imagine that if he finds the Chief Minister  an

unworthy member of his Party he should at least accept

the  Member for Serangoon a person worthy to represent

him at these talks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am afraid

that  the Member for Tanjong Pagar only consulted  the

Chief Minister and it is so unfortunate that I am  not

the Chief Minister!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question arose out of the question raised by Sir

Ewen Fergusson and it struck me that such an important

issue  should also be clarified. I am rather surprised

that a man like the Member for Tanjong Pagar, who  has

all  the legal training behind him, is now anxious  to

know  that  we  should speak with one voice  with  the

Chief  Minister. If I were the Chief Minister and  the

hon. Member had consulted me, I think I would not have

brought up this point. A Member has the right to bring

up  any  question in this Assembly on the spur of  the

moment.  I  am surprised that the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar himself is not aware of it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It would appear, Sir, from what

the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar said in reply to the

hon. Member for Queenstown, that whenever he moves  an

amendment  to any Government motion or any  Government

Bill,  he  would  like to seek the assistance  of  the

Chief  Minister to help him to paddle it through.  And

when  any  questions, either embarrassing or not,  are

asked, it will have to be the Chief Minister who  will

have to come to his rescue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while it is true that there have been

consultations with me and my Ministerial colleagues on

the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar, we did not take into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>



consideration the point raised by the hon. Member  for

Queenstown. A question has been asked of him. This  is

his amendment and no doubt he has a reply to the point

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Sir, given further thought to the amendment

proposed  and  I have an amendment to propose  to  the

amendment.  This amendment which I am  going  to  move

seeks  to give special consideration to the aged,  the

sick  and  the  infirm to have motor cars  bring  them

right up to the gate of the polling station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, Sir, during the Second Reading of this Bill

last month, that the Bill incorporates everything that

was  agreed  in the amendments to the Local Government

Elections  Ordinance and that the amendments  proposed

in   that   Ordinance  were  as  a   result   of   the

deliberations  in the Select Committee  on  which  the

hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar sat as  a  Member.  It

would appear, Sir, that he has had further thoughts on

the matter and felt that further improvements could be

made - hence  the proposed amendment. I agree  with  him

that  his second thoughts now appear to be better and,

apart  from the amendment which I am going to  propose

to his amendment, Government supports his motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, elaborating on

the Chief Minister's remarks, may I use the very words

used  by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar - that we  do

not want to be rubber-stamped in this House? It was he

who said this morning that anyone who moves any motion

in  this  House  should be able to  clarify  it.  This

amendment is moved by the Member for Tanjong Pagar and

it  is his duty and responsibility to answer questions

raised by any Member in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Having been terrorised into making

a  defence  of myself, may I say, with temerity,  that

the  Member  for  Queenstown has every  right  to  ask

S.P.A. is a properly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>



organised Party and that the leader  speaks  on

behalf of his Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to the series of meetings with the

leaders of other Parties, I thought I was dealing with

plenipotentiaries. It now appears that I  was  dealing

with people who are playing marbles, and are incapable

of pledging their Party to anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to explain for the benefit of

the Member for Queenstown that there was nothing that

he  had raised which had not been carefully considered

by  his  able leader, the Member for Havelock. He  had

considered all the points, including the one raised by

the  Member  for Queenstown, and had decided  that  my

second thought - as he had chosen to call it - is, to  say

the  least, an improvement on the first draft  of  the

Government.  But  if the Member for  Queenstown  would

like  to know why we did not raise the matter earlier,

I  will tell him that I never believed that there were

going  to  be  local government elections  within  the

lifetime of this Government, and that I saw no  reason

why we should debate things which we were not going to

use.

adopted. And then whatever cohesion they may have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>



had  at  that time was no longer cohesive last  month,

and the poor Member for Tanjong Pagar had to stand  up

and  propose further amendments to improve on what  he

thought  was already very good! He now states that  he

did  nothing. He did not feel it was necessary for him

to  strain himself over the question of the amendments

to  the Local Government Elections Ordinance, although

he  knew  full  well  that  whatever  amendments  were

proposed  and  accepted  to that  Ordinance  would  be

incorporated in this Bill. He knew it was to be so. He

did  sit on the Select Committee. He did help to bring

about   considerable   improvements   to   the   Local

Government Elections (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he has given the matter further thought. He feels

that  further improvements should be made. And because

we are prepared to concede that there could be further

improvements, it would now appear that he is the  only

one  who knows how to make proposals to tighten up the

Elections Ordinance so that the elections in May could

be clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said I propose to move an amendment to

his amendment. Shall I do it now?

There  is a point which I shall raise when copies  are

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the amendment distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before the Chief Minister moves, I would

like  to  indicate the point which is in my mind.  The

original  amendment speaks of "a motor  vehicle".  The

prohibition is against a motor vehicle parking  within

one  hundred yards of any polling station.  The  Chief

Minister's   amendment  has  reference  only   to   "a

vehicle". Is the amendment meant to refer to "a  motor

vehicle"?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the word "motor" should be

inserted before the word "vehicle"?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I trust that hon. Members have followed

that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, after "station", to add "other than a

motor  vehicle used for the conveyance  of  any  sick,

infirm  or  disabled  person  for  such  time  as   is

reasonably necessary to enable such person to cast his

vote".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as compulsory voting will be introduced during

the  general  elections, it is felt that sick,  infirm

and   disabled   persons  should  be   given   special

sympathetic consideration and be allowed to ride in  a

motor  vehicle  right up to the gate  of  the  polling

station.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am gratified that the Chief

Minister admits that his Government also continues  to

keep  thinking, and to arrive at second thoughts which

add  to  the  general effectiveness of the  provisions

that  he  has  proposed. I have no objection  to  this

clause  being  added, but I would like to  remind  him

that  when  his draftsmen first prepared the  original

draft,  they had altogether forgotten about the  sick,

infirm  and disabled or other such unfortunate people.

I  would  like  to  add this for the  benefit  of  his

colleague,  the  Minister for Commerce and  Industry,

who  is  very  fond  of coming out with  bright  first

ideas.  Bright ideas can always do with some polishing

up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> It may be that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  has forgotten that I mentioned to him the sick,

the  aged  and  the  infirm before his  amendment  was

drafted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not to my recollection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I wonder whether I can seek clarification

on  the  amendment to the amendment. I presume that  a

motor  vehicle conveying a sick person  would  be  the

motor  vehicle  of a wife driving her husband  or  her

child, or something like that. It does not imply  that

I can take a sick person in my car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>



and  say,  "I  am now authorised by this  section."  I

would like to be quite clear that it does not vary the

law  and that it only permits a further thing for  the

sick.  It does not give them special rights which  are

not otherwise allowed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am always ready to oblige him.

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General pointed out  to

me, after I had proposed my amendment, that in fact  I

had left out the sick, the infirm and the disabled.  I

then pointed out to him that in his original draft  be

never  had  the sick, the infirm and the disabled.  So

now he is carrying out a partial amendment in that the

sick, the infirm and the disabled, whose family owns a

car,  can  go  to  a polling station,  park  within  a

hundred  yards of a polling station, go in  and  vote,

and then come back and sit in the car. As the hon. Mr

Francis  Thomas has pointed out, it does  not  include

disabled  people whose families do not own cars.  They

presumably,  will  stay on the register  because  they

have a good excuse.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it is so amusing for us on this

side  of the House to see a good fight between friends

who  have  been  three years together - ex-Labour  Front

Members,  now  S.P.A. and  the  P.A.P.!  It  is  very

amusing, Sir, but on this point about those who do not

own  cars  and because they are sick and infirm,  they

can  remain in the house, but they would like to vote.

If  this  provision is not included, I think a proviso

may  be  added  to  the end of this amendment  to  the

amendment - "for those who own a car". This is meant for

those who own a car and not others.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I point out

to  the  Member for Telok Ayer that it is not a change

of  mind  or a change of attitude? This is a piece  of

legislation   which  will  govern  a  very   important

election. The Member for Tanjong Pagar agreed  at  the

All-Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>



meeting  on the Local Government elections.  It

was  he who agreed to all those things. It never  came

into   his   mind  that  he  should  move  all   these

amendments. It is surprising that, after this new Bill

has come out, he has thought it necessary to move this

amendment  to  suit  the  conditions  of  the   coming

elections. It is an afterthought, and I think everyone

should  have afterthoughts. It was as a result of  his

afterthought that this amendment came about and it  is

my  afterthought  that  I should  make  the  intention

clear.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the amendment of the Chief

that, he must put it down in writing.

will permit me some time.

that the Clerk at the Table will assist him.

should do anything more about it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Now the original amendment, as amended,

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think that the Member for

Queenstown  proposed any amendment to  the  amendment,

but  I  would like to say a word about his  suggestion

that  a man, who has a motor car and also has a  house

with  a  frontage  on a public road within  a  hundred

yards  of a polling station, should have the right  to

park  his  car even though the public are not  allowed

to. If I understand him rightly, his view is that if a

man  owns a house, it entitles him thereby to the  use

of  the road for parking his car. This seems to me  to

be  totally wrong; I believe, in law and certainly  in

common  sense;  and I hope that no  illusion  will  be

spread that his suggestion is correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am a bit bewildered now as

to  the general tenor of the remarks. I would like  to

point out that there are certain streets in town where

people live, and they have traffic signs which say "No

parking  on even days". If you happen to live on  that

side  of the street and you own a car, you park  there

on  the  odd days. On the even days, if you park  your

car  there, you get a ticket, and the fine goes up for

every  even day that the car is left there. Similarly,

if  you  happen to live within a hundred  yards  of  a

polling  station, between the hours of  8.00  am, and 8.00  p.m., you betake yourself and your car  to  some

other more convenient place of abode.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much

obliged for the answer given by the Member for Tanjong

Pagar.  As a legal man, he should have given  me  that

explanation when I asked for it, rather than now after

everyone has told him so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 23, as amended,

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

comment on clause 23 - the use of motor vehicles at

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> in this House are aware that over 5,000

people  of  Tiong  Bahru  district  have  shifted   to

Kallang. They are there now because of the big fire in

Kampong Tiong Bahru on 13th February, 1959, and  I  am

quite  sure  that  about 50 per cent  of  these  5,000

people now living in Kallang are voters in my area.  I

wonder whether the Government will consider setting up

a  polling station in order that these people can cast

their votes in Kallang, instead of coming down to  the

Tiong Bahru district - a distance of several miles.  The

Chief  Minister  was kind enough  to  say  that  motor

vehicles  used for the conveyance of the sick,  infirm

or  disabled  would be allowed to  park  in  front  of

polling stations, and I am quite sure that among  this

large number of voters, he will give consideration  to

the  fact  there  may be quite a number  of  sick  and

infirm  persons. I would strongly urge that Government

either  set  up  a polling station in Kallang  itself,

where  there are thousands of workers, or allow  these

people  to  go  to  the district  of  Tiong  Bahru  in

vehicles provided by Government.

this to say:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That polling day would not be until late May is

February  that the Tiong Bahru fire victims should  be

rehoused in new low-cost housing on the burnt-out site

in  three months' time, i.e. 17th May. We can be  sure

pleasure - loving and indolent Ministers  are  rehousing

the  fire  victims  in  record time  for  reasons  not

unconnected  with the elections. If the  fireworks  of

the   great   Trade  Fair  had  not  turned   out   to

expectations, why not take advantage of the  fireworks

at Kampong Tiong Bahru? The Chief Minister turned out,

the  Chief  Minister  carrying a bucket  of  water  to

squash  out a fire threatening the lives of our people

following  day.  We find it hard to believe  that  the

target  date of three months for rehousing the victims

will  be  after  polling. Already  unprecedented  S.P.A.

Government   generosity  has  overwhelmed   the   fire

victims.  Free S.I.T, housing, until rehoused  in  three

months.  Some  cynical poor living in other  miserable

kampongs,  many  worse than Kampong Tiong  Bahru,  are

saying that it is better to burn out the kampongs  and

get  the  S.P.A. to repeat their philanthropic schemes

comes but once in five years. And an S.P.A. Government

but once in a lifetime."

the  Government  had  the doers who  could  equal  the

people  who did the thinking, and who could match  the

will  of the thinkers, then low-cost housing would  be

ready  before polling day. The voters will be  brought

back  there  before polling day, and  the  Member  for

Tiong  Bahru can rest assured that the purpose is  not

to  get them to vote for the present Member for  Tiong

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed

very  healthy  to see these friendly exchanges  across

the Table during the last sittings of the life of this

Assembly.  The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  felt  it

necessary  to quote from his Petir, which I  think  is

"The Lightning", and one does know the destruction  of

the lightning. And he went to the extent of suggesting

that it is because it is nearing election time that we

did   all   those   things  for  propaganda.   May   I

respectfully submit to the hon. Member,  Sir,  that  I

was  in  politics years and years ago, and whatever  I

did,  I  did  it  from  my heart, without  any  desire

whatever to seek publicity; unlike certain leaders  of

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, I

need   not   have  to  take  along  with  me   special

photographer  to  snap pictures and to  see  that  the

photographs taken at the scene of the devastation  are

properly published in the local newspapers. I did  not

know there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>



was  going  to be pictures taken, or that I asked  for

pictures to be taken. I have been working all my  life

helping  people whenever help was needed. In fact,  it

is true, Sir, that it is very difficult for leaders of

the  P.A.P. to believe that there are sincere  people

who  help  those in distress out of their  own  heart,

instead  of  seeking political credit  for  everything

that they do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they say the fact that we are going to build

houses  in three months' time is a political stunt  on

the  part of the S.P.A. If we do not do a thing,  they

will  say that this Government is rotten; it does  not

look  after the interests of the poor. And,  "If  your

houses get burnt, well, you have to look out! You have

a  very rotten Government which does not have sympathy

for your sufferings." I believe, Sir, even on the very

day  of the fire, while it was still raging, there was

a  P.A.P. propaganda machine out there saying that the

Government  was the cause of the fire! The  Government

was  the  cause of the fire! Sir, I do not  play  that

kind  of politics. Ten years have I served the people,

and  I  will  keep  on serving clean,  without  having

anything to do with politics. I do not have to try and

tell hawkers that we love them, although -

allowed  the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  to  depart

from  the  subject and bring in the case of  the  fire

victims  just  to explain the use of cars  on  polling

day.  I thought that in reply it was necessary for  me

too to say that I did not have to go to the extent  of

telling hawkers that I love them, and that I would not

arrest  them  anymore, although they were arrested  in

their  thousands only a few months ago. I do not  have

to do that, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have departed from the real purpose of

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really

surprised  at the remarks made by the hon. Member  for

Tanjong Pagar, that the flats being built or going  to

be  built by the Government on the site of the fire in

Kampong Tiong Bahru will be ready in three months; but

I   am  quite  sure  that  within  three  months   the

Government  will  not be able to  build  these  flats,

especially when they are multi-storey flats,  as  said

by  the Hon. the Chief Minister. So it is my duty,  as

the  people's  representative in Tiong Bahru,  to  see

that  these  people, now living in  Kallang,  are  not

being inconvenienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We either set up polling stations in Kallang for them

or take them down to their original polling districts.

Whether  they vote for me or for anybody else is  none



of  the business of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar.

My  concern is that it is our duty and I so  urge  the



Government  not  to inconvenience these  few  thousand

voters, some of whom are old men and women and who may

be  sick or infirm, by imposing compulsory voting  and

restricting  the use of vehicles, and  so  on  and  so

forth.  I  feel  that it is our duty  and  I,  as  the

elected representative in Tiong Bahru, feel it  is  my

duty  to draw the attention of the Government  to  the

lack of polling stations.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I have already given an undertaking

to  the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru, which I willingly

reiterate  since  he has felt it necessary  to  stress

the  point  again,  that we will  look  into  what  is

practicable in order to assist this particular section

of the population to record their votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 to 26 inclusive ordered to stand part of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 11, line 14, at end, to add- "; or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) open or maintain, for the purpose of any

activity directed towards promoting or procuring

the election of a candidate at any election, any

office  in  any  room,  building  or  any  place

whatsoever, whether open or enclosed,  within  a

radius  of  two  hundred yards  of  any  polling

station on polling day.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is provision in the Ordinance

to  prevent canvassing on polling day, and one of  the

loopholes which was left open was the use of  election

offices. No election office is prohibited, and it  may

well  be  that the practice in the past, of  using  or

requiring  election  offices as near  as  possible  to

polling  stations, would spread like  a  rash  if  the

purpose  is  to  try  to overcome  or  circumvent  the

provision   against   canvassing   on   polling   day.

Therefore,  I  move  this  amendment  to  prevent  any



election office from being used within 200 yards of  a

polling  station. The present provision  without  this

amendment  only  prohibits  canvassing,  which   means

activity  in a public place. This will close the  last

of  the  little  gaps  in the "no canvassing"  or  "no

activity" directed to procure votes on polling day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

afterthoughts  of  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  have

prompted me to move this amendment. The wording itself

sounds  very good, but I am surprised that,  with  all

his legal background and training, and although he has

admitted himself that prohibition of canvassing  would

come in, he has framed the amendment in this way.  The

original wording of the clause itself reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"73A.-(1) No person shall on polling day-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) by word, message, writing or in any other manner

endeavour  to  persuade any person  to  give  or

dissuade any person from giving his vote  at  an

election;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) visit an elector at his home or place of work for

any purpose in connection with an election."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>



I  will  omit  the  other part. I  will  come  now  to

73B.-(1) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) endeavour to establish the identity of any

person entering a polling station; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) check the name of any person entering a polling

station on any list at the approach to a polling

station; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) anywhere place any desk or table or establish

any office or booth for the purpose of recording

particulars of voters; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) wait outside any polling station on polling day,

except  for the purpose of gaining entry to  the

polling station to cast his vote; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) loiter in any street or public place within a

radius  of  two  hundred yards  of  any  polling

station on polling day."



<br><br>To say that you cannot open any office within a radius

of two hundred yards - I cannot see what purpose that

might have. It does not allow anybody to establish any

office or even place a desk anywhere at all. What is

the purpose, and what is the idea of this amendment

then, Sir? The hon. Member has got his legal training

in a Colonial country and should have been able to

frame these amendment in the way in which he has been

taught. Not to allow anybody to place a desk or

establish any office near a polling station! He has

even gone to the extent of restricting the

interpretation of "family" and he does not allow

grandchildren, or even -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not wander over matters

which are not before the Assembly. We have finished

with the amendment on "family". We should now consider

this particular amendment which is before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, I was only trying to

indicate and then clarify how this amendment comes in.

Now,  canvassing is not allowed. You  cannot  even  do

anything  at  all. Sir, how could you  then  allow  an

office  outside 200 yards of a polling station?  Would

not that be subject to abuse? If you can establish  an

office outside 200 yards of a polling station, what is

there to stop a voter going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>



that  office (or that desk) and obtain particulars  of

his  name on the electoral roll and, at the same time,

to  be canvassed by the people who sit at that desk to

vote  for  a certain Party? With all my experience  in

past  elections, the P.A.P. has swarmed over all polling

stations by establishing offices just in front of  the

polling  stations. An amendment is now moved  that  an

office  should  not be within 200 yards.  It  will  be

outside  the  200  yards. What  is  there  to  prevent

canvassing then? We can not do anything at all. So why

cannot  we say that we cannot even establish an office

outside  the  200  yards  limit,  Sir?  May   I   then

officially move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the words "in Singapore" be inserted between the

word  "whatsoever" and ", whether" and to  delete  the

words  "within a radius of two hundred  yards  of  any

polling station".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I have the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member's amendment appears to

be  to leave out, in line 4, the words ", whether open

or  enclosed, within a radius of two hundred yards  of

any  polling  station on polling day",  and  there  to

insert "in Singapore".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> If it pleases you, Sir, I think I

am prepared to omit the words "in Singapore". The Bill

is   the   Singapore  Legislative  Assembly  Elections

(Amendment) Bill, and whether the words "in Singapore"

are there or not, it does not matter much.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I did not indicate that the words "in

Singapore" should be omitted. The words "in Singapore"

should be inserted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> To be inserted? I am sorry, Sir, I

am  much  obliged  and I am prepared  to  accept  your

advice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the hon. Member completed what he

has to say on his proposed amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The original amendment is to add a

paragraph (f) reading:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open or maintain, for the purpose of any activity

directed  towards promoting or procuring the  election

of  a  candidate at any election, any  office  in  any

room,  building or any place whatsoever, whether  open

or  enclosed, within a radius of two hundred yards  of

any polling station on polling day."



<br><br>The amendment to be moved is to leave out, in line  4,

the words ", whether open or enclosed, within a radius

of two hundred yards of any polling station on polling

day"  and  there to insert "in Singapore" so that  the

paragraph would then read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open or maintain, for the purpose of any activity

directed  towards promoting or procuring the  election

of  a  candidate at any election, any  office  in  any

room, building or any place whatsoever in Singapore."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> "in Singapore", and stop at that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is my understanding of the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> What about the words "on polling

day",  Sir,  because I am trying to  lay  emphasis  on

polling  day rather than on any other day  during  the

period between Nomination day and the election?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> To insert " in Singapore on polling

day", is that it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> What about the words "open or

enclosed"?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that if a building is not to

be  erected, then whether it is open or enclosed makes

no  difference. If the hon. Member is happier to  have

it, we will put it like this:

"in  Singapore, whether open or enclosed,  on  polling

day". Can I then indicate what my understanding of the

amendment is? The amendment is to leave out the  words

",  whether open or enclosed, within a radius  of  two

hundred yards of any polling station on polling  day",

and  there  to insert "in Singapore, whether  open  or

enclosed,  on polling day". The original amendment  is

as it appears in the Supplementary Order Paper. It has

been  proposed  as an amendment to that  amendment  to

leave out ", whether open or enclosed, within a radius

of two hundred yards of any polling station on polling

day", and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>



there  to  insert  "in  Singapore,  whether  open   or

enclosed, on polling day"; so that the paragraph  will

read,  "open  or  maintain, for  the  purpose  of  any

activity  directed towards promoting or procuring  the

election of a candidate at any election, any office in

any   room,  building  or  any  place  whatsoever   in

Singapore, whether open or enclosed, on polling day."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The question is, "That the words

proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Member for Queenstown has what

is   popularly   called  "a  nimble  mind".   Sir,   I

congratulate him on the perspicacity with which he has

been  able  to  discern  the  other  loopholes  in  my

amendment. But I would like to remind him that  it  is

normal  during polling day to have what are  known  as

polling  agents  and  counting  agents - polling  agents

representing a candidate, one in each place where  the

votes  are  cast. If you do not have any  place  where

your counting agents can foregather, and then disperse

to  the  various  polling stations, how  then  do  you

organise your work on polling day? I am obliged to him

for  the simplicity with which he has swept aside  all

necessity for any activity whatsoever on polling  day.

But I must remind him that candidates are entitled  as

of  right  to  have a polling agent at each  place  of

polling,  and  a  counting  agent  at  the  place   of

counting. These people have to be organised in shifts.

They  go  in  the  morning - some are  replaced  in  the

afternoon.  If  there  is  no  place  where  they  can

foregather,   then   how  does   one   conduct   these

activities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I just explain the reason why the

amendment  was  drafted in this way?  It  was  because

every  other conceivable type of election activity  on

polling   day  has  been  catered  for  and   properly

circumscribed,  except a candidate's election  office.

And we know from past experience that if an election



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>



office is near a polling station, the chances are that

it will be abused. It will be used, not as an election

office where the organisational operation - the backroom

work - of the election is done, but it will also  become

a centre from which a certain amount of canvassing can

take place, because voters would pass by on their  way

to the polling station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not originally phrase my amendment to include

"within  a  radius of two hundred yards". I originally

phrased  my  amendment  to read  "within  two  hundred

yards", because I did not consider the back street  of

a  polling  station to be of sufficient importance  to

warrant   its  exclusion.  I  think  the  Member   for

Queenstown does not really know how much embarrassment

he  is causing his Government. This draft which he now

sees  on  the  Order Paper is, in fact,  the  Attorney

General's improvement on my draft. Since he wanted  it

to  read  "within  a radius of two hundred  yards",  I

agreed.  Even  though we will have  only  one  further

sitting    when   we   have   to   deal    with    the

Government - Members  of  the Opposition  will  be  well

advised to circularise individually all Members on the

Government side to get their respective views.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  says  that  he  is  dealing  with  the

Government;  but  I,  as  an elected  Member  of  this

Assembly,  have no right at all to raise any  question

or  to  move an amendment to an amendment.  I,  as  an

elected representative of the people, have no right at

all  to voice the views that I have gathered from  the

people. What nimble mind the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

has!  I  again  emphasise, Sir,  with  all  his  legal

training  from  the  Colonial  Office  which  he   had

condemned,  he now comes and admits that  he  has  not

framed  the  amendment in such a way as he  originally

should  have  done  so. I move this amendment  to  his

amendment  because it came into my  mind,  during  the

course  of  my  interviewing the  electorate  and  the

public,  that  if his amendment were to  be  accepted,

then it would be subject to abuse by the P.A.P.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to my

question  tabled  in this House this morning  and  the

reply  given by the Minister. From what I find on  the

question   of  the  operation  of  public   passenger-transport service, there are two kinds of law - one  for

the S.T.C. and one for the Chinese bus companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to April 1956, the law where it controls the

public  passenger transport service was  divided  into

two  parts,  as  I have just mentioned. The  Singapore

Traction  Ordinance, which controls buses operated  by

the Singapore Traction Company; and another one, which

is section 326 of the Municipal Ordinance at that time

and  the  Hackney  Carriage by-laws  made  after  this

section  326 of the Municipal Ordinance, controls  the

Chinese bus companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After April 1956, the Government thought it best that

there   should  be  a  licensing  authority   and   it

introduced  a  new  law, which is called  the  Omnibus

Licensing Authority Ordinance, to control the  Chinese

bus  companies. Under this legislation, three  members

were appointed to this authority. One is the Permanent

Secretary to the Ministry of Communications and Works,

who  was  made Chairman of the authority. Another  one

was  the  Chairman of the Rural Board, and  the  third

member was the then President of the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, with the new City Council that has

come  into  being,  neither the Mayor  nor  the  Chief

Administrative Officer of the City Council  could  sit

on  this  authority,  because at the  time  when  this

authority  was introduced it was made clear that  only

members  of the civil service could sit as members  of

this   authority.  The  Mayor,  who  is   an   elected

representative,  cannot sit on this authority.  So  is

the  case  with the Chief Administrative  Officer  who

happens  to  be  an employee of the City  Council.  So

after  1957  or  1958  this  authority  has  only  two

members - one,  the Permanent Secretary to the  Ministry

of  Communications  and  Works,  and  the  other,  the

Chairman of the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this authority was introduced, I was told

that it was at the initiative of the then Minister for

Communications  and Works. It was he  who  had  bright

ideas  of  alleged corruption in the City Council  and

that  it would be better to set up a new authority  to

control   the   public  passenger-transport   service,

because he felt that even if more members sit  on  the

Board  it would not serve any purpose. It was  subject

to  corruption. That was his way of thinking. I cannot

understand  how he could make it this way. When  there

are six, seven or eight persons to decide an issue - and

it  is so difficult to canvass or bribe all of them to

come  to  a definite conclusion - there are allegations

of  corruption!  Now,  today  with  only  two  members

sitting  on that authority, there is no corruption  at

all.  I  am  not suggesting that the members  of  this

authority are corrupted. But I am trying to point  out

to the then Minister for Communications and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>



Works,  who  sits  right behind me, that  his  way  of

thinking   about  corruption  is  entirely  from   the

practical side of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this new licensing

authority, the Singapore Traction Company comes  under

the  old law of the Singapore Traction Ordinance,  and

these  Chinese  bus  companies  come  under  this  new

Ordinance  which  also includes the Municipal  Hackney

Carriage  By-Laws. Under these two laws, I find  there

is a lot of disparity in treatment. I will now come to

the  different types of disparities. The first is  the

monopoly  given to the S.T.C. The S.T.C. is  given  a

monopoly under a sort of charter and this charter  was

extended by the City Council for another seven  years,

because in 1956 the City Council was not able  to  buy

up the S.T.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monopoly gives them special rights to run a

certain  number  of routes, they are  covered  in  the

Singapore  Traction  Ordinance,  Section  3   of   the

Ordinance  gives the different routes that the  S.T.C.

were allowed to operate:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telok Blangah Road, Keppel Road, Anson Road, Telok

Ayer  Street,  Cecil Street, Collyer  Quay,  Fullerton

Road,  Anderson Bridge and High Street,  Hill  Street,

River  Valley  Road,  Tank Road, Tanjong  Pagar  Road,

South  Bridge  Road, North Bridge Road, Jalan  Sultan,

Victoria Street, Kallang Road and Geylang Road (Part),

Geylang  Road  (Part), Bras Basah Road, Prinsep  Road,

Selegie  Road, Serangoon Road, Upper Serangoon   Road,

Lavender Street, McKenzie Road.



<br><br>And list "b" which was included later:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper Serangoon Road, Geylang Road, Victoria Street,

Hill Street, New Bridge Road,

Bukit Timah Road, Rochore Canal Road, Rochore Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the monopoly that has been given to the

S.T.C.  It is more or less a statutory right that  the

omnibuses  or the buses operated by the S.T.C. should

run  according to these routes. If they want to  apply

for  new  routes, apart from what is in the Ordinance,

they will have to apply to the proper authorities. The

proper  authority  are the City Council  where  it  is

within  the City radius, and the Rural Board where  it

is  outside  the  City limits it  should  now  be  the

District Councils.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that they are only confined to the

Ordinance. They are allowed to operate only within the

routes I have mentioned. And if they are to apply  for

any route outside that limit, they will have to submit

plans  to the proper authorities, showing the way  how

they are going to run it and the reasons why they  are

going to run it. I will read the interpretation of the

word "Authority":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the expression "the Authority" means, in the case of

that  portion  of  the  Island of  Singapore  situated

within City limits, the City Council and, in the  case

of  any  other  part of the said Island, the  District

Council;'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the law which I have found recently is

not in the least respected by this authority, because,

as  I  have  mentioned, this authority  has  only  two

members  sitting on it. You can now find S.T.C. buses

penetrating into every other street not listed in  the

law. Applications are made and if the authority thinks

fit  to give it to the S.T.C., it just says "Yes"  and

it  goes  ahead without reference to the City Council.

Why  are  the  applications not referred to  the  City

Council or to the District Council?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote a case where representations were made to me

by  the  Queenstown Community Centre and  the  Redhill

Community   Centre.  There  are  many   thousands   of

residents    in    these   two   localities - Alexandra,

Queenstown  and Redhill kampongs. They  come  down  to

Tanjong  Pagar or to town either for work or any  kind

of  business. There is no direct service at  all  from

Queenstown  or Redhill to Tanjong Pagar,  which  means

that  all  the residents within these two  areas  will

have to take two or three different buses by different

routes to come down to Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Sir, there are many school children

who  attend the Fairfield Girls' School, which is near

Cantonment  Road. These school children,  aged  seven,

eight  or nine, will also have to travel two or  three

different routes to get to their school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for a bus service was made to the City

Council  about  two  years  ago.  At  that  time   the

Licensing Authority had not taken over, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>



City  Council took all the trouble and spent money  to

widen Cantonment Road, so that it could take the heavy

load  of  these  omnibuses.  Cantonment  Road  is  now

widened  and  it  can take omnibuses.  But  when  that

application  was  referred to the Licensing  Authority

after it has taken over, it was turned down. I do  not

know why should it be turned down. If that application

had  been approved, it would not have caused  so  much

trouble to the bus company that is running that route.

It  would only necessitate a very slight deviation  of

the  existing  route  of  the  bus  company  that   is

operating  in  that area. Why then,  Sir,  should  the

residents  of  Queenstown and Redhill  suffer  because

this  Licensing  Authority did  not  look  into  their

plight?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, as I have said, the authority

has  allowed  the S.T.C. buses to penetrate  into  the

Chinese  bus  companies' areas. Why  should  there  be

disparity  and  discrimination, Sir?  I  think  it  is

either  due  to the ignorance or inefficiency  of  the

members of that authority who do not look at things in

the  right way. If the members of that authority claim

that they are neither ignorant nor inefficient, then I

say  it is discrimination of treatment. Because it  so

happens that the S.T.C. is not an Asian company. It is

more  or  less  run and managed by the Whites  or  the

Europeans. That is the reason why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then Minister at that time was a nominated

Minister. He was not aware of the trouble, because  he

did  not stand for election. He does not know what the

people want, and he does not know the troubles of  the

people.  The  members of that authority  also  do  not

know. May I say that the then Minister was a white man

and,  as a white man, certainly I think he was in  his

mind pro-white. The Singapore Traction Company is more

or  less  controlled by Europeans and he should  be  a

little  bit  pro-white. I wonder whether the  Minister

himself  has given a direction to this authority  that

whenever  they  decide on these applications  for  bus

routes, they should be pro-white. Because, as far as I

understand, Sir, section 4 of the Omnibus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>



Services  Licensing  Authority  Ordinance  does   give

powers  to  the Minister to issue a directive  to  the

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may from time to time give to the

Authority  such  general directions  not  inconsistent

with  the provisions of this Ordinance as he may think

fit  and  the  Authority shall comply  with  all  such

directions."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my assumption - the Member for Tanjong Pagar

always assumes things - that the then Minister, who was

a  white  man,  would  have given directions  to  this

authority  that it should be given to a white  company

and  not  to any of these Asian companies. If that  is

the  directive, Sir, it is now high time that the  new

Minister,  who  is  an  elected  Minister  and  not  a

nominated  Minister - he is also an  Asian - changed  that

directive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the licence and licence fees, this is

where  the disparity comes in. The S.T.C. do  not  pay

any  licence fee at all to operate bus routes. It  was

given free of charge to them. You have your buses, you

run  on  the routes that have been given to  you.  The

Chinese  bus companies will have to pay $10 every  six

months  for a bus route licence, irrespective  of  the

number of buses that operate on that route.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the licence fee of the vehicle itself. The

S.T.C. enjoy the privilege of paying a sort of royalty

to  the City Council and the Rural Board - 5 per cent of

its  gross takings, plus two cents for every  car-mile

run  whilst carrying passengers -which means that  they

only  pay  5  per cent of the gro ss profits  plus  two

cents  for  every  car-mile run. This  means  that  an

S.T.C. vehicle  which  is  stationed  on  the  S.T.C.

premises, does not pay at all. Only when it  runs  and

carries passengers does it pay two cents for every car-mile run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do the Chinese bus companies pay? First, as a

seating fee of $5 per passenger per month. This  means

that it depends upon the size of the vehicle, and  for

every passenger the Chinese bus company must pay $5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have a horsepower tax that we normally

pay. We have our vehicles on the roads and the Chinese

bus companies must pay the same tax as we pay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>



This  is what is imposed on the Chinese bus companies.

Third,  Sir, there is the hackney-carriage fee of  $30

for  every  six months. Now, the Chinese bus companies

have  to  pay  $10  for the use of a route  every  six

months. On top of that $10, they have to pay a hackney-carriage fee of $30

every six months. Just compare the

difference in treatment and the fees paid!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of fares, Sir. The S.T.C. are

allowed to charge a minimum of ten cents for the first

mile and five cents for every subsequent mile. But can

the Chinese bus companies start with a minimum fare of

ten  cents for the first mile? No. I am not trying  to

suggest  that  the Chinese bus companies should  raise

their  fares to ten cents for the first mile,  because

it  will  make  things difficult  for  the  travelling

public who will have to pay more for their fares. I am

suggesting that the S.T.C. should reduce the  fare  to

five cents for the first mile to bring it in line with

the Chinese bus companies. The travelling public would

benefit  by  this.  Most people who travel  in  public

transport  do not travel long distances as car  owners

do.  It  is  only  on these short distances  that  the

companies  make a bigger margin of profit.  No  wonder

the S.T.C. make a lot of money every year!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to accidents and mechanical defects in

buses. Sir, if a bus belonging to a Chinese company is

involved  in  an  accident or  if  it  has  mechanical

defects,  it  has  to be brought to the  Registrar  of

Vehicles immediately for a mechanical inspection. Only

after  the  mechanical inspection and  after  all  the

defects  are attended to can that bus go back  on  the

road.  But  the S.T.C. under its charter or under  the

Ordinance,  enjoy  a privilege. They  have  their  own

Registrar of Vehicles to inspect their vehicles. If an

S.T.C. bus  is involved in an accident or  there  are

mechanical defects in a vehicle, the S.T.C. repairs it

in  its own shed. I am even prepared to overlook this,

but  why  should  it not be sent to the  Registrar  of

Vehicles  for  inspection after it has been  repaired?

There  are  qualified inspectors  who  can  check  the

vehicle instead of their saying, "All



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>



right, you have already repaired your vehicle. You can

put  it  back on the road." The Chinese bus  companies

must  send their vehicles to the Registrar of Vehicles

for inspection, and if there are any defects, they are

sent to the workshops for repairs. After that they are

sent  back  again  to the Registrar  of  Vehicles  for

inspection  and  if they are certified  fit  for  road

service, then only can they go on the road. But in the

case  of  the  S.T.C. buses, who  is  there  to  check

whether they have been repaired or not? The S.T.C. can

say,   "We  have  repaired  this  vehicle  after   the

accident."  There is no inspector to  certify  whether

that  is  the case. Their own people pass judgment  on

their  own vehicles. There are many, many more  points

of  disparity, but it may take me too long to describe

them. I have already spoken for about 18 minutes and I

want  to  give the Minister a chance to  reply  if  he

wants to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the new elected and Asian

Minister - I  congratulate  him  on  being  an   elected

Minister and I am much obliged to him for the reply he

gave  me this morning - to consider my suggestion:  one,

to  put  the S.T.C. on the same footing as the Chinese

bus companies, or, alternatively, to bring the Chinese

bus  companies in line with the S.T.C.;  and  two,  to

review any directives that may have been issued by the

former  Minister for Communications and Works  to  the

Licensing Authority consisting of only two men who are

supposed  to  be  incorruptible.  There  should  be  a

Committee  consisting of about six men. If there  have

been  such directives issued, they should be withdrawn

and new directives issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not propose, Mr Speaker, Sir, to

attempt   to  deal  with  the  lengthy  and  extremely

inaccurate  remarks  of  the  Member  for  Queenstown.

Anybody  who  wishes  to inform himself  on  transport

matters  should get a copy of the Hawkins'  Commission

Report  in  which he will find the situation  properly

laid  out.  Anybody who is misguided enough to  accept

the  guidance  of  the Member for Queenstown  in  this

matter will certainly find himself in error.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are two points on which I would like

to  speak.  The  first  is what  appears  to  be  a

suggestion  by  the  Member  for  Queenstown   that

foreign  investors  should  be  deprived   of   the

protection of the law. His own Party newspaper  has

been quoted in the daily Press - I have not seen the

paper myself - as threatening that if his Party does

not  get elected, there will be a strike of capital

to be organised so as to strangle Singapore. Yet he

himself is proposing in this proposed treatment  of

the  Singapore Traction Company precisely the  sort

of  anti-foreign investment line which would be the

worst possible thing for Singapore. He is proposing

apparently  to  deprive them  unilaterally  of  the

benefits  of  the Singapore Traction  Ordinance.  I

have seldom heard a more irresponsible speech and I

hope  that  it  will be officially  denied  by  the

Government Front Bench that there is any reason  at

all  to  support  that. If he  is  suggesting  that

foreign  investors  should  be  deprived   of   the

protection  of the law, I hope that  will  be  made

quite  clear by the Front Bench, that there  is  no

question of that at all. If it cannot be made quite

clear, it is a matter where I shall personally feel

bound  even to sever my long connection  with  this

side of the House and move across to the other side

of  the House - if I thought that this Government  is

going  to  adopt  the  line  of  frightening   away

reasonable  and responsible overseas  investors  in

the hope of getting votes for the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which I would like very briefly

to  deal  with is the allegation or insinuation  by

the hon. Member that I am a white man and therefore

I  have  given pro-white directives to the officers

in  my  Ministry and to the Members of the  Omnibus

Services Licensing Authority. I think the time  has

come  when we should stop talking about the  colour

of  people's skins and talk of people according  to

their   citizenship,  whether  they  are  Singapore

citizens or not. I am a Singapore citizen. I have a

home in Singapore. I married a Singapore woman.  My

child goes to a Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>



school  and  I  hope to live and die a  citizen  of

Singapore. I have the most sad and pained  feelings

in  my  heart  when again an hon.  Member  of  this

Assembly  can  raise - for what reason I  can  hardly

guess,  nor  would  you  allow  me  to  guess,  Mr

Speaker - a racial and a communal issue on  a  matter

which  is  purely  concerned with  the  profits  of

Chinese bus companies. He referred to the rumour, I

believe, that there was corruption in dealings with

bus  company matters when they were handled by  the

City  Council. Matters of corruption are very  hard

to  prove  indeed,  but those  who  have  made  any

examination  of the facts, either of the  furniture

in people's houses or of the new cars that appeared

in  front of people's houses when there was  a  new

route  approved, or of the presence of other goods,

have  also studied the irrationality and the  folly

of the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, Sir. The Member is making

accusations,  Sir.  Can the Member  name  the  City

Councillors who had new cars when a bus  route  was

approved?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. Mr

Thomas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, the irrationality and folly of

some  of  the licensing decisions made in the  City

Council  in  those  days  imposed  on  Singapore  a

completely  irrational and unserviceable  transport

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the two points which I thought were

unfortunate in the hon. Member's speech. We do  not

need in Singapore today to try to create more fears

and  hatred between the citizens of this  city.  We

need  to  bring  people together,  not  to  try  to

separate  them on grounds of culture or  colour  or

language  or  religion, and anybody who  takes  any

other line is performing a great disservice to this

country. We also need to preserve the most friendly

relations   we   can  with  overseas   territories,

particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>



with those who have invested or who may invest in  the

development  of  Singapore, and  any  suggestion  that

foreign  investors  are going to be  deprived  of  the

protection  of  the  law  is a  most  mischievous  and

irresponsible suggestion.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very unfortunate

indeed that various allegations and many things  which

have  no  bearing  on  the subject  should  have  been

discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, may I dissociate myself from the

remarks of the Member for Queenstown when he said that

my  predecessor had judged all issues of licensing  on

the  basis  of  colour. Having had  the  privilege  of

looking  into the whole aspect of the traffic  problem

and  the  enormous amount of work which my predecessor

had  to  go  through, I am convinced beyond all  doubt

that  there had been no bias in the discharge  of  his

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown is not in full possession

of  the  facts regarding the membership of the Omnibus

Licensing  Authority. I heard him say that  there  are

only  two  members on the Board, namely, the Permanent

Secretary to my Ministry and the Chairman of the Rural

Board. I must inform him, Sir, that the Board consists

of three members: the Registrar of Vehicles who is the

Secretary  of  the Board, my Permanent Secretary,  and

the Chairman of the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can show that many of the points he raised

were  baseless. I do not think I have enough time  now

at  my  disposal to do so; but may I just inform  this

House that there are two important documents in regard

to  the passenger transport service which have been in

the  hands of hon. Members for a long time? The  first

one  is  the Report of the Commission of Inquiry  into

the   Public  Passenger  Transport  System  which  was

accepted  by  the Government as a clear, comprehensive

and  authoritative analysis of the grounds for concern

of  the  state  of  industry in Singapore.  The  other

document is Cmd. Paper No. 48 of 1956.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>



Both  these  two  documents give full details  of  the

complications   of  our  transport  system   and   the

Government policy regarding it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said this morning that the Government has

fully  realised  and has come to the  conclusion  that

there cannot be proper co-ordination of the service in

the  public interest and that the traffic needs of the

area as a whole cannot be met unless all operators are

subject  to  the same licensing system and rules.  The

activities  with  regard  to  unifying  the  transport

system  in  Singapore  have  been  undertaken  by   my

predecessor,  but they were negatived by difficulties.

We  have  felt, Sir, that the only step  which  is  of

paramount  importance to the achievement of a  unified

bus  transport system is the purchase of the Singapore

Traction Company and, as my predecessor has stated  in

the Assembly, the stumbling-block to this has been the

lack of finance. I must say here and now, Sir, that if

we  have  the  money, the problem can  be  ironed  out

fairly  quickly. The other difficulty which faced  the

Ministry  was the question of the Chinese  bus  owners

not  being  able  to  agree among  themselves  on  the

amalgamation  of all Chinese bus companies,  which  we

thought was the first step to the unification  of  the

bus service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not been able to make the whole thing

clear  as  there are so many other points which  could

further  clarify the whole matter. I do  not  think  I

have  any  more time left, but I would  just  like  to

point  out  one more point and that is the  allegation

against   the   Licensing  Authority.  From   my   own

experience, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We have reached the time of

termination  of the sitting. Of course,  the  Minister

may take advantage of the opportunity tomorrow to make

a Ministerial statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Four o'clock

p.m. and  the Debate having continued until the  time

appointed  for  the  termination  of  a  sitting,  Mr

Speaker  adjourned  the  House without  Question  put,

<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr A. R. Lazarous</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether the Government has received a report from the

Public Service Commission Standing Committee on

recognition of foreign University degrees; whether and

when the report will be published; and what is the

reason for the delay in its publication.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> The Government has received three

interim  reports by the Standing Committee on  Foreign

University Degrees covering the following subjects:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) American and Indian qualifications held by

candidates for entry to the Education Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) American and Indian qualifications for entry to

the Administrative and Executive Services; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Overseas qualifications held by candidates

for entry to the Engineering Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substance of the first interim report was

published in November last year and is being discussed

with representatives of teachers' unions which will be

affected  by  the recommendations in the  report.  The

other  two  reports,  which broadly  embody  the  same

principles,  are being examined and consultation  with

the  Staff  Side of the Singapore Civil Service  Joint

Council has started. There has been no delay over this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When agreement has been reached with the Staff Side

and the unions concerned, suitable provisions will  be

written



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>



into existing Schemes of Service setting out  the

extent  to  which  overseas  qualifications  will   be

recognised for entry into the public service  and  the

appropriate  salary  points on the  recognised  salary

scales on which selected candidates will be appointed.

These  new provisions will be published in the Gazette



in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Public

Service Commission Ordinance, 1956.
