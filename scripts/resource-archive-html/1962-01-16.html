<div align="center"><b>(Statistics)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  (a)  what was the number of applications  in

1961  from  employees for withdrawals of  monies  to

their credit in the Central Provident Fund; (b)  the

number  of such applications from persons  who  were

unemployed for more than 6 months and were over  the

age  of  40; and (c) the number of such applications

from unemployed persons aged over 40 which have been

acceded to by the Central Provident Fund Board.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

answer   to   (a)  is:  there  were   6,557   formal

applications made in 1961 by employees  to  withdraw

their monies standing to their credit in the Central

Provident Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards (b), persons who are unemployed are

normally    not    eligible   to   withdraw    their

contributions to the Central Provident  Fund  unless

exceptionally they satisfy the conditions set out in

paragraph (f) of the definition "date of withdrawal"

in section 2 of the Central Provident Fund Ordinance

which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"date of withdrawal" means the day... on which any

member of the Fund:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) is in the opinion of the Board not likely to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be employed in a contributor's employment

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again after having ceased to he an employee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a period of not less than two years;'.



<br><br>The  number  of  applications from persons  who  are

unemployed for more than six months and over the age

of 40 is not ascertainable from the Board's records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards (c), here again, Mr Speaker, no

figures  are available of persons who are unemployed

and  over  the  age  of 40 and who  have  had  their

applications  acceded  to by the  Central  Provident

Fund Board. However, some 837



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



persons   have   been  allowed  to  withdraw   their

contributions under paragraph (f) of the  definition

of  "date of withdrawal" found in section 2  of  the

Central  Provident Fund Ordinance. Of these persons,

229  are  married women engaged in household duties,

411 had left to reside and work in the Federation of

Malaya,  and  the remaining 197 were mostly  members

who  have become substantially self-employed or  who

are  out  of  work and seem unlikely for reasons  of

health or otherwise to enter further employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> I am obliged to the

Minister  for  the  information he  has  given,  Mr

Speaker.  But  recognising the  principle  that  the

Provident Fund is to assist persons on a rainy  day,

does  he  not  recognise that many  of  these  6,000

applications  which  have  been  rejected  are  from

persons in dire need -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

embarking on an expression of opinion and inviting a

debate. Is there a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, would

the  Minister  consider introducing an amendment  to

the  Central  Provident Fund Ordinance in  order  to

the  Provident Fund Board to allow applications  for

withdrawals in circumstances which are meritorious?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I

remember  correctly, the Member for  Anson  in  this

House  raised this question once before, and I  made

it  quite  clear that the objects of this  Fund  are

such that I am afraid my answer at the moment to his

supplementary  question asking  me  to  consider  an

amendment is "no".

adequate  to  meet the contingencies such  as  those

which  have  occurred  lately  in  respect  of   the

curtailment  of  inter-bank  clearances  of  cheques

where one of the banks' employees is on strike.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance   whether  the  Government  would   consider

establishing a State Bank.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Would the hon. Member please

inform  the House what sort of State bank he  wishes

the Government to consider establishing?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Any bank, Sir, such as every other

State  in the world has. I am rather surprised  that

he should need a clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, different States have

different types of State banks. Some State banks are

for  special purposes, such as to provide credit  to

farmers  and  they are called Farmers' Banks.  Again

some  other types of State banks provide easy credit

facilities for industrial banks, and they are called

State industrial banks. There are Co-operative State

banks  and a whole range of types of State banks.  I

am  not  trying  to be facetious, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

when  I  ask the hon. Member for a clarification  on

this  point  because  there are different  types  of

State banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member says that every State has got

a  State bank. I presume he means a Central Bank. Am

I right in this understanding?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The question is a simple one, Sir.

Is  the  Government considering the creation of  any

State bank?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Government already has a

State bank and that is the Post Office Savings Bank.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Taking it seriously, Sir, is the

Minister  then  indicating to  the  House  that  the

Government has no intention to establish any Central

or other State bank?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now we come to it, Mr Speaker,

Sir. As I said, he was really referring to a Central

Bank.  The  answer  is  "no". The  reason  is  quite

simple.  I do not know whether I should go into  any

details  on the functions and purposes of a  Central

Bank  and  their role in the financial system  of  a

country.  Perhaps  I  should not.  I  can  give  the

reasons quite simply. The Federation of Malaya has a

Central Bank and, after merger, I have no doubt this

Central  Bank  will establish branches in  Singapore

and  the Borneo territories. It is, therefore, quite

unnecessary for the Singapore Government to consider

setting up a Central Bank of its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Central Bank such as most independent nations

have is only worthy of its name and status if it is,

in addition to performing the necessary functions of

government bankers and the lender of last resort  to

commercial banks, also the authority to control  the

monetary  issue of the country, that  is,  the  note

issue of the country, and as a corollary it acts  as

a   custodian  of  the  nation's  foreign   exchange

reserve.  We do not have a currency of our own,  and

therefore  to have a Central Bank of our own,  while

we  are  part  of the common currency area  together

with  the  Borneo territories and the Federation  of

Malaya, is quite a meaningless affair.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask the

Minister,  accepting his thesis that a Central  Bank

is   not  necessary  in  the  light  of  the  merger

proposals, would he not consider that in the context

of  the  stature of Singapore in the commercial  and

financial   field,  a  State  Commercial   Bank   is

imperative for our own commercial needs?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, my own appraisal is that

our  banking requirements are adequately met by  the

private commercial banks. But if the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



for  Anson thinks otherwise and if he could convince

me  that  there  is a gap in the range  of  services

which  the private banks are performing and which  a

further State Commercial Bank would perform, then  I

shall be very happy to consider his proposal.

<div align="center"><b>STATUTORY LAW REVISION ADVISORY COMMITTEE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health  and  Law  whether Government would  consider

introducing legislation for the establishment  of  a

Statutory Law Revision Advisory Committee to include

members  from  the Bench, the Bar, the  Chambers  of

Commerce, Trade Unions and women's organisations.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the

Government accepts the need for the establishment of

a  Law  Revision Committee from time to time, it  is

felt that it would be wrong to establish a permanent

Statutory  Committee with its  powers  set  out  and

circumscribed  by  legislation.  It   is,   however,

proposed to seek the views of the Judges and the Bar

Committee  to explore the possibility of setting  up

from  time to time Law Revision Committees  to  deal

with  particular  aspects  of  the  law  which  need

revision.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I appreciate the indications given

by  the  Minister. But would he not consider that  a

permanent committee which has to meet and  has  this

responsibility of regularly meeting and  considering

the  need  for  revision would far better  meet  the

requirements of fast-changing circumstances than  ad

hoc committees from time to time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have traced the

history of Law Revision Committees elsewhere and  we

have  found  in all the Commonwealth countries  that

they  are  never appointed on a permanent  statutory

basis  and  given well defined powers. As  the  need

arises,  these  Statutory  Revision  Committees  are

appointed. If the Member for Anson has any ideas  on

the subject, and if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



were  to write in to us making suggestions, we would

consider  the setting up of a Law Revision Committee

to  look into those aspects of the law which require

amendment   or   revision.  These  are   essentially

technical  committees,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, If  the

Member  for  Anson  feels very strongly  that  there

should  be amendments to particular laws,  there  is

nothing  to prevent him from introducing  a  Private

Member's Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk and

distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's recommendation  that  the

Bill  be  proceeded with. I beg to move,  "That  the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members may recall that this Bill  was  first

introduced to the Assembly at the June 1961 sitting,

and since then the Bill has lapsed. The contents  of

the  Bill before the House now are the same as those

introduced in June last year, and except  for  minor

changes in dates and in the bringing of the Schedule

up  to date, there has not been any material change.

The  main  purpose of the Bill is to  secure  proper

control   over  the  activities  of  the  banks   in

Singapore  and  to  provide  proper  supervision  to

ensure  a sound basis for banking business which  is

so important to the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill are modelled on the

lines of the Banking Ordinance and the Central  Bank

Ordinance now in force in the Federation of  Malaya.

It  is  desirable that Singapore and the  Federation

should  have  parallel banking  legislation  as  the

banking  system  is common to both territories.  The

Banking  Bill now before the House has been held  in

abeyance  since  June 1961, because of  more  urgent

business  that  has  occupied the  House  since  the

present Session began. It is now being re-introduced

on  a  Certificate of Urgency. I am proceeding  with

this Bill throughout its three stages because of the

recurrence  of  industrial disputes between  certain

local banks and their employees. These disputes have

resulted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



in  considerable inconvenience to the public and  to

the trading and business community in the inter-bank

clearance  of  cheques, and ths has interfered  with

the efficiency of the banking business in the State.

At  the  moment,  the  Malayan  Banking  Association

operates  a  mutual inter-bank clearing  house  with

three of the bigger banks serving as clearing hunks.

There is provision in the Bill for the setting up of

a  Clearing  House by the Government  and,  if  this

Clearing  House is set up, on the coming into  force

of  the Ordinance, the inconvenience that arises out

of  any industrial dispute will be restricted in its

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House is a fairly

straightforward  one  and  only  a  few   words   of

explanation are necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I makes the necessary definitions. Banking

business is defined very broadly and is not intended

to limit any legitimate banking business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is devoted to the licensing of banks. This

Part  provides that only banks holding licences from

the  Minister  can carry on business  in  Singapore.

Provision  is made for conditions to be attached  to

licences and these conditions can be modified as and

when  necessary. The object of this section,  is  to

ensure that banks which operate in the State have  a

sound  financial structure and that  their  business

integrity   is  not  open  to  question.   All   new

banks - whether  local  or foreign - have  to  obtain  a

licence.  Existing  banks  which  were  incorporated

before  1st January, 1962, will be given a  licence.

They  will, however, have to satisfy certain capital

requirements. In the case of new banks  incorporated

after  1st January, 1962, if its Head Office  is  in

Singapore, its paid-up capital must be at  least  $2

million.  If  the  Head Office is  situated  outside

Singapore, its paid-up capital must be at  least  $5

million  and  it must hold at least  $2  million  in

Singapore in respect of business in Singapore either

in  the form of immovable property or other approved

assets.  Existing  banks  incorporated  before   1st

January, 1962, will be given a period of grace of up

to 10 years under Part VI to comply with the capital

requirements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III sets out the main duties of licensed

banks. Most of the duties set out in this Part  will

not  in  any  way  cause well established  banks  to

depart  from their existing practices and  policies.

There is provision for a licensed bank to inform the

Minister   of   any   alteration   in   the   Bank's

constitution or of any proposed change in ownership.

Every  licensed bank is also required to maintain  a

reserve  fund to be built up out of its  profits  in

the  manner prescribed n the Bill. The reserve  fund

will of course greatly increase the soundness of the

bank.  Licensed  banks are also not allowed  to  pay

dividends until its capitalised expenditure has been

written  off;  nor  can  it  grant  unsecured  loans

exceeding $5,000 to any of its directors or any firm

in which the directors are interested. Certain other

requirements  are  also  set  out  to   ensure   the

financial  soundness of the bank. Certain statistics

are  also  required to be furnished to the Inspector

of  Banks  for the protection of depositors  and  to

assist  in  the  control  of  banks.  A  bank   that

considers  that  it  is  unable  to  meet  financial

obligations  is  required to  inform  the  Minister.

Licensed banks are also required to appoint auditors

to be approved by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with the powers of the

Minister. In this Part the Bill differs from that of

the   Federation  of  Malaya  Ordinance,  where  the

Central Bank exercises the principal functions  laid

down  in  their Ordinance. Since we do  not  have  a

Central  Bank, it is necessary to set up some  other

authority   which   can  perform  these   functions.

Provision  is made for the Minister to  establish  a

clearing house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inspector of Banks is to be appointed to be the

authority to undertake investigations of banks  both

on  a routine basis and when the Minister has reason

to  believe that a licensed bank is carrying on  its

business in an unsatisfactory way. The Inspector may

also,  on the advice of the Minister, assume control

or  exercise  supervision over  the  business  of  a

licensed  bank in certain circumstances  to  protect

the interests of depositors and creditors. But these

are  reserve powers which will be used only when the

need  arises. The powers of the Minister, which  can

be delegated to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



Inspector  of  Banks, does not extend,  however,  to

authorising enquiries specifically into the  affairs

of any individual customer of a licensed bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill makes general provisions such

as  barring certain individuals from taking part  in

the  management of a licensed bank, for  instance  a

bankrupt   or  persons  convicted  of   an   offence

involving fraud. Other clauses state the penalty for

offences and amendments to the Companies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI makes provisions for the transitional

period.  I  have already referred to  the  provision

that existing banks incorporated before 1st January,

1962, will he granted a licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 (2) allows a period of grace of up to 10

years  for  banks with less than $2 million  paid-up

capital  or $2 million worth of assets in the  State

to  adjust their assets to the amount required under

this   Bill.  Banks  with  their  Head  Offices   in

Singapore will not he affected by this provision  as

none of them have a paid-up capital of less than  $2

million.  The  position of branch  banks  with  Head

Offices  abroad will have to he ascertained  in  due

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention here, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

clause  34 of the Bill, which is modelled on section

32 of the Federation Banking Ordinance, differs from

the  Federation  Ordinance in an important  respect.

Under  section 32 (2) (c) of the Federation  Banking

Ordinance,  banks  which are  principally  owned  by

foreign governments will not be granted a licence in

the   Federation  of  Malaya.  This  part   of   the

Federation of Banking Ordinance is omitted from  the

Bill now before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the main provisions of the Bill. Hon.

Members  can see that there is nothing in  the  Bill

that   is   meant  to  curtail  legitimate   banking

business.  To  banks which have  operated  on  sound

banking  principles,  this  Bill  should  not  cause

anxiety or trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards staffing arrangements to administer the

provisions  of  this Bill, I intend to  appoint  the

Deputy  Controller  of Foreign Exchange  to  be  the

Inspector  of  Banks under clause  17.  He  will  he

assisted by an adequate number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



subordinate  staff.  Two officers  of  the  Exchange

Control  have been sent in the second half  of  last

year  to  undergo a special training  course  kindly

arranged  by  the Central Bank of the Federation  of

Malaya.   Arrangements  to  set  up  the  Government

Clearing  House are well under way and the  Clearing

House should he in operation in a few days' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I always view with

repugnance  any  effort to rush through  this  House

measures of an important character and it cannot  be

doubted   that  this  measure  is  of  an  important

character.  However, I accept the Minister's  reason

for  the  Certificate of Urgency as valid. It  is  a

significant  commentary on the  irresponsibility  of

the   Malayan  Banks  Association  in   seeking   to

inconvenience  members of the public  by  curtailing

inter-bank  clearances cheques  when  one  of  their

members  has  an industrial dispute  that  today  we

should  have  to deal on the basis of  urgency  with

this Bill instead of the normal procedure whereby I,

for  one,  would have wished to see that an adequate

opportunity be given both to the banks  and  to  the

commercial community to make representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one aspect of the Bill. Sir, which I do

not  quite  follow.  A radical distinction  is  made

between  those banks which are in existence now  and

those  who seek fresh licences. Under the provisions

of  clause  3  (4), the Minister may grant  licences

with or without conditions, or refuse a licence. But

under clause 34 (1), which over-rules the provisions

of sub-clause 4, it says that the banks specified in

the Third Schedule, which are the banks in existence

now,  shall  be  granted a licence subject  to  such

conditions as are contained in any licence which  is

in  existence. So that, Sir, we cannot  impose  more

conditions than are in existence, nor can we  impose

any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



conditions in the licence if, in fact, there are  no

conditions  in any existing licence or no conditions

at  all.  I am sure there must he some valid  reason

for   this  distinction  and  particularly  for  the

limitation  of  the  Minister's  powers   to   place

conditions  in respect of the issue of  licenses  to

banks which are in existence and which are listed in

the  Schedule.  I would appreciate an indication  of

the  reasons which underlie the distinction  between

licences  granted to new banks and licences  granted

to  existing banks. I do not know, Sir, but I should

imagine  there  are banks in existence  today  which

have  no conditions attached to any licence, and  in

so  far  as  I read clause 34 (1), it precludes  the

Minister from imposing any conditions on the licence

that  he  issues  to those banks,  tying  his  hands

completely.  I would ask whether, in fact,  that  is

intentional  or inadvertent, and if intentional  the

reason   therefor.  I  would  also   appreciate   an

assurance   that  this  Clearing  House  which   the

Government is setting up with such commendable speed

will,  in  fact,  be  adequately organised  for  the

purpose  of meeting inter-bank cheque clearances  to

avoid  the  type  of inconvenience  which  has  been

imposed  upon the public by members of  the  Malayan

Banks Association recently.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

Bill  of  such a nature would, in my opinion,  be  a

step in the right direction to protect the interests

of  depositors  although  I  feel  that  it  is  not

adequate  enough. Sir, we have seen in this  country

too  many mushroom bogus employment agencies,  bogus

insurance companies, and I feel that unless  such  a

Bill  is passed, we may also see in the near future,

bogus banking companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion the Bill is not

adequate  because,  although the Minister  is  given

sufficient powers to investigate into the affairs of

the  banks,  yet the depositors and  the  public  at

large do not know the results of such investigations

until  the situation has worsened so badly that  the

Minister or the Inspector has to take action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the details given by the banks to the

Minister  as  set  out in the First Schedule  should

also  be  disclosed in the banking premises so  that

the depositors will know what happens to the banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the bank in theory belongs to the

directors,  and  also, to a lesser  extent,  to  the

shareholders  who do not play a large  part  in  its

direction,  the depositors have as much a  stake  in

the  bank  as,  and sometimes even  more  than,  the

directors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point to which I wish to

draw the attention of the Minister is that he should

be  given powers so that he can direct the Inspector

to  go  and  test check the cash position and  other

details  of  the  banks  as set  out  in  the  First

Schedule and not just rely on the balance sheets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the ideal situation, of course,

is  to  set up a Central Bank, but it is a practical

impossibility because we are still in the stage of a

semi-colony, but we hope with this Banking  Bill  we

will  have more sound banking practices and  systems

than has been the case in the past.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to oppose this Bill not because of the content

of   the   Bill.  The  content  of   the   Bill   is

praiseworthy. In fact, it was praiseworthy  in  June

1961 when the Government introduced it, and if there

had  been  no  intervening motives  which  have  now

induced  the  Government to introduce this  Bill  at

this   stage,  the  content  would  still  be   very

praiseworthy. But what makes this Bill objectionable

at  the  moment is the manner in which it  is  being

presented to the House and the time at which it  has

been  presented  to this House - I repeat  the  phrase

"the  time"  and  I think the Minister  for  Finance

understands very well what I mean by the phrase "the

time  at  which he has presented this Bill".  It  is

objectionable and unworthy of this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a trading island

which has commercial facilities and the banks play a

very important part in the commercial prosperity  of

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



island. Now, as banks are employers, therefore there

must  be  employees. The business of the Government,

as I see it, is to foster the economic conditions of

this country, and in the fostering of these economic

conditions,  it  becomes  necessary  to  foster  the

banking  facilities  available  to  this  commercial

community. In the absence of State banks  and  State

commercial banks, the Minister has himself said,  in

answer  to a question by the Member for Anson,  that

the private banks are in fact adequately meeting the

needs  of  the commercial community. As the Minister

concerned  in  these  bathing  facilities,   he   is

satisfied  that these banks are, in fact,  providing

an  adequate  service and he knows  of  no  instance

where they have fallen down on their obligations  or

failed  the commercial community. Why then,  I  ask,

are  we being presented with the Banking Bill today,

and  why  does  the Minister ask that  it  be  taken

through  all the stages at one sitting? The Minister

introduced the Bill in 1961. He said that because he

had other urgent business he had allowed the Bill to

lapse.  I  do  not  accept the explanation  for  one

moment. Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has other motives for introducing this Bill of

which he has not told this House. On the aspects  of

the  Government's motives in introducing this  Bill,

they should be ashamed. My colleague, the Member for

Cairnhill, will be dealing more adequately with that

aspect  of  the situation later on in  this  debate.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to  touch

upon  those  motives which have led the Minister  to

introduce this Bill at this particular juncture. The

motives  indicate that the Minister for  Finance  is

taking sides in disputes which do not concern him as

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that in theory he

disapproves of Bills being brought into  this  House

and  passed  on  Certificates of  Urgency  when  the

issues  involved are vital to this country, and  yet

he  has said that in this case he is going to excuse

the  Government. I wonder what has happened  to  the

sense  of  justice of the Member for Anson  in  this

particular instance? Has he got a phobia against the

banks?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister in his Second

Reading  said that the reasons for the Bill are  the

proper  control and the proper supervision of banks.

Now is he suggesting that any of the certified banks

listed in the Third Schedule has contravened any  of

these  reasons? Are the banks or any  of  the  banks

misbehaving  so badly in their banking  business -  I

mean. Mr Minister, not in their relationships  over

which the Minister has no Concern? Or should not -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I apologise for that, Sir,It was

inadvertent.  I was not addressing Mr  Minister.  I

was  addressing you but I inadvertently happened  to

look in his direction.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Farrer Park, of

course, cannot address the Speaker as Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon. I meant to say "Mr

Speaker". Sir, I accept the position that this  Bill

is  necessary.  Of course, it is necessary.  We  all

accept  that  position. It is necessary  that  there

should  he proper control over banks and that  there

should he proper supervision of banks. I agree  with

the  Member  for  Hong Lim that these  controls  are

necessary in order that in the future no bogus banks

might  come  up. But the point I am  trying  to  get

across to Mr Minister is this. Mr Speaker. Sir, if

he  is moving this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency,

then there is a suggestion that there are some banks

which  are misbehaving from a banking point of view.

The  Minister  has  made no such suggestion  to  the

House. He has not given any reasons whatsoever as to

why  this  Bill should he moved on a Certificate  of

Urgency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



through  all three stages in this House. He has  not

mentioned one word about that. One reason  he  tried

to give was this. He said the reason for the urgency

was  industrial strife in some local banks.  Now  if

there  is industrial strife  - and there is industrial

strife  in  the banks  - surely the remedy is  in  the

hands of the Minister for Labour, and not in rushing

a   Bill  through  all  the  three  stages  in  this

Assembly. He could refer all these disputes  to  the

industrial Arbitration Court. This industrial strife

will come to an end and the industrial disputes will

be    settled   properly   before   the   Industrial

Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always wondered why in

all  these  bank disputes the Government  has  never

sent   the   matters   to   the   Industrial   Court

immediately.  Insofar as the  Bank  of  America  was

concerned,  the strike was allowed to  last  for  19

days before the Government sent the matter up to the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court.  Was  there  not  an

urgency  at  that time? Why did the Government  then

not   send   up  that  dispute  to  the   Industrial

Arbitration Court as soon as it broke out?  Why  was

this   Bill  not  introduced  at  that  stage?   The

Government has not given any good reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are also informed by the

Minister  that when this Bill has been  passed  into

law   and   when   the  clearing  house   has   been

established, what is now happening in Singapore will

not  happen. I venture to suggest to him  that  that

will  not be the position under this Bill. The  mere

establishment of a clearing house under  this  Bill - as  it  is  set  out in this Bill  - is not  going  to

prevent   the  Bankers  Associations  from   getting

together and doing exactly what they are now  doing.

All that the Bill does is that it sets up a clearing

house.  All this Bill dues is, instead of the  three

banks  which are now acting as a clearing house,  to

set  up  one  clearing house. That  is  the  general

effect  of  it. But if the banks get together  after

this  Bill  - and this I pose to the Minister  in  all

seriousness -   how  does  the  Minister  propose   to

control them? If they refuse to clear in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



the  way that they are now clearing, is the clearing

house going to help the situation? Not one bit.

he  has  not told this House about. I hope  he  will

really what has induced him to move this Bill  on  a

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

July  1960, at the time of the opening of the Second

Session  of  this  Assembly, the Prime  Minister  on

moving  a  motion  of thanks to the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara for his gracious speech had this to say,  and

I  quote  from Hansard, Volume 13, No. 2  dated  3rd

August, 1960, column 54:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the past year the momentum of the P.A.P. after

its  massive  victory  in  the  last  elections  was

stupendous.  There were exuberance  and  zeal  which

took  a  lot of tempering. Minor mistakes of  haste,

born  out of impatience to put the world right, were

committed. They were errors, not of the rashness or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



wisdom  of the policy to be implemented, but of  the

intemperate  haste  which resulted  in  insufficient

preparation and the carrying of the opinion  of  the

people,  which  could have been  done  by  prolonged

consultation and public discussion.'



<br><br>Sir,  this  referred  to the haste  with  which  the

P.A.P. during its first year of office rushed  Bills

through  on  Certificates of Urgency. So I  thought,

after  having  listened to the speech of  the  Prime

Minister  in  1960, that the P.A.P. had  learnt  its

lesson  and  would  proceed cautiously.  Instead  of

which  we now have very important legislation  being

rushed  through  all its stages on a Certificate  of

Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his speech on the Second Reading said that it is desirable that Singapore and the Federation should have parallel banking legislation if the banking system is common to both territories. But is this proposed legislation parallel? It is not. It contains three

clauses which are new and which are not included  in

the banking legislation in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister refers to the reasons why this

Bill has to be taken through all its stages. He says

that   because  of  the  recurrence  of   industrial

disputes  between certain banks and  its  employees,

these   disputes   have  resulted  in   considerable

inconvenience to the public and to the  trading  and

business  community. Sir, the truth of all  this  is

that  the  Bank Employees' Union is in the hands  of

the  P.A.P., and they are playing party politics.  I

make  the solemn charge in this House that,  because

the  Union  is  a  P.A.P. union,  the  Minister  for

Finance has said that unless an apology is given  by

the  bank  concerned  to  the  union  in  the  terms

demanded  by the union, he will introduce this  Bill

today  and  rush  it  through.  I  will  make   that

allegation  at  any  time before any  Commission  of

Inquiry.  He  did  say  this - that  unless  the  bank

concerned  did give an apology to the union  in  the

terms demanded by the union, he would introduce this

Bill today and rush through all its Readings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fond of saying that anyone who

makes  an  allegation in this House  must  face  any

Commission of Inquiry. I make this charge and I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



face  it.  The  whole trouble with the banks  today.

Sir,  is  because - and I will  not  touch  at  great

length   on  it  because  I  have  a  motion -    this

particular union, in the hands of the P.A.P.,  tries

to  show  to the workers of Singapore that they  are

indeed brave men, that they are indeed fighting  for

the  workers' rights, and that other unions  led  by

other people, the Barisan Sosialis, are no good. And

they  place restrictions in the paths of unions that

do  not come under the control of the P.A.P. In this

particular   case  where  they  have  an  Industrial

Arbitration  Court, the matter could be referred  to

the  Court.  It has been referred to the Court,  and

there is a strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is a question of face. I will not touch on

the merits or demerits because I must say that I  do

not  know  fully the merits or demerits,  but  in  a

matter  of  this kind, Sir, surely the Minister  for

Labour  could have called in both parties and  given

them  a  stiff talking to and said, "Shut up,  don't

behave  like  that. The economy of  the  country  is

greater  than any political Party and anybody  else.

Go  back, do your work. Shake hands and forget about

it."  They could have done it. Instead of this,  the

Minister for Finance is here introducing a Bill  and

rushing  it  through all its stages with the  threat

that  unless  apology is given to  the  P.A.P.  Bank

Employees' Union, this Bill will be proceeded  with.

That is the true reason. Of course, the Minister can

deny  it.  But I make this solemn charge and  I  say

that what they are trying to do is not right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park, has

said that we arc in support of the principles of the

Bill.  Why rush it through for the purpose?  We  are

not here to help the P.A.P. run P.A.P. unions. It is

because of that that we are against this move on the

part of the Government to rush through this Bill. We

will  oppose  the  Second Reading now.  But  if  the

Minister will have it sent to a Select Committee, we

will  have  no  objection. In fact, we  support  the

principle  of the Bill, but we protest, and  protest

vigorously,  against  the  reasons  that  impel  the

Minister  to  introduce  it  on  a  Certificate   of

Urgency.

<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I had

not  intended to participate in this debate, but  in

view  of  the speeches which I have heard, one  from

the  Member for Farrer Park and the other  from  the

Member  for  Cairnhill, I think we  should  get  our

credentials right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Cairnhill says he does not

know  what  this is all about. I find that difficult

to  believe,  because  the  Oversea-Chinese  Banking

Corporation, which is a holding company  of  Eastern

Realty,  was  his  former  employer.  Thus  we   get

credential  No. 1 in place. I am not suggesting,  on

the  other hand, that the Member for Farrer Park  is

being paid by the O.C.B.C. to speak on their behalf,

but  I  do suggest that from, time to time, in fact,

it  is  well known that his firm of solicitors often

act  for  the  O.C.B.C. And I find it  difficult  to

believe that two persons, so closely connected with -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Sir. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have no brief here, but  I  do  ask

whether it is in order that insinuations of personal

interest should be made in this manner.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If, in fact, there have been

insinuations  of  that nature,  the  Prime  Minister

could   be  brought  up  before  the  Committee   of

Privileges  on a question of privilege.  As  far  as

rules of order are concerned, all I can say is  that

possibly  the  Prime Minister is  imputing  improper

motive and, therefore, under our Standing Orders  he

must not do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am act suggesting improper

motive,  Sir.  All I am suggesting is:  two  Members

one  moment that the Member for Farrer Park, because

he  is  closely  connected with  the  O.C.B.C.,  is,

therefore, taking sides with the O.C.B.C. What I  am

suggesting  is: I find it difficult to believe  that

two  Members  of the S.P.A., who are well  connected

with  the  bank  socially from their  past  business

association,  do  not  know the circumstances  under

which this Bill has been brought about.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, it is not worrying me at

all.  In  fact, if the Member for Farrer  Park  will

notice,  I  was  surprised why there should  be  any

hesitation  in saying point blank to the  bank  that

the  ultimate referee is the Government of the State

of  Singapore. If the banks are going to gang up  on

behalf of any single bank, be it the O.C.B.C. or any

other  bank,  and stop clearing and stop  the  whole

economic  machine in the process of  one  industrial

dispute  with an individual bank, then  I  say,  the

State intervenes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Or for the Minister for

Finance.  I  say to the O.C.B.C., and  I  know  them

well, too -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Are you sure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, the Managing Director.

Let  me tell the Member for Farrer Park the kind  of

gentlemen  we  deal  with.  The  Managing   Director

happens  to  be distantly connected with me  through

marriage.  He  told me once, when I  was  leading  a

delegation  of  postmen  in  a  dispute   with   the

Government then, that he always got his way. He  was

then  a Member of the Executive Council, and he told

me - I  was then a very much younger man - that I should

listen  to  him and settle. He said,  "You  know,  I

always win. When I was a young chap, I kept fighting

fish, and my fighting fish beat everybody's fighting

fish.  They  asked, `How did you do that?'  I  said,

`Simple.' " And I say this publicly too - I  think  he

is  not feeling very well at the moment and he  will

not be feeling very well after ha reads this. To his

fighting  fish every day he added a drop of  brandy.

So the fish got soaked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



up with it. After seven drops of brandy had gone in,

any  other fish that entered into its bowl was  out.

And  if it went into the other bowl, he poured  half

the  water from his bowl into the other. Of  course,

all this is stored away somewhere in the recesses of

one's mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Finance consulted me and

said, "Look, the banks are ganging up. What shall we

do?"  I  said, "What is all this about?" I had  been

away for some time, about a fortnight, and I did not

understand  the circumstances under which  this  had

come  about - the  pig-headedness of  this  particular

bank  and the ganging up of the other banks to  back

this   bank  at  the  expense  of  the  economy   of

Singapore. I say. "Well, if they do not want  to  do

their  duty, the Government steps in."  We  are  not

trying to help the Business Houses Employees'  Union

vis-a-vis  the O.C.B.C. They can scrub it  out.  The

O.C.B.C. is prepared to shut business. If they  shut

business,  the bank employees will suffer too.  They

lose pay. The matter can be settled, but we will not

let - 37 banks, is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thirty-five.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thirty-five banks gang up for

the  sake of the O.C.B.C.'s pig-headedness  and  jar

saying this: the Member for Cairnhill and the Member

for  Farrer Park are well acquainted with the  facts

of the dispute. I am not interested in the merits of

the  dispute.  But I say, if they  gang  up  at  the

expense of the whole economy of Singapore, it is the

duty of the Government to step in.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, recently whenever there has  been

an  industrial  dispute  in one  bank,  the  Malayan

Exchange   Banks  Association  has  taken  concerted

action  to  stop inter-banking clearing arrangements

in  all  other banks in Singapore, even though  they

are  not in any way involved in the dispute. In this

way  the  Malayan  Exchange  Banks  Association  has

inflicted unwarranted hardship on the public -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - and has attempted to convert every

isolated  industrial dispute into a general  dispute

affecting  all  the banks. This sort of  action  has

been repeated on a number of occasions recently.  In

this  way  the  Association has held the  public  to

ransom  every  time one of the associated  banks  is

involved   in   an  industrial  dispute   with   its

employees. There is as little justification for this

sort  of  action  as  there will  be  for  the  Bank

Employees' Union to call a general strike in all the

associated  banks  of  the  Malayan  Exchange  Banks

Association whenever disputes arise in  one  of  the

banks.  Government could not be expected to  condone

such  a state of affairs if action of this sort  was

taken  by the union, which would have the effect  of

causing undue hardship to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers always complain to the Ministry of

Labour  about the failure of trade unions  to  bring

trade  disputes  to  the Ministry  of  Labour.  They

always  complain to the Ministry of Labour  whenever

unions  engaged in sympathy strikes sought to extend

the  dispute  in this way to firms or  organisations

which  arc  not in any way involved in a  particular

dispute.  If this sort of industrial action  on  the

part of the unions is to be condemned because of the

prejudicial  effects it has on the  economy  of  the

State,  the action that has recently been  taken  by

the  Malayan Exchange Banks Association in  refusing

clearing  facilities in the associated  banks  which

are  not  in any way involved in the trade  dispute,

must  equally  be condemned. It is for  this  reason

that  a  clearing house has been set up under clause

16  of this Bill. Clause 16 of this Bill is designed

to  prevent  the Malayan Exchange Banks  Association

from  resorting  to such improper practices  in  the

future.  When this Bill becomes law, all  inter-bank

clearing  arrangements will be put  on  a  statutory

footing  and operated from a central clearing  house

under  Government  control.  It  is  only  by   such

arrangements that Government can put an end  to  the

hardship   which   the   Malayan   Exchange    Banks

Association  has  improperly  sought  to  impose  on

general public whenever one of its members has  been

involved in an industrial dispute.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Member for Farrer Park say to this

House  that if this clearing house is set  up,  what

can  we do about it? There is nothing to prevent the

exchange   banks  from  ganging  up  together.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would refer the Member  for  Farrer

Park to clause 31 of this Bill which provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may make such regulations as may be

required from time to time for carrying into  effect

the provisions of this Ordinance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such regulations made under those provisions

would  come under the provisions of clause  27.  Any

breach of any regulations made under clause 31 could

be  dealt  with under the general penalty provisions

of  clause  27.  May  I  read  the  general  penalty

provisions  in clause 27 to the House, Mr  Speaker,

Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any licensed bank which is guilty of an offence

copy  of these draft regulations. They will be known

as  the  Banking  Clearing House Regulations,  1962.

They  require  each  bank carrying  on  business  in

Singapore  to open immediately with the  Accountant-General  a  clearing  account in  the  name  of  the

Clearing House, and they require representatives  of

the  bank  to appear daily for the purpose of  these

clearances.  These regulations will  be  promulgated

when this Ordinance comes into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park said

just  now  that we were unduly interfering with  the

affairs  of  the banking community in  Singapore  by

introducing  this Bill in the Legislative  Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Federation

there  are  two  Ordinances: Ordinance  61  of  1958

dealing  with  the  Central  Bank  of  Malaya,   and

Ordinance  No.  62  of  1958  dealing  with  banking

generally. Except for sections 16, 17 and 19,  which

are   adapted  from  the  Central  Bank  of   Malaya

Ordinance,  all the other sections of  this  Banking

Bill are taken from Ordinance No. 62 of 1958 of  the

Federation dealing with banking generally; with  the

exception of the powers given to the Minister  under

clause  16  to  set up a clearing house,  and  under

clause  17  to  appoint  an Inspector  of  Banks  to

inspect  and investigate under conditions of secrecy

the   books,  accounts  and  transactions  of   each

licensed  bank where he has reason to  believe  that

the  licensed  bank is carrying  on  business  in  a

manner  detrimental  to  its  depositors  and  other

creditors, or has insufficient assets to  cover  its

liabilities to the pub' lie, or has contravened  the

provisions   of   the  Ordinance,   or   where   his

investigation  is  requested  at  the  instance   of

shareholders  or depositors. The rest of  the  other

provisions  of  the Central Bank  Ordinance  of  the

Federation are omitted from this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Federation, in addition

to   these  powers,  the  Central  Bank  of   Malaya

Ordinance  also  gives  the Minister  the  following

powers:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To prescribe liquid assets which each

licensed bank should hold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To make recommendations to licensed banks on

the following matters:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The policy to be followed by the banks when

granting  advances  and extension  of  credit

facilities;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Rates of interest payable to or by licensed

banks;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The reserves to be held by each licensed

bank;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The maximum amount or amounts of assets

expressed  as a percentage which  the  assets

must  bear  to sight and time liabilities  of

the licensed bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To direct or make recommendations to persons

or  classes  of persons even if they  are  not

licensed  banks if they carry on the  business

of receiving money on deposit.



<br><br>In  addition  to these powers, the Minister  in  the

Federation also has the power, once he has made  the

recommendation, to issue directives  in  writing  to

each  licensed bank, or class or classes of persons,

to  give  effect  to  the  recommendation  within  a

reasonable time, subject to penalties for  a  breach

of  these  directions. These powers  have  not  been

included  in  this  Banking Bill.  The  only  powers

incorporated are the powers of setting up a clearing

house,  and to provide for the inspection  of  banks

under conditions of secrecy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite clear that no powers

have  been  included  in this  Bill  to  enable  the

Government  to  determine the credit policy  of  the

banks   as  these  are  powers  which  are  normally

exercised  by the Board of Directors of the  Central

Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it has been suggested that this Bill has been introduced from a spirit of vindictiveness on the part of the Minister for Finance. Mr Speaker, Sir, for the information of Members of the House, this Bill has nothing to do with the dispute that is current now between the O.C.B.C. and the

Bank Employees' Union.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not the Bill. The timing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let us go briefly

into the facts of this dispute. An award was made in

the  dispute  between the Singapore Bank  Employees'

Union  and  the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation

on  the  22nd July, 1961, and covered two categories

of   employees,   the  clerks   and   the   clerical

assistants. The award covered salary scales,  bonus,

annual  leave,  casual leave, T.B. leave,  maternity

leave,   period  of  probation,  overtime,   medical

facilities.  These  are what  are  known  as  fringe

benefits. A



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



dispute arose between the Bank and the Union on  the

interpretation of certain provisions  of  the  award

referring to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The redesignation of all messengers as clerical assistants and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On the method of conversion of clerks from their old salary to the scale awarded by the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union was satisfied with the salary awarded

and   the   method   of  conversion   for   clerical

assistants. But the Union claimed that all  existing

messengers  as  in  other Chinese  banks  should  be

regarded  as  belonging  to  a  single  transferable

category.  The Bank would not accept this contention

and  disputed the contention that all the messengers

employed   in   the  Bank  belonged  to   a   single

transferable  category. In  other  words,  the  Bank

maintained that certain existing messengers were  to

he  left  out  and were not to be converted  to  the

scale  of  clerical assistants. Both  these  matters

were  put  to the referee. The referee appointed  by

the  Court  was the President of the Court  himself.

The  referee ruled that in regard to the  messengers

they belonged to a single transferable category, and

in  regard to the method of conversion of the clerks

from  their  old  scale to the new  scale,  he  made

certain rulings. The Bank read the referee's rulings

on  clerical conversion in one way and the Union  in

another.  On  the Union's reading of  the  referee's

ruling, the clerks stood to gain, and on the  Bank's

interpretation  the clerks stood to lose.  The  Bank

then  took  the point that the referee had  exceeded

his  jurisdiction as referee when he interpreted the

award. This was ultra vires as the full Court  alone

had  the jurisdiction to interpret any award. On the

strength of this argument the Bank moved to the High

Court  in  certiorari proceedings for  an  order  to

quash  the referee's award on the grounds  that  the

referee  had no powers to interpret the  award,  and

that  it  would be against natural justice  for  the

President,  who had acted as referee  to  be  called

upon later as President of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



the  Court to interpret the award. Although the Bank

disagreed   with  the  referee's  rulings   on   the

redesignation  of messengers as clerical  assistants

the  Bank  did  offer payment to all  messengers  as

clerical assistants in accordance with the award.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there was no dispute in regard to the

conversion of messengers to the new scale awarded by

the   Court  for  clerical  assistants,  the   Union

instructed  its members to accept this payment.  The

payment  was made in accordance with the  ruling  of

the  referee  that all messengers employed  by  this

Bank belonged to a single transferable category  and

should  all  be  converted  to  the  new  scale  for

clerical assistants. In relation to the clerks,  the

Bank  did make an offer to the Union to make payment

in  accordance with their reading of the  award  and

their  reading of the referee's ruling of the award.

The  Union  refused to accept any  payment  for  the

clerks  pending a complete clarification of all  the

conversion  items  in  dispute.  There  were   still

differences between the Union and the Bank as to how

the  clerks should be converted from their old scale

to  the  new scale. The clerks going on to  the  new

scale  had  different conversion points on  the  new

scale  varying  with their length of  service.  This

offer  by the Bank to the Union to make payments  to

the clerks and the refusal by the Union of the offer

took  place  in  September last year.  Subsequently,

without the knowledge of the Union, and against  the

Union's  stated stand in the matter, the  Bank  made

payment to a few individual members of the Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union also alleged that officers of the Bank

had attempted improperly to induce other members  of

the  Union  to  accept payment against  the  Union's

wishes.  This was discovered by the Union  recently.

The  Union  asked  the Bank for an  apology  on  the

grounds  that  unilateral  arrangements  between  an

employer  and  individual members of the  Union  had

been  made secretly, completely bypassing the Union,

and  this  was  clearly an attempt by  the  Bank  to

subvert  good industrial relations with  the  Union.

The Union gave the Bank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



48   hours'  grace  in  which  to  make  a  suitable

expression of regret and to give an undertaking that

in  future  there would be direct official  dealings

only   between   the   Bank   and   the   recognised

representative  of the Union, and  that  they  would

avoid   entering  into  similar  secret   unilateral

arrangements  with individuals in the  future.  Even

before  the 48 hours were due to elapse,  the  Union

received a letter from the Bank containing a  series

of threats to prosecute the Union for non-compliance

with  the award. Incidentally that was signed by  L.

C. Goh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present strike has nothing whatever to do with

the  question  of  the  certiorari  proceedings  for

quashing  the referee's order, which was  instituted

by  the  Bank in the High Court recently. The Union,

the   Bank   and  the  State  Advocate-General   all

consented to this Order. It was right of the Bank to

offer  payments  to  the clerks in  accordance  with

their  reading of the award. But once the Union  had

indicated  that  it disagreed with the  management's

interpretation  and would not accept  payment  until

these  disagreements  had  been  clan-fled,  it  was

improper  of  the  Bank  to have  made  payments  to

individual members of the Union behind the  back  of

the  Union. This was the issue which has led to  the

present strike. The application -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I allowed the Minister to

commence because he said it was going to be  a  very

brief statement of the dispute. I take it that he is

justifying  the  reason  why  this  Bill  has   been

introduced on a Certificate of Urgency. That is  the

only  relevance, I think, of this statement, because

I  cannot  see how the dispute between the Bank  and

the  Union has anything to do with the principle  of

this Bill and that is what we are debating.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I heard the Member for

Cairnhill  say just now that it was because  of  the

dispute between the O.C.B.C. and the Bank Employees'

Union  that this Bill has been introduced.  He  also

said  just  now  that  we were supporting  a  P.A.P.

union.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The point is that the Minister

has   gone   into   details  which  are   completely

irrelevant to the principle of the Bill.  I  do  not

think the Member for Cairnhill went into details. He

just  said in passing that that was his opinion  and

that   it  could  be  denied  from  the  Ministerial

Benches.  But  these  details,  which  seem  to   be

justifying a Union's action, have nothing to do with

the principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to trace the

history of this dispute in some detail to show  that

it   has   nothing  whatsoever  to   do   with   the

circumstances which led to the introduction of  this

Bill.  It is because of the ganging up of the  banks

and  the  denial of clearing facilities and  of  the

imposition that the banks have placed on members  of

the public that this Bill has been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may refer to the point

raised  by the Member for Anson. He wanted  to  know

why,  under clause 34 of the Bill, the licences that

were  issued to banks under the Companies  Ordinance

were  deemed  to be issued under the  provisions  of

this  Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, all banks are required

to  be registered under the Companies Ordinance. All

that  this Bill does is to give a licence under  the

new  Banking Ordinance to banks which are registered

under the Companies Ordinance in order that they may

carry on the business of banking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Anson will

look at clause 32 of the Bill, he will find that  it

seeks   to   amend  section  309  of  the  Companies

Ordinance.  Section  309 of the Companies  Ordinance

refers   to  the  licensing  of  banks  which   have

headquarters  elsewhere which carry on  business  in

Singapore.  Under  this  section  of  the  Companies

Ordinance, such banks have to take out licences.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



No  such  licences are required under this  section

of  the  Companies  Ordinance for  banks  which  are

locally incorporated and which carry on business  in

the State of Singapore. The provisions of clauses 32

and  34 of the Bill require all existing banks which

are already registered under the Companies Ordinance

to  take  out licences. They shall take out licences

under the provisions of clause 34.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any hon. Member wishes to speak? Dr

Goh then in reply.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I really have very little to

add in reply to the points raised by the Opposition.

I  am  glad to note that there is general assent  to

the  contents of the Bill and the purpose which this

Bill  sets  out to achieve. Certain Members  of  the

Opposition   regret  the  timing.  The  Member   for

Cairnhill,  in particular, thinks the whole  purpose

of  this  operation is to favour the Bank Employees'

Union.  But  he  has not explained exactly  in  what

manner  the  immediate passage  of  this  Bill  will

assist the Bank Employees' Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from our point of view, the issue is quite

simple. There has been a strike by the Union at  the

O.C.B.C.  Whenever  strikes occur  at  other  banks,

members  of  the Malayan Exchange Banks Association,

who  control  and operate their own clearing  house,

decide  on  one  pretext or other to slow  down  the

clearing  operation.  On  one  occasion  at   least,

matters  reached such a stage that nearly the  whole

economy of Singapore almost came to a grinding halt.

When  this  particular strike at the O.C.B.C. broke

out,  it  was  obvious  that the  same  practice  of

restricting inter-bank clearances would  he  carried

out by the Exchange Banks. It is in the interests of

the Government to see that the general public is not

inconvenienced.   The  most  obvious   and   easiest

solution is to see that the strike ends as early  as

possible. If the strike continues for any length  of

time  with  inter-bank clearances curtailed,  it  is

quite  evident that the Government must move in  and

provide the inter-bank clearances which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



the  banks  themselves are unable or  unwilling  to

provide. For these reasons, therefore, when  certain

members  of the Exchange Banks saw me, I decided  to

assist  in any way possible to bring the two parties

together  to  an  early settlement. It  became  very

clear  to  me that in this instance, the  union  was

clearly  in  the  right and the banks  were  in  the

wrong. There were absolutely no two ways about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Not only was the Bank in the

wrong,  but it acted in the most extraordinary  way.

The Union members, in the first instance, decided to

give the Bank two days to make up their minds before

they called a strike On Wednesday. The banks held  a

meeting with representatives of the Union. Far  from

achieving  any  settlement,  it  brought  about  the

opposite  effect. Instead of waiting till  Wednesday

to  strike,  they  went on strike  on  Tuesday,  the

following  day.  I tried to convince  the  banks  in

general and this particular Bank in particular  that

it  was  not in their interests to continue in  this

strike and that, in my opinion, the terms offered by

the Union were moderate and reasonable and should be

accepted  by  the  banks.  If  there  was  no  early

settlement  of the strike, I informed  them  that  I

intended  to  bring this Bill before the  House  and

pass  it  on a Certificate of Urgency, set  up  this

clearing  house so that the inconvenience caused  by

the strike can be restricted to the minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park thought I was trying to

hide  something  and that I did not  give  the  full

picture.  It was surely not necessary for  me,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in moving the Second Reading  to  go

into  all  these  details. I  would  not  know,  for

instance,  that  the two hon. Members  had  such  an

intimate  interest  in  the subject.  But  there  is

nothing that the Government has done that it has  to

apologise  for  and  be  in any  way  ashamed.  This

particular bank and the banks in general  have  only

themselves  to  blame  for bringing  this  state  of

affairs  about. But in moving the Second Reading,  I

did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



say  that the reasons for proceeding with this  Bill

on  a Certificate of Urgency were the recurrence  of

industrial disputes in local banks and the  need  to

provide  a  Government clearing house  so  that  the

inconvenience  arising from such  disputes  will  be

restricted  in  their effect. That  is  the  general

explanation.  There is nothing for  me,  as  Finance

Minister  of  the  Government, to conceal  from  the

public.  If the Member for Cairnhill wants  to  give

his  evidence on oath, nobody is going to  stop  him

from  so  doing. He can go to the Supreme Court  and

sign a statutory declaration for all I care. I think

I have dealt with the most important point raised by

the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked whether there would be

adequate  arrangements for the  clearing  house.  My

reply is that the administrative arrangement for the

clearing house was made several months ago  when  we

foresaw that the time might come when the Government

would have to intervene in this matter. As early  as

last   November  all  the  draft  regulations   were

completed, the administrative schemes drawn up,  and

consultations and instructions carried out with  the

Central  Bank in Malaya to see what their procedures

are.  As I have said, arrangements are well in hand.

There  is  some difficulty about getting  furniture.

That  is the last report. We had to bring 42 tables,

one  table for each hank and so on and so forth. The

P.W.D. have not been as expeditious as they could. I

do  not know what the reasons are, but generally  we

are  pressing ahead as fast as possible. I have been

assured by the Deputy Controller of Foreign Exchange

that he could get the clearing house in operation by

Friday, but he thought it would be a bit of a sweat.

He  assured  me, however, that it would be  in  full

blast the following week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part of

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Part III, clauses 7 to15. Is there

any particular clause on which any Member wishes  to

speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> There are a number of clauses.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will take the Part clause by

clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 8 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, there are two points on this

particular clause. In clause 8 (1) (b) (i), it  says

"a  sum  equal to not less than fifty per centum  of

such net profits;". These are payments which are  to

be  made  into  the reserve fund - 50  per  cent.  The

quantum  is  set  out,  of  course.  There   is   no

difficulty  about  it.  It is  related  to  the  net

profits.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own experience and in the experience of the

Court,  they  have always found great difficulty  in

arriving at what net profits are. There is always an

argument on what net profits are. Could the Minister

inform  the House what exactly he thinks net profits

are,  and whether it would not do some good to  this

particular  clause if the phrase  "net  profits"  is

defined? That is the first point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in sub-clause (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the Minister is satisfied that the aggregate

reserve fund of a licensed bank whose head office is

situated  outside  Singapore  is  adequate  for  its

business he may by order in writing exempt such bank

from  the  provisions  of  subsection  (1)  of  this

section.'



<br><br>It  appears  to  me that under this  sub-clause  the

banks   which   have  their  head  offices   outside

Singapore seem, on the face of it, to he on  a  more

favourable footing. The yardstick for foreign  banks

is  adequacy for its business, but, insofar as local

banks  are concerned, it is another yardstick. Could

the  Minister explain to the House what  exactly  is

meant  by  the "aggregate reserve fund of a licensed

bank   whose   head   office  is  situated   outside

Singapore"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is

rather  difficult  for me at this stage,  before  we

have  any  experience of administering the Ordinance

itself,  just  to  say  whether  or  not  any  tight

definition of "net profits" is necessary.  My  guess

is  that  it is not necessary because it  is  not  a

matter  of the banks having to pay out or  lose  any

sum  of  money  which is based on net  profits.  For

instance,  in the case of the Income Tax  Ordinance,

the definition of "net profits" must be a very close

one  indeed, because it is subject to taxation.  But

here  it  is  not. I would say that  that  would  be

sufficient provided the accounts are set  out  by  a

reputable firm of auditors and there is no  fiddling

about  with  the expense accounts and so  forth.  In

practice,  of course, what I suspect will happen  is

that  most of the banks will have reserve  funds  in

excess of these statutory requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 8 (2), there is no question of treating

overseas   banks   more  favourably   than   locally

incorporated banks. So the difficulty is this,  that

in the case of a locally incorporated bank, you have

an easy criterion, that is, the paid-up capital, and

so you can relate everything to that. In the case of

branch  banks  with headquarters outside  Singapore,

this is not always the case. You have to get another

entity.  In  clause  34 (2) (b), for  instance,  the

element which is taken will be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



equivalent of the paid-up capital or assets held  in

Singapore in the form of immovable property or other

kind  of approved assets. I rather suspect that,  in

the  first instance at any rate, that could  be  the

yardstick   whereby   clause   8   (2)   would    be

administered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Clause 15 (7)?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Clause 15 (7), yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, on clause 8 (1) (b), I appreciate

the  Minister's difficulties in this  matter  and  I

appreciate that until these things are worked, it is

very   difficult.  But  I  wonder  if  the  Minister

realises that non-compliance with clause 8  (1)  (b)

is  an  offence  punishable under  clause  27  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any licensed bank which is guilty of an offence

against  this  Ordinance for  which  no  penalty  is

expressly  provided shall, on conviction, be  liable

to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars.'.



<br><br>So  that  on  a  difference of opinion  between  the

Inspector and the bank on the question of  what  net

profits could be, the bank might find itself in  the

District  Court  facing a criminal charge,  which  I

think  is  not a very desirable thing. But,  on  the

other  hand,  I appreciate that there  is  a  saving

clause  that  no  prosecutions  will  be  instituted

without  the  consent of the State  Advocate-General

and  probably in such a case the the State Advocate-General  will  not  sanction  a  prosecution.  I  am

looking hopefully at the Minister for Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He does not command the State

Advocate-General.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, no. Sir, the other point which I

have  raised  and  to  which the  Minister  has  not

replied  - he has tried to answer what is adequate for

its  business - he has not told us what the  aggregate

reserve  fund  of a licensed bank is.  I  understand

what  a  reserve  fund  of  a  particular  bank  in,

Singapore  is,  but  I fail to understand  what  the

aggregate reserve fund of a licensed bank is. I take

it  that "aggregate" in its normal connotation means

the  adding of various sums or multiplying  by  that

number. But what does the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



aggregate  refer to - all its branches throughout  the

world,  or all its branches throughout the  country,

or what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I should say the aggregate

reserve fund refers to the reserve fund of a  branch

bank in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is provided for

in  clause 15 (7), where the head office is situated

outside Singapore and properly audited reports  have

to  be  sent  in  of  the annual balance  sheet  and

accounts  of  such bank. On compliance there  is  an

exemption from the provisions of the appointment  of

auditors required under clause 15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these clauses have been looked

at  very  closely by the State Advocate-General.  He

has  been in correspondence with his opposite number

in  the  Federation. He has been assured that  these

identical  clauses  have been in  operation  in  the

Federation  since 1958 and that there have  been  no

difficulties whatsoever. Everybody understands  what

net profits are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not on the net

profits now. I have let the net profits go by on the

basis  of the Minister's statement. I want  to  know

what  an  aggregate reserve fund is. I am suggesting

to  the  Minister that it is no answer to tell  this

House  that  the State Advocate-General advises  him

that  that is so. If the Minister does not know  the

answer, let him tell the House that he does not know

the answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Well, he has made his point, Mr

Speaker,   Sir.  This  is  a  piece  of   comparable

legislation. A similar Ordinance has been applied in

the  Federation  from  1958.  Have  there  been  any

difficulties?  The State Advocate-General  has  made

enquiries and he says that no such difficulties have

arisen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not know why the Member

for Farrer Park is pursuing this point. If he thinks

that  there is something technical about it and that

certain  implications or meanings  should  be  drawn

out,  he should tell the House. So far as I can see,

this  is  a  perfectly  simple term.  The  aggregate

reserve  fund  would refer to all the reserve  funds

held



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



by the branch in Singapore. It does not refer to the

reserve  funds  held outside, whether  in  the  head

office or elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I knew the answer,

I would not be asking that question. I really do not

know  what the aggregate reserved fund of a licensed

bank,   whose   head  office  is  situated   outside

Singapore, is. Unless the Minister is able  to  tell

the  House, or somebody  - I suppose the Inspector  of

Banks -   must  be able to advise these foreign  banks

what exactly is the aggregate reserve fund which  is

necessary  under clause 8 (1) (b) (ii), because  non-compliance  with clause 8 (1) (b) (ii),  as  I  have

already  indicated  to the Minister,  is  punishable

under  clause  27. Therefore, it is  important  that

this  House  is told how the aggregate reserve  fund

under clause 8 (2) is ascertained. I think I am  not

being  unfair. The Minister must I assume have  done

his homework.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> All that this sub-clause (2)

says  is that if there is an aggregate reserve fund,

then this particular bank will be exempted from  the

operation of sub-clause (1). If there is no  reserve

fund  held  by  the  branch in Singapore,  then  the

operation of sub-clause (1) would be required by the

bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I might explain the procedure. This

is  an urgent Bill and therefore when I call "clause

9", that is the time when any Member wishing to make

an amendment to this clause must move the amendment.

There  is  no  notice required for any amendment  in

regard  to  urgent  Bills.  The  time  to  move   an

When  I  pose  the Question, "The Question  is  that

clause 9 (or any clause) stand part of the Bill," it

will he too late to do so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked at the Federation Ordinance, and in

the   Federation  the  languages   in   which   this

requirement  concerns itself with  are  English  and

Malay  newspapers. Here the Government  has  altered

the   Bill  to  read  "English,  Chinese  and  Malay

newspapers" and I take it it has quite inadvertently

left  out  "Tamil". Mr Speaker. Sir,  I  have  very

often  heard  it  said that the  Government  is  not

really interested in the Tamil language and that the

Tamil  language is just a step-sister. I refused  to

believe it, but after this Bill. I have some grounds

for believing it. We have four official languages in

this Assembly, and if the Government saw fit to take

in Chinese, I do not see why they should not take in

Tamil, which s also an official language.

It  would appear that the publications will have  to

two English newspapers daily, under this Bill as  it

stands,  it  will have to be two. Sir, I  am  really

should  have been "or" - "or Tamil newspaper". But  as

and say "in at least one local daily Malay newspaper

and  at least one local daily Tamil newspaper", that

will  cover  it.  There will be no misunderstanding.

necessarily  in  a  Tamil  newspaper  or   a   Malay

of  something which is certain. I am not quite  sure

what the implications of the amendment of the Member

accept  it.  Although  I  think  this  is  not  very

elegant,  at  least it is sure, and I  think  it  is

necessary  in  a legal enactment to be  sure  rather

than to be elegant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member for Anson insisting?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is  not merely a question of elegance.  We  have

reached  a  point of absurdity when we  repeat  that

phrase  four times. It is a question of good  sense.

Would  the Member for Farrer Park, who is a  lawyer,

tell  us where it errs - "in at least four local daily

newspapers,  one  each  published  in  the  English,

Chinese,  Malay and Tamil languages"? Where  is  the

ambiguity?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have wasted quite a number of

by the Member for Anson is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, lines 31 and 32, to leave out "local

daily English, Chinese and Malay newspapers" and

insert "at least four local daily newspapers, one

each published in the English, Chinese, Malay and

Tamil languages".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Part IV. Are there any clauses on

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. There are a number of amendments,

Mr Speaker, which I wish to move to clause 16. I

will hand these amendments to hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The second amendment is on page 9,

line 35. That seems to be wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir. It should he

line 7.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Page 9, line 7. Perhaps the Member

for Farrer Park should first deal with the first two

amendments. They seem to be connected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. It would be convenient if I could

deal with the first two amendments. I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 5, to leave out, "shall" and

insert "may", and in page 9, line 7, at end, to add,

"The Clearing House so established shall come into

operation on such date as the Minister may by

notification in the Gazette appoint."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have moved the first amendment

merely  to  invite  discussion  on  this  particular

clause so that we can know exactly what is meant  by

a clearing house, where it is to be established, who

is to run it, and in which premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is an amendment of substance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Clearing House so established shall come into

operation on such date as the Minister may by

notification in the Gazette appoint."



<br><br>It  seems  to  me  that although the Minister  might

create  a  clearing house, I think it is  recognised

that  the  Minister having exercised his power,  the

exercise  of  that power should be notified  in  the

Gazette, and that it is only after notification that

the  power  should become effective. So it  is  with

that  intention in view that I have moved the second

amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will take one amendment at a time.

It  has  been moved in page 9, line 5, to leave  out

"shall" and there to insert "may". The Question  is,

That the word proposed to be left out, he left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated, the debate may range over the second

amendment,  in page 9, line 7, at end, to  add  "The

Clearing  House  so  established  shall  come   into

operation  on  such  date as  the  Minister  may  by

notification in the Gazette appoint."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I might add that in

the Federation, it is the Central Bank that does it,

so  that  the  Central  Bank is already  established

under  another  Ordinance.  There  it  has  a  legal

entity.  There is a Clearing House, something  which

the  Minister is going to create by virtue  of  this

Bill.  As the clause now stands, it appears that  as

soon  as he puts his signature to a piece of  paper,

the  Clearing  House is created. But  I  think  that

state of affairs is undesirable and the coming  into

operation of the Clearing House should be `by virtue

of   a   notification  in  the  Gazette  under   the

Minister's hand.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light of

the  disclosures  made to us this afternoon  by  the

Minister for Finance, which of course, were met with

both amazement and consternation, I think there  can

be  no  question but that this House make this power

compulsory  - "he shall". No question of "may"  as  of

now. It is the duty of the Government to protect our

economy   from   the   irresponsible   conduct   and

contumacious  conduct  of  these  banks.   I   would

certainly  not  agree  to the first  amendment.  For

myself  I  want  to make it quite clear  that  I  am

indeed  grateful  to the Minister for  having  taken

steps already to make possible the establishment  of

a Clearing House next week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second amendment, Mr Speaker, it does

not  seem  to me to have any real importance.  There

are  35  banks  involved  which  will  naturally  be

communicated  with. The Clearing House  affects  the

banks directly and not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



individual  depositors or the payees. They  are  the

persons  who  have to know when the  Clearing  House

comes into operation, and it seems to me, Sir,  that

it really does not go any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, I trust I will be given an

opportunity - I do not know whether this would  be  an

appropriate  time - to  ask for the  deletion  of  the

words,  "at  an appropriate time and in  conjunction

with banks operating in Singapore". Could we discuss

that  amendment? Mr Speaker, Sir, may I  have  your

leave?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on the amendment to leave

out  the  word "shall". I think we will  dispose  of

that first.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Any other Member wishing to speak on

this amendment, in page 9, line 5, to leave out  the

word "shall"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to say more on

this. The art of draftsmanship is not a simple  one.

I  think  both  the Member for Farrer Park  and  the

Member  for  Anson will understand  that  it  is  an

esoteric  one  which is not for general  lawyers.  I

mean  that non-specialists in that particular  field

of  the law should leave it well alone. There may be

a  whole series of interpretation arising out of  an

alteration in the phrase. To my mind, the reading of

the  phrase  as it stands, "shall at an  appropriate

time", really means what the Member for Farrer  Park

wants to do, namely, to make it a discretion at  the

appropriate time. What is the appropriate time is  a

matter  which no doubt would be decided by officials

and  other expert parties, and to change it to "may"

does  not carry it any further. To leave out "at  an

appropriate  time"  means we  go  into  the  banking

business  willy-nilly.  Not having  gone  into  this

matter,  I would say, on first principle,  leave  it

well  alone. This is not an amendment of  substance.

This  is  an  amendment of form. As to form,  I  say

doubtless the State Advocate-General, who has  spent

some   time   over  it - poring  over  the   principal

Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Federation from which he  has  adopted  and

incorporated  several provisos - must have  considered

all  these  points.  I would rather  leave  it  well

alone.  I  would say, as to the first amendment,  we

leave   both  "shall"  as  it  is  and   a   Gazette

notification does not carry the point any further. I

should imagine long before the Minister puts his pen

to  paper, they would all be running around  to  the

Clearing House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not know whether it

will  help the Member for Farrer Park rather to  say

this. Does it really matter whether "I shall do  it"

or  "I may do it"? The point is, "I will do it."  As

for  gazetting this thing, the Member for Anson  has

said that there are only 35 banks involved. In fact,

my  Ministry official have already got in touch with

them to work out the details of the operation of the

Clearing House. I do not think we are arguing a very

major point of substance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think the Minister for Finance has

misunderstood  me and so has the Prime  Minister.  I

merely  move the amendment "shall" to "may"  because

it  is very difficult, under the Standing Orders, to

have  a complete discussion on the sub-clause  going

without this particular amendment. The point of  the

amendment  was to invite debate on the  question  of

what this Clearing House is, what it is intended  to

do,  and  how  it  will perform its  functions  more

efficiently than it has done at the present  moment.

It  is only with that intent, and when that part  of

it  has  been  satisfied, I intend to withdraw  that

amendment.  That is why, when I moved the amendment,

I  said it is merely one of form, to invite a debate

and an explanation of the term "Clearing House", and

what   it   is  intended  to  mean.  The  subsequent

amendment  following  the word  "House"  is  one  of

substance. It is one of substance in the sense  that

although  it is a question of 35 banks, I think  the

Member  for  Anson and the Hon, the  Prime  Minister

will  understand that this is not a private business

where  the Minister writes to the banks and  says  a

Clearing House is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



established. It is an Ordinance, it is  the  law  of

the  country, and it is vital that it should be done

by  means  of  a Gazette notification. That  is  the

proper  thing  to  do. We are looking  at  it  as  a

domestic  issue.  It is not. It is  on  the  Statute

books and in the years to come we want to know  when

this  Clearing  House  is established  and  on  what

particular date.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I take it that the Member for

Farrer  Park wishes to withdraw his first  amendment

but is pursuing his second amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is so, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Member wishes for leave

to withdraw the first amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, all I wanted was an

explanation from the Minister for Finance as to what

this Clearing House is, how it is to be established,

and what it is going to do that the present clearing

system  does not do. I have not had a reply  yet  to

all these questions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It does not arise on the amendment,

does  it?  The  amendment merely asks to  leave  out

"shall" and insert "may".



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> How then can I get this explanation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> When the Question on the clause is

proposed, "That the clause stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> At a later stage?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am satisfied with that. Therefore,

may I beg leave to withdraw my first amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on the second amendment.

Will the Member now move formally?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 7, at end, to add "The Clearing

such date as the Minister may by notification in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to repeat what I have said. The

reason for this is to see that an effective date  is

set  to  it, and the effective date will be  set  in

such a way that it could be proved by the production

of the Gazette.

this amendment. It seems only 35 banks are involved.

I  see no reason why it is necessary to resort to  a

Gazette notification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee resumed.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the hon. Member for Farrer Park

wish to move his third amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have had an opportunity of looking

at  this proposed amendment, i.e., in page 9,  after

line 16, to add a new sub-clause:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On and after the establishment of the Clearing

House  no  industrial action in any form  whatsoever

shall  he  taken by any bank with its  employees  in

respect of industrial matters and all trade disputes

between any hank and an association of its employees

shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



be  referred to the Industrial Arbitration Court  or

such  other  tribunal or body as  the  Minister  may

appoint for hearing and adjudication."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me there are two objections to this

amendment.  One  is  under Standing  Order  No.  69,

paragraph (2), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any such Committee [i.e. the Committee on the

Bill]  shall  have power to make such amendments  to

the  Bill as they shall think fit; provided that the

amendments (including new clauses and new schedules)

are relevant to the subject matter of the Bill;'.



<br><br>The subject matter of the Bill is the subject matter

as  indicated in the title of the Bill, which is "An

Ordinance   to   provide  for  the   licensing   and

regulation of the business of banking, and to  amend

certain  provisions of the Companies Ordinance."  So

it  does  appear  to me that this amendment  is  not

really  relevant to the subject matter of  the  Bill

and  there is, of course, authority to say  that  an

amendment is irrelevant if it goes beyond the  scope

of the Bill. That is the first objection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objection, part of the amendment

anyway, seeks, in fact, to make an amendment to  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance. Section  28  of  the

Ordinance  indicates when a trade dispute should  be

referred  to the Industrial Arbitration  Court.  The

correct legislative procedure for the Member, if  he

proposes  to  pursue his subject on that  particular

aspect  of his amendment, is to take steps to  amend

that  section. I must rule it cannot be done by  way

of   an   amendment   to  this  particular   clause.

Therefore, my ruling is that the amendment is out of

order and cannot be moved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I speak on the clause?

on the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, not on the amendment. You

have already ruled on the amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, apart from the two

procedural  points  you  have  raised  against   the

amendment, which you have ruled is out of  order,  I

might mention that I did discuss the matter with the

Member for Farrer Park and I pointed out to him that

the  substantive effect of this amendment, if it was

carried,  would  mean in effect  that  a  a  radical

change  would be created in industrial relations  in

all banks.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Prime Minister speaking on

the amendment I have over-ruled?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On the amendment you have over-ruled, but in passing, Mr Speaker, Sir. What I wish

to  say  is this - that it then transpired, I think  I

must  say this in fairness to him, that he had moved

this  really for the purposes of debate and  he  was

anxious  that  the Government should make  it  quite

clear   that  it  is  not  the  intention   of   the

Government,  by  setting up this clearing  house  to

allow the union to sort of pick the banks as victims

in turn, one at a time, so that in that way one bank

after  the  other could be penalised. First  he  had

explained   that  obviously  the  bank   which   was

recalcitrant might lose custom. I pointed out to him

that  that was a possible method of operation if  we

wanted to kill private banking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has already stated quite categorically that our entrepot trade, for various reasons, is best served by leaving the commercial banks as they are for a very long time, and it is not the intention of the Government to penalise or to milk each bank in turn. But I have said just now and I repeat this: if the banks, for various reasons

of their own, decide to gang up against the union on

behalf  of one of its members and thereby bring  the

whole of the banking system to a grinding halt, then

it is the duty of the Government to ensure that they

are  frustrated in that attempt. For the duty of the

Government is to maintain a fair balance. The system

must be kept going. As has been aptly described,  if

you shoot the pianist, the dancing stops. And it  is

not  the  business of the Government  to  shoot  the

pianist. But if the pianist refuses to play, then  I

say  it  is the business of the Government to ensure

that somebody is there in order that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



the  music  can go on and the economy  can  tick.  I

think  I  made  fairly  clear the  position  of  the

Government. We are openly in favour of the  workers,

but  we cannot afford to allow either in the banking

industry  or  in any industry a situation  to  arise

where  the  enterprise  upon which  the  economy  of

Singapore is founded is run down to earth because it

is  no  longer  profitable. The basic  principle  of

private  enterprise  is the  profit  motive  and  we

accept that, and that is the contradiction we  face.

We  have  inherited  a free trade  economy.  We  are

pledged to certain policies on behalf of the workers

to  level down or level up benefits, and I  say,  in

the interest of both the workers and the economy  as

a  whole, a certain measure of free play and balance

must  be  maintained.  But if one  employer - in  this

particular  case  the  O.C.B.C. and  its   managing

directors  - is recalcitrant, then I say it can  fight

it  out with the union. We are not helping the union

by  this.  But  we  are  preventing  the  bank  from

bringing the economy of Singapore to a grinding halt

by ganging up with the other banks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed obliged

to  the  Hon, the Prime Minister for that statement.

The  purpose of these amendments to clause  16,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  was to seek some sort  of  assurance

from  the Government that, as a result of this Bill,

a  situation  such as I have envisaged could  happen

would  not  happen. As the Prime  Minister  has  now

assured us that in these matters it is the intention

of the Government to hold the balance evenly between

employer  and  employee  and  that  it  is  not  the

intention  of the Government to let the economy  and

trade of this country run to ruin and run to seed, I

am  quite  happy. On the principle of  the  Bill,  I

accept that the Bill should go through, but I was  a

bit  worried  that the timing of the Bill  was  such

that  it  might create suspicions in  the  minds  of

certain trade unionists in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it an amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> An amendment, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 12, line 37, to leave out "five" and

insert "fifty".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have had in this House a Bill

introduced   with   reference  to   privileges   and

immunities whereby the Government sought strenuously

to have a maximum fine of $5,000 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Anson must not

go into such details of a Bill which is now before a

Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect, I am

referring to the Bill as published and in respect of

the Second Reading.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Member is

justified  in saying the Government has  strenuously

sought  to  impose  a  penalty  of  that  sort.  The

strenuous effort has not even arrived.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Government has sought to impose

the  maximum  penalty of $5,000  in  respect  of  a

breach  of  privilege in connection with  individual

Members  in  this House. Compared to  a  bank  whose

minimum  capital is $2 million with an equal reserve

fund,  where  do  the  financial  resources  of  the

individual  Members  come in?  Particularly  in  the

light  of  the  statement made by the  Minister  for

Finance  and  the contemptuous conduct indicated  of

banks  towards  the  request  of  the  Minister  for

responsible action, do we not recognise the need for

really punitive measures in the event that the banks

seek to disregard the requirements of the law? To  a

man  like  Mr  Tan  Chin  Tuan,  $5,000  is  almost

invisible; he would need a magnifying glass.  It  is

absurd  to suggest that we should penalise  by  only

$5,000 a bank that does not provide a reserve  fund,

a bank that does not comply with the requirements of

the  Ordinance. There is not even an alternative  of

imprisonment for the officers concerned.  This  kind

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



tender  approach  on  the  part  of  the  Government

towards  the  banks, particularly in  the  light  of

their recent conduct, is more than surprising, and I

ask  that we redress the balance a little by  making

the penalty realistic.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am quite happy with the

amendment. Of course, I must say that the  power  to

restrict  this  penalty  does  not  rest  with   the

Government  but with the law courts. The  fact  that

you  have  to provide for a higher penalty does  not

mean  that,  in  fact, it will be  enforced  if  the

offence  with  which the bank is charged  and  found

guilty  does  not  merit such a punishment.  But  on

principle,  there  is  nothing  the  Government  has

against the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to mention this

business of upping the kitty. The last time  it  was

done  in  the  City  Council, I believe  the  P.A.P.

Councillors  moved  for a 20 cent  increase  in  the

salary of the daily rated. The Opposition, which had

been  in charge of the City Council for a long  time

before that and had done nothing about it, upped  it

by  another 20 cents since the money did not  belong

to  them.  And  if  we keep on upping  the  fine  to

$50,000 and somebody takes it into his mind  to  add

another  zero, so it can go on. I think we will  let

the  Member for Anson have the credit for adding the

first zero and leave it at that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It seems to me that the eagle eye of

the  Member for Anson has not noticed that in  other

clauses the penalty is only $5,000.

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 33 inclusive ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 14, to leave out lines 35 to 38 and insert

"with or without conditions".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law has sought

to  answer  the objection I made during  the  Second

Reading,    but   I   fear   that   there    is    a

misunderstanding. I know that he will correct me  if

I  am  wrong,  but as I read this clause,  Sir,  the

Minister   has  no  power  at  all  to  impose   any

conditions  on a licence to an existing  bank  other

than  the  conditions which are existing already  in

1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from him now that some banks have no

licence  at  all;  so there are no  conditions.  And

other  banks  probably  just have  licences  without

conditions. So that it really means, in effect, that

the Minister has no power to lay down conditions  in

granting  the  licences  to  these  existing   banks

although  he  has  the power under  clause  3(4)  to

impose  conditions in respect of grants of  licences

to  new  banks. I seek to equalise the  position  in

respect of existing banks and new banks to give  the

Minister unfettered power in his discretion to  make

such conditions as he may consider necessary on  the

licences in respect of banks already established  as

he  can in respect of new banks. That is the purpose

of  the  amendment. If you will notice, it will  now

read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"shall ... be granted a licence with or without

conditions".



<br><br>And  the  wording in clause 3(4) "grant  a  licence,

with or without conditions".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not at

all happy about the amendment proposed by the Member

for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> To give you added power.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Farrer Park says

that  it  gives  me added power. My present  unhappy

state of mind should surely convince him of my fully

democratic persuasions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are good reasons for the clause as it

stands.  May I say that this is not a new  Ordinance

or  an  untried Ordinance? It has been tried in  the

Federation  for  more than two years  and  has  been

found  satisfactory. The purpose of this whole  Bill

is  not to point a gun at the head of banks. I think

it  will be wrong in principle to centralise so much

power in the hands of one man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But he will be able to dictate

terms  in  detail to important institutions  of  the

economy.  Of course, it may be that the  Member  for

Anson  has great trust in my discretion. If that  is

the case -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You will not be there long.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - I am most delighted. But, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on principle, I think it is wrong  to

give  such powers to the Government where  the  need

for such powers has not been clearly established. If

the  Member for Anson will just say what he  has  in

mind  quite  apart  from  carrying  on - he  must   be

carrying on a war with somebody - whether in  fact  he

could  say, "These are the conditions I think  which

should be applied to banks of this type." If he  can

satisfy  the Government that there is a  great  need

for  that, then I think we might reconsider, but  so

far, quite apart from venting wrath on the banks,  I

do not think he has established a case.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is an

agonizingly frustrating experience to try  and  talk

logic  to the Minister for Finance. If no conditions

are  necessary, why do we have clause  3(4)?  If  no

conditions  are at all necessary for the control  of

banks,  why do we have the Bill? We have the  Bill - I

will  refresh  my  memory, Sir - to  provide  for  the

licensing and regulation of the business of banking.

Under  clause 3(4), I trusted him when  he  said  he

required  the powers of conditions on licences.  If,

in  fact, those powers are necessary for new  banks,

why   are  they  not  necessary  for  banks  already

established?  The Minister himself may  not  require

those  powers,  but,  as I have pointed  out,  every

government  is ephemeral and one does not  legislate

for  the  government in office. One legislates  from

the  permanent point of view. Other governments  may

consider  it necessary to have those powers.  It  is

for  the  Minister to convince us why there  is  the

necessity  for the distinction of treatment  between

these  two sets of banks and why he thinks that  the

banks  which  have no conditions on  their  licences

today will never require controlling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Surely there is a distinction

between existing banks and new banks. The fact  that

a  bank is in operation shows - and in most instances,

it  has been carrying on business for years  - that it

has  adjusted itself to the economy by fulfilling  a

certain  need  in  that particular  section  of  the

economy.  For  the Government to say  that  a  well-established  bank  should conduct business  along  a

certain  pattern or should have certain  changes  in

its  system  of  organisation,  I  say  that  it  is

completely  unnecessary.  No  such  need  has   been

proved,  more especially so when in due  course  the

control  in detail over banks would be exercised  by

the   Central  Bank  of  the  Federation   when   it

establishes a branch here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To leave out from the word "Inquiry" in line 2 to

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As has been agreed to, the debate

continues not only on the amendment but also on  the

main  motion, and all questions, if necessary,  will

be put at the end of the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Prime Minister was speaking.

<br><br>6.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would only wish to draw

the  attention  of  Members  to  the  terms  of  the

amendment and to point out that what we agreed to in

principle,  without even hearing the Member  for  Anson and the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



Upper  Serangoon,  was  that  there  should   be   a

Commission to investigate any allegation of nepotism

or  improper political interference with  the  civil

service and employees of statutory boards. We  never

agreed, Mr Speaker, to a roving Commission to  find

out   what  the  gossip  is  in  town  and  in   the

coffeeshops  and  if  anybody has  any  gossip.  The

amendment  makes it quite clear, to investigate  all

specific  allegations. I give  an  undertaking  here

that  if the Member for Anson has any other specific

allegations  which he forgot to list in  his  speech

yesterday,  all he need do is to put  them  down  in

writing, evidence can be let on them, and the matter

will be investigated. But I would like to point  out

this:  that  it  falls  upon  the  Government,   the

Minister  for Law and myself, to invite a member  of

the judiciary to head such a Commission. I think the

Member  for An son, not only from his experience  at

the  Bar  but also from his experience as  a  former

Chief Minister, will know that Judges do not like to

be  asked  to serve on Commissions with no  specific

purpose  or task in mind. A considerable  amount  of

time  is  involved in hearing and sifting  evidence,

and  they  must be convinced that there is something

worthwhile   investigating  upon  which   they   are

required to adjudicate. I think no Judge would  like

to  be put in a position of a collater and collector

of  gossip. On that understanding, I would  like  to

say  that any specific allegation made either in the

course of this debate or subsequently by a Member of

this  Assembly  in writing or of improper  political

interference  will  receive  the  attention  of  the

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   I   believe   that   the    former

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the  Prime   Minister

yesterday  raised  something that concerned  me.  He

said that I had written some notes to a certain camp

leader, that these notes would be taken as evidence,

and  that  they  had something to do with  political

nepotism. I will not talk too much on the conduct of

our former Parliamentary Secretary, as my colleagues

all know what kind of conduct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



his is. He was not a party member before the general

elections.  It  was only when the general  elections

were held in 1959 that he became a member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to read some very brief notes.

I do hope that these notes, though they were written

by  some Members sitting opposite, will not be  used

as  evidence to show something relating to political

nepotism.  These notes were written by  the  Barisan

Sosialis Members recommending certain people to work

in the Work Brigade. I think that in the course of a

socialist movement, if one is a socialist and  wants

to  help  his country to become a socialist country,

he  will need to have more cadres in order to  carry

out the work of socialism. In producing these notes,

I  do  not  mean  to attack Members in  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  My intention is to show that  the  notes

written  by  them had nothing to do  with  political

nepotism. Here is a note written by Chan Cheng  Ying

to  me. At that time I was responsible for the  Work

Brigade.  The note says that Han Ching  like  to  be

trained  us  a Work Brigade leader. Chan Cheng  Ying

recommended  this.  This  note  is  very  brief.  We

understand it is meant to recommend certain comrades

or  friends  to join the Work Brigade  and  to  work

there.  Another  note  here - a very  brief  one -   was

written  by  the so-called Chairman  of  the  Action

Committee  of  the  Work  Brigade  which  has   been

disbanded. He was then very active. His name  is  Wu

En  Pao.  He wrote this to the camp leader  at  Paya

Lebar, "One Yang Chen Pao in the camp wants to  talk

with  Wang Chin San. He seeks permission to go  home

everyday in order to carry out his work." I have  no

intention to spend any more time on these notes.  If

I  want to read out, I have many more notes to  read

out here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the purpose of my mentioning this is only

to  prove  that the words uttered by the Member  for

Upper  Serangoon yesterday were irrelevant and  were

taken  out of context. At this time when we want  to

realise  Malaysia, they are seeking out  trifles  in

order to attack us in our work. Therefore, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



now  want  to  tell  Members here that  the  Barisan

Sosialis' attitude and tactics in all this should be

understood by the people gradually.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, I did not intend to make a speech, but just

now  after  we heard the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for Home Affairs say something  which

seemed to me to be unprincipled, I therefore want to

give a reason. I want him to know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that what he has mentioned just now,

when  he  referred  to  the  notes  mentioned  by  a

colleague of ours, he did not mention the dates.  He

said the notes did not give the dates and times, and

therefore  could  not be taken as evidence.  On  the

second  point,  he should know that  at  that  time,

before  we  parted from the P.A.P., all our  actions

were done under the directions of the leaders of the

P.A.P.  Therefore, when I was appointed to the  Work

Brigade by the Minister for National Development,  I

received many notes, including notes from the  Prime

Minister,  recommending P.A.P. members  to  work  in

various departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days before the Anson by-elections, I

handed over some secret documents from the P.A.P. to

certain  officers of the Work Brigade to be  brought

to  the  Central Executive Committee of  the  P.A.P.

These  documents  were  marked  "Confidential",  and

their contents related to recommendations by certain

P.A.P. members recommending some other members.  My

actions then were done under the directions  of  the

P.A.P.  At  the time when the P.A.P. was formed,  we

felt  that  if  there was no democracy,  we  had  to

argue,  and  later on that led to  our  forming  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon clearly told the

House  that  we of the Barisan Sosialis  raised  all

these  issues.  Everything is based on  reason.  The

purpose  of  this motion is not to hit  out  at  any

members or Ministers of the P.A.P. We of the Barisan

Sosialis  have no such intention. I only quote  this

to  show that whatever actions we did were all based

on principle.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The only way the Prime

Minister  can  speak now is if he  can  satisfy  the

important  aspect  of  his speech.  I  do  not  know

whether  he  can  bring his point  of  clarification

within that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, he cannot be all that

balanced.  The point I want to make is this.  To  my

recollection, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member mentioned

Anson  and my recommending some people to  the  Work

Brigade. That I did, and I have, I think, about four

or  five of them still noted down in my diary.  They

were  not members of the P.A.P. and I see no  reason

why  I should have put them in a secret document  to

him.  If  that is what he is alleging - that that  was

nepotism - then  he can put it down  in  writing  and

doubtless  will be part of the specific  allegations

which the Commission will investigate.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I say frankly that

I  oppose  the amendment moved by the Government  on

the  grounds that the spirit of the amendment  seeks

to frighten Members of this Assembly from expressing

their  views which will consequently result in  such

Members  having to face the consequences. There  has

been  intimidation of a reasonable extent of freedom

of  speech. Secondly, in the original motion, I  see

there   is  some  merit  which  it  is  proper   the

Government  should consider, because,  as  has  been

mentioned by the Member for Farrer Park, it is  true

that  since  the  Government  assumed  office  until

today, there has been talk among the people of  this

nepotism. They say that only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. members will find employment,  or  at  least

P.A.P. sympathisers  will   find   employment   in

Singapore today. Therefore, if the Government really

feel responsible to the State of Singapore, there is

no  reason  why this matter should be  considered  a

loss to them. On the contrary, it should be an added

prestige to the Government, because from the  events

which  have taken place since the Government assumed

office,  we  know there have been many  splits  even

among  their  own  members. It has become  a  public

topic. If there is no wind, the tree will not shake,

so the Malay saying goes. So there must be something

about  ex-P.A.P. members who have defected  and  who

were  responsible for this matter. We ourselves have

heard this expressed in the Assembly. P.A.P. members

have  spoken loudly about the overwhelming  majority

they had then. We would like to know who really  are

sincere  in looking after the interest of Singapore,

which  we  all wish for. The Hon, the Prime Minister

may say this motion is childish or puerile, or it is

political tactics between political parties. But  we

in  the  Alliance,  who  are not  involved  in  this

dispute,  are  yet  responsible  to  the  people  of

Singapore,  and  we  wish to  know  who  are  really

responsible for these irresponsible acts. We do  not

wish  these matters to be on the lips of the  people

of  Singapore, because, Mr Speaker, that will  lead

to  the disunity of the people, and that would be  a

very grave matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker.  Sir,  when the Member for  Anson  and  the

Member for Upper Serangoon jointly put down a motion

implying  political nepotism and  jiggery-pokery  in

the  civil service, everyone expected them  to  come

out  with awful disclosures of irregularities. After

all,  Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon  had  been

closely associated with the Government for two years

as   the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Prime

Minister. As such, he was in a position to  know  if

anything  irregular  had  been  going  on   in   the

Government. Moreover, his twelve colleagues, some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



of  whom  were Parliamentary Secretaries,  have  had

access  to many files. As regards the activities  of

the  Government, where there had been  consultations

with   them,   they,  jointly  pooling   all   their

knowledge,  could have made some awful  disclosures,

if  there  had been any. They could have  spilt  the

beans,  as  it were, and shaken the Government  with

factual  disclosures  about political  nepotism  and

other irregularities on the part of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They will tell the Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We will be coming to the Member

for  Anson later on. But, Sir, not a single bean was

spilt  alleging anything reprehensible.  The  Member

for  Upper  Serangoon,  far  from  wading  into  the

Government  with startling disclosures of  political

nepotism,  gave the impression  - in fact he  made  an

apology -  that he was seconding the motion with vague

reluctance. He said he had no intention  of  hitting

out at the P.A.P. This cannot be because his Barisan

Sosialis friends have developed a soft spot for  the

Government,  since they treacherously  deserted  it.

The truth is that the Member for Upper Serangoon has

nothing  to hit with at the Government.  If  he  had

anything  to hit with, I am quite sure  he  and  his

Barisan Sosialis friends would not have hesitated to

go  for  the Government. But once he knew  that  any

allegation  made would have to be substantiated,  he

dried  up for words and allegations. Sir, it is  one

thing making broad allegations in places where  they

know  they  cannot be challenged, and quite  another

having  to  make  allegations which they  know  they

would  be  called upon to substantiate. Sir,  it  is

characteristic  of  the Barisan Sosialis  that  they

have  developed  a  strong  aversion  for  the  open

confrontation.   As  you  know,   Sir,   they   like

monologues  but  shun things like  forums  like  the

plague, because any statement made at a forum, where

there  is  no  prepared script, can  be  immediately

challenged  and  refuted. So the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon was wise in not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



making   allegations  which  he  knows   he   cannot

substantiate and which he knows are not true. So all

that  happened was that allegations of nepotism  and

irregularities have now turned out to  be  something

vague and' nebulous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson obviously had hoped for

support  from the Barisan Sosialis. But I  am  quite

sure,  Sir,  that  he  is  as  disappointed  as  the

newspapers  are  at  what was  disclosed  yesterday.

There  was  nothing for them. The Member  for  Anson

spent  some  time enumerating the number  of  P.A.P.

members  and  Assemblymen who had been appointed  to

statutory boards and other Government committee.  He

was  able  to  do that through the courtesy  of  the

Government  which provided him with a list.  All  he

said  was,  "There are two P.A.P. members  on  this

committee.   There  are  three  P.A.P. members   or

Assemblymen  on  that committee," and  so  on.  Sir,

nobody has ever denied these facts. They have  never

been concealed from anyone.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You never told us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Many of these committee

appointments were gazetted.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You never told us anyway.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They were published. They were

openly  made and were public knowledge. In no single

instance did the Member for Anson suggest that these

appointments were improperly made. What then is  the

allegation?  Where  is  the  evidence  of  political

nepotism  and other irregularities? It is true  that

the  Government has appointed P.A.P. Assemblymen  or

P.A.P. members to boards and committees. Sir,  there

is  nothing  irregular about a government appointing

people  whom  they  know  personally  and  trust  as

members  of a committee or a board to carry out  the

work  of the committee or the board. Is it suggested

by the Member for Anson that we should pick names at

random  from  a telephone hook and appoint  them  to

boards and committees?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Why do you not listen -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member will have a chance

to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have to endure listening to him

occasionally, Sir. P.A.P. Assemblymen  and  members,

even from the list, i.e. the enumeration provided by

the  Member for Anson, constitute a minority in most

of  these  committees. It is  natural,  Sir,  for  a

government  to  have a few nominees  whom  it  knows

intimately,  in order to know what goes  on  in  the

committees  for which it is responsible. After  all,

Sir,  if  anything goes wrong in a  committee  or  a

board,  it  is  the Government which must  take  the

responsibility.  Therefore, it is its  duty  to  see

that  people  whom it knows and trusts  are  in  the

committee. As I have said, they always constitute  a

minority of the members of any committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. Government took office, it

made  it  a  point  to see that P.A.P.  Assemblymen,

instead of being passive Back-benchers, were given a

share  of  responsibility in government work.  Every

Assemblyman  therefore was attached to one  Ministry

or  other. That is public knowledge. We have  stated

so  earlier  on  when  the Government  took  office.

Therefore, participation in committees and boards is

one way of delegating responsibility to Assemblymen.

Why  then is the Member for Anson surprised to  find

P.A.P.   Assemblymen  openly  and   constitutionally

appointed  to  boards and committees?  What  is  the

point  of  making a recitation that so  many  P.A.P.

Assemblymen  are  in this or that committee?  Is  it

suggested  that it is irregular? Or is he stating  a

fact? Probably having no evidence, he just wants  to

leave  an  impression behind that somehow the  whole

thing   was   irregular  and  therefore  there   was

political nepotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he contends that what disconcerts him is that

there are too many P.A.P. members and Assemblymen in

these committees and boards. How much exactly is too

many  of  the  527 appointments which were  made  to

these boards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



and  committees? The P.A.P. Assemblymen and  members

constitute an insignificant minority. The Member for

Anson  knows  it is not always easy to get  suitable

people  to serve on boards and committees regularly,

and for the most part voluntarily. It is natural and

inevitable that some of the nominees should be drawn

from  party colleagues and workers whose  worth  and

ability  we have to acknowledge. Sir, where then  is

the  nepotism? Were the P.A.P. members appointed  to

these boards and committees unsuitable or corrupt or

inefficient?  Or  were these committees  and  boards

used  to  line  the  pockets of P.A.P. members  and

Assemblymen?  If that was true, then the  charge  of

nepotism  would  be  valid. But no  such  charge  or

allegation was made. So far the allegation was  that

so   many   P.A.P. members  and  so   many   P.A.P.

Assemblymen were appointed to committees and boards.

Equally, it was open to the Member for Anson to  say

that  so  many non-P.A.P. members were appointed  to

committees and boards. Both have no point  to  that.

What  is the significance to say that so many P.A.P.

Assemblymen  or  members  and  so  many   non-P.A.P.

members were appointed to this board or that  board?

In  fact,  Sir, from what the Member for Anson  said

yesterday, it is not clear what the allegations  are

or,  what  is  more  important, what  precisely  the

commission of inquiry is supposed to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then went on to allege that

P.A.P. members have been given government  jobs  in

community  centres, the Work Brigade, the Ministries

and  the like, and that the Party imposes a levy  on

such  members. Sir, this again contains no  specific

allegation but vague charges. Of course, a number of

P.A.P. members are in the employ of Government, just

as  before  the  P.A.P. Government came  into  power

there  were  a number of P.A.P. members  working  in

many  Government  Ministries  and  other  Government

bodies.   Is   the  Member  for  Anson,   therefore,

suggesting  that  a man should not  be  employed  in

Government service or in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



the Work Brigade or in the People's Association just

because  he  is  a P.A.P. member? The point  surely,

Sir, is not whether he is or is not a P.A.P. member,

hut  whether he is qualified to do the job to  which

he  is  appointed,  and whether the  appointment  is

properly  made.  Merely to say that there  are  four

P.A.P. members in the Ministry of Culture,  as  the

Member  for Anson said yesterday, or that there  are

so  many P.A.P. members in this or that Ministry  is

not even prima facie proof of nepotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again a great deal has been made by the

Member  for  Anson about the fact that  some  P.A.P.

members  who are in Government service are asked  to

contribute to the Party. As I have said, even before

the  P.A.P. became the Government, P.A.P. members,

whether they are in Government service or elsewhere,

have  contributed as they like to  the  Party.  Here

again,  Sir,  the  Member for  Anson  has  tried  to

extract  some  sinister meaning out  of  all  these.

There  is  nothing sinister or unusual  about  Party

sympathisers,  whether  they  are  in  or   out   of

Government  service,  making  contributions  to  the

Party.  For  example, Sir, it is a  well-known  fact

that all Ministers and Assemblymen, on this side  of

the House at least, pay a part of their salaries and

allowances to the Party as contributions. Similarly,

if  we ask members who may be employed in or out  of

Government  to make contributions to the Party,  why

should  the Member for Anson even suggest that  this

is nepotism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even from the figures reeled off by the

Member  for  Anson,  as  I  remarked  earlier,  they

constitute only a small fraction of the total number

of  employees in Government service. Therefore,  the

charge  of  nepotism by saying that a few people  in

the  employ of Government are P.A.P. members is  not

proof  or  even prima fade proof. What needs  to  be

proved   to  make  the  charge  feasible   or   even

reasonable is to show that the appointment was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



improperly made and that the person is holding a job

which he is incapable of performing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson and the Member for Upper

Serangoon did none of these things. They brought  no

specific    allegations   for   investigation    and

pronouncement by an inquiry commission. All that the

Member  for  Anson  could  rely  on  was  a  general

feeling. In fact, throughout the speeches, the terms

were  "They say; it is said; and there is a  general

impression"   that  these  things  are   going   on.

Similarly,  the  Member for Anson  used  words  like

"People are saying, and there is an impression  that

there  is political nepotism in the Government."  In

fact,  Sir, to be quite frank, most of this business

about "They say and it is said," originates in  this

Chamber.  Allegations are made here that people  are

saying  this and that in the coffee-shops. They  are

passed  on to the newspapers and the next  day  they

come back and say, yes they have heard somebody  say

that  there is talk of political nepotism  and  that

the  Government is doing this and that. Very  often,

they listen to their own echoes and say that this is

what  the  public say. There is no evidence produced

that there is definitely such and such a person  who

is  prepared to come forward and say the  Government

has done this, that or the other thing. All that  we

have is a vague reference to a possible existence of

nepotism in the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, having made these charges from time to

time,  Members of the Opposition have been given  an

opportunity to come out with specific facts and make

specific  allegations, but none of them are prepared

to  take the opportunity. Again there is vague  talk

about feelings and impressions. Sir, the Member  for

Anson  wants  the inquiry commission to  investigate

not  specific cases and instances of nepotism.  This

is  because  neither  he nor the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon  and  the other speakers who  have  talked

since then have been able to pinpoint or crystallise

their charges. It is like bringing a man to court on

a  charge of murder. When the defendant asks,  "Yes,

but what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



murder?  Who am I supposed to have killed  and  when

and  with what?" He is told, "Well, how do  we  know

whom you have killed and when and with what? That is

for  the Judge to find out. All we are doing  is  to

charge you with murder in general, simply because we

hope  that  the investigation may bring a murder  to

light." It is up to the defendant to defend himself,

if  he can, against a general charge. As far as  the

Opposition are concerned, they are not going to  say

whether  a  "murder" has or has not  been  committed

except  in  a general and vague sense. They  have  a

feeling and impression that something wrong has been

done.  This reminds me of - in fact, I will  recommend

the  Member  for  Anson and many of  the  Opposition

Members  to  read -  a well-known novel by  the  Czech

writer, Franz Kafka, called "The Trial."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have you ever read it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In "The Trial" a man called Joseph

Kay  came to town and was apprehended. A summons was

issued  against him that he was supposed to come  to

court  for  trial. The novel deals  with  the  whole

procedure  of  the trial that was gone through.  The

prosecution asked questions. Evidence was  produced.

But  neither  the  Judge nor the defendant  nor  the

prosecutor knew what the charge was. Yet  the  whole

rigmarole  ritual of a trial was gone through.  This

novel  ended  with the man suddenly  being  declared

guilty. He was dragged Out. Two warriors came round,

stuck  a knife in the side of his belly and finished

him  off.  Nobody knew what the charge was - not  even

the  victim himself. The implication is that it  was

very easy, by just going through the procedure of  a

trial - the procedure of making allegations which  are

not specific - to find a man guilty. That is precisely

the  technique which the Member for Anson and others

have  adopted.  No charges are made. But  they  say,

"Yes,  two P.A.P. members here, three P.A.P. members

there.  Therefore,  there  might  be  a  charge   of

nepotism."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson made another

allegation - it was not even an allegation but just  a

hint of improper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



political interference with the civil service.  Sir,

let  me  say this, that what he, in fact,  has  been

trying to persuade me to do is to interfere with the

civil  service.  He  has  been  writing  me  letters

complaining  against  the  News  Section  of   Radio

Singapore  and  saying  that  he  has  been  wrongly

reported.  For  the information of  the  Member  for

Anson, I am told that yesterday he rang up the  Head

of  the News Section of Radio Singapore saying,  "If

Radio Singapore in its 10.30 p.m. news reports  that

the  House agreed that the Referendum Bill is to  be

postponed,  I am going to bring up this question  in

the Assembly."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In fact, I have received from

the  Member for Anson a complaint precisely in those

terms which I am investigating, that Radio Singapore

was  alleged  to have said that the Assembly  agreed

that   the   National  Referendum  Bill  should   be

postponed, which, of course, was not the  case.  The

Assembly did not agree. It was a postponement  under

the  Standing  Orders. I might as  well  inform  the

Assembly that the allegation is that the Member  for

Anson  pointed out that that was a mistake -  a  false

report. But in spite of his pointing out that it was

a  false report, the News Editor put it on again  at 10.30 p.m. So I am investigating that complaint.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

interested  in whether that allegation  is  true  or

not.  What I am pointing out is that the Member  for

Anson rings up a civil servant and tells him how  he

should carry out his work.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister not consider it

only  fair  to this civil servant that a  Member  of

this  Assembly should point out that he is wrong  in

order to give him an opportunity, knowing that it is

coming  on  again at 10.30 p.m., to correct  it?  Is

that not what he would, in fairness, do himself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is quite a

different    proposition.   If   this   charge    is

specifically made in the inquiry -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It has been made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - then I have letters here - a long

correspondence going on between the Member for Anson

and  myself. I would like to think that my  letters,

which  are  signed  in  black ink,  are  written  in

temperate  language;  whereas  the  letters  of  the

Member for Anson are written in black ink and signed

in green ink. But it gets more acrimonious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is yellow!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> But the essence of it is this. He

has  been inviting me to get Radio Singapore  to  do

things  his way. He considers that it is not  honest

and fair reporting. And he rings up -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Minister. Would

he  agree  that he himself and the members of  Radio

Singapore  have told me that they have no  power  to

deal with any complaint - they hake no powers even  to

give me sight of a copy of their script  - and that  I

must refer all matters to the Minister? Is this  not

true?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is not only true, but since

then  I  have given instructions to the Head of  the

News   Section   that   any  interference   by   any

Assemblyman who is not authorised to do so should he

rejected outright. Just because the Member for Anson

was  a  former Chief Minister, he cannot  run  Radio

Singapore as though it was his preserve. If he wants

to   make  any  complaint,  it  should  he  properly

directed to the Minister, the responsible authority.

But nobody has a right to ring up and demand scripts

as  the  Member for Anson has done. The News Section

quite rightly says, "You are not entitled to have  a

look  at the scripts. If you want to do so,  get  to

the  Minister." Since then I have re-emphasised that

any  attempt  by anybody to intimidate  any  of  the

staff  of the News Section of Radio Singapore should

be ignored.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Including the Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We have always said so before that

we  run the News Section as we like. When the Member

for  Anson was the Chief Minister, he prevailed upon

Radio  Singapore  to even report him  opening  small

Labour Front branches, which at least, Sir, we  have

not dared to do. But that is a different proposition

altogether, Sir. What I would like to say  is  this.

We   have  never  concealed  the  fact  that   Radio

Singapore  is a Government department. The  Minister

has  a  right  to  lay  down policies  and  to  give

directives. We have never denied it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Including distortions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I understand that the charge of

distortions  is to come up before the  Committee  of

Privileges and I shall have the privilege of quoting

the   Member's   letters  and   my   letters   about

distortions    and   other   allegations.    As    a

newspaperman, I can tell you that the charge he  has

made  about distortion and unfair reporting has  not

two legs or even one leg to stand on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the charge by the Member for Anson about

improper  political interference, the only  instance

he  brought  up was Radio Singapore, in addition  to

intimidating some of the members of the News Section

by  saying,  "If you do not do this, I am  going  to

bring  this up before the proper authorities." Apart

from doing and saying that, he has not brought up  a

single instance of improper political interference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as far as I can see, none of the

Opposition Members who have spoken on this motion on

political  nepotism have a single bit  of  evidence.

What  they hope for is to let loose a Commission  of

Inquiry with no particular directives. They  do  not

know  what to look for but they hope that they might

eventually  tumble on to something. If they  stumble

on   one   case   of   nepotism  or   of   political

irregularity, they are lucky. But if they do not, it

is  too bad. One High Court Judge has spent a couple

of years hoping to unearth a piece of evidence about

political    nepotism    or    improper    political

interference.  I am not a lawyer, Sir,  but  I  have

enough respect for the Judge sitting on a Commission

of Inquiry to tell him, "Well, all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



we can tell you is that there is coffee-shop talk of

nepotism.  We cannot even tell you which coffee-shop

it  is. Would you please investigate? If you manage

to  get to the right coffee-shop, good luck to  you;

but if you do not, it is just too bad."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is the kind of Commission of Inquiry

the Members of the Opposition are proposing, then  I

say  that they are neither showing great respect for

the  Commission  of Inquiry nor for the  unfortunate

gentleman who has to go around groping in  the  dark

in  the  hope  of unearthing something  which  might

provide  the Opposition with ammunition against  the

Government.  But  at the moment,  there  is  nothing

concrete. In fact, Sir, if you look up the newspaper

reports  on  this - I  am  told  the  newspapers  were

looking forward with great glee to awful disclosures

along the lines of Maria Monk to enable them to sell

at  least  another five or ten thousand  copies  but

they  were  very disappointed  - the whole debate  was

limited  to  half a page. In fact, I can assure  the

Member for Anson - just before he starts blurting  out

that  I  had a conference yesterday, and I told  the

newspapers to keep it to half a page - that  there  is

nothing  worth reporting. As far as scandalous  news

is  concerned, the newspapers are ready to print all

the  news that is fit to print. But as far  as  this

motion on political nepotism is concerned, the tough

cynical    and   hard-faced   newsmen   have    been

disappointed. They had been looking forward  to  the

Member  for Anson and his colleague, the Member  for

Upper   Serangoon,  to  provide  them  with   enough

disclosures to titillate their breakfast readers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member for Anson, who is obviously

bursting  to  say  it out "in green  ink",  will  at

least,  before  he winds up, produce  some  concrete

evidence of nepotism or irregularity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

today   there  are  more  grave  and  more  pressing

problems  facing  us. Two of them  are  firstly  the

question   of   automatic   citizenship    in    the

Government's  merger  proposals,  and  secondly  the

grave  economic crisis into which this  country  has

been  plunged, including the aggravated unemployment

situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we feel the Government should pay more

attention  to  these problems and that  we,  in  the

Opposition, should press the Government for a proper

solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have experienced and we have seen in the

past  that  reports of Commissions do  not  make  an

impact  on  the  public. Neither do they  have  much

value.  They  are not much noticed  by  the  public.

Neither do they help to sway the course of political

events  in Singapore. Sir, in addition to that,  the

cost,  time and labour taken, and the efforts  which

the  Government,  Members of the  Assembly  and  the

civil  service  have  to  spend  on  Commissions  of

Inquiry do not warrant this Commission of Inquiry at

this  juncture  in  Singapore's  political  history.

Therefore, we are not supporting the appointment  of

a Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this Commission of Inquiry sits, it will

only help the Government to divert the attention  of

the  public from the real and pressing issues  which

are  facing  us - namely,  the question  of  automatic

citizenship in the merger proposals and the  present

economic position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are therefore abstaining from both the

amendment and the motion itself.

the  government.  I  said a Commission  of  Inquiry,

appointed  to  go into matters which can  be  solved

either  at  Question Time or by  a  motion  in  this

House,  will not only take days and weeks, but  much

money and effort will have to be spent.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It takes centuries to build a civil

service  of integrity and efficiency. And no  amount

of  effort and no amount of money at any time is too

much  to  guarantee an honest civil service  without

which  no  politician, however able he may think  he

is,  could  possibly govern. It was and  it  is  the

intention  of  this motion not so much  to  seek  to

punish.  You have seen, Sir, that we have sought  to

discuss it with restraint and this has been made the

subject of jibes. It was not my intention to provide

bits  for  breakfast  tables.  It  is  not  even  my

intention  to  administer vengefully  the  odium  of

public  opinion upon those on the opposite  Benches.

For  let  them  know that there are  few  people  in

Singapore who would not want to wear a gas mask when

they see a P.A.P. Minister walking by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was my intention and it is my hope that

the  gravity  of  the charges should  be  adequately

recognised.  The  question is to protect  the  civil

service from the continuance and the perpetuation of

an  evil tradition which undermines the entire basis

of  government.  To  give  you  an  example  of  the

incapacity  of  this  Government  to  hear,  and   a

pathological  urge  to vary,  I  would  ask  you  to

remember  what you heard in this very  debate.  Last

night I heard what I believe to be a false report by

Radio Singapore. I immediately pointed this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



out to the News Editor and said, "This is wrong.  If

you  don't  correct it, I will have to  report  it."

That  is  transformed, Sir, into intimidation  by  a

former  Chief Minister throwing his weight,  not  an

effort  by a citizen and an Assemblyman to  give  an

opportunity to Radio Singapore to correct a grievous

error,  because  it was going on the  air  again  at 10.30 p.m., and to avoid the need for referring  the

matter  to  Select Committee. That is the way  their

mentality works, Mr Speaker. Again it was said, "Do

you want us to go to the telephone directory? Are we

not allowed to appoint P.A.P. members?" Mr Speaker,

be  indulgent  for  a few moments  whilst  I  repeat

myself to show you to what extent they are incapable

of hearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it quite clear - this was my speech,

Sir,  in moving it - it is not my suggestion that  the

Government should not appoint a member of its  Party

to  public  office because he is  a  member  of  the

Party. Quite naturally, it can and does happen  that

a  member  of  a  political Party in office  is,  by

virtue  of  his own merit, worthy of appointment  to

public  office.  I  recognise  that  those  who  are

prepared  to  go through the travail  of  dedicating

themselves to the ideals of a political Party  often

are  sincere in their dedication to public  service,

even  though  I  may not agree with their  political

views  or conduct. But what I do say, Sir,  is  that

the  numbers  involved  are  of  a  character  which

legitimately raise a query as to whether,  in  fact,

some appointments were made not merely on merit  but

took into consideration the fact that the persons in

question  were  P.A.P. members  in  pursuance  of  a

policy to seek control of all aspects of public life

for party ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the extraordinarily revealing thing in the

debate  is  that  the Deputy Prime Minister  himself

admitted the charge. He has said to us, "It  is  our

duty  as  a  Government to control  these  statutory

bodies."   This   is   indeed,   Mr   Speaker,   an

extraordinary admission, an admission  made  out  of

ignorance of the constitutional position. I  am,  in

fact,  charging the P.A.P. with seeking  control  of

public  bodies for party ends. Is he not aware,  Mr

Speaker, that the very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



reason  for  separating statutory  bodies  from  the

Government  machinery is that they  should  be  free

from  political control and political  interference?

Take  a case in point, Mr Speaker. The Deputy Prime

Minister sneeringly said, "Does the Member for Anson

expect us to appoint him to the Income Tax Board  of

Review?"  (Laughter] "Ha, ha, ha!" And why should  I

not be if I had an adequate knowledge of income tax?

Would  the fact that I am a Member of the Opposition

and   have  this  strong  repugnance  for  gibbering

gibbons, affect my judgment in deciding the  justice

of  a  claim by the Comptroller of Income Tax or  by

the taxpayer? If that is what he has suggested, then

he  in fact admits, Sir, that he has his own men  in

in  order  that their judgment should be prejudiced,

and affected by their political affiliation. Because

that is the total idea.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Leader of the

intervene, all he has to do is to stand up and I  am

sure the Member for Anson will give way.

his  seat? The Deputy Prime Minister has risen on  a

matter  of  elucidation. I do not know  whether  the

Member for Anson will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Will the Deputy Prime

Minister sit down?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He must expect no more courtesy than

he gives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister says, "Does the Member for Anson expect to be appointed to the Housing Board?" And why not, Mr Speaker? Do I want housing any less than they do? If I had the qualifications, if I had the knowledge, if I had the ability to be of service to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



the Housing Board? Does the fact that I belong to an

Opposition  Party make it impossible so  to  appoint

me?  Sir, the very sneer, if analysed, indicates the

basis of their thinking - that a member of a political

Party  on  a  statutory board  must  necessarily  be

biased  and  seek  political  interference  in   the

justice or otherwise of what that Board seeks to do.

And  I  want to make it clear, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

hope  that there is no impression in anybody's  mind

that  I seek to be appointed to any statutory  board

by this Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I grant courtesy and I receive

porcine insults. I shall remember it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position is this, according to the Deputy

Prime Minister - that it is the duty of the P.A.P. to

appoint  to  statutory boards those who would  boot-lick the Prime Minister and wag their tails in every

P.A.P. board in order that they should have control

of  all aspects of Singapore life. That is what I am

charging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am impressed, genuinely impressed, by the cold, contained fear emanating from the Front Bench since yesterday when we started on this motion, and the puzzled sighs of relief that we have not been flinging chunks of mud but instead have been dealing with principles. I can understand they are more at home



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



with mud. I can understand they expect a lot of  mud

because I have no doubt they have many skeletons  in

their   cupboard   and  they   anticipate   I   have

information  of  some of them. It  is  their  guilty

conscience which sighs with relief and which  crows.

But let us again recognise the aim of this motion is

not  to  fling mud. It is to seek the protection  of

statutory   bodies  and  the  civil   service   from

interference by men - who call themselves men -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Like the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The charges have been made and I am

indeed  grateful to the Member for Farrer Park - I  do

not  know  if he is present  - for the lucid and  fair

manner in which he expressed what I sought to say to

this  House:  the place for the specific allegations

is  the  tribunal and is the Commission of  Inquiry.

The  Member  for Farrer Park drew attention  to  the

most curious feature of the Government's fears which

were  put into words by the Prime Minister  when  he

said,  "Are  we going to allow the civil service  to

bellyache  to  the Judge? "Bellyache". Mr  Speaker,

why  this  word  "bellyache"? There is  an  arrogant

tendency on the part of the Front Bench to denigrate

their civil service and particularly on the part  of

the   Prime  Minister.  That  word  "bellyache",   I

remember, being first used in this House -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> By the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Never. That is a complete

inaccuracy.  As you can well know, Mr Speaker,  you

have  been  here all the time. I read of  this  word

"bellyache" by the Prime Minister when he termed the

complaint  of the civil service about the  ruthless,

unwarranted  and unheralded paycut as  a  bellyache.

Now, it is "bellyache" if they complain to the Judge

who chairs the tribunal. The very words of the Prime

Minister are indicative of my charge that the  civil

service   is   being  intimidated,  and   improperly

intimidated, by these men of the day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister asked whether checking civil service inefficiency is

interference.  How very clever! Did anybody  suggest

it?  No,  Sir. But if they cannot knock down  honest

arguments,  they  put  up  their  own  specious  and

fallacious  arguments,  and  knock  down  their  own

skittles  to the amusement of their own  mates.  Mr

Speaker,  what  we  do  say  is  that  there  is   a

constitutional procedure of which the  Minister  for

Culture  seems  to  know  little;  a  constitutional

procedure  whereby  and  only  whereby,  the   civil

service  should  be checked. We are  against  P.A.P.

thuggery  being  employed by  any  future  Party  in

office.  We  want to protect the Civil Service  from

the P.A.P. type of thuggery. Again, Mr Speaker, the

extraordinary pathological arrogance of  the  P.A.P.

is transparent in the Deputy Prime Minister's remark

that   the  Government  cannot  have  retired  civil

servants  on  a  Commission because  that  would  be

asking  former civil servants to judge  the  present

Government. What extraordinary pride! What fantastic

ego!  Mr  Speaker, all I can say is  that,  for  us

normal  human beings, we watch with amazement things

like  that  being confessed to publicly  before  the

Press. Is it not recognised by this Government  that

amongst  our  former  civil  servants  are  men   of

integrity,  men of training, men who have  dedicated

their  life-time to the service of  the  State,  men

from  whom  you can obtain not only a just  decision

but  who,  having  been in the  civil  service,  can

understand where the shoe pinches and can understand

how to recommend the protection of the civil service

and  the maintenance of its integrity? No, Sir. "We,

the P.A.P., can never be judged by anybody who is  a

mere  civil  servant retired." That  is  the  mental

approach  of the so-called socialists of  the  Front

Bench.  This  contempt for the civil  service,  this

arrogant  superiority on the part of the  Government

to  the civil service is something that no Member of

this House not blinded by party affiliation like the

Minister for Culture could ever tolerate.

excuse  made  for  refusing to  give  us  two  civil

servants on the Commission is that the public  might

think  they  are biased in favour of the Government.

That  is funny, Sir, because they know as well as  I

know, as well as everybody in Singapore knows,  that

the contempt for the P.A.P. on the part of the civil

service  could  not be greater.  It  is  only  their

loyalty,   their  sense  of  discipline  and   their

dedication -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - which has prevented them from

bringing  into  the  open their dissatisfaction  and

their  unhappiness, except those who  have  resigned

and now keep silent in dignity. I urge this House to

recognise  that  even more important - in  fact,  the

reason  for  ascertaining whether there is,  and  to

what extent there is, political nepotism and to what

extent  there is political interference - is to  know

how to prevent it in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very difficult for a man in this

Assembly,  having made a stand, to change his  mind,

although constitutionally the democratic process  is

intended  to give an opportunity for logic,  reason,

good   sense  and  persuasion  to  attempt  to  vary

existing  attitudes. I do appeal to the  members  of

the United People's Party to recognise that, despite

any  personal experience, and in fact because of the

leader's   personal  experience,  a  Commission   of

Inquiry  does  a great deal of good in clearing  the

air and in helping the people -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - to a recognition of the reality.

There  is  tremendous  value  in  a  Commission   of

Inquiry.  The money spent and the energy  that  goes

into it is well worth while when the topic is of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



major  importance  to the welfare of  this  country.

This  Commission  of  Inquiry is  sought  not  in  a

punitive spirit, as the one that was sought  against

the  Member for Hong Lim. It is sought in the spirit

of  seeking  an improvement of our ad, ministration

and  the  protection of our civil service  not  only

from  this  Government but from any other government

that  seeks  to  use these methods. I  do  earnestly

appeal to them. Their vote does count; their vote is

vital;  to  recognise that they hold the balance  in

this  matter,  and it is important for  us  that  at

least on this subject we should have -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Who is the mover?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is curious, Mr Speaker, again

and again we have this superficial levity in matters

of  gravity,  for  this  is  a  matter  of  gravity,

allegedly accepted by the Deputy Prime Minister  who

puts in an inept amendment which, in fact, seeks  to

limit the scope of the inquiry only to matters  that

have  been specifically aired in this Assembly. Sir.

let  us  recognise again what the Member for  Farrer

Park  has  tried  to  explain - that  the  people   of

Singapore  are  the people who will  know  what  has

happened  to  them. The civil servants particularly,

of  whom there are none present here today, and  the

members  of  the  statutory boards, should  have  an

opportunity to make complaints to this tribunal. The

Prime  Minister  says, "We are  not  afraid  of  any

Commission any time anywhere."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sure.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> But then why not let us have this

Commission without the absurd limitations that  this

amendment  seeks  to  have? Any Commission!  Let  us

implement that proud boast.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Make the charges.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We are asking for this Commission,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. My charge is that it is  my  firm

belief  that there is political nepotism. It  is  my

firm  belief, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there has  been

improper  interference  by this  Party  amongst  the

civil servants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>

the  people should have the opportunity. I ask every

Member of the Opposition to recognise that it is our

duty  to  give the people this opportunity  to  make

their complaints in the appropriate place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Government

finds  itself cornered and the heat is on, "We  will

have any Commission any place, any time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And then when you pin them down, the

Government  finds itself a Judge. That is  the  "any

time"  of  the Prime Minister. Let me say this,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir. There is power in this Government  to

appoint acting Judges. And there are able men in the

State  Advocate-General's Department and at the  Bar

who  could  well fill that function. I say,  let  us

appoint  acting  Judges to the High  Court  and  use

existing  Judges for the number of Commissions  that

we  require  in order to facilitate the business  of

this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker, Sir.

the   reason  we  should  excuse  him  for   seeking

clarification.  He  was  not  present  to  see   the

treatment  I received at the hands of his  Ministers

and   colleagues.  [Laughter]  Ah,  a   matter   for

amusement! I shall remember that too. Let us end. It

is not a question of personalities. It is not even a

question of condemnation of this Government  that  I

seek.  I  seek  an impartial tribunal  with  retired

civil  servants  who know from their own  traditions

how to protect the civil service for the welfare  of

Singapore,  to protect them from improper  political

interference  and to protect statutory  bodies  from

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  motion has been long delayed, so much so  that

it  has  been  rendered almost out of  date  by  the

recent course of events. It is almost like trying to

lock  the  stable  door after the horses  have  been

stolen.  Nevertheless, this motion  will  serve  its

purpose  if  only  to  remind  the  Government  that

"merger"  is  not a One-Party issue but  a  national

issue  and  therefore  an All-Party  issue,  and  it

should be treated as such. If only this motion  will

help to show the P.A.P. its past mistakes and if the

P.A.P. would  only  admit these mistakes  and  take

appropriate steps to rectify them, then the time  of

the House wilt not have been wasted in debating this

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much of what I have intended to say in this

motion has already been said in the debate on merger

and my amendment to it. I shall not, therefore, bore

you -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - with an unnecessary repetition

of  many  of the revelations of striptease  politics

which are well known to all the people in Singapore.

I shall therefore confine myself to bringing out the

salient   features   in  the  P.A.P.'s   treacherous

betrayal of the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> By Lee Siew Choh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, as I have already said,

merger  is  not a One-Party issue. It is a  national

issue affecting the lives and the future of each and

every one of us in Singapore. Yes, even our children

and  all our future generations will be affected  by

the way in which we resolve this national issue.  If

it  was  really a private matter affecting only  the

P.A.P. and  no other people, then the P.A.P. could

make it a One-Party internal matter and no one would

complain. For example, if all the Assemblymen on the

Government Back-benches should gang up together  and

oust   the   arrogant  Ministers  from  their   high

pedestals,  then  we would just watch  and  let  the

P.A.P. handle its own affairs and settle  them  the

way  it  wants.  But  merger, Sir,  is  an  entirely

different  matter. It affects the lives  of  present

and  future generations and as such transcends party

politics.  Political Parties represent only  certain

sections  of the people and one would have  expected

the  P.A.P. to have the magnanimity  to  treat  the

issue   with   all   the  national  importance   and

consideration  it  deserves  and  not  make   it   a

completely One-Party affair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. surely knows that there are different

aspects  of  the  problem which will  give  rise  to

different   viewpoints,  and   that   an   All-Party

consultation would be necessary as all the different

views   representing  different  sections   of   the

population  would help to give a proper  perspective

and  better  understanding of the  issue  at  stake,

especially so today when the P.A.P. is only a shadow

of  its former self - a mere shell - and cannot, by  any

stretch  of the imagination, be said to be a popular

Government  that  can claim to be representative  of

the  people.  The P.A.P. has not only not  consulted

the other political Parties, both inside and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



outside  the Assembly, on this all important  merger

issue,  but  has  also been so  dictatorial  in  its

behaviour  inside the Assembly, in the  way  it  has

gone  about its interjectory motions and lifting  of

Standing  Orders during the last few  sittings -   all

without  prior consultation with Opposition  Parties

that all the people of Singapore today know that the

P.A.P. is still as dictatorial as ever, and that it

is  all the time trying to impose a one-man majority

parliamentary  dictatorship in the Assembly  and  in

the whole of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the House of the shameful record of

the  P.A.P. in its attempts at hiding the  facts  of

merger  from  the  people and from  other  political

Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When the Yang di-Pertuan Negara spoke of the

tremendous  drama that had accompanied the  progress

and  development of merger and Malaysia talks in the

last five months - now 7� months -  we had already known

of  the secret negotiations of the Prime Minister of

Singapore  and the Prime Minister of the  Federation

for quite some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) During the Anson by-election, the Prime

Minister  said  that  merger  must  follow   certain

conditions which must be approved by the people  and

not  by the Ministers. I hope the Prime Minister and

his  ministerial  colleagues will not  forget  these

words of promise they made to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There was further mention of "merger" by the

Prime  Minister  over  Radio  Singapore,  now  Radio

P.A.P., on 27th July, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) On 8th August, 1961, according to the Tunku,

merger was only an informal proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) On 23rd August, 1961, the first joint

statement of the two Prime Minister was issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It was three days later, on 26th August, 1961,

that  the Acting Prime Minister wrote to the leaders

of  the Opposition Parties, purporting to seek their

views on the two points already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



agreed to, in principle, by the two Prime Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here was the Government having negotiations

with   the   Federation  on  a  matter  of  national

importance,  on a matter that concerns  everyone  in

Singapore.  Yet  the  people  and  other   political

Parties  knew  nothing about it until agreement  had

been reached in principle. Concern was expressed  by

civil  organisations,  unions  and  leaders  of  the

Singapore and Chinese Chambers of Commerce. We  were

wondering  if there was any meaning in  that  letter

from  the  Acting Prime Minister. The  Acting  Prime

Minister  asked  if we agreed to the two  principles

already  agreed  to.  Was it a genuine  and  sincere

seeking  of views? If it was meant to be  a  sincere

seeking of views and a form of consultation, then it

should   have  been  sent  before,  and  not  after,

agreement  had  already been  reached  in  principle

between the two Prime Ministers. In our reply to the

Acting  Prime  Minister on 1st September,  1961,  we

pointed  out that the attitude of the Government  in

going about its business, regardless of the views of

the others, especially on a matter of such magnitude

and importance affecting our entire people, was,  to

say   the  least,  most  reprehensible.  Under   the

circumstances,  we could not help but  come  to  the

conclusion  that  the letter from the  Acting  Prime

Minister  was  only intended to deceive  the  people

into believing that all Parties were being consulted

in the P.A.P. attempt to sign away the future of our

people.  The  fact that this letter was released  to

the Press even before replies were received from the

Opposition leaders, showed the farce and insincerity

of  this  so-called consultation. It  is  absolutely

clear that this letter was a result of after-thought

for  the P.A.P.'s earlier sin of omission. And  what

was  the  purpose of this cheap political propaganda

stunt   but  to  deceive  and  sell-out?  Even   the

reactionary Lim Yew Hock Government had to take heed

of   the   public   when   it   came   to   consider

constitutional matters in 1958. All the Parties were

first   consulted  and  they  had  agreed   to   the

principles  before they proceeded to negotiate  upon

them -

<div align="center"><b>PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC SECURITY ORDINANCE AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, in

1955 when the people's first elected government took

office,  they  promised to examine exhaustively  the

Emergency Regulations with a view to dispensing with

such  powers  that are no longer essential  for  the

maintenance of law and order within the framework of

normal legal procedure. As soon as we came in,  Sir,

we   began   to   repeal  parts  of  the   Emergency

Regulations   and  finally  reviewed  the   question

whether   we  could  repeal  the  whole   of   those

deservedly unpopular regulations. The Federation  of

Malaya  sent  urgent  representations  through   its

Defence  Secretary  and Chief of  Operations  urging

upon  us  the gravity of relaxing the measures,  and

out  of  deference  and because  we  had  not  fully

studied  with  the  question,  Sir,  we  agreed   to

temporary  measures  pending further  study  of  the

issue. Those temporary measures were incorporated in

what  is  now  known as the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance wherein it was sought to give the

maximum  security for the citizen within the context

of  basic  security of the country.  I  pointed  out

then, Sir, that the P.P.S.O. was more liberal - I  had

so thought it - than the Security of the Pakistan Act,

the  Preventive Detention Act of India,  the  Public

Order  Preservation  Act of Burma,  and  the  S.O.B.

provisions  of Indonesia, which all give  powers  of

preventive arrest and detention in respect of  those

whose  conduct may imminently prejudice the security

and safety of the State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main safeguard, Sir, incorporated in these

provisions of the P.P.S.O. was a tribunal  of  three

Judges  which  would  review all  decisions  of  the

Cabinet and could order the release of a detainee if

they  considered that his detention  was  no  longer

necessary for the security of the State even  though

it was against the Government's wishes, and such -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member please

remember that his speech is being translated? He  is

speaking a bit too fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged, Mr Speaker. It was

then  I  said that it was with a heavy heart that  I

introduced  a  Bill which did not completely  remove

the  existing inroads into the rule of law as I  had

hoped to in the early days of my government. The law

that  was  passed was for three years, so  that  the

Government  should have to account to  the  Assembly

before  that  Assembly ended its life. The  Minister

for Labour (then the Member for Sembawang, Che Ahmad

Ibrahim) during that debate said, "These Regulations

were  no  longer serving the purpose of  saving  the

country from a grave political crisis, but were,  in

fact,  a fetter on the political development of  the

people  in this country. Trade unionists and freedom

fighters  were  fully alive to this  threat  to  the

Malayan freedom movement and to ordinary trade union

activity."  The present Prime Minister,  during  the

debate  in  1955 did not deny that the law  was  far

better than the existing Emergency Regulations  and,

in fact, stated in col. 723:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is an advance, I am not denying that. It is

better than what it was before, when one Judge could

not order but could only recommend a man's release.'



<br><br>That  was  said by the very man who, when he  became

Prime Minister, promptly removed the Judges and took

away the power to order a man's release.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of elucidation, Sir. In

the name of -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, it is a question of the Prime

Minister, I think, being misrepresented on record.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am quoting from the record - col.

723 of the Hansard of the 21st of September, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

should  wait  until  the Member  has  completed  his

speech  and he can then give his explanation if  the

Member will not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker. Now,

that  Bill was passed without a division and  I  can

say  in  all  conscience that so long as  I  was  in

office  no  man was detained because of dislike  for

his  political affiliations or because he was  being

troublesome,  but genuinely because he was  believed

to  be  not merely a nuisance but a major threat  in

respect of potential large-scale disturbances -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker. I

have  here  Hansard, col. 723. I believe the  Member

for Anson did not give the correct quotation. May  I

read from col. 723 what the Prime Minister said?  He

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Three Judges! Great play has been made of three

Judges! ... One good judge is as good as three.'



<br><br>That was what he said.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I believe we have the

same  Hansard.  It is a question of  a  little  more

eyesight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is an advance, I am not denying that. It is

better than what it was before, when one Judge could

not order but could only recommend a man's release.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may go on, Mr Speaker. I was saying that for

us it was a question of incarcerating only those who

were  potential  organisers of  imminent  widespread

disorder  and  they never detained a  moment  longer

than  was  necessary.  I had sought,  in  fact,  the

report   on  the  entire  administration   of   this

Ordinance.  My  successor, the  present  Member  for

Cairnhill,  utilised the provisions of the  P.P.S.O.

with  extraordinary  width and incarcerated  amongst

others no less an eminent person than Dr Chuang Chu

Lin,   now   the  Vice-Chancellor  of  the   Nanyang

University -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I think it might interest the ex-Chief Minister to know that Dr Chuang Chu Lin was

not  detained  under  the  P.P.S.O. but  under  the

Banishment Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well, Sir, in that case my memory

serves  me wrong, but I was quite convinced that  he

was   detained  under  the  Preservation  of  Public

Security  Ordinance, and I shall be happy  to  check

that  perhaps  and refer it back, Mr  Speaker.  The

curious  thing is that this gentleman was never,  in

fact,  banished.  But the question  is  this:  I  am

trying  to  show you the way things have gone.  When

the   P.A.P. took  office  there  were  61  persons

detained  by  the Member for Cairnhill's Government,

and the P.A.P. itself in the two and a half years it

has  been in office has detained 30 persons in  all.

On  14th October, 1959, Sir, an amendment to  the  P.P.S.O. was introduced by the Prime Minister of the

present  P.A.P.  Government  on  a  Certificate   of

Urgency.  It  was  passed  on  the  same  day.   The

amendment abolished the tribunal of three Judges and

the power of the tribunal to make orders contrary to

the  wishes of the Government if it considered  that

there were inadequate reasons for further detention.

This  Government abolished the very safeguard  which

was  placed by the Prime Minister when he was in the

Opposition  at the time it was passed. But  when  he

became   Prime  Minister,  in  his  own   words   he

substituted  for this provision of three  Judges - and

these are his words in Hansard, 14th October, 1959:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... Substitutes in its place the original position

obtaining  under  the Emergency laws,  that  is,  an

advisory committee.',



<br><br>and  to  the  credit  of the Opposition  they  voted

against  that  amendment. The excuse,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  was  that the Judges were unhappy about  their

duties. I say this to you, Mr Speaker -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of order, Sir. When the

Member  for Anson quoted the Prime Minister in  col.

668  of  Hansard, col. 668 gives the speech  of  the

Chief Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister is

getting  a  bit frivolous now. He has  not  got  the

right quotation from the right volume.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, the

have  been  grossly misrepresented. I  read  here  a

letter from the then Acting Chief Justice saying  he

does not want anything to do with the P.P.S.O. under

the then provisions. I am saying that I am now being

alleged to have misrepresented the then Acting Chief

Justice.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, he says he read a

letter. Col. 668 - have you got it, Mr Speaker, Sir -

of  the  Hansard  of  the 14th  October,  1959?  The

Hansard   has  grossly  misrepresented  the   Prime

Minister. Paragraph 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First, clause 5 of the Bill repeals section 5 of

the  present Ordinance which provides for an  Appeal

Tribunal consisting of three judges, and substitutes

in  its place the original position obtaining  under

the Emergency laws, that is, an advisory committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September this year, I had discussions with the

present  Chief  Justice [of the  letter]  about  the

functions of the judiciary under the Preservation of

Public  Security Ordinance, which is  due  to  lapse

later this month.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the letter is

contained in col. 669.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I read it, Mr Speaker, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"My brother judges and I are all of the opinion

that it is extremely undesirable for members of  the

judiciary to constitute the Appeal Tribunal...".'



<br><br>They  are  still members of the Appeal  Tribunal.  A

Judge  is  still chairman of the Appeal Tribunal.  I

read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"... we think it was a mistake to have caused the

judiciary  to  be associated with the  work  of  the

tribunal.".'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



They  are  still  associated with the  work  of  the

tribunal. I will read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"However, in view of the reasons for extension of

the life of the Ordinance set out in your letter and

more particularly in view of your assurance that the

judiciary  will not be called upon to do  this  work

for  more than one further year, [October 1959]  the

judges who constitute the tribunal have agreed  with

great reluctance to continue to serve as members...".`



<br><br>Sir,  they  are still Judges of the High Court,  but

instead of giving them the dignity of being able  to

release  a detainee, that power has been taken  away

from them by this Government; not that they did  not

want  to shoulder that responsibility but that  they

did   not  want  to  associate  with  the  tribunal.

However,  they  were compelled to be associated  and

they  could still discharge that function.  But  the

Government was not happy that they should  have  the

power to discharge and to release detainees whom the

Government might wish to detain. In fact,  Sir,  you

will remember the evasive reply of the Minister  for

Home Affairs when I asked him whether there was  any

occasion on which he had rejected the advice of  the

Appeal  Tribunal. And he said, "I cannot  remember."

"I cannot remember."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 20th July this year the Deputy Prime

Minister   in  a  very  emotional  moment   solemnly

informed this House that there were at the  time  18

persons  still under detention who had been detained

by  the Lim Yew Hock Government and whom it was  the

desire  of the P.A.P. Government as long ago as  the

12th August, 1959, to release. In fact, he tabled  a

secret document in which he said -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That they were Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"once Lim Ching Siong is released, it makes very

little   difference  from  the  point  of  view   of

subversion  whether the remaining  40-odd  detainees

are  released or not, because they cannot materially

affect the security position."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, what is rather interesting is

the assurance given by the Deputy Prime Minister  on

the  20th  July  that the Government  would  release

these detainees from time to time in accordance with

the  original proposals of the Singapore Government.

Yet  the Minister for Home Affairs, in his reply  to

my  question which was tabled in this House on  16th

November,  stated  that at that date,  the  16th  of

November, two months ago, there were still these  18

detained  and that 4 of the 30 persons  detained  by

the present Government were still under detention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the same date, the Minister for Home Affairs, in replying to my question asking whether he would publish a report on the working of the P.P.S.O. since its inception, sneeringly said that since I was its framer and creator I should know how it worked. Mr Speaker, Sir, I know what it

was  intended for, but I do not know how it has been

used.  That  information I know will be  strenuously

denied  us  by  this  as well  as  by  the  previous

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not so much the persons who are detained under the P.P.S.O. that we are concerned

with  as the power of intimidation that it has given

this Government over the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is unfortunately true, Mr Speaker,

that it is not necessary to carry out  this

threat in this country. It is enough that you should

have  the power to make that threat. They discovered

that  by  detaining  two silly journalists - so-called

Right-wing  subversionists - they  could  intimidate

the-entire  Press and subjugate it in  terror.  They

have   utilised  this  P.P.S.O. with  Machiavellian

ingenuity.  [Interruption]  Ah,  the  Minister   for

Culture  feels the banb. Mr Speaker, it  is  to  be

noted  furthermore  that that Ordinance,  which  was

intended for three years, has been extended to  nine

years.   The  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance was passed by the Government of the Member

for Cairnhill, allegedly to meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



the  threat of gangsters - not political gangsters.  I

mean secret societies. I have reason to believe that

it has been used in other than secret society cases.

In any event, Mr Speaker, it is a radical departure

from  the  rule  of  law in that it  authorises  the

imprisonment  of persons for successive  periods  of

two   years  without  trial  at  the  will  of   the

Government  with  the  concurrence  of   the   State

Advocate-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the duty of Members of this House - all Members and not only the Opposition - to seek to safeguard the liberty of the people who have elected them and to scrutinise jealously every infringement of normal legal rights. The purpose of this motion is to urge upon all Members of this House to recognise that we have in our midst two

major  breaches in the rule of law, that  they  have

been  in operation for a considerable period of time

and  that  they  have not been adequately  examined.

There have been no reports on them. I say that we in

this  Assembly  and  the  people  of  Singapore  are

entitled to have from the Government a report on its

working  from  its  inception. I for  one,  who  was

responsible  for  its  creation  and  in  part   had

administered  it,  have no fear of  any  disclosures

that  could  be  made. I say that there  should  be

clearly  established reasons and  justification  for

the   continuance   of   the   provisions   of   the

Preservation  of  Public Security Ordinance  in  the

considerably improved situation in Singapore  today.

I say we are entitled to this information.



<br><br>8.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> From time to time it is my

unpleasant duty to say how wrong we have been. There

was  a time when I felt that whatever the short-comings  of the Member for Anson, here was one, albeit

innocently  and naively, who believed in  democratic

rights and freedom on very basic principles.  But  I

am  convinced, after listening to him for  the  last

twenty  minutes - I  was not here for  the  first  two

minutes - that  that  is  not  the  position.  He  was

entrusted with the survival of the State,  and  when

he was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



entrusted with the survival of the State, he made no

bones  about his responsibility and of the necessity

to  have  these laws. He quoted India  and  Pakistan

with great eloquence to demonstrate to the then semi-elected  Assembly how independent countries  had  to

protect  their  integrity  and  survival  from   the

ruthless  machinations of those whom he  hated  from

the very bottom of his belly.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Plague-carrying rats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Plague-carrying rats whom he

hated and so on. And now I hear from him not in  the

same  voice, but in a different one. He is  now  the

champion, albeit in a back-handed way  - how  nice  it

would be to have a chap like the Member for Anson as

Prime Minister - he believes them all. We should  deal

with  them  gently, and only detain them  for  short

periods.   I  say  to  him  that  in  the   art   of

brinkmanship,  there  are  two  qualities  required.

First  a fine judgment of just how far one wants  to

go,  and  that depends on what one is fighting  for:

and second, the ability, when the time requires,  to

stand  up and fight. And I say, when we took office,

we  had calculated all the odds involved and I stand

by  every  word  of that document to  which  he  has

referred.  Once we released Mr Lim Ching Siong,  it

is  utterly  irrelevant and trivial to hold  up  the

balance  of these people whom from time to  time  we

shall  release till the last of them are out. I  say

the  Barisan  Sosialis  and their  chief  performers

understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all a purely academic argument. It is a

waste of time and we want to get it out of the  way.

The  Member  for  Anson - I say from  my  information,

knowledge  and  belief - understands  full  well  that

without  the  P.P.S.O. and the judicial exercise  of

those  powers on the right target, there is not  the

slightest  hope of democracy surviving.  He  himself

has  admitted it. You do not have to use any powers,

says  he. All you have to do is to threaten, and  it

is  not the Government who does the threatening.  It

is  the  chaps who run the underground and  say,  "I

will fix you - and I will fix you in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



quiet corner  - not in accordance with the law, but in

accordance with the gun." And they get obedience. We

have seen in this very Chamber how chaps have melted

away. They believed in democracy. But when the  heat

was  put  on, they melted away: mind you,  believing

that  the other side was going to win. But  that  is

another  matter.  That is the tragedy  that  we  are

faced  with, that few people have sufficient  belief

in  democracy to stand up and fight for it  and  die

for  it.  The tragedy I was touched by just now  was

that once I used to list the persons who would fight

and  die for democracy. I am afraid, after listening

to  the  Member for Anson just now, I will  have  to

scratch  him  from the list. He is no more.  He  may

have  started,  Mr Speaker, Sir, as a  naive  well-meaning  liberal. By the time he was finished  with

15 or 16 months as Chief Minister in one of the most

turbulent periods of Singapore's history since 1945,

he  knew what this was all about. He told me what it

was  all  about. I think he ought to do me at  least

this  one act of justice, that I have never  at  any

time  denied any of the truths he tittered  in  this

Assembly,  truths which I knew to be true.  But  the

Member  for Anson locked up Mr Fong Swee Suan.  And

he  is  an evil-doer. I never denied it. We  pleaded

and appealed to his better nature. It was my duty as

Secretary-General  of  the  Party.  I  do  not  know

whether  it  was my plea or the ferocious utterances

of  the  supporters of the Bus Workers'  Union  that

persuaded the Member for Anson to release  Mr  Fong

Swee  Suan. I like to believe that it was my  gentle

plea for mercy that made act in that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when all the sweet talk about liberty and the

rights  of  men is over, I say there is a  right  of

self  defence,  and  the Members on  the  Opposition

Benches, the Barisan Sosialis, understand that. They

know  it full well. In the last resort, what worries

me  is  not that there will be three Judges  or  one

Judge  who will review these matters. Does it really

matter?  Any government that abuses the P.P.S.O. to

use  it against non-Communists destroys the efficacy

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



P.P.S.O. The last Government knew it. The Federation

Government is fully alive to it. The Tunku  says  he

is  very selective and judicious. Because to make it

an effective instrument, you must be judicious. Then

people know. Ah, quite right.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What about reporters?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Reporters? We said quite

rightly that they were not Communists. I thought  we

had  dealt with it under the Criminal Law (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance. We said so. When  they  were

not Communists, we named them. A.R.T.I.S.  - they were

not  Communists  - we named them. But I say or him and

the former man entrusted with power deliberately  to

cast  a  cloud  over it, to say that the  democratic

liberal  line is quite innocent leaves me completely

cynical.  If  you remove these powers, he  knows  as

well  as  everybody else that he will not  be   going

before  a Judge and arguing these things out:  in  a

very  short  while  you will be  lynching  chaps  in

Orchard Circus and settling matters there. He cannot

deny  that.  He knows it. What worries me  is  this,

that there will be enough stupid chaps in Singapore

and  elsewhere  in Malaya and in Malaysia  who  will

make  it  increasingly difficult for us to  maintain

the  democratic  tradition  because  they  play  the

undemocratic game. That is the tragedy. I would tell

the Member for Nee Soon particularly - and I have told

him  this  long  before  these  serious  errors   of

calculations were made - that in the last  resort,  if

the  Communists  use methods of intimidation,  force

and   pressure,  they  cannot  expect  a  democratic

government to sit back and allow itself to be  eaten

away;  and  the  more the methods  of  pressure  and

intimidation,  the Central Government  will,  albeit

reluctantly, have to act with firmness,  regret  and

effectiveness.  But I think the  operative  word  is

"effectiveness".  Otherwise we  will  not  be  here.

There  will  not  be pensions to be  paid  to  civil

servants.

grateful to him because he opened Pandora's  Box.  I

was  there  watching. He opened one  box  after  the

other  and  a  cobra  popped out  at  the  end.  His

successor put the cobra back. We drew out the  fangs

of the cobra. It is now running



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



around and I do not know when it is going to be  put

back,  but it is without fangs now. Before it  grows

new  fangs, I am pretty sure that the hopes, freedom

and  liberty of the people of Singapore, Malaya  and

Malaysia will be guaranteed.
