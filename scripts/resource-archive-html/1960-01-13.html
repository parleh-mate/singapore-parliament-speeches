<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Johore River Scheme will take about four years

to complete. On completion, it will be able to supply

Singapore  with an additional 25 million  gallons  of

water a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Scheme is expected to ensure an adequate water

supply  for the island's population over a period  of

five  to  ten years. Should the consumption  increase

beyond what is expected at present, the Scheme  would

be  extended. The minimum yield from the Johore River

is approximately 300 million gallons a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the foreseeable future Singapore's consumption of

water  cannot  exceed the potential supply  from  the

Johore River.

Council Draft 1960 Budget prepared in accordance with

section  71  (1)  of the Local Government  Ordinance,

1957, on 23rd October 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister approved the Budget on 23rd December, in the exercise of his powers under section

72  (2) , subject to the deletion of development items

and  to  further  scrutiny of the  Budget  to  effect

economies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The draft Budget, as presented to the Prime

Minister, provided for an estimated deficit  of  some

$13  million.  The Government has resolutely  opposed

deficit  budgetting, and has made known its intention

to   effect   all   possible  economies   in   public

expenditure.   The  Prime  Minister  therefore   gave

instructions  for  a  further  scrutiny  of   special

expenditure  items, particularly  those  items  which

provide  for projects which come within the scope  of

the Schedule to the Development Fund Ordinance, 1960.

The  work  of scrutiny and deletion has been  carried

out  by  the Ministry of Finance in conjunction  with

the City Council and is still proceeding.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While scrutiny is in progress, expenditure on items

of  special expenditure has been frozen, except where

commitments  have  already been  made  prior  to  1st

January,  1960. When scrutiny has been completed,  the

Government   will   consider  providing   the   funds

necessary  to  implement those projects,  which  have

been   accepted.  Any  further  deletions  could   be

effected by Supplemental Budgets.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill re-enacts the provisions of Part II of

the  Road  Traffic  Ordinance, with  the  significant

modification  that  all payments of  compensation  by

insurers





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



in  respect of third party risks are required  to  be

paid to the Public Trustee as trustee for the persons

entitled thereto, and that solicitation in respect of

claims for such compensation is prohibited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides that, when any

payment is made by way of compensation by an approved

insurer or by the owner of a motor vehicle in respect

of  the  death  of  or bodily injury  to  any  person

arising  from the use of a motor vehicle on  a  road,

such  payment shall be made to the Public Trustee  as

trustee for the persons entitled thereto. The  moneys

received by the Public Trustee will be distributed to

the  persons entitled thereto after payment of  costs

and fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is given to the Public Trustee to require

.the  approval of the court for a payment by  way  of

settlement,  where  he considers the  payment  to  be

inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill similarly requires that where

any payment is made by an insurer under a judgment of

the  court, such payment shall be made to the  Public

Trustee as trustee for the persons entitled thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 of the Bill makes it an offence for a

person to solicit instructions or authority to act on

behalf  of any other person in respect of the  making

or  commencement of any claim or action  for  damages

for  death or personal injury arising out of the  use

of a motor vehicle, or in respect of the negotiation,

compromise or settlement of such claim or action.  It

is also made an offence for any person, other than  a

public officer or an advocate and solicitor, to  make

or  cause to be made any claim on behalf of any other

person for such damages. A public officer or advocate

and  solicitor who acts for another person in respect

of such claim will only be entitled to payment of his

taxed  costs, and if any other sum is paid  for  work

done or services rendered in respect of any claim  or

action for such damages, such sum may be recovered by

the person who paid it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the Bill is to put an end to the practice

which  is  resorted  to by some lawyers  of  engaging

touts to solicit and obtain accident claims cases and

arranging  to  keep  a  substantial  portion  of  the

compensation received for themselves. In this way the

unfortunate  victims  of  road  accidents  have  been

cheated  of  the sums rightly due to  them  by  these

unscrupulous lawyers, and I am glad to say  that  the

majority  of the members of the Bar and the insurance

companies have welcomed the move of the Government to

put a stop to this racket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Bill has been introduced, a number of

discussions  have been held with the  representatives

of  the  Motor  Insurance Association of  Malaya  and

Borneo,  and  as  a  result of these  discussions,  a

number of amendments have been agreed to, and I  will

seek  to move these amendments in the Committee stage

of  this Bill. The most important of these amendments

is  to  make  it unnecessary for payments under  $500

made  by  way of settlement to be paid to the  Public

Trustee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to incorporate

in   the  amendments  to  be  proposed  a  number  of

provisions  from  the Federation of  Malaya's  recent

Road Traffic Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this proviso is taken from the

Federation's Road Traffic Ordinance, 1958. The

existing law, which makes it mandatory for the Court

to disqualify the driver unless there are special

reasons relating to the offence, sometimes causes

hardship to a paid driver who has no knowledge that

there is no policy of insurance in force or that the

policy has expired. The amendment seeks to remove

this hardship.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new subsections, Mr Speaker, Sir, are taken

from  the Federation's Road Traffic Ordinance,  1958.

They  give  the Minister the power to  lay  down  conditions   for   approval  and  to  control approved

insurers.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

will  the Minister please enlighten the House on  two

matters  which  arise  out  of  the  amendment?   The

proposed subsection (8) (e):



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to keep the Minister informed of any change in the

address of such place of business or of such agent.";

and



<br><br>following on from there, to subsection

(9):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister shall cause the name and address of

every  approved insurer and of his place of  business

or agent to be published in the Gazette."



<br><br>At  first  sight, it would appear, Mr Speaker,  that

subsection   (9)  might  not  cover   a   change   of

address - that is my first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the proposed subsection (10), the position is

that  if the Minister struck out an insurance company

under  this  subsection, then its  future  insurances

would  be invalid. If an unsuspecting person went  to

such  an  insurance company and took out an insurance

policy on a car, he would naturally be uninsured; and

if  he should meet with an accident on a policy which

he  thinks  is  valid, then he would  be  in  serious

trouble.  I  do  not  notice any  provisions  in  the

Ordinance  which  will  penalise  such  an  insurance

company  where, after it has been struck out  by  the

Minister, it effects an insurance policy on a car.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these subsections are

actually  taken  from the Federation's  Road  Traffic

Ordinance,  1958.  On the first  point  made  by  the

Member for Farrer Park, that subsection (9) would not

cover  cases of a change of address of a business,  I

would suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it would.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other point made by him, I think, if there

are  difficulties in the operation of the subsection,

the  Government would always be prepared to look into

them.  As  far  as we know, there have been  no  such

representations made to the Federation Government  in

respect of a similar subsection in their Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied with the

assurance  given by the Minister on subsection  (10).

Should  anything arise, I take it the  Minister  will

bring up the legislation to meet the case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (9), Mr Speaker, Sir, is a great

convenience  to those people who deal with  insurance

companies. Sometimes it is very necessary to know the

name  of the agent and his address. It might be  very

difficult to obtain the information unless they go to

the Gazette and obtain it. If the Minister could,  by

administrative action, cause the change of address to

be gazetted, I should then be satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the Minister is

under  an  obligation to have the change  of  address

published in the Gazette.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

"exceeding   five  hundred  dollars  other   than   a

liquidated sum specified in a policy of insurance".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment is made at the

suggestion  of  the  Motor Insurance  Association  of

Malaya and Borneo. The purpose is to leave out  small

claims and payments for minor injuries from the scope

of the section. There are many such claims, which are

settled  by insurance companies, and it is felt  that

to require all such settlements under $500 to be made

to the Public Trustee would not be advisable from the

point of view of administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also seeks to make it unnecessary to

pay personal benefit claims, which are liquidated  in

a  policy of insurance to the Public Trustee. In such

cases the amount of the compensation and the terms of

the payment are provided for under the policy itself.

provision is unnecessary.

provisions  of  subsection (1)  of  this  section  is

manifestly".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, is consequential

to the amendment to sub-clause (1) of clause 4. It is

also  designed to restrict the powers of  the  Public

Trustee to cases where the amount of compensation  is

manifestly  inadequate. It has been  suggested  that,

unless  some  such  provision  were  made,  insurance

companies  would not want to settle claims but  would

want to fight all claims in the Court.

particular vehicle belonging to any particular person

or  class of persons. Now, this clause might do  more

than that. It could regulate payments arising out  of

road accidents and such like matters. By this clause,

is it the intention of the

persons  from  insuring with insurance companies  but

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shariah Court was established to administer the

Muslim  law of marriage and divorce in 1958,  but  it

has been found that the Court does not, in fact, have

the  powers  to carry out its functions  effectually.

When  this  Government assumed office, it  was  found

that  the  Shariah Court had only one official,  that

is,  the  Registrar of Muslim Marriages who was  also

President of the Shariah Court. The Court had a clerk

lent from the Land Office and an office boy lent from

the  Ministry of Home Affairs. The first  step  taken

was  to provide the Court with an adequate staff. The

Shariah  Court  now  has, besides  the  Registrar  of

Muslim Marriages, its own General Clerical Officer, a

General  Clerical  Assistant, a  Process  Server  and

Notice Server, a typist and an office boy. The  Chief

Kathi and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



Kathi  have been placed on the establishment  of  the

Court  and this year it is hoped to appoint a  Muslim

Social Case Worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the Shariah Court were very limited

indeed. It had no power to punish for contempt in the

face of the Court, nor had it power to issue warrants

for  arrest to persons who failed to comply with  any

summons   issued  by  it.  It  had  a  very   limited

jurisdiction. For example, it had only powers to make

orders for maintenance up to $100 a month. Even  when

it  had jurisdiction and had made an order, it had no

power  itself to enforce compliance with the  order.

This Bill, therefore, seeks to increase the powers of

the Shariah Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 and 11 of the Bill give powers to the

Shariah Court to make orders for maintenance and  for

the  payments of rnas-kahwin or dowry and consolatory

gifts  and  also power to enforce the orders  in  the

same  manner as fines may be livied in a Magistrate's

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill gives power to the Shariah

Court  to  summon witnesses and to issue warrants  of

arrest to persons who fail to attend after being duly

summoned,  and  also to exercise the  powers  of  the

Court  under Chapter XXXII of the Criminal  Procedure

Code to punish contempts in the face of the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill gives power to the Shariah

Court  to  hear  all appeals from  the  decisions  of

Kathis instead of, as formerly, only from refusals to

register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shariah Court has, to some extent, succeeded in

giving  greater  stability  to  Muslim  marriages  in

Singapore, as shown by a Table which I have caused to

be  prepared of marriages and divorces in  Singapore.

For 1957, the Shariah Court performed 2,303 marriages

and  divorced  1,192  persons, and  in  the  case  of

revocation (rojo) there were 183 persons involved. In

1958,   2,332  persons  were  married,   1,149   were

divorced,  and there were 156 cases of revocation  of

divorce.  The  figures for 1959 are  also  available:

Marriages  were  reduced  to  1,953,  divorces   were

reduced to 719, and revocations of divorce were  also

reduced to 76.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some success has been achieved, it is felt

that more can be done. Clause 9 of the Bill provides,

therefore  that the Court should appoint arbitrators

in   all   cases  coming  before  it  and  that   the

arbitrators    should   endeavour   to    effect    a

reconciliation between the parties. In this  respect,

the arbitrators will, it is hoped, be assisted by the

Muslim  Social  Case  Worker who will  be  appointed.

Power  is  also given to the Court in  clause  10  to

order  the  payment of a consolatory  gift  in  cases

where  a divorce is unreasonably insisted on  by  the

husband.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks in clause 3

to impose some control on the solemnisation of Muslim

marriages  by  providing that where the  man, to  be

married  has  already  a wife or  wives  living,  the

marriage  may only be solemnised by the Chief  Kathi,

who  shall  satisfy himself that there are no  lawful

obstacles  according  to the Law  of  Islam  to  such

marriage.  Care has been taken not to go  beyond  the

provisions of Muslim law in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been referred to the Muslim Advisory

Board  and  the All-Malaya Muslim Missionary  Society

who have both approved the provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on my part and on behalf of

U.M.N.O.,  we  support  the  proposal  to  amend  the

Muslims  Ordinance, 1957, on principle.  Indeed,  the

time has come when we should give full powers to  the

Shariah  Court  to  implement its  administration  in

accordance  with Muslim law. Sir, I  pay  my  highest

tribute to the Government for putting up this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many matters which I think should

be placed before this House in connection with clause

3,  where powers to solemnise the marriage of  a  man

who already has a wife or wives living, are given  to

the  Chief Kathi. I think this power is very wide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



and the  question  of giving it only to the  Chief  Kathi

should be reconsidered by the Government because,  in

the opinion of my colleagues in U.M.N.O. and also  in

my  opinion, this power should be vested not only  in

the  Chief Kathi but also in all the other Kathis  in

Singapore.  For instance, if the Chief Kathi  himself

wants  to  have more than one wife, who is  going  to

solemnise  the marriage? But a bigger problem  arises

when  a  person who already has a wife  in  Singapore

goes to Johore Bahru and gets married there. What  is

the  purpose then of having the Muslims Ordinance  if

we  cannot control the citizens of Singapore who  can

marry  and  re-marry  here? And if  the  Chief  Kathi

forbids a person from marrying here, that person will

marry  elsewhere. This is a problem  which  we  would

like to place before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer to the Muslims Ordinance,

1957,  in  which this House gave powers only  to  the

Chief Kathi to solemnise marriages of girls who  have

no guardians. This must also be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I appeal to the Government, particularly

to  the  Minister for Labour and Law, to  bring  this

Bill  before a Select Committee so that these clauses

can  be further considered. As has been explained  by

the  Minister  for Labour and Law, I  know  that  the

Muslim  Advisory  Board  and  the  All-Malaya  Muslim

Missionary  Society have consented  and  given  their

approval  to the amendments, but I do feel that  this

is  a  big  issue affecting the lives  of  people  of

Islamic  faith in Singapore. Under the circumstances,

I  appeal to the Government to refer this Bill  to  a

Select Committee for further consideration.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  in  a  review  of  the  Muslims

Ordinance,  amendments  have  been  put  up  by   the

Government.  We  should adopt a certain  attitude  in

matters  affecting people of Islamic faith. The  Bill

is  very  wide  in  scope, and does  not  cover  only

marriage and divorce. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I  feel

that  the  steps we are taking to review the  Muslims

Ordinance should receive very careful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



consideration. I am not opposed to wider powers being

given  to  the Shariah Court. The Minister  has  said

that  formerly  marriage  was  considered  to  be   a

plaything. This Bill will have an adverse effect  not

only  on the Muslim community in particular, but also

on the citizens of Singapore as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of giving powers to the Chief Kathi

alone - it  was  brought up by the Member  for  Geylang

Serai - I think the powers should not be given only  to

the   Chief  Kathi  with  the  object  of  preventing

unscrupulous persons from marrying two or more wives.

Ordinary marriages can be solemnised by other Kathis,

say,  by  the  Vice-Kathi. We should  also  give  the

ordinary  Kathis  powers to enable  them  to  conduct

inquiries  in  the  same  way as  investigations  are

carried out into the lives of persons who have  wives

and  who wish to marry again. I cannot see any reason

why  the Chief Kathi alone should be given the powers

as,   in   fact,  the  other  Kathis  are   similarly

responsible for solemnising marriages in Singapore. I

am  personally of the opinion that if only the  Chief

Kathi  is  given such powers we will not achieve  the

desired  objectives.  As  I  said  earlier  on,   the

ordinary  Kathis should also be given special  powers

to   carry   out  investigations  before  solemnising

marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another point I wish to raise. If the

Chief Kathi alone is so empowered, it would mean that

he  would  have to carry out investigations based  on

information   obtained  from  other  people,   before

solemnising a marriage. Now, if a man lives far  away

from  the  City, say, in one of the Southern Islands,

surely  the  Chief  Kathi  could  not  solemnise  his

marriage on the recommendation of the penghulu alone.

If  a  person  lives in Changi or in  a  far  distant

kampong where contact or communication with the Chief

Kathi  is  difficult, it is natural for those  people

who  live  in  that kampong to know all  the  details

about  a  person who: wishes to marry again. Now,  if

the  powers  are given to the Chief Kathi  alone,  he

will be unable to conduct a very careful study of the

matter.  Therefore, powers should  be  given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



to  the other  Kathis  as  well who can carry  out  a  better

investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I think it is proper that this

Bill should be referred to a Select Committee so that

an opportunity could be given to the public to put up

constructive    suggestions    for     the     better

implementation of the Muslim law in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to make is that many people in

Singapore,  who  claim to be Muslims,  have  remarked

that this Bill is very deleterious to the position of

Islam in Singapore because no power is vested in  the

Shariah  Court in the case of non-Muslims who cohabit

with   Muslim   women.  Therefore,  if  the   Muslims

(Amendment)  Bill is referred to a Select  Committee,

more opportunity will be given to review it.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government

which believes in practising democracy, I wish to say

that  the Government will not be unwilling to  accept

the suggestion by the Opposition to refer the Muslims

(Amendment)  Bill to a Select Committee  for  further

consideration. However, before doing  that,  I  would

like to put forward my views. On the question of  the

powers  of the Chief Kathi to solemnise the  marriage

of  a  person  who already has a wife or  more  wives

living.  From the point of view of Muslim law,  Islam

does not encourage a man marrying more than one wife.

On the other hand, it warns Muslims who wish to marry

more  than one wife but who are unable to afford  it.

In  the interests of justice, a man should not  marry

more  than one wife. If the power is vested  only  in

the  Chief Kathi, the question of marrying more  than

one  wife,  from  the point of view  of  the  Islamic

people,    can   be   controlled,   thus   preventing

unscrupulous persons from marrying more than one wife

and,  after three months, divorcing their  wives.  It

may  be that between them, the wives will be able  to

pull their husband's ears! If we invest powers in the

Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



Kathi  only, those Muslims who can afford to maintain

more than one wife will marry more than one wife.  If

we give this power to the ordinary Kathis, who I know

are not paid-their income comes only from solemnising

marriages-it will mean that investigations  into  the

case  of  a person who wishes to marry more than  one

wife  will only be carried out just for the  sake  of

investigation, because if there is no marriage,  then

the  Kathi  will have no income. If the Chief  Kathi,

who  is  paid  by the Government, has  these  special

powers, he will be responsible to the Government  for

carrying  out  his functions effectively,  and  I  am

quite  confident that this will mean a  reduction  in

polygamous  marriages. If a man  cannot  get  married

here  and  he goes to Johore, it is not our  problem.

There  may be people who wish to go to Indonesia  and

marry there; or go to India or Egypt for that matter.

It  is not our business. But what matters is that  we

want an Ordinance in Singapore so that there will  be

less  domestic conflicts between the many wives as  a

result    of    the   Kathis   not   making    proper

investigations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning guardians. This power

is  also given to the Chief Kathi who is paid by  the

Government. I have read in the newspapers lately that

a youth eloped with a spinster from Johore. They came

to  Singapore  to  get married. The parents  of  this

couple would ask the Kathi for an explanation. Such a

marriage is possible nowadays because this is an  era

where people mix freely. If we give this power to the

ordinary  Kathis who are not paid by  the  Government

and  who  depend  solely  on  the  solemnisation   of

marriages  for  their income, it will  mean  that  no

proper investigations will be carried out. Therefore,

with  the  introduction  of  this  Bill,  I  think  a

marriage without the sanction or the knowledge of the

parents  can  be controlled completely. Mr  Speaker,

concerning the legal guardian, shall I say this is an

easy  matter,  because  I know  if  people  from  the

kampong  wish to marry, they will send for  a  Kathi.

They  pay  a  marriage  fee of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



$15,  apart  from  the

question  of  transport to fetch a  Kathi  say,  from

Kampong Java to Changi. I think it will be better  if

the  bride  and  bridegroom will go in  one  car  and

proceed  to  the  office  of the  Chief  Kathi,  thus

reducing a lot of expenses; and it is up to  both  of

them  to decide what kind of wedding feast they  wish

to  have. So, Mr Speaker, this legislation which  we

are   going  to  enforce  is  good.  However,  as   a

Government which believes in and practises democracy,

we will not be unwilling to accept the proposition by

the  Opposition Members to refer the Bill to a Select

Committee, so that every community in Singapore  will

be  able  to  offer  their views to  the  Government,

particularly Islamic people, as this particular  Bill

affects them.

Opposition  to  refer the Bill  back  to  the  Select

Committee. This is a good thing. But, Mr Speaker,  I

would  like to clarify one point. As far as  I  know,

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

National  Development has emphasised  the problem  of

marrying one wife or more than one wife, and that the

Kathi  is only a witness. There are many Muslims  who

know  about  this. As an example, Ali has a  daughter

and  Inche Yaacob asks for her hand. Inche Yaacob has

already  got a wife. Ali is very pleased and is  very

willing  to accept Inche Yaacob as his son-in-law.  I

am  quite  sure Ali will accept Inche Yaacob  because

the  Muslims Ordinance permits Inche Yaacob to  marry

Ali's  daughter, although he has already got a  wife.

Therefore,  the Kathi, whether it is the Chief  Kathi

or  an ordinary Kathi, merely witnesses the marriage.

The  marriage is conducted according to Muslim rites.

If  I  am  wrong, please ask the Muslims who  are  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kathi is merely a witness to the marriage to

ensure  that it will not be in contradiction  of  the

Muslim  law. Under these circumstances, Mr  Speaker,

U.M.N.O. is  of  the opinion that if the  Government

agrees  to  this Bill to be further reconsidered,  it

will receive many reports and views on the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have followed the newspapers from day to day, particularly the local newspapers. As far

as  Muslim  law is concerned, this Bill is  different

from  the  one  which was approved  by  the  previous

Government  in  power in connection  with  monogamous

marriages. I would like to know whether the staff  of

the   Sharjah  Court  can  make  statements  in   the

newspapers as to their views on Bills which have  not

already  been approved by this Assembly? Can  it  be

done  by the staff of the Shariah Court, who are paid

servants of the Government? Are they involved  in  or

connected  with  other matters? It  is  a  difficulty

which I myself cannot clarify here. It is left to the

Government to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand, Mr Speaker, as explained by the

State  Advocate-General in the newspapers,  that  the

Chief  Kathi  is  paid  for his  work  and  that  all

payments  are returned to the Government. I  wish  to

emphasise  here that the Islamic faith believes  that

all  men are the same. If we are industrious, we will

be  rich.  God  is almighty and just, and  we  cannot

overcome  the  powers of God. If we allow  the  Chief

Kathi to solemnise such marriages, there may be times

when - as  I  have  said, the Chief Kathi  is  just  an

ordinary human being - he may not be in the mood and he

will  reject the request to solemnise such marriages.

If  the  ordinary  Kathis are also  given  powers  to

solemnise  marriages, I have no  objection  to  their

help. We can even place them on the establishment  of

the  Court.  I  have  already explained  the  reasons

earlier in my speech.

Mr  Speaker, as a woman, I wonder whether,  if  this

would consider inviting the views of Muslim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



women to be represented to the Select Committee, just

as  they  have done with the Pawnbrokers  (Amendment)

affects  their lives. This Bill concerns women  as  a

whole, and, if possible, could not the views of other

women besides Muslim women be represented before  the

Select Committee?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had better make it quite clear to the

hon.  Member that when a Bill is referred to a Select

Committee,  it  gets out of the jurisdiction  of  the

Government. It then comes within the jurisdiction  of

the Assembly. It is up to the Assembly or Members  of

the  Select  Committee to decide whom  they  wish  to

hear. It is not the Government which decides.

<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, in  connection with the  amendment  to

clause  3  concerning guardians, I have  to  add  the

views of the Muslims. I must admit that I am not well-versed  in religious matters, and thus my interviews

with  people  who  are  themselves  well  versed   in

religious matters have benefited me a lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what has been expressed by the Member for Kampong Kembangan has been very misleading indeed

because,  as  far as I know, if I am not  wrong,  the

Kathi  is the guardian of the Prophet Mohammed. Peace

be  unto him. No ordinary man can become a Kathi. The

Kathi  is a guardian of the Law of Islam and is  held

in high esteem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the amendment. If we have many Kathis who

can solemnise marriages and there are men who wish to

marry more than one wife, I think there is no purpose

in  this  Government restricting  the  many  divorces

which  are prevalent among the Muslim community.  For

instance,  Mr Speaker, many Kathis are permitted  to

solemnise  marriages for men who already have  wives.

As an example, a Muslim goes to a Kathi and tells him

that  he  wishes to marry another girl. The Ordinance

says  that if he can afford to maintain two wives  he

can do so because there are no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



such restrictions. It follows, therefore, that if  he

is  not permitted to take another wife, he will  then

naturally go to another Kathi, and if he fails in his

second effort, he will go to the next Kathi, until in

the  end  all the Kathis have been approached because

being  a human being, he will make an all-out  effort

to  get married to another girl if he wants to marry.

But he will make no attempt to raise his standard  of

living.  I  have heard it said that if we  take  four

wives  we  will  be  following the footsteps  of  the

Prophet Mohammed but that we do not practise what the

Prophet  practises, that is to say, say  our  prayers

five  times  a  day. If the power  to  solemnise  the

marriage of persons who already have wives is  vested

only  in  one Kathi, it will mean that there will  be

less  people who can marry more than one  wife.  Take

the   example  quoted  by  the  Member  for   Kampong

Kembangan. Inche Yaacob wishes to marry his daughter.

It does not matter. The Kathi, in his own words, is a

witness.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan was referring to Members  of  this

Chamber. I think he was giving figurative examples. I

do  not  think he meant that there should be a  union

between the Government Benches and the Opposition!



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff:</b> It is misleading, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is

misleading  at all. I think the word is  "figurative"

and not "misleading".



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Member for Kampong Kembangan said he is a Malay  and

is  of  the  Islamic faith. So am  I.  I  very  much

regret   to  say  this,  Mr  Speaker.  He   himself

mentioned his name Ali and Yaacob, therefore  it  is

better  for  me also to mention Ali and  Yaacob.  If

Ali's  daughter  is in love with Inche  Yaacob,  who

has  already  got  a wife, and if  Ali  permits  his

daughter  to  marry Inche Yaacob,  then  it  is  all

right. But if Inche



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



Ali does not wish his daughter to marry Inche Yaacob,

then  Inche Yaacob will elope with his daughter. When

they  elope,  they will go to a Kathi. If  the  Kathi

says,  "You  both cannot marry," then  they  will  go

before  another Kathi until finally they succeed.  In

the  words  of  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for National Development, if this power  is

vested  in  many Kathis - we know that  they  are  not

paid, and the marriage fees will he handsome - it means

more  business for them. It is not because I have  no

confidence  in the other Kathis here in  this  House,

Mr Speaker. I do not wish to condemn them. But as  I

have said just now, the Kathi is the guardian of  the

Prophet Mohammed on this earth.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member

for  Anson  has said that the Kathi is a guardian  of

the  Prophet Mohammed Who is the true guardian of the

Prophet Mohammed? May I have an explanation, please?



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I have said earlier,

I  am  not well versed in religious matters, but  the

Kathi  is  a  guardian  or a  representative  of  the

Prophet  so far as it concerns marriages between  men

and  women; not, as the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

said,  that  the  Kathi is merely a witness  so  that

anybody can be a Kathi. I can be a Kathi. All  right,

let  me  marry  them. But this is not the  case,  Mr

Speaker. Because, in accordance with Islamic law, the

position of the Kathi is held in high esteem, as  far

as  it affects the solemnisation of marriages between

men and women both of Islamic faith. I have said that

I  am  not well versed in religious matters, but  the

views that I have expressed have been derived from my

contacts  with  people. I do not wish to  condemn  or

criticise  the Kathis, but I have heard  cases  where

some  of  them  have  not fulfilled  their  functions

factually.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



Therefore, we find from the statistics that  divorces

are   prevalent,  because  unscrupulous  persons  are

exploiting  Muslim  women on  the  grounds  that  the

Islamic law permits a man to keep four wives. So this

Government's  intention is to  prevent  Muslim  women

from being further oppressed by unscrupulous persons.

The  moral practice of this law will be felt  not  by

anybody  else  but by our own Muslim  society.  After

having  got the views of those people well versed  in

religious matters, I agree that only one Kathi should

be   given   the   power   to  solemnise   marriages,

irrespective of whether he is the Chief Kathi  or  an

ordinary  Kathi, in the case of persons  who  already

have  wives  in Singapore, because he will  be  in  a

position to carry out a thorough investigation as  to

whether  the person concerned is able to afford  more

than one wife.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker, I am surprised to hear the debate on the

Islamic  law. It is not my intention to criticise  or

to  give  advice, but I hope Members in  this  House,

particularly Members of the Opposition, will be  very

careful  in respect of matters touching on  religion.

We  are not the only people here who can settle  this

matter. As far as the Government is concerned, as has

been  stated  by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for National Development, it is prepared  to

refer   this   Bill  to  a  Select  Committee   where

opportunity  will be given to persons, who  are  more

well   versed   with   such  matters,   and   Islamic

associations to express their views in line with  the

teachings of the religion of Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as Muslims in the true sense of the word, we must be very careful if we wish to take part

in  debates touching on Islam, lest we slip up or  we

go  beyond  the  limit. I have heard the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan  say, during  the  course  of  the

debate, that the Kathi is merely a witness. As I have

said  earlier on, Mr Speaker, it is not my intention

to  criticise  or advise, because I  am  prepared  to

admit that I am not well versed in religious matters.

However, as a responsible Muslim, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



think   the  statement that a Kathi is a  witness  is

complete  distortion. I think the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  has  been misled or has  slipped  up.  The

Kathi is not a witness. He is a person delegated with

powers to solemnise the marriage of a would-be bride.

The  father of the bride delegates his power  to  the

Kathi  who  solemnises the marriage. Aside  from  the

Kathi,  we  need  to  have  persons  to  witness  the

solemnisation of the marriage. As far as I  know,  it

is not a mistake. It is a common thing which is being

practised  when  solemnising  marriages  of   Islamic

people.  The  Kathi  performs the solemnisation  and,

aside  from him, there are two other witnesses.  That

means that the Kathi is not a witness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Mr Speaker, this matter concerns

religion.  The  Government has  repeatedly  given  an

assurance that it is prepared to refer this matter to

a  Select Committee where we will be in a position to

receive  and  hear  reports  submitted  from  Islamic

bodies.   So  we  can  give  a  final  decision,   if

necessary,  should  the Islamic  people  agree  by  a

majority  with  the amendments. I am quite  sure  the

Government will pay heed to any amendment  which  may

be   for   the  good  of  the  people  of  Islam.   I

particularly request Members of the Opposition to let

us finalise this matter in Select Committee.

<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  I  wish to say  a  few  words  on  the

subject.  Just  now the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

said  that  the  Kathi is a witness. I  think  he  is

unable to understand the real position. I got married

when I was young and I remember a Kathi solemnised my

marriage. This means that the Kathi has power  to  do

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the subject of solemnising marriages, I agree completely that the power to do so

should  be  given only to one person,  that  is,  the

Chief Kathi, the reason being that it will mean  that

the  wives will be protected from being oppressed  by

their  husbands who try to make use of them  only  as

playthings. Or maybe because their wives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



are  not beautiful or they are already aged, so they,

only  through lust, try to marry another one.  If  we

appoint   only   one   man  who  can   perform   this

solemnisation ceremony, I am confident that more than

one  marriage will be curtailed or marriages will  be

reduced to a minimum. But, Mr Speaker, if this power

to  solemnise marriages is given to many  Kathis,  as

explained by my colleagues just now, and if one Kathi

refuses  to solemnise a marriage, the matter will  go

from  one Kathi to another until finally the would-be

husband  in  the end succeeds in getting married.  If

this  power  is given to many Kathis in Singapore,  I

feel  that  not only will a man marry more  than  one

wife, but he may also be able to marry four wives, in

accordance   with  the  Islamic  law.  If   this   is

practised,  it  is  no  use for  this  Government  to

administer  the  law in Singapore to  prevent  or  at

least  to reduce such tyrannical acts on the part  of

husbands  towards their wives by marrying  more  than

one  wife.  Mr Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly  with

the sentiments expressed by my colleagues because, in

addition  to  helping  those wives  who  have  become

victims,  we  will be able to prevent  husbands  from

marrying more than one wife.

Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to increase the

revenue  of the Marine and Marine Survey Departments.

The  Merchant  Shipping  Ordinance  contains  certain

provisions  which  are  to  ensure  that  ships   are

properly manned with crews who are fully qualified to

perform  their  functions. In this way efficiency  on

board  ship and safety at sea is preserved. In  order

to  do  so,  it is necessary that crews of  ships  be

examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Department carries out such examinations,

and if those who sit for these examinations so fulfil

the standards required of them, the Marine Department

grants them certificates of competency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Schedule of fees laid down in the

Ordinance   for  these  examinations.  The   Schedule

contains  the  maximum fees that can be  charged  for

these  examinations. As it is now intended  that  the

examination fees should be increased, it is necessary

therefore that this Schedule should also be  revised,

so that new maxima will be laid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other possibility by which the Marine Department

can   levy  fees  is  to  charge  fees  for   matters

transacted at the Shipping Offices, for example, when

shipping companies wish to engage or discharge  crew.

But there also is a Schedule of fees for work carried

out  in  registering the engagement or  discharge  of

ships'  crew. Here, too, it is intended to raise  the

maxima of the fees carried out for this work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, the sum of money collected from these two

Schedules  amounted to $21,191.50. In  1958,  it  was

$28,495.50  and  in  1959, it was $27,729.00.  It  is

estimated that with the revised Schedules, there will

be an increase of $11,700.00 annually.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I would say that there is little profit

made  out of the work carried out in conjunction with

these  examinations and with the work carried out  in

registering crew who are being engaged or discharged.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



(k)  of  section 15 subsection (1) of the Control  of

Ordinance, 1959, which suspended these powers  for  a

period  of  six  months with effect from  24th  July,

1959,  gave  farmers and other occupiers  of  land  a

temporary  respite from eviction in cases  where  the

landlord wishes to recover possession for development

purposes, pending consideration by the Government  of

permanent  legislation to ensure that tenants  to  be

evicted  in  these circumstances in future  are  paid

reasonable  compensation  and/or  are  satisfactorily

settled by the landlord.

opportunity   of  discussing  the  merits   of   this

various stages in the Assembly in the normal way.  In

the  meantime, it is considered desirable to continue

the  temporary protection afforded by the Control  of

Rent (Amendment) Ordinance, 1959, which will lapse on

25th January, 1960.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.58 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe the

operative  words are "to extend for a further  period

of  six  months". When the Minister moved the  Second

reading  of the Control of Rent (Amendment)  Bill  on

16th July, 1959, this is what he said, as reported in

Hansard  of  16th  July,  1959,  at  col.  95,   last

paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, Mr Speaker, it is the intention of Government

to  introduce  at  an early date new  legislation  to

assist  farmers and householders, but definitely  not

illegal squatters of land."



<br><br>And he went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea of the new legislation is to assist legal

farmers    and   legal   householders    to    obtain

compensation, or the offer of a suitable  alternative

site,  when evicted from land required for  so-called

development  purposes. Pending  the  introduction  of

such  legislation which will take some time to draft,

it  is  considered  necessary and desirable  to  make

temporary provisions to suspend for a period  of  six

months   paragraphs  (i)  and  (k)  of  section   15,

subsection (1) of the Control of Rent Ordinance."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not have imagined it to be a very difficult thing for the Minister to have

brought  out this legislation within the six  months'

period which the Assembly gave him. This Assembly has

been faced with a spate of legislation on matters not

quite  as  important as this, and some of  them  have

been taken through all the stages at one sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will remember how

anxious the Minister for Finance was when he made his

Budget  speech that building operations in  Singapore

should  commence  as  rapidly  as  possible  and  how

important it was to encourage the building  trade  to

get  on its feet. I would submit, with respect to the

Minister for National Development, that this  is  not

the way to put the building industry on its feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of encouraging the building

industry  in  Singapore: one is  public  housing  and

public  building,  and the other is  to  let  private

development  carry  on under the  private  sector  of

building. If the Minister takes another six months to

frame this Bill, there will be no building operations

in so far as private development is concerned for the

next  six months, because, unless something  is  done

with respect to this matter, there can be no building

whatsoever  in  so  far  as  private  developers  are

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While appreciating the anxiety of the Minister to

protect  and to assist farmers and other  persons  in

legal occupation of land, I think the Minister should

bear  in  mind the greater interest of Singapore  and

try   to  introduce  this  legislation  as  soon   as

possible.  I  hope that the next six months  will  at

least enable the Minister to give birth to new ideas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, we have given

the  greatest attention to the permanent  legislation

which  we  intend  to bring up in  order  to  protect

farmers.  However, this legislation is most  involved

and we have to study precedents in countries like the

United  Kingdom,  Japan,  India,  Pakistan,  and   in

several  other  countries where the same  problem  of

landlords evicting farmers has arisen. We are  giving

the utmost priority to this legislation and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



are    considering   all   the   repercussions    and

consequences  so that when the Bill eventually  comes

up   for  debate  it  will  be  the  best  piece   of

legislation we have thought of..

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this legislation which we intend to bring up has not much to do with building

operations.  Perhaps the Member for  Farrer  Park  is

worried  about the building companies who had  bought

land long before we suspended paragraphs (i) and  (k)

of  section  15 (1) of the Control of Rent Ordinance.

Such  landlords who had bought land long  before  the

new   law   came  into  being  have  fought  eviction

proceedings because of our six months' suspension. We

have  been  informed, particularly in  the  past  few

weeks, that many legal firms have taken or are trying

to  take  action on behalf of their clients to  evict

farmers, who in most cases are legal tenants  of  the

land,  for  the purpose of building housing  estates.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, we know that this will  cause  a

lot  of  hardship to these poor farmers and  tenants,

and  the legislation which we intend to bring up  has

nothing  much  to  do  with the building  of  private

houses.  We would like persons who are interested  in

building houses for the public to buy vacant land  of

which there is plenty in Singapore. Most of the  land

for  which  eviction orders have been  or  are  being

obtained  are areas near agricultural zones and  they

should be protected in the interests of the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government can assure the House that we shall introduce our intended permanent

legislation  at  the earliest possible  moment.  This

legislation will be given the highest priority.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill repeals the Notaries Public Ordinance,

1958,  which has not been brought into force but  re-enacts  its  main  provisions with the  modifications

which  are  considered  necessary  in  view  of   the

attainment of self-government by Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt that the provision whereby notaries

public  appointed by the Master of Faculties  of  the

Archbishop  of  Canterbury  are  allowed  to  act  as

notaries  public in Singapore is not in keeping  with

the  new  status  of  our State. In  the  past,  such

persons  had  indeed an exclusive  right  to  act  as

notaries public in Singapore, but it is proposed that

in  future  only notaries public appointed under  the

provisions  of  the Ordinance shall  be  entitled  to

exercise   the  functions  of  notaries   public   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the Minister is given a discretion

in  the  appointment  of notaries  public  who  must,

however,  be  practising advocates and solicitors  of

not less than seven years' standing. The Minister may

consult  the Bar Committee but shall not be bound  by

the  recommendations of the Committee. Power is given

to  the  Minister to make rules for the guidance  and

control  of  notaries  public and  to  fix  the  fees

payable by and to notaries public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while welcoming this

Bill,  I  wish  to  bring to  the  attention  of  the

Minister  one  point  that  may  arise  out  of   the

enactment of this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are notaries public practising

in  Singapore who had been appointed to practise here

by  a  source extraneous to the State. When this Bill

comes into operation, Mr Speaker, Sir, by virtue  of

clause 6, such notaries public will immediately cease

to have the right to practise. By virtue of clause 3,

it  might  take some time before persons are entitled

to practise as notaries public under the Bill. Now we

are  a  commercial city and it is very  necessary  to

have  notaries public functioning. The only  point  I

wish  to bring to the notice of the Minister is  that

he  will  not allow a hiatus to occur - that  Singapore

must  not  be  for a period of time without  notaries

public and thereby  cause commercial inconvenience.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member talking on his

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would refer the

Member  for Farrer Park to clause 1 which  says  that

this  Ordinance will come into operation  on  such  a

date  as  the  Minister may by  notification  in  the

Gazette appoint. It is the intention of Government to

bring  this Ordinance into force as soon as possible,

but  everything will depend on the procedure that  we

have to follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions of clause 3

(3), there must be an invitation to the Bar Committee

to  submit  a  list of persons who the Bar  Committee

considers  are suitable for appointment, and  if  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park wants  speedy  action  with

regard to these appointments, I would suggest to  him

that he prods the Bar Committee into early action.

occurs, to insert "or act as".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason for this amendment is

tied  up  really with the amendments I am  moving  to

clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member please read out the

amendments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The amendments read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 26, to leave out "If it shall appear

to the Minister that" and insert "Where",



<br><br>and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 28, after "Court", to insert "or has

been  suspended  from practising as an  advocate  and

solicitor in Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put my point as clearly as I can, it may be

necessary to partially cover my amendments on  clause

5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As clauses 3 and 5 stand, they only provide for a

case  where a person has been struck off the roll  of

advocates  and solicitors of the Supreme  Court.  But

there  is another way whereby a person may be stopped

from  practising temporarily: in other words, he  may

be  suspended. The period of suspension  may  operate

for  as  long as a year or perhaps even two or  three

years.  So  it is for that reason, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that  I  have  sought to introduce this amendment  to

clause 3 (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall be appointed to be or act as a

notary public unless he is a practising advocate  and

solicitor  of the Supreme Court and has so  practised

for not less than seven years."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



It is not a very neat way of doing it, but it was the

only  possible  way I could do it as  the  Bill  now

stands.  So  that  under  the proposed  amendment  no

person  can  act  as  soon  as  he  ceases  to  be  a

practising advocate and solicitor. In other words, by

operation  of the law, he will cease to be  a  notary

public, whereas in clause 5 he might have been struck

off  the roll on 1st February, 1960, but the Minister

might  not gazette under the clause till the 15th  of

February, 1960. So it could well be that this  person

could claim to act as a notary public although he has

ceased  to have the qualification necessary  for  his

acting as a notary public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with that purpose and intent in view, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that I have introduced this  amendment

to clause 3 (2).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the words

proposed  to  be  inserted, be  there  inserted."  As

indicated  by the Member for Farrer Park, the  debate

may range over his proposed amendments to clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would accept it as

there  is  considerable force in what the Member  for

Farrer  Park has just said, but I would like to  draw

his attention to the provisions of clause 3 (1) where

it is clearly stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may, from time to time, appoint fit

and proper persons to be notaries public...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the intention of

Government to appoint anybody to act as notary public

and  the Member for Farrer Park has not suggested any

amendment to clause 3 (1).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has also referred to

amendments which he is proposing to move to clause  5

of  the Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the objection

that  he  has  made  can  be  overcome - I  crave  your

indulgence - under the provisions of Standing Order  56

(2)   which  would  enable  me  to  move  a  drafting

amendment  by  introducing  the  words  "suspend  or"

before the word "revoke" in the 4th line of clause  5

which will then read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Minister shall, by order under his hand,

suspend or revoke the appointment..."

is  not  of a minor or purely drafting character.  It

goes  further than that, because he seeks  to  insert

the words "suspend or" after the word "hand," in line

29  of page 2 of the Bill. He may, of course, proceed

under Standing Order 32 which reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notice shall not be dispensed with in the case of a

motion  or  in  respect of any other  proceeding  for

which  notice is required except with the consent  of

the   Speaker  and  the  general  assent  of  Members

present."



<br><br>So that when we come to the appropriate time, perhaps

the  Minister  would  request  "the  consent  of  the

Speaker and the general assent of Members present".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now still on clause 3. Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the important amendment

from  my point of view is the amendment to clause  5.

If  the  Minister thinks that the amendment  which  I

have  sought to put in in clause 2 is untidy and  not

appropriate, I am quite prepared to withdraw it.  But

the  important  point, from the  practical  point  of

view,  is the amendment to clause 5. Sir, in view  of

that,  can  I have leave to withdraw my amendment  to

clause 3 (2)?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Leave is granted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me, on

reading the clause as it now stands:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it shall appear to the Minister that any person

being a notary public has been struck off the roll of

advocates  and  solicitors of the Supreme  Court  the

Minister  shall, by order under his hand, revoke  the

appointment of such person and shall cause such order

to be published in the Gazette.".



<br><br>that the first comment I have to make is on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it shall appear to the Minister that ...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the time when a person is struck off the

roll  and the time when "it appears to the Minister",

there  might  be  an interval of two,  four  or  five

weeks.  One does not know. So it could well  be  that

the notary public might consider himself entitled  to

practise  as a notary public between the time  he  is

struck off and the time his name is published in  the

Gazette  under the provisions of clause 5.  That  was

the first thing that struck me, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing was that a person ceases to be a

practising advocate and solicitor when, first, he is

struck off the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



roll and, second, he is suspended. For the period  of

his  suspension, he is not entitled to carry  on  the

practice  of  an  advocate and  solicitor.  Clause  5

merely deals with the case of a notary public who has

been  struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors

of the Supreme Court and leaves untouched the case of

a person who has been suspended from practising as an

advocate and solicitor in Singapore. Could this  then

mean that the Minister might not have power to strike

off the person who has been suspended and that he can

only  strike off the person who has been  struck  off

the roll?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the position absolutely clear and

safe, I have moved:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 28, after "Court", to insert "or has

been  suspended  from practising as an  advocate  and

solicitor in Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the marginal note "Misconduct of

notaries  public.", a person can be  struck  off  the

roll  of  advocates and solicitors for  two  reasons.

One,  for  misconduct and, second, where  he  himself

applies to be struck off the roll merely because  he

does  not  want his name kept on it. So it  would  be

unfair  to such a person who has voluntarily  applied

to  have  his name taken off the roll to say that  he

has  committed  misconduct. It is with that  purpose,

Sir,  and  to make the position absolutely safe  from

that point of view that I have suggested the marginal

title  to  read "Revocation of appointments."  rather

than  "Misconduct  of  notaries public.", because  a

notary public can be struck off the roll not only for

misconduct but also because he so wishes it himself.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I might, of course, indicate to hon.

Members that the marginal title of any clause is  not

strictly  part  of  a Bill and, therefore,  it  is  a

question  of  agreement  as to  what  marginal  title

should  be  used. Perhaps the Minister will,  in  due

course,  inform the House whether he agrees that  the

marginal  title should be amended as suggested.  But,

as  I  say, it is not a question for debate. It is  a

question for agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the amendments, it has been moved in

page 2, line 26, to leave out "If it shall appear  to

the  Minister that" and insert "Where". The Question

is,  "That the words proposed to be left out, be left

out,"  and  the  debate  may  range  over  the   next

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say, with

respect, that it would be quite unfair of the  Member

for  Farrer  Park  to  want P.A.P.  Ministers  to  be

omniscient, wherever other Ministers may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the clause requires the Minister

to  do certain acts under certain circumstances,  and

in  order that he might be able to do those acts,  it

is  necessary that he' should have notice, and  quite

clearly  the  words  "If  it  shall  appear  to   the

Minister"  are  important because they indicate  that

the  Minister must have some notice before he is able

to  act. For that reason, I would submit that  it  is

necessary that those words stand part of the clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point which the Member for Farrer Park

has raised, the omission to deal with the suspension

of  practising advocates and solicitors, I  will  now

admit,  Sir, that that was an oversight on  our  part

and I am quite prepared to accept that amendment. But

in  order  to  give  effect to the intention  of  the

second  amendment  which has  been  proposed  by  the

Member for Farrer Park, I think, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

would  have to crave your indulgence and that of  the

Members  of  the  House to agree to  my  moving  now,

without  notice, the insertion of the words  "suspend

or" after the word "hand," in line 4 of clause 5.

note, I am in complete agreement with what the Member

for Farrer Park has said.

he is suspended, then he is -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to close certain

loopholes   which   have  become  apparent   in   the

administration of the Moneylenders Ordinance, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks in clause 2 to prevent loans by

moneylenders  to persons under the age of  twenty-one

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill would have provided that a loan

made  by  a  moneylender whether before or after  the

coming  into operation of the Ordinance shall not  be

enforceable by the moneylender unless he is  licensed

under  the  Ordinance. The intention was to  make  it

clear  that  a  moneylender should  not  be  able  to

recover  a  loan  made by him unless he  is  licensed

under the Ordinance, but as this provision would have

the effect of depriving him of his contractual rights

acquired  before  the coming into  operation  of  the

Ordinance, it has been decided on reconsideration  to

withdraw this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in clause 4 that the mere fact that a

borrower has signed a note or memorandum in which the

amount  of  the  money lent to  or  received  by  the

borrower  is  set out shall not raise any presumption

that the amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



of  money so set out was actually lent to or received

by the borrower. The onus of proving the actual money

lent  to  or received by the borrower will  therefore

remain on the moneylender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides in effect that no

assignment of any debt in respect of money lent by  a

moneylender, whether before or after the coming  into

operation of the Ordinance, shall be valid unless the

moneylender is licensed under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill in clause 6 relating to

the besetting of the residence or place of work of  a

debtor  have  been amended to make it an  offence  to

harass or intimidate the debtor or any member of  the

debtor's  family  at,  or  to  watch  or  beset,  the

residence or place of work of the debtor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to take this opportunity to make it

clear  that  the  Ordinance  only  affects  loans  by

persons who carry on the business of moneylending. It

is  not  meant, for example, to prevent persons  from

occasionally lending out money on mortgages, so  long

as  they do not make it a business to lend out  money

on mortgages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, lines 25 and 26, to leave out "whether

before or".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now that clause 3 is not part of

the  Bill,  I  would  submit,  with  respect  to  the

Minister,  that perhaps the amendment  I  am  seeking

should be acceded to. So long as clause 3 became part

of  the  Bill, then the new subsection (2) of section

29 (clause 5 of



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"No assignment of any debt in respect of

the Bill) should read:

<br><br>money  lent by a moneylender whether before or  after

the coming into operation of this Ordinance shall  be

valid  unless the moneylender is licensed under  this

Ordinance.";'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in view of the fact that a moneylender who has

lent  money previous to the coming into force of this

Ordinance is permitted to sue for that money provided

that   he  does  not  now  carry  on  a  moneylending

business,  I  would  submit, with  respect,  that  he

should  also be allowed to assign his debt without  a

licence; because if the basis for withdrawing  clause

3   was   that  contractual  rights  should  not   be

interfered with, here too, Mr Speaker, Sir, where  a

person is allowed to sue for it without a licence, is

there  any  need  why, before he can  assign  it,  he

should be called upon to take a licence?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that point has been

very carefully considered by Government. Mr Speaker,

Sir,   it   is   necessary  to   prevent   unlicensed

moneylenders  from  assigning  their  debts  incurred

before the coming into operation of the Ordinance, as

otherwise  they  will  assign  their  debts  to   the

registered  moneylenders and leave  the  country.  In

such  cases, it will be difficult for the  debtor  to

give evidence against the unlicensed moneylender. The

moneylender who has made loans before the coming into

force  of  the Moneylenders Ordinance,  1959,  is  at

liberty  to collect old debts even though he  is  not

licensed.  He  may sue in respect of old  debts  even

though  he does not possess a licence. But we do  not

propose  in  any way to allow a further extension  of

that,  because if we did that, nothing would prevent,

say,  an unregistered moneylender from assigning  his

debts   to   a  moneylender  registered   under   the

provisions  of  this  Ordinance and  then  leave  the

country.  In  such a situation, the debtor  would  be

defenceless against the unlicensed moneylender.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while appreciating

that  there is a point in what the Minister has said,

I  do  not  see how an assignment of a  debt  in  the

circumstances  set out by the Minister  would  render

the  person  who  has borrowed the money  defenceless

against  the assignee. If the Minister could convince

me  that  that would be so, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  am

quite  ready to withdraw the amendment. But I  cannot

see how an assignment by an unlicensed moneylender to

a  licensed  moneylender could operate to defeat  the

debtor,  because the assignee would have' no  greater

rights  in the matter than the assignor himself,  and

any  defence  available to the borrower  against  the

assignor would be available to the debtor against the

assignee, the present holder of the note.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for

Farrer  Park  knows, the purpose of the  Moneylenders

Ordinance is to grant the debtors protection  against

unscrupulous moneylenders, and that protection  takes

many forms. One is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



requirement   that   moneylenders  should   register.

Hitherto  they were never required to register.  Even

when  they have registered, there is also the further

protection  to the debtor that in these money-lending

transactions  the debtor can raise  issues  that  are

referred  to in our amendment to section  24  of  the

Ordinance in clause 4. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is always

the  bone  of contention in moneylending transactions

that the debtor has signed for much more than he  has

received. Hitherto, all that the moneylender has  had

to  do was to produce the promissory note, and if the

debtor  had  signed a promissory note for more,  then

his  receipt would preclude him from raising such  an

issue  as  soon as the promissory note was  produced.

But  today,  it will be open to the debtor  to  raise

that as a specific issue against the moneylender;  in

which  case  the moneylender will have to prove  from

evidence  other  than the evidence of the  promissory

note  itself that he has given the debtor the  amount

that  he  claims  to have done. If we  allowed  these

assignments, then the debtor would never be  able  to

raise  these issues against the moneylender  who  has

assigned his rights to the registered moneylender.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I go straight into my speech?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of

introducing this amendment - I will be quite frank with

the Minister - is not to get it on to the statute book,

but  to  initiate a discussion in order that the  air

might  be  cleared and that people in Singapore  will

know  exactly what the position is with regard  to  a

certain type of moneylender, who is not a moneylender

in the accepted sense of the term, but who happens to

lend  money not because he wants to extract  interest

from  somebody else but merely because  he  wants  to

invest  in  moneys  which he might have  received  on

retirement  or by way of legacy or by any  other  way

that  a man receives money. As I understand it, after

the new Moneylenders Ordinance came into force, which

deleted  this  provision from section 2  of  the  old

Moneylenders  Ordinance, there has been  considerable

doubt  as to whether any person lending money on  the

security of a mortgage is a moneylender or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



That doubt has been enhanced by the behaviour of  the

Stamp  Office  in  these mortgages. It  appears,  Mr

Speaker - and I have information on this which  I  have

no  reason  to  doubt - that  when  a  person  takes  a

mortgage deed to the Stamp Office to be stamped,  the

stamping   officer  asks,  "Is  this  a  moneylending

transaction?" With great respect, I do not  see  what

business  it is of the stamping officer to  ask  that

question.  The  business of the Stamp  Office  is  to

stamp  a  document presented to it according  to  the

laws  of  the country and, if the person:  presenting

the  document is late, to exact a penalty if that  is

necessary.  But why any officer in the  Stamp  Office

should want to find out whether a mortgage deed is  a

moneylending transaction or not, I am at  a  loss  to

understand. What is happening is this. The officer in

charge  of the Stamp Office has been saying, "If  you

cannot get a certificate from your solicitor, I  must

have  a  statutory declaration from you that you  are

not  a  moneylender." Mr Speaker, Sir, no  solicitor

would  say  that, in his opinion or to his knowledge,

the  lender is not a moneylender. He cannot give that

certificate because he cannot say. So the person  who

lends  the  money, if he wishes to get  the  document

stamped,  must swear a declaration that he is  not  a

moneylender. He must also say that that  is  not  his

second  or  third transaction because, if it  is  his

second  or  third  transaction,  then  apparently  he

becomes  a moneylender, although in the eyes  of  the

law,  he  might  not  be carrying on  a  moneylending

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if a person retires from

Government or Municipal or any other service, and  if

he  receives,  say, a gratuity or  a  provident  fund

payment of $20,000 or $30,000, what does that  person

do?  He either invests some of his money on mortgages

or he puts it in a business, or he deposits it with a

bank, or he invests it with a pawnbroker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Or he spends it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Or he spends it! Some spend it too. But

the more thrifty ones, who are worthy of support from

the State, are those who wish to invest it. If you go

to  a  pawnbroker  and  give your  money  to  him  on

interest at 8 per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



or  9 per cent, apparently that is not a moneylending

transaction. That is an investment, in  the  eyes  of

the  law.  If  you take it to a bank and  deposit  it

there  at  6  per  cent,  as  some  banks  do,  I  am

told - others  give 3 and 4 per cent -   that  is  not  a

moneylending transaction. That is a laudable thing to

do  and it is called an investment. But if you  would

be  so  foolish as to put your money on an investment

which secures you the return of that money by way  of

a mortgage on an immovable property, the Stamp Office

immediately brands you as a moneylender and will  not

stamp the mortgage deed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to hear the Minister make the

statement that the Moneylenders Ordinance is intended

to   affect   those   persons   whose   business   is

moneylending.  If  I can have the  assurance  of  the

Minister  that  the  sort  of  thing  which  I   have

mentioned just now will not happen again in the Stamp

Office,  that  people  who go  there  to  have  their

documents  stamped will not be harassed  by  stamping

officers, and that stamping officers will merely look

at  the mortgage deed and stamp it according to  what

is  laid down in the law, then I am quite prepared to

withdraw  this amendment, because, in  my  own  view,

persons  who  carry  out such  transactions  are  not

moneylenders; they do not come within  the  ambit  of

the  operation  of this Ordinance.  That  is  only  a

personal  view. But if the Stamp Office is  going  to

make  it  impossible for these people to  have  their

documents  stamped,  then I  think  it  is  time  the

Minister looked into it.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed obliged to

the  Member  for Farrer Park for raising this  matter

this  afternoon. I think there is a great distinction

between moneylending, which is run as a business, and

money  which  is given out on loan, however  frequent

the  transactions may be. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  think

the   Member  for  Farrer  Park  has  overlooked  the

provisions  of  section  23, subsection  (5)  of  the

Ordinance which reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No person who is neither a moneylender nor one of

the  persons  referred to in paragraphs  (a)  to  (e)

inclusive   of   the   definition  of   "moneylender"

contained  in section 2 of this Ordinance  shall,  in

respect of money lent by him, in any case recover  in

excess of the money actually lent by him (whether the

excess  be  claimed by way of interest or  otherwise)

any  sum  greater  than  an amount  equal  to  simple

interest  at the rate of twenty per centum per  annum

on the money actually lent by him.'



<br><br>That  would  cover the case of persons who  lend  out

money  on  mortgages as investments. I am aware,  Mr

Speaker. Sir, of the practice that has been obtaining

in  the Stamp Office. With regard to the stamping  of

promissory notes, it has been brought to my attention

that the officers there have behaved in the way which

the  Member for Farrer Park has said that  they  have

done. I have instructed the State Advocate-General to

inform  these officers that it does not  follow  that

money lent on mortgages is necessarily a moneylending

transaction, because the Ordinance itself requires  a

licence  to be obtained only by a person who  engages

in  the business of money-lending. I thought that the

matter  has since been put right, but in view of  the

representations which the Member for Farrer Park  has

just made in this Assembly, I shall ask the S.A.G. to

issue further instructions to the officers concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I move, "That the

clause be read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this amendment is,

to  some extent, tied up with the amendment moved  by

the  Minister in clause 4. The fact that  a  borrower

has  signed a note or memorandum which complies  with

the provisions of section 16 of this Ordinance and in

which the amount of the money lent to and received by

the borrower is set out shall not of itself raise any

presumption that the amount of money so  set  out  is

actually  lent  to or received by the  borrower.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, by virtue of the provisions of  section

30  of  the  Moneylenders Ordinance, which  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Whenever a promissory note is taken as security

for  any  loan and the borrower is a person who  does

not  understand the English language on such note the

note  shall be attested by an advocate and solicitor,

a  Magistrate, Justice of the Peace, commissioner for

oaths or such other person as may be appointed by the

Minister  generally  for such purpose.  The  attestor

shall explain the terms of the promissory note to the

borrower, and shall certify thereon that the borrower

appeared  to understand the meaning of the same.  The

money  borrowed shall be paid over by the  lender  to

the  borrower  in  the presence of the  attestor  who

shall certify the fact upon the promissory note."



<br><br>So  that  any  note signed by a person who  does  not

understand  the English language or the  language  in

which the note is written -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. My copy of the Ordinance has

"written  language"  on it. I think  the  Member  was

saying the "English language".



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon. It is "written

language".  Now, clause 4, Sir, takes in  all  notes,

that  is,  notes which are understood by  the  person

signing  the  note so far as the written language  is

concerned, and notes which are not understood. In  so

far  as  the  notes  the language  of  which  is  not

understood   by  the  borrower  are  concerned,   the

provisions of section 30 have to be complied with. In

those circumstances, the whole of the transaction  is

done  either  before  an advocate  and  solicitor,  a

Magistrate, a Justice of the Peace, or a commissioner

for  oaths,  or  such other person appointed  by  the

Minister  generally  for such purpose.  So  that  the

provisions  of  section 30 see to it that  everything

that should be done for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



borrower  is  done for him - the money must  be  given,

certification   must  be  made - in  fact,   there   is

absolutely  no room for any slip-up in respect  of  a

person  who does not understand the written  language

on   the   note.  Now  clause  4  takes  in  such   a

transaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, to put it my way, to be a mockery

that,  where the provisions of section 30  have  come

into  operation  in  respect of  a  particular  note,

clause  4  should also come into operation again  and

say  that  that note in itself shall not be  evidence

and the borrower himself may try to upset it. Now, if

that  became  the practice and the law, Mr  Speaker,

then  transactions before a Justice of the  Peace,  a

Magistrate, or a commissioner for oaths, would become

quite meaningless, and the law would be a subject for

ridicule.  That is why I moved the amendment  to  the

effect  that  a  person "who does not understand  the

written language on such note" should be deleted. The

effect  of that, Mr Speaker, will be that all notes,

whether  their language is understood by the borrower

or  not,  shall be treated under section 30 and  they

must   either  be  signed  before  an  advocate   and

solicitor, a Magistrate, a Justice of the Peace, or a

commissioner for oaths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this amendment is accepted, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

will get away from this rather ridiculous position of

the  borrower every now and then, even though he  had

signed  the  note willingly and with full  knowledge,

setting up a defence that he did not know what he was

signing and that he got less than what he signed for.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, you can protect a person up  to  a

point, but beyond that he must fend for himself. I do

not think the law should spoon-feed him too much. The

purpose  of my amendment to section 30, Sir, is  that

once  the provisions of section 30 have been complied

with and the note has been signed and attested either

before  an advocate and solicitor, a Justice  of  the

Peace,  a  Magistrate, a commissioner for  oaths,  or

such  other  person appointed by the Minister,  there

shall  be a finality to the matter and the matter  of

"I  did  not sign it", "I did not receive the  money"

shall  not be raised again; otherwise there shall  be

no end to litigation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say at the

outset  that  it  is an attractive  amendment  as  it

would, I agree, strengthen the law considerably.  But

on the other hand, it would make it necessary for all

promissory notes to be attested. That would certainly

give  more  work  to  lawyers,  and  it  would  incur

additional  cost  to the borrower. For  that  reason,

Sir,  the  Government is not prepared to accept  that

amendment  because this section 30 deals specifically

with  the  attestation of promissory notes where  the

borrower  does  not understand the  language  of  the

note.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure

the  Minister for Labour and Law that no lawyer would

ever  get himself mixed up under section 30; it would

not pay him. Every time he puts his signature to such

a  note, it merely means that he will be called as  a

witness  in  all legal proceedings relating  to  that

note.  And no lawyer, who is worthy of his  name,  is

going  to get mixed up in these transactions.  I  can

assure  him that there will be only very few  lawyers

in  town who will act under the provisions of section

30, unless he is a philanthropist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I raise this amendment to show

that  clause 4, as it stands, will encourage just  as

many unscrupulous borrowers as there are unscrupulous

moneylenders.   There   are  sometimes   unscrupulous

borrowers. They borrow money knowing full  well  that

they  can  take  full advantage of  the  Moneylenders

Ordinance  and  make things difficult for  a  genuine

moneylender. I raise this matter on the  basis  that,

if the Minister acceded to my suggested amendment, it

would put the matter completely beyond doubt and  the

dignity of the law would be maintained, and we  would

not  reach a position where something which had  been

executed  under  section 30 would  be  liable  to  be

challenged  again in Court. And the Judge would  have

to go seriously into the whole question when possibly

a  Magistrate, who is also an Officer of  the  Court,

had  certified it as being correct. It  seems  to  be

rather  a  ridiculous position for  the  law  to  get

itself into.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provisions of

section  30 are normal provisions for the attestation

of  documents where a person who executes a  document

does  not  understand its language. Such attestations

can  be made bona fide and they can also be made mala

fide.  So  it  is always a question  of  fact  as  to

whether there has been proper attestation; so that in

our  view, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is not necessarily

any conflict between the provisions of section 30  of

the  Ordinance and the new subsection (2) to  section

24 that we have introduced this afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not wish to pursue the matter any

further, but it could well be that a person who  gets

his   document  executed  under  section  30  of  the

Ordinance  stands a much better chance  of  defeating

any  objection  raised by the borrower under  section

24, as amended, after this Bill comes into operation.

However, Sir, I have made my point and I wish to draw

the  attention of the Minister to it. I do not  think

there is much point in my pursuing the matter further

since the Minister is not accepting the amendment. In

view of that, Sir, may I be given leave to withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I should think the Member for Farrer

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to bring the law in Singapore

relating  to  libel  and slander,  although  somewhat

belatedly,  in  line with that in the United  Kingdom

and the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the law relating to defamation,

which includes libel and slander, is based ultimately

on  the  Common Law of England. That law grew  up  in

England many years ago and was not entirely suited to

modern  conditions,  with the result  that  statutory

amendments  had to be made to the law  from  time  to

time,  particularly by the Law of  Libel  (Amendment)

Act of 1888 and the Slander of Women Act, 1891. These

statutory amendments were incorporated into  the  law

in  Singapore by the Libel Ordinance, which was first

enacted by Ordinance No. 7 of 1915 and is now Chapter

28  of  the  Revised Edition. In  1952,  the  law  in

England was further amended by the Defamation Act  of

1952. The provisions of this Act have been adopted in

the  Federation of Malaya by the Defamation Ordinance

of  1957, and this Bill seeks to incorporate  in  our

law the provisions of that Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those Members in this House who

are  lawyers will know that the essence of defamation

is to say something to the discredit of somebody else

and  to hold him up to hatred, ridicule, or contempt.

The common lawyers drew a distinction between written

and  spoken  words,  and it was considered  that  one

should  not  treat  spoken words  which  were  spoken

rather  hurriedly  in the same way as  words  written

after  due deliberation. They, therefore, established

the   rule   that,  if  a  person  writes   something

defamatory  of somebody else, that other  person  can

bring  an action without showing that he had actually

suffered  any  damage at all; but if  a  person  says

something  defamatory of somebody  else,  that  other

person can only bring an action for slander if he had

or  could  prove that he had suffered actual  damage,

such as losing a paid employment or losing a valuable

contract. There were certain exceptions to this  rule

even  under the Common Law. For example, to accuse  a

man of a criminal offence was actionable per se, that

is,  without proof of special damage. The Slander  of

Women  Act,  1891,  provided that  words  spoken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



and published which impute unchastity or adultery to  any

woman  or  girl shall not require special  damage  to

render  them  actionable,  and  this  provision   was

incorporated into the law in Singapore by  the  Libel

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill re-enacts this provision of the

law.   In   addition,  the  Bill   incorporates the

amendments made by the Defamation Act of 1952.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides that for the purposes

of  libel  and slander, the broadcasting of words  by

means  of  the radio should be treated as publication

in  a  permanent form, that is to say, it  should  be

treated  as  libel,  and does not  require  proof  of

special damage to be actionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends the law to some extent

with regard to slander spoken of a person in relation

to  his  office,  profession or  calling.  Under  the

Common  Law, a somewhat subtle distinction was  drawn

between those words which were spoken of a person  in

relation  to  his  profession and those  which  would

merely affect his profession. Thus, it has been  held

that  if  a  solicitor is accused  of  dishonesty  in

relation  to  his  clients, he can  bring  an  action

without  proving  that  he has suffered  any  special

damage,  but  if  he  is  accused  of  dishonesty  in

relation  to  somebody else, other than his  clients,

then  he  has  to prove that he has suffered  special

damage. Clause 5 of the Bill now provides that in  an

action for slander in respect of words calculated  to

disparage  the  plaintiff in any office,  profession,

calling, trade or business held or carried on by  him

at  the  time  of the publication, it  shall  not  be

necessary to allege or prove special damage,  whether

or  not the words are spoken of the plaintiff in  the

way  of  his  office, profession, calling,  trade  or

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next change in the law which is proposed in the

Bill  is  in  regard to what is called "unintentional

defamation". There have been a number of decisions in

England which had laid down the law that a person can

be  liable  for libel or slander even  though  he  is

unaware  of the circumstances in which his  statement

was defamatory.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill following the amendment of the law in the

United  Kingdom seeks to provide that it shall  be  a

defence  that  the  defamation was unintentional.  In

such  a case the person can offer to print an apology

and  correction in the same manner as he printed  the

original libel and, if this is accepted, there  would

be  an end of the matter. If it is not accepted,  the

person  can  then  prove  that  the  defamation   was

unintentional  and  in that case he  has  a  complete

defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment proposed by the Bill concerns

the principles of justification. It is a defence to a

civil action for defamation that what is said of  the

plaintiff  is  true. But the law was very  strict  on

this  and  required the person to prove every  single

item of the original defamation. If a person says  of

another man, for example, that he was a murderer  and

that he missed going to church last Sunday, and he is

able to prove that the man was in fact a murderer, he

would still pay damages for saying he had not gone to

church.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to amend the law by

providing that, in an action for libel or slander  in

respect  of  words  containing two or  more  distinct

charges   against  the  plaintiff,   a   defence   of

justification shall not fail by reason only that  the

truth of every charge is not proved if the words  not

proved  to  be  true  do  not materially  injure  the

plaintiff's reputation having regard to the truth  of

the remaining charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment which I need mention is that a

considerable extension has been made to the law  with

regard to the privileges of newspapers. It has always

been a defence to a newspaper that it has published a

fair, accurate and contemporaneous report of judicial

and  some other proceedings. The Bill seeks to extend

these  privileges. Fair, accurate and contemporaneous

accounts of the proceedings of various bodies are now

either   absolutely  privileged  or  else  they   are

privileged subject to this: that the newspaper may be

required  to  print  a reasonable explanation  if  so

requested by the person who claims that he had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



defamed.  The  details  of the  protection  given  to

newspapers are set out in Part I and Part II  of  the

Schedule to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Schedule deals with accurate reporting

from   the   Legislatures  of  Singapore  and   other

Commonwealth      countries,     of     international

organisations and so forth. In these cases  there  is

absolute privilege. It is also provided that  when  a

fair and accurate copy or extract of a register which

is  open  to  the  public is  printed  or  a  notice,

advertisement  or report issued or published  on  the

authority  of any court is published without  malice,

it is privileged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part II of the Schedule are set out the

circumstances in which a fair and accurate report  of

the  proceedings  of various other bodies  formed  in

Malaya  are protected. The privilege, in these  cases

is  limited in that the newspaper may, if required by

the   plaintiff,  have  to  publish  some   form   of

correction  of  any false statement. The  proceedings

which  are  covered by these provisions  include  the

findings  or decisions of any association formed  for

the purpose of promoting or encouraging art, science,

religion  or learning, or formed for the  purpose  of

promoting  the  interests  of  any  trade,  business,

industry  or  profession or persons carrying  on  the

same or engaged in any game, sport or pastime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also assimilates radio broadcasting to

newspapers and gives to radio broadcasters  the  same

defence  vis-a-vis  newspapers  in  respect  of   the

reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to insure against libels is clarified and

the right, hitherto restricted to newspapers, to give

evidence  that  the  plaintiff has already  recovered

damages from someone else in respect of the same or a

similar libel, is extended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is necessary, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  me to deal with the other provisions of the Bill

as  they do not make any substantial changes  in  the

existing law. The provisions are, I venture to  hope,

sufficiently dealt with in the Explanatory  Statement

attached to the Bill.

<br><br>7.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their current campaign against criminals and

secret  society  gangsters,  the  Police  have  found

themselves   hampered  because  they  can   take   no

effective  action against vehicles believed  to  have

been  utilized,  or  intended  to  be  utilized,   in

furtherance  of  criminal activities.  Taxis,  pirate

taxis and private cars are all used from time to time

to  convey criminals, gangsters, vicious weapons  and

spoils  of  thefts  and  robberies.  But  it  is  not

possible,  at  present, to take any effective  action

against  the  owners or the drivers of such  vehicles

unless  it  can be proved that they have participated

in the crime or have abetted it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the present Bill is to enable the

Police  to stop and search any vehicle on the  public

roads  if  they have reasonable grounds for believing

that there may be found in the vehicle any article in

respect of which a scheduled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



offence  to this Bill has been or is being committed.

Where any such article is found either in the vehicle

or  on  any person travelling in it, both the vehicle

and  the  article  may be seized by the  Police  and,

under clause 4 (1) of the Bill, the Court is required

to make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle if

it  is  proved to its satisfaction that  a  scheduled

offence  was  committed  in respect  of  the  article

concerned. At the Committee stage, I shall be  moving

an  amendment, of which I have already given  notice,

that an order for forfeiture of the motor vehicle  by

the  Court  shall be made only on the application  of

the State Advocate-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (2) of the Bill provides that when any

article  in respect of which a scheduled offence  has

been committed and the vehicle containing the article

are found without an apparent owner, both the article

and  the  vehicle  shall  be forfeited  if  no  owner

subsequently appears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 is the penalty clause for contravention of

or non-compliance with the provisions of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that the introduction of this Bill

will   discourage  vehicle  owners  from  using,   or

permitting  the  use  of,  their  cars  for  criminal

purposes. There is little doubt that some car  owners

and owners of pirate taxis have in the past permitted

their  vehicles  to  be used by  criminal  gangsters,

although they were not actually participating in  the

commission of any crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.05 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while sympathising with

the  Minister  for Home Affairs and his Police  Force

who  are being hampered in the suppression of  crime,

merely  because  they have not got  powers  to  seize

vehicles   which  convey  undesirable   persons   and

articles in respect of which scheduled offences  have

been  committed, I would say this, Mr Speaker,  that

this  Bill as framed gives the Police very, very wide

powers indeed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister fondly hopes that because he gives the Police powers to seize vehicles, he is going to solve

the problem of gangsters and undesirable elements  in

the  country. I suppose in the near future  we  might

have  a Bill before the House which says that when  a

pistol or an offensive implement is found in a house,

that  house should also be forfeited to the State.  I

think  we are fast approaching that state of affairs.

We are getting very close to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vehicle is a modern form of conveyance. The next

time  the  Minister might say that because a  man  is

using  his two legs, they shall be forfeited to  him,

because without them, he would not have been able  to

go  to  the  scene of the crime. We are getting  very

close  to  that. It sounds ridiculous.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  if  I  may say so with respect,  this  Bill  is

verging  on the ridiculous. The Police would like  to

be armed with all sorts of powers, and it is for this

House to see whether they should get them. The powers

which they are asking, Sir, are much too wide and  it

is  not  in  keeping  with  the  prevalence  of  such

offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may say so - and I will raise

this  on  another  Bill which is  coming  before  the

House - the  trouble  with  the  present  situation  in

Singapore  is  not  that the  law  does  not  provide

adequate  measures  whereby  the  Police  can   bring

criminals  to book, but that the Police do  not  have

sufficient  resources  to  detect  crime  and  punish

criminals.  Because  they cannot detect  crime,  they

say,  "We want all sorts of powers. We want power  to

seize vehicles. We want power to do this and we  want

power to do that."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I have a number of amendments to move

at   the  Committee  stage,  and  when  moving  those

amendments I shall try to show to the House how  very

serious it will be if the Bill is passed in the  form

in which it is now before the House.

<br><br>7.10 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a typographical emendation:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 7, to leave out from "road" where it

secondly occurs to the end of line 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the object of this amendment is

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (2) reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) as respects any road vehicle being on any road;

or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) upon the overtaking of a road vehicle on any

occasion on which the person driving, or in control

of   the road vehicle has in accordance with  the

provisions of subsection (1) of this section been

required to stop but has failed to do so ...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that sub-clause

(2)  (b)  is totally unnecessary. It will meet  the

case if the clause reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If as respects any road vehicle being on any road

any police officer has reasonable grounds for

suspecting ...",



<br><br>because  sub-clause (2) (b) only refers to  the  case

where  a  vehicle has been required to stop  but  has

failed to do so. That is covered by the case of  sub-clause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



(2)  (a) "as respects any road vehicle being  on  any

road".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it seems to me that sub-clause (2) (b) is

unnecessary and, therefore, I have moved an amendment

to  leave  out  what  I  consider  to  be  completely

unnecessary in the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment

proposed by the Member for Farrer Park would remove a

provision  which makes it clear that a vehicle  which

is  not  stopped  when  required  to  do  so  can  be

overtaken and searched and, therefore, I cannot agree

to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with great respect to

the  Minister, I beg to differ from what he says.  In

fact, any vehicle on any road may be stopped. If I am

going   along  a  road  and  a  police  officer   has

reasonable grounds under clause 3 to stop me, he  may

stop me and I must stop for him to search me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not see why paragraph (b) is necessary

because  paragraph  (a)  takes  in  everything   that

paragraph (b) can do.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  probably  it  revolves  around   the

definition  of  "road" which means that  supposing  a

vehicle has been asked by the Police to stop but that

vehicle  is  not on a road as defined in  this  Bill,

then  obviously  the power of the police  officer  to

search this vehicle is no longer valid, and I presume

paragraph (b) is to cover that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 3 (1) gives the

Police power to stop a vehicle. Clause 3 (1) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person driving, or in control of any road

vehicle  in  motion shall stop the vehicle  on  being

required to do so by any police officer in uniform."



<br><br>That  is  the sub-clause which enables the Police  to

stop a vehicle. Now sub-clause (2) , Mr Speaker, Sir,

is the sub-clause which gives them powers to search a

vehicle  on  reasonable grounds. "If as respects  any

road  vehicle being on any road . . ." therefore must

take in the vehicle which has already been stopped by

virtue of the provisions of clause 3 (1).

provision  which makes it clear that the Police  have

the  powers  to  stop and search a car  which  is  in

motion as well as to search a car which is stationary

on  any  road. There is absolutely no harm in  making

those provisions, Sir.

the same clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me completely unnecessary and unless the

Minister  in charge of this Bill or anybody else  can

say  that sub-clause (2) (b) provides for an occasion

which  sub-clause (2) (a) does not provide for, then,

of  course, there is a need for sub-clause (2) (b) to

exist.  But  if  sub-clause  (2)  (a)  provides   for

everything  that sub-clause (2) (b)  takes  in,  then

what  is the point of sub-clause (2) (b)? Let us have

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 13, after "officer", to insert "in

uniform".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not a drafting amendment.

This is a substantive amendment of sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) enables only a police officer in

uniform to stop a vehicle, whereas sub-clause (2) , as

it  stands in the Bill, gives any police officer  the

power  to  search  a  vehicle if  he  has  reasonable

grounds  for suspecting that there is to be found  in

the  vehicle  any  article  in  respect  of  which  a

scheduled offence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



has  been  or  is  being committed.  I  submit,  with

respect,  that it is imperative, from  the  point  of

view  of this clause, that the person who searches  a

vehicle  should also be a police officer in  uniform,

particularly  when the person who has stopped  it  is

required by law to be in uniform.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

necessary  to  provide  that motor  vehicles  may  be

searched  by  a  police officer  not  in  uniform - for

instance, detectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the person who stops a car must be an

officer  in uniform, but once the driver of a vehicle

refuses  to stop, then any police officer  must  have

the power to overtake the vehicle and search it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to my mind, it is not

an  adequate answer. If the driver does not stop  his

vehicle, I do not see how anybody can search it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, quibbling over

words is quite typical of lawyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean is that if a police officer in uniform

tries  to  stop a vehicle and the driver  refuses  to

stop,  surely any officer on the spot, whether he  is

in  uniform  or not, must have the power to  overtake

the vehicle, stop it and search it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Does the Minister mean that a police

officer  may  stop a vehicle but that  if  he  has  a

couple of detectives standing near him not in uniform

those  detectives  should be enabled  to  search  the

vehicle?  It is more likely, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that

that  is what the Police want in this matter. Because

if anybody fails to obey the law or the behests of  a

police officer, then, of course, he may be chased  by

any  person, and when that person produces  his  card

showing  that  he is a police officer,  then  he  may

arrest  the  person  and different consequences  will

ensue. But here, Sir, we are considering the case  of

a  person who is asked to stop by a police officer in

uniform.  He stops, and then somebody not in  uniform

is  allowed to search him. My question is, why should

that  be  so?  Why should not the police  officer  in

uniform who has stopped him, search him and his car?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I think this clause may be

understood  if  we  are  to  cite  an  example.   For

instance,  if  a plainclothes man or  even  a  police

officer, who normally would be in uniform but because

he was off duty was not in uniform and was on his way

to  some rendezvous in town, should feel that  a  car

which was ahead of him was suspect, it is quite right

that  this  police officer should be  allowed  to  be

given  the authority to stop the car. Because  if  he

were  to  ask the driver to wait so that he could  go

back  home and put on his uniform, then the man would

have got away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is necessary

for me to draw the attention of the Member for Farrer

Park  to  the distinction between sub-clause (1)  and

sub-clause (2) of clause 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop any citizen driving along a road, it would

be  necessary that he be stopped by a police  officer

in  uniform, otherwise he has the right to  disregard

the   instruction  to  stop.  Now  in  the  situation

envisaged  in sub-clause (2), that refers to  a  case

where  somebody in control of a car is  getting  away

from a person who is pursuing him. The person who  is

pursuing him may very well be a police officer who is

not  in  uniform. So all that the police officer  has

got to do is to order the driver to stop his vehicle.

If  the vehicle contains articles in respect of which

a  scheduled  offence has been or is being  committed

and the driver does not stop, then the police officer

would pursue him, stop him and search the vehicle.  I

think that is the essential distinction between  sub-clause (1) and sub-clause (2) of clause 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Supposing the one who

is being chased is afraid that the one chasing him is

a kidnapper, then naturally he will drive faster!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I see the point now. It seems to me that

the  person who is driving a car, unless  he  sees  a

police  officer  in  uniform, might  think  that  the

person  trying  to  stop  him  is  a  kidnapper   and

therefore he is entitled not to stop: whereas once  a

vehicle is stationary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



then a police officer, on identifying himself as a

police officer, could search, be he in uniform or

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of that, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 22, after "therein", to insert

"and".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, to my mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a drafting

amendment and unless the word "and" is inserted,  the

clause  does not seem to make sense as it now stands.

The clause as it now stands, Sir, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where it is proved to the satisfaction of a court

that  any  scheduled offence has  been  committed  in

respect  of any article found in any road vehicle  or

on   any  person  found  therein  seized  under   the

provisions  of subsection (2) of section  3  of  this

Ordinance or that such...".



<br><br>It does not seem to make any sense whatsoever to me.

What is intended I believe, Mr Speaker, Sir, is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where it is proved to the satisfaction of a court

that  any  scheduled offence has  been  committed  in

respect  of any article found in any road vehicle  or

on  any  person [in that road vehicle  and  the  road

vehicle is] seized under the provisions of subsection

(2) of section 3 of this Ordinance...",



<br><br>then the Court shall make an order for the forfeiture

of  the  road vehicle. So that before the  Court  can

make an order for the forfeiture of the road vehicle,

first  of  all,  a scheduled offence must  have  been

committed in respect of an article either in  a  road

vehicle or on the person found in a road vehicle  and

the vehicle must be seized. Without the word "and", I

do not see what "seized" refers to, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Where  a  scheduled  offence has  been  committed  in

respect   of  an  article  found  "and"  seized,   or

something to that effect - without that word "and",  it

does  not  make any sense to me. Perhaps the Minister

might  say  that it does make sense and  I  am  quite

prepared  to listen to him, but as I see  it  at  the

moment,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not see any sense  in

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it may happen that a man concerned

in a scheduled offence has travelled on an omnibus to

or  from the scene of an offence, and under clause 4,

the  Court will have no alternative but to confiscate

the  omnibus. This, I think, may be a bit drastic and

it is for this reason that the amendment is proposed.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see how all

embracing  this  section is. It even takes  into  its

embrace  the big public service vehicles,  which  the

Minister is most anxious to avoid, although that type

of  vehicle comes within the ambit of the section. He

wants  the  State Advocate-General to decide  it  and

nobody  else.  I am at a loss to understand  why  the

amendment  is  being sought. The section  as  it  now

stands is a peremptory one. It makes it obligatory on

the court to confiscate. Once a scheduled offence has

been  committed,  the  court  must  confiscate.   The

Minister now seeks to interpose an application of the

State Advocate-General and he is trying to soften the

blow.  How then is the blow going to be softened?  Is

the  State Advocate-General going to say, "I  do  not

think  Mr  X's car should be confiscated.  He  is  a

decent  enough chap, you know. So let  us  leave  him

out. But, Mr Y, oh, I know he is a crook; so let  us

confiscate his car." Is that what is going  to happen

in   the  State  Advocate-General's  Office?  Is  the

discretion to confiscate or not to be vested with the

State  Advocate-General and not  with  the  court?  I

could  understand if the Minister moves an  amendment

and  says the court may make an order; then  I  would

applaud  him.  But to take the power  away  from  the

court and give it to a Government official I think is

not  the right thing to do; and in any case it is not

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



good  administrative measure to  put  this  amendment

through,  Mr Speaker. The court, on the  application

of  the  State Advocate-General, shall make an order.

How is it going to work in practice? In practice, Mr

Speaker, this is what is going to happen. Most of the

scheduled offences, after the Criminal Procedure Code

(Amendment) Bill has been passed into law, will go to

the  District Court. None of them will go to the High

Court.  In  the District Court, we do not have  Crown

Counsel   prosecuting.   We  have   police   officers

prosecuting.  So  what is going to happen?  A  police

officer  is  going  to prosecute. He  will  obtain  a

conviction  and get the case adjourned in order  that

the  Solicitor-General or a D.P.P. can come down  and

make an application to forfeit the vehicle. Is it not

all  a  waste of time? Particularly when the Minister

for  Law  is so anxious to save his very few precious

legal  officers?  Are we not really making  work  for

ourselves?  Are  we not really making life  difficult

for  everybody  concerned? Why do  we  not  give  the

discretion to the Court? It is so much simpler.

to  introduce.  He  knows very well  that  under  the

revenue  Ordinances, any vehicle  in  which  dutiable

liquor or dutiable tobacco is found is forfeited.  An

order  of  forfeiture is then made automatically.  In

the  case  of radios, if I have a radio set which  is

unlicensed, and if that is detected and I am  brought

do  damage to people like the Member for Farrer Park.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am well aware that

under   the  Customs  Ordinance,  the  courts   shall

forfeit.  Thai  is a very exceptional Ordinance.  The

Customs  Ordinance  provides for forfeiture,  because

revenue  is  an  important matter to the  State,  and

anything used to avoid earning revenue for the  State

is  a subject matter for forfeiture, not only in this

country,  but also in every other civilised  country.

In  those circumstances, it is forgivable because the

State must protect its revenue and any object used in

the evasion of State revenue should be forfeited. But

the  position  here  is  quite  different.  This  has

nothing to do with State revenue. It is a matter, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, which affects every citizen  in  every

walk  of  life. I might have a car. I  might  have  a

driver.  I send him home. He picks up a friend.  That

and  he  parked it somewhere, and he did not  have  a

driver,  then, Mr Speaker, Sir, somebody could  hide

in  his  car  with a dangerous weapon. If the  police

arrested  that person in his car, his  car  would  be

finished - Deputy Prime Minister or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I am surprised to find that

the  Member for Farrer Park is so interested  in  the

Government's ability to collect revenue. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think the Member for Farrer Park will  agree

with  me that, unless you have peace, order and  good

government, there is no question of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



State  collecting  any revenue from  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park.  So it is very necessary that  we  have

these  provisions. The Member for Farrer  Park  knows

that such provisions are not new provisions. They are

scattered  right  throughout  our  law.  He  has  put

forward  the  case of some innocent  person,  with  a

missile in his pocket, being suddenly detained by the

police  in  a  car and that car is forfeited - spirited

away under the provisions of this Ordinance. Now,  to

prevent  that  sort of thing, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

State Advocate-General has advised that we make  this

amendment,  that after the word "court", we  say  "on

the  application of the State Advocate-General"  that

the  vehicle should be forfeited. The State Advocate-General   is   the  person  who  is  in   charge   of

prosecutions.  He  reads carefully  through  all  the

investigation papers that he and his officers receive

and he knows that, in fact, in a case such as the one

which the Member for Farrer Park has just put to this

House,  it will be stupid to forfeit the vehicle  and

for that reason this amendment has been proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I entirely agree with

the  Minister that this section could result in a lot

of  stupidity.  But  the Minister suggests  that  the

stupidity  should be relieved in the State  Advocate-General's Office. I am saying that it should  not  be

relieved there. Let it go to court, and let the court

decide  it. Why should the State Advocate-General  be

called  upon to perform judicial functions  affecting

property?  Why should he have the power  of  deciding

whether  a man should be allowed to have his  car  or

not?  He  is a law officer, so let him not administer

the  law. On the question whether a piece of property

should   be  forfeited  or  not,  we  have   adequate

machinery  in  this country to deal with it - machinery

which the citizens respect and trust - the courts.  Let

us  leave the courts to decide such issues,  not  the

State Advocate-General. In this Bill, as soon as  the

State Advocate-General says, "I think this car should

be forfeited," the judge has absolutely no option. Is

it right and fair that a law officer should hold this

whip  over the courts? Why not let the courts  decide

it?

Farrer  Park  is  aware  of  the  practice  in  these

matters.  Under the revenue Ordinances, the  vehicles

are  forfeited, and the court has no discretion  with

regard  to  forfeiture. If an aggrieved  person  felt

that  his  vehicle  was forfeited  unjustifiably,  he

still  had  his redress. He could, in the past,  seek

redress  by  way  of  petition  to  the  Governor-in-Council. Today, he can still petition the Cabinet. He

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will now read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the court on the application of the State Advocate-General may make an order for the forfeiture of the

road vehicle."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While agreeing with the Minister for Home Affairs

that the police must be given wide powers of seizure,

I  think  any system of justice should see that  the'

balance is held equally between the police, the State

and the private individual. The judiciary is there to

see that that happens. We have an extremely efficient

judiciary,  and these are matters best  left  to  the

judiciary who can then have an impartial inquiry into

the  circumstances in which the offending weapon  was

found  in the car, or the offending person was  found

in  the car. If the court is satisfied that the owner

of  the vehicle had absolutely nothing to do with  it

or  had not connived in it in any way, then the court

would  say that this is one of those cases where  the

vehicle should be returned to the owner. Does anybody

say that no cases of injustice might arise under this

section? If the Minister concedes that some cases  of

injustice  might arise, then I think he must  concede

the  proposition  that an impartial inquiry  must  be

instituted in order that those cases might be given a

full  hearing.  The  purpose of this  amendment,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is to give the court art opportunity to

go  into  the  matter  and then  decide  whether  the

article should be forfeited or not.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said

just now, the law, to be effective, must provide that

the  forfeiture  should be mandatory. This  amendment

would make my previous amendment meaningless. In the

circumstances, I cannot accept it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 32, to leave out "apparent".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, clause 4 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any article in respect of which a scheduled offence

has  been  committed and any road vehicle  containing

the  same  which are found without an apparent  owner

and  for  which  no owner appears after  such  notice

given as to a court seems fit shall be forfeited."



<br><br>The  words  "an  apparent  owner"  are  intended   to

qualify, Mr Speaker, any article in respect of which

a  scheduled offence has been committed and also  any

road  vehicle  containing the same  which  are  found

without  an  apparent  owner.  In  other  words,  the

apparent owner relates both to the article and to the

road  vehicle.  I would submit, with respect  to  the

Minister, that although an article may be without  an

apparent owner, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



road  vehicle cannot be without an apparent owner.  A

road  vehicle always has a registered owner.  He  may

not be the true owner, but he is still the registered

owner.  Sir,  in  view of that,  I  think  the  words

"apparent  owner" in reference to a road vehicle  are

quite meaningless.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

"without  an  apparent  owner" means,  for  instance,

without  an  owner  on  the  spot.  For  example,  an

abandoned car or an abandoned article. A car  may  be

abandoned, and although it has a registered owner, he

is not there at that time on that spot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister saying

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the words "all offences under" be deleted from

sub-paragraph (a) of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are redundant as, in the opening words

of  the paragraph, there have already been references

provisions".
