Government,  and resolve all existing differences

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That the words

proposed  to  be  added,  be  there  added."  As  I

indicated yesterday, the debate can range over  the

whole of the Address as well as the amendment.  The

Member for Bras Basah had the Floor.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

the   Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara  has  stated   very

accurately  that  our life is now  interwoven  with

that  of  Malaysia, we cannot be effective, however

successful we may be in the Malaysian scene, if  we

confine  ourselves to Singapore. There must  be  an

inter-flow of political ideas and politicians among

the territories in Malaysia. Federation politicians

have  sought to spread their activities  and  their

views  in  Singapore. It is only proper and  indeed

desirable  that  political ideas  originating  from

Singapore should have its impact over the whole  of

Malaysia.   The   flow  of  political   ideas   and

politicians  from  Singapore  has  not   moved   as

smoothly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



and  as  quickly as some of us might have hoped.  I

think  I  can  say  for  all  the  politicians   in

Singapore  that  their desire to have  their  views

spread  over  a  greater area has been  impeded  by

unnatural   forces.  It  is  my  hope   that   this

Government will do all it can to convince the  seat

of  authority in Kuala Lumpur that if democracy  in

this  vast  area  of  Malaysia is  to  survive  and

prosper,  there  must be a free flow  of  political

ideas and politicians throughout this territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that democracy depends to a large

extent on the existence of a free democratic  trade

union  movement. In Singapore we are  fortunate  to

have  a free, virile, democratic and, above all,  a

patriotic  trade union movement. This  trade  union

movement  of Singapore has shown and proved  itself

in  the  past  few  years that it can  contain  and

conscribe political adventurers seeking to use  the

trade  union  movement for anti-national  purposes.

With  this  experience behind it, the  trade  union

movement in Singapore is certainly in a position to

assist  trade union movements elsewhere in Malaysia

in  the fight against Communist elements posing  as

trade unionists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All round the trade industrial front in Singapore,

the democratic trade Union movement represented  by

the   National  Trade  Union  Congress   has   made

significant  progress. It has indeed been,  as  His

Excellency  said,  a  large-scale  eradication   of

industrial  discontent and unrest on the  basis  of

industrial   peace  with  justice.  The  Industrial

Relations Ordinance was made law in 1959.  In  1960

the  Industrial  Arbitration Court made  its  first

impact. Nevertheless, experience over the years has

shown  that  it  has  certain undesirable  features

which  are  needy  of attention. The  most  glaring

example  is the constant violation by employers  of

section 77 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance. A

number  of  employers in Singapore still  retain  a

colonial  approach  in  industrial  relations  with

their  employees.  They  still  think  that  labour

should  be  docile and should not be organised.  At

the very first indication of attempts by workers to

organise,  these  employers  seek  to  destroy  the

workers'  unity by wanton dismissal. The Industrial

Relations Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



provides   specifically  for  penalties  for   such

conduct.  But today, for one reason or another,  no

employer  has yet been prosecuted under section  77

of  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance. It may  be

that   the   machinery  for  such  prosecution   is

inadequate. It may be that the wording  of  section

77  makes  it difficult for successful prosecution.

But  the  Government should try to improve  on  the

machinery of, or to amend, the Industrial Relations

Ordinance  to  speedily  mete  out  punishment   to

employers who flout the spirit of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter is of the utmost importance and

urgency.  We in the trade union movement have  been

co-operating with the Government in its  policy  of

industrial peace with justice. The justice that  is

reposed  in the industrial system, this justice  we

hope to find through the Courts. If the trade union

movement  finds that it cannot obtain this  justice

through the institutions of law, then it cannot  be

blamed if it seeks justice elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years a number of employers

appear   to  have  escaped  scot-free  with   their

violation  of the law. This violation has  done  no

good  to  the  employers themselves, to  the  trade

union  movement, and to society. I  therefore  call

upon  the Government to take urgent positive  steps

to  rectify  the  situation which,  if  allowed  to

continue,  will cause the very foundations  of  our

democratic society to sink.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for

Tampines  described Mr Devan Nair and the N.T.U.C.

as  stooges of the P.A.P. Well, nobody could expect

pro-Communist  elements to  make  friendly  remarks

about  those who have trounced them in  the  battle

for  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  workers   of

Singapore. Workers do not support stooges, and this

is  the  reason  why the stooges of the  Indonesian

confrontationists daily continue  to  lose  support

from  the workers of Singapore. Mr Devan Nair  was

once with the Communists, and he is not ashamed  of

the  reason which led him to join them. But  he  is

also  not  ashamed either of the reasons which  led

him  to leave the Communist fold, for he discovered

that far from fighting for the real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



interests  of the workers the Communists were  only

interested  in  exploiting them  for  anti-national

political  purposes. There is an honourable  and  a

dishonourable  way of breaking with  your  friends.

Mr  Nair  did not crack up in prison and come  out

after making penitential statements. Unlike certain

other  persons,  he never squealed  to  the  police

against his friends. But what Mr Devan Nair did is

public  knowledge. He openly and  publicly  took  a

stand  against the Communists who betray the  cause

of  Malayan socialism by acting as fifth columnists

for  foreign powers. The workers of Singapore  know

that   had  it  not  been  for  Mr  Devan   Nair's

determined stand against the Communists, they would

now  have  been  prisoners of the  friends  of  the

Indonesian   confrontationists.  The   workers   of

Singapore  also know that Mr Nair has  contributed

more  to  trade  unionism than all  the  Woodhulls,

Puthuchearys  and Lim Shee Pings put together.  The

Communists and their friends cannot be expected  to

understand the democratic concept of trade unionism

which  is  the  basis of the N.T.U.C.  They  cannot

understand why the N.T.U.C. supports the Government

on   all  fundamental,  political  and  ideological

issues.  We  are  functionally independent  of  the

Government.  They  cannot  understand  why  it   is

possible for the postmen of Singapore to give  full

support  to democracy and to Malaysia. It  is  also

possible  for the Singapore workers to take  strike

action   against  the  Government.   The   N.T.U.C.

supported  the  strike by the  Public  Daily  Rated

Employees Union in 1961 against the Government.  It

also  supported  the nurses and the  police  clerks

when they went on strike. Recently employees of the

Postal  and Telecommunications Department  went  on

strike and we were fully behind them. But all these

thousands  of workers are beyond the reach  of  the

Communists  simply  because  they  know  that   the

Government respects the democratic concept of trade

unionism  on which they are based. The  Member  for

Tampines is too ignorant of democracy to appreciate

that if the P.A.P. were an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



anti-labour  Government, then  police  clerks,  for

instance,  would  never have been  able  to  go  on

strike.  Does  he  believe, for instance,  that  in

Communist  countries  police  personnel  would   be

allowed to go on strike? Does he even believe  that

his  Indonesian  friends would allow  their  police

personnel  to  go on strike? However, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, it is not my purpose to educate pro-Communists

because  they  are beyond the reach  of  education.

There is no more uneducable person than a Communist

with  a  closed mind. We on this side of the  House

are  more  interested in educating  the  public  of

Singapore in the mechanics of democracy and in  the

fact  that  only in an open democratic society  can

the  real  freedom of the trade union  movement  be

protected. I invite the Member for Tampines to look

with  unprejudiced eyes, if that is not beyond  his

capacity, at all our neighbouring territories,  and

I  will give him a medal if he can show any country

in  South-East Asia which has labour legislation as

advanced   and  as  progressive  as  we   have   in

Singapore. His real complaint is not that  we  have

reactionary labour laws but that we do not love the

Communists. We do not intend to betray the  workers

of Singapore by allowing them to be swallowed up by

the  fifth  columnists of foreign powers.  On  that

there will be no compromise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me warn the pro-Communist

elements in the trade union movement that we in the

N.T.U.C. are out to succeed. We will  expose  them

whenever  and  wherever they  turn  up  their  ugly

faces. I can promise them that we regard it, in the

words   of   Mr  Khrushchev,  as  "our  historical

responsibility  to bury them." This  is  inevitable

and  the  Member for Tampines and others  like  him

should  appreciate the fact that it is historically

inevitable  that in Malaysia the proponents  of  an

open  democratic  society  will  triumph  over  the

Communists  and  their anti-national  allies.  They

will  not  win  as  long as we are  on  this  field

because  we  will  meet intelligence  with  greater

intelligence; vigour and dedication with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



greater  vigour and dedication; determination  with

even  greater  determination. But it  is  time  the

Communists  must  realise that in dealing  with  us

they  are  not dealing with reactionaries but  with

people  who are dedicated to the ideal of  a  free,

democratic non-Communist and socialist Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Indonesia's  trade boycott has created an  economic

crisis  of  the  first magnitude  unprecedented  in

Singapore  and  it has overshadowed all  our  other

problems.  It  is, therefore, on this issue,  which

surpasses  all  other  issues,  that  is,  on   the

consequence  of Indonesia's economic confrontation,

that I wish to take today's opportunity to draw the

attention  of the Government and of this  Assembly.

This is a problem to which the Government must give

its   full   attention  and  seek  a   satisfactory

solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 22nd September a crippling stroke has

gripped  this island's economy and its 1.8  million

people.  Since the days of Stamford Raffles  people

can only gauge the influence of Indonesian trade on

Singapore's   economy.  Even  under  the   Japanese

occupation  trade  never  ceased  to  flow  between

Singapore and Indonesia. Now for the first time for

many  centuries  there is a complete  severance  of

trade  between these two territories. The  blow  to

Singapore's economy is indeed devastating.  Whether

we  like it or not, the Singapore cow has been  too

dependent on Indonesia's pastures. The great wealth

of   Indonesia   has  for  centuries,  ceaselessly,

effortlessly  and unconsciously flowed  through  to

Singapore,  which is one of the greatest  ports  of

the world. But on the 22nd of September this wealth

stopped to flow. Singapore has no other pastures to

turn  to  and  is now experiencing a slow  economic

death. The question in the minds of the people  is,

will  the  great  entrepot of Singapore  be  doomed

forever? What will Singapore's future fortunes  be?

Since   the  great  depression  of  1929  to  1932,

Singapore  has  never  suffered  in  peace  time  a

greater blow to her economy. There never has been a

greater  number  of  unemployed  people,  and  this

figure is steadily increasing. Traffic on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



the Singapore River, which has been called the

life-blood  of  Singapore's commerce and  industry,  has

come to a standstill. Telok Ayer Street, the centre

of  high-level Indonesia trade, is almost deserted,

except  for  unemployed stevedores and  workers  in

dark  blue  Chinese uniforms squatting with  silent

faces  cursing  the Government, no money  to  drink

even  coffee  and  reminisce  over  the  past.  The

merchants  in the city are assessing their  losses;

their    debts   in   Indonesia;   their   property

confiscated; their future; their bank overdraft  as

31st  December  approaches at a faster  speed  than

usual.  But, Sir, on these matters, they are unable

to  come to any definite conclusion. I do not  wish

to  argue with the Government whether 8 per cent or

80  per cent of the business, or the people, or  of

the  national  income or the economy  is  affected;

whether it is 8,000 people or 80,000 people who are

unemployed  as  a  result  of  Indonesian  economic

confrontation. This type of argument  leads  to  no

useful purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to give a broad picture I have formed of

the  outcome  of Indonesia's economic confrontation

and  put forward certain more constructive measures

for  Government's consideration. In  the  paramount

interest of Singapore and for the salvation of  our

economy  from  complete  wreck,  let  us  use  this

Assembly to find a solution. Telok Ayer Street  and

the  streets around it are the heart of Singapore's

trade  and  commerce, particularly with  Indonesia.

The raw materials and goods that flow in and out of

the  Singapore  River  is  the  blood  which  flows

through the main artery, the Singapore River, which

feeds  most  of Singapore's population. Telok  Ayer

Street and the streets bordering it, together  with

the Singapore River, are a barometer of Singapore's

prosperity.  Now  the twakows and the  motor  boats

which  used to shuttle in and out of the  Singapore

River  have been left idle for nearly three months.

If  the  Indonesia/Singapore trade relation is  not

normalised soon, these twakows will sink  into  the

Singapore  River  one after the  other  from  sheer

inability to maintain them. The hundreds  of  ships

on  the Indonesian run are scattered throughout the

whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



sea   front.  There  has  never  been   a   greater

conglomeration of ships in Singapore lying idle  at

any one time waiting for the tide and the barnacles

to  take its toll. If things do not improve,  these

ships would later be sold as scrap to meet the same

fate  as  the  Dutch  ships which  fled  away  from

Indonesian   confiscation  and  were  anchored   in

Singapore  several years ago. The Chinese tongkangs

or  sailing  junks  anchored at the  mouth  of  the

Kallang  River  are equally idle  and  as  many  in

numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody can deny that trade and commerce in

Singapore  has been drastically curtailed,  fatally

hit.   Nearly  all  businesses  in  Singapore   are

affected directly or indirectly by the interruption

of trade with Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is the factory of Indonesia's raw

materials and the warehouse of Indonesia's imports.

Singapore's imports to and exports from the  United

Kingdom,  the  United States,  Japan,  Germany  and

other countries, in the overwhelming bulk, are only

an  extension of trade with Indonesia. If Indonesia

does not ship her raw materials to Singapore to  be

processed  and  re-exported to the markets  of  the

world  from  here,  the value of exports  to  other

foreign   countries  compiled  by  the   Statistics

Department  would  be correspondingly  reduced.  If

Indonesia  does  not  buy  a  substantial  bulk  of

imports of textiles, food and other consumer  goods

from  Singapore,  the volume of  imports  of  these

commodities   from  the  country  of  origin   into

Singapore  would  also be correspondingly  reduced.

The  value of Indonesian trade cannot therefore  be

measured  in  terms  of  figures  compiled  by  the

Department  of Statistics, because, Sir, Indonesian

trade  is  unique. It is different from trade  with

Japan,  the United States or the United Kingdom  or

any  other  foreign  countries.  Trade  with  these

countries  does not create employment in Singapore.

If   Japan  refuses  to  sell  us  her  radios  and

transistors,  Singapore can  buy  them  from  other

countries   without   making  any   difference   to

Singapore's  national  income  or  the   level   of

employment.  If any country refuses to  buy  rubber

from  Singapore, it can be sold to other countries.

Trade with other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



countries  creates little employment in  Singapore.

Trade   with   Indonesia  is,  however,  completely

different.  Indonesia  not  merely  sends  her  raw

materials  to  Singapore for  re-exporting  abroad,

they are sent here for processing, grading, packing

and  in  some cases manufactured into new  products

before  re-export. Singapore is Indonesia's factory

and  Indonesia's warehouse. It is due to this  fact

that Indonesian trade has created so many jobs  and

such  a  huge volume of employment. It is not  only

the  quantity  but also the quality  of  Indonesian

trade   that   requires  our  attention.   In   full

recognition  of  the  value  of  Indonesian   trade

towards  maintaining Singapore's economy, Singapore

cannot  help  but  maintain friendly  relationships

with  Indonesia. This is different from  advocating

merger  with  Indonesia.  Singapore  cannot  afford

enmity  with all her neighbours, particularly  with

Indonesia.  Indonesia  is  Singapore's  number  one

exporter  and  importer.  But,  Sir,  it   is   the

multiplier  effect  of Indonesian  trade  that  can

either  make  Singapore prosperous or  can  destroy

Singapore.  One dollar of Indonesian trade  creates

far  more  employment than many tens of dollars  of

trade  with  other countries. One ton of Indonesian

rubber  imported can create jobs for tens of people

in  Singapore. Indonesian raw materials require  so

much processing, grading and repacking before being

re-exported, and it is this which creates the jobs.

Due  to  Singapore's competitive market,  a  stable

currency,  good  banking and  shipping  facilities,

foreign  countries for centuries have preferred  to

buy  Indonesian raw materials from Singapore  at  a

slightly higher premium. It is difficult to  assess

the  effect of severance of Indonesian trade on our

national  income.  After taking into  consideration

the  multiplier  effect, and based on  the  figures

compiled by the Statistics Department which are far

below  the real volume of Indonesian trade,  it  is

safe  to  assume  that Singapore's national  income

would  drop  by more than 50 per cent  if  economic

confrontation were to continue for a  year  and  if

Government did not increase its public spending ---

Fifty?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> 50. Statistics compiled by

Government   are   based   on   official    Customs

declarations.  In  the case of trade  with  foreign

countries  when  there are normal foreign  exchange

conditions,  the value of imports  and  exports  in

Customs declaration forms is fairly accurate.  With

Indonesia, however, the situation is different. Due

to  Indonesia's foreign exchange controls  and  the

imposition  of  quotas  on imports,  the  value  of

imports  and  exports  declared  to  the  Singapore

Customs authorities is far below the real value. In

addition,  a  substantial bulk of  the  trade  with

Indonesia  never passes through the  Customs.  This

odd  situation  has  arisen because  of  the  great

difference between the official rate of exchange of

the  rupiah  and its black market rate.  Indonesian

merchants exporting raw materials to Singapore,  or

for that matter any other foreign country, have  to

remit  back to Indonesia the proceeds of  the  sale

through  the  official rate of  exchange.  If  they

remit  the  full  value back through  the  official

exchange, they will lose heavily and no trade  will

follow. Indonesian exporters, therefore, must  seek

to  reduce  the value of their exports declared  to

the  Indonesian authorities so that only the  value

declared  has  to  be  remitted  back  through  the

official  exchange, and the balance of the proceeds

could  be sent back to Indonesia through the  black

market yielding many more rupiahs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of imports, Indonesian merchants are

required  to obtain import quotas which are  rather

difficult   to   get.  To  enable  import   quotas,

therefore,  to  go  a longer way  than  the  amount

stated,  Indonesian importers have to underestimate

the  value  of their imports. This will  also  save

them  from  the  high  import  taxes.  This  under-estimation of import and export values on the  part

of  Indonesian merchants is reflected in  Singapore

Customs  declaration forms. Since  Singapore  is  a

free  port the Singapore Customs are not particular

about  the value or the quantity of goods declared.

In   addition,  the  goods  bought  and  sold   via

tongkangs by visitors from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia,  the 1,000 runners who ply  piece  goods

and  luxury or semi-luxury goods between  Singapore

and  Indonesia are seldom declared. It is therefore

wrong  to  depend  too much on statistics  compiled

from  Customs forms as far as Indonesian  trade  is

concerned.  We  should not be like  ostriches,  but

must  be  prepared  to  face  the  consequence   of

economic confrontation boldly and to recognise that

the  Indonesian  trade  has  been  the  cradle   of

Singapore's  past  prosperity.  Singapore  is   now

experiencing this economic blackout. It is  no  use

comforting  ourselves that Indonesia  is  suffering

more  than we do. Even if it were true, it  is  not

going  to  help  us. It offers us  no  consolation.

Indonesia is basically an agrarian economy in which

plenty  of  natural resources, trade  and  currency

play a little part. Singapore with no land mass and

hardly any natural resources depends solely on  her

entrepot  trade. Cuba can stand the United  States'

economic confrontation, but Singapore, only a  tiny

island,   cannot  withstand  Indonesia's   economic

confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is really very serious. The

merchants who were promised a second New  York  and

the  laying  of golden goose eggs in Singapore  are

now  feeling  frustrated and bitter. Many  of  them

have  lost  heavily  in the past  two  and  a  half

months.  Some firms have closed down and many  more

will close down on the 31st of December or near the

Chinese  New Year. Staff will be retrenched.  These

merchants  cannot collect back their trading  debts

from  businessmen in Indonesia. On the other  hand,

the  banks here will soon be pressing them for  the

payment of their overdrafts. Many of them have  had

stocks,  shops, ships, factories and properties  in

Indonesia confiscated or soon to be confiscated  by

the Indonesian authorities. Nearly 400 rubber mills

and rubber smoking houses have been confiscated  or

will  be  confiscated.  Thousands  of  millions  of

dollars  of  wealth will be gone.  These  merchants

after  years of hard work face economic  damnation.

And the promise of future wealth in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



Jurong  does not appeal to them because  it  cannot

solve their immediate problems. As traders they are

not  experienced in industry. Many of them  now  do

not  want  to invest their capital in any industry.

They have little confidence that it is possible  to

industrialise Singapore unless Indonesian  economic

confrontation is settled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am doubtful, Sir, whether the Government

realises  the gravity of the situation because  the

Government  is repeating over and over  again  that

the  loss is only 8 per cent. There are few  trades

and  occupations  in  Singapore  not  affected   by

Indonesia's economic boycott. It all depends on how

long   this  confrontation  lasts.  In   the   last

analysis,   everybody   will   be   affected.    If

confrontation  lasts  for  a  longer  period   even

certain categories of Government employees will  be

affected because the Government will have no  money

to pay their salaries. Singapore being reduced to a

mere  skeleton  of its prosperous  past  would  not

require so many civil servants. Singapore will  not

be  the New York of Malaysia. Singapore would  then

become the expendable appendix of Malaysia.  It  is

safe  to  say  that  six months  after  Indonesia's

economic  confrontation, 80 per cent of the  people

and  80  per  cent  of all trades,  businesses  and

occupations  will  be  affected.  The  effects   of

Indonesian  economic  boycott would  surge  forward

like waves. Those who received instant effects were

those  on the 22nd of September - the twakow  owners

and  the  workers, the shipowners and the  sailors,

fishing boats fishing in Indonesian waters ---

attendants and nearly a thousand runners who  carry

piece   goods  and  luxury  goods,  the   tongkangs

carrying  charcoal, firewood and timber  logs,  the

thousands  and thousands of waterfront workers  and

sundry  labourers.  These people  were  immediately

affected  on the 22nd of September. The next  batch

affected are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



factory  owners  and the workers and  traders  with

Indonesia.  For the factory owners, the  supply  of

all  raw  materials has stopped. Depending  on  how

much stock is left the factories and the warehouses

are  now stopping work one after the other. For the

traders, business stopped on the 22nd of September,

1963.  It  is only a matter of time that one  after

the other will close down and the staff retrenched.

Indonesia's   economic   confrontation   has    hit

Singapore's economy like a ton of bricks. The whole

economy  is  now  being paralysed.  Promises  of  a

prosperous  Jurong  will not  help  to  remedy  the

situation.  More  positive action  is  required  to

neutralise the catastrophe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is estimated that more than 30,000 people

are  already  unemployed as a result of Indonesia's

economic  confrontation. The figure  is  increasing

day by day. Many shops and firms will close down on

the  31st of December. By Chinese New Year it  will

increase at an even faster rate. When this is added

to  the  big pool of people already unemployed  and

the  large  number of students who  are  graduating

from the secondary schools and the universities  to

find  jobs, Singapore faces the biggest  number  of

unemployed  people in her history. It is  far  more

difficult to estimate the number of people who will

be  indirectly  affected by  the  Indonesian  trade

boycott. The biggest number of people unemployed in

any  trade as a result of confrontation comes  from

the rubber industry. The import of low-grade rubber

from  Indonesia gives jobs to nearly 10,000 workers

directly   engaged  in  processing,   grading   and

packing,  and indirect employment to many  tens  of

thousands of people. Some rubber mills have  closed

down. Others are now working on the average of  two

days  a week and when old stocks are finished,  all

will  close down. Many allied firms, shops, closely

dependent on the rubber industry will also have  to

close down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that nearly 4,000 workers, mostly

female workers, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



were engaged before confrontation in the grading of

coffee  beans  imported from Indonesia,  have  lost

their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly 1,000 workers in the sago factories will

become jobless very soon. Some sago factories  have

closed down. Those with more stocks can survive for

a few more weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 20 firms and nearly 2,000 workers in the

rattan  industry engaged in skin peeling and rattan

curing  are  affected. When the rattan  stocks  are

depleted, most of the workers will be thrown out of

their jobs also. The Government has prohibited  the

export  of raw rattan, but this is now circumvented

by  the import of low-quality Indonesian rattan via

Hong Kong. Nearly 1,000 workers engaged in the  gum

and  the  damar grading industries have lost  their

jobs. Also more than 500 workers are thrown out  of

their employment in nutmeg grading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charcoal trade is also severely hit. It is

estimated  that there are nearly 500 shops  dealing

in  charcoal and firewood, with an average of three

shop  assistants each, and more than 1,000  workers

engaged  in the unloading of charcoal and firewood.

There is estimated another 1,000 people engaged  in

tongkangs,  transporting the charcoal and  firewood

from  the Indonesian islands to Singapore. Although

at   present  there  are  small  sampans   carrying

charcoal and firewood coming to Singapore  for  the

exchange  of  food, the quantities are  negligible.

The  import  of  timber  logs  from  Indonesia  for

Singapore  sawmills is also a major trade.  It  has

now  completely  stopped.  Singapore  also  imports

copra,  copra cakes, pepper, tea, shells, chillies,

beans  and other raw materials from Indonesia which

give work to thousands of workers. All this has now

stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only the importing firms and the

factories  or warehouses associated with Indonesian

produce  that  are badly affected. The  firms  that

export   goods   to  Indonesia  are  also   equally

affected.  Not only is there a loss in  trade,  but

trade debts running into hundreds of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



millions  of dollars cannot be recovered. Singapore

supplies  Indonesia, particularly the Rhio Islands,

Celebes,   Sumatra  and  Borneo  with   foodstuffs,

textiles,    hardware   and   building   materials,

bicycles, second-hand cars and spare parts and  all

types  of consumer goods. The main bulk of textiles

imported to Singapore are re-exported to Indonesia.

In addition, there are thousands of people employed

in   the   garment  industry  situated  in   little

shophouses  making shirts, pyjamas, children's  and

ladies'  wear, with Indonesia as their main market.

It  is  difficult to estimate the number of workers

engaged  in the garment industry, in the making  of

embroidery,  shoes, slippers, all  types  of  piece

goods  with only Indonesia as the main market.  The

number of workers could run into tens of thousands.

A  large  part  of  the work is  sub-contracted  to

housewives  and girls in their own homes.  Most  of

the  shops around New Market Street, Beach Road and

Rochore   Road,   China   Street   areas,   selling

foodstuffs  and vegetables to the Rhio Islands  and

Sumatra border regions have been badly affected. It

is  believed  that  a shopkeeper  in  Rochore  Road

committed   suicide  as  a  result  of   Indonesian

economic confrontation. Unable to recover his debts

from  merchants  in Indonesia and  pressed  by  the

creditors here, he chose suicide as an escape.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The textile merchants in Circular Road, North

Bridge Road, South Bridge Road and High Street  are

also   badly  affected.  Indonesia  is  Singapore's

biggest  exporter  of textiles.  It  has  been  the

dumping  ground for textiles, garment goods,  shop-soiled   goods   and  patterns  not   easily   sold

elsewhere. Textiles at present meant for Indonesian

markets cannot be sold in any other place. Attempts

to  send them to Indonesia via Bangkok and Hongkong

have    not   been   successful.   The   Indonesian

authorities have taken preventive measures  against

such  moves. Many of the shops selling piece goods,

medical  products, watches, radios, pens, jewellery

and  all types of luxury or semi-luxury goods  have

Indonesia  as  the  main market. There  are  nearly

1,000  runners in Singapore who make a  comfortable

living  by  bringing  these goods  in  person  into

Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



Because  Indonesia has a high import  tax  on  this

type  of goods - and these are valuable goods  - each

ship  or  tongkang take a few runners  attached  to

them whose main occupation is to buy these goods in

Singapore  and  personally  bring  them   over   to

Indonesia. These goods are seldom declared  to  the

Customs.  Now  all these runners  have  lost  their

means  of  livelihood. Many of  the  shops  selling

piece  goods and medical shops are badly  affected.

In  turn, general importers of such goods from Hong

Kong, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom will be

affected  soon and the vicious circle will  go  on.

Many  of  the  factories in Singapore dependent  on

Indonesia  as  their  main  market,  for  instance,

aerated water, biscuit and flour factories, and  so

on,  will be affected. As production goes down, the

owners  and  the  workers in these  factories  will

suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important sector in our economy badly hit

is  water  and  land transport and  the  waterfront

workers.  Several thousands of twakow and  tongkang

workers  have been unemployed since 22nd September.

The  waterfront workers, the Harbour Board workers,

the lorry-owners, drivers, attendants, many tens of

thousands  of labourers who depend on  loading  and

unloading  goods  sent  to and  from  Indonesia  in

twakows, motor boats, tongkangs, ships, warehouses,

factories  and firms are now unemployed  or  under-employed. Many fishing firms have closed  down  and

many  more will be closing down. The fishing  boats

are  left to rot. Those engaged in fishing and  the

thousands of seamen in the hundreds of coasters  on

the  Indonesian run are jobless. Most of the  ships

are now at anchor, and millions of dollars will  be

lost later due to barnacles. Some of the ships  are

sent  to  other Malaysian ports, to run at a  heavy

loss  because  it is considered more economical  to

keep  them  moving  at a loss  than  to  lose  them

because of barnacles and later sold as scrap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very hard to assess the total loss that

Singapore  has  suffered after only  2½  months  of

economic confrontation. The Federation, except  for

Penang  which  has suffered an insignificant  loss,

has   benefited  economically  as   a   result   of

Indonesia's trade boycott, because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



prices  of  tin,  rubber, copra, timber  and  other

primary produce have gone up mainly as a result  of

stoppage of such goods to the world markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for us to remember that the longer

the  Indonesian economic confrontation  lasts,  the

harder it will be later for us to repair the damage

and  to  recoup  Singapore's entrepot  trade.  Once

Indonesian  exporters get used to  exporting  their

raw  materials  to  the  world  markets  and  start

importing   consumer  goods  from   the   producing

countries,   even  if  Singapore  later   were   to

reestablish   friendly  relations  with   Indonesia

again,  it  would be impossible to revive  the  old

trade  ties.  Singapore will lose Indonesian  trade

almost  completely  except  for  bulky  goods  like

timber and raw sago, and it will become a dead city

with  no  prospect  of  industrialisation  forever.

Singapore's industrialisation can only  be  carried

out  if  the Indonesian market, or part of  it,  is

secure  to Singapore's manufacturers. To whom  will

the products of the new industries be sold? The 1.8

million   people  of  Singapore  will  be   greatly

affected by the Indonesian trade boycott and  their

purchasing   power  will  be  much   reduced.   The

Federation of Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak with  their

eight  million  people  are debarred  to  Singapore

manufacturers because of the customs  barrier.  Now

the Indonesian market has been denied us. The flour

mills,  the  steel mill, the shipbuilding  industry

and all those new industries started in Jurong will

find  it difficult to get a sufficiently big market

to  warrant economical operation. The manufacturers

of  other  new  industries which have  not  started

building  on  their factory sites  will  now  think

twice  before they put in their capital. They  will

adopt  a  policy of wait and see. Industrialisation

in  Singapore  cannot  be a  reality  unless  goods

manufactured in Singapore can find their  way  into

the     Malaysian     market     and     Indonesia.

Industrialisation  can only be a pipe-dream.  Those

businessmen  who have lost heavily as a  result  of

the Indonesian economic confrontation have not been

keen on Government's offer of participation in  the

Jurong industries. Unless there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



sufficiently  wide  market for manufactured  goods,

they  are going to lose more money down the  drain.

What they want the Government to do is to take more

positive  and  immediate  measures.  They  are  not

touched  by the profuse of great wealth in  Jurong.

Until they can solve their problems today, they are

not  interested in the future. Most  of  them  have

lost  heavily  in  debts  advanced  to  traders  in

Indonesia. The 31st of December is approaching  and

the  banks will soon be pressing them to pay  their

overdrafts. The losses suffered from the Indonesian

trade  boycott cannot be estimated. It is  believed

that  thousands  of millions of dollars  have  been

lost.  Properties, shops, ships, houses, shares  in

businesses, estates, nearly 400 mills  and  rubber

smoking  houses in Indonesia belonging to Malaysian

citizens mainly from Singapore will be or have been

confiscated. The trading debt loss alone amounts to

hundreds  of  millions of dollars. All  the  ships,

fishing  boats,  lorries,  twakows,  factories  and

warehouses, etc. in Singapore geared to  Indonesian

trade  are  now  left idle and much money  will  be

lost.  The loss in trade and employment and general

dislocation  in the economy can never be  measured.

Yet  the Government has virtually done very little.

Its so-called economic defence measures are nothing

but eyewash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is facing the greatest challenge to its

existence as one of the great cities of the  world.

Whether   Singapore  continues  on  with  its   old

prosperity  or becomes paralysed will be determined

in   the   coming  momentous  months.  The  present

economic blackout calls for the boldest of  action.

Yet  the Singapore Government have not lived up  to

our expectations. On their own without Government's

effort,  the businessmen and the workers cannot  do

much. The workers are really suffering and can only

wait  and  wait.  Not many of the  businessmen  can

afford  to  pay  one-third of the wage  bill  which

Government  requires them to pay.  Businessmen  who

have  tried  to break the embargo by  trading  with

Indonesia via Hong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



Kong  and Bangkok have not been successful. As soon

as  the  Indonesian authorities  smelt  this,  they

placed  an  embargo  on the  export  of  basic  raw

materials like rubber, pepper, coffee, copra,  etc.

to  Hong  Kong. Only bulky goods like  copra-cakes,

teak,  shells  and sago which are  uneconomical  to

ship  back  to  Singapore can be exported  to  Hong

Kong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the only trade which outwardly does not

seem  to be affected is the building industry.  But

most  of the houses and flats being built now  were

planned and started before September 1963. There is

a  time  lag  in the construction industry.  House-

builders  are  now  finding difficulty  in  selling

their   houses  and  flats  because  of  the  lower

purchasing power in the community. This will affect

the  future  plans  of private  developers  as  the

effects   of   Indonesian  confrontation   on   the

construction industry will be felt later  - possibly

in a year's time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation, Sir, is very grim. Robberies and

thefts  are  on the increase. And as  the  31st  of

December  approaches, which is zero  hour  to  many

businessmen, the atmosphere gets more tense.  There

is   a   flight  of  capital  to  other  countries,

particularly   to   Hong  Kong.   After   Indonesia

announced  the confiscation of assets belonging  to

Malaysian citizens, Indonesian nationals of Chinese

origin who have assets in Singapore are afraid that

their  assets  here  will  be  confiscated   as   a

reciprocal  measure. The Government should  give  a

categorical assurance that all assets belonging  to

Indonesian  nationals  in  Singapore  will  not  be

confiscated.  If this assurance is not  given,  the

flight  of  capital  will  further  aggravate   the

difficulties  faced  in the economy.  People  still

remember  the fate of the Bank Negara Indonesia.  I

understand  that depositors in that bank  were  not

able  to  draw out their deposits. Businessmen  are

also worried about the future of the Bank of China.

Every   effort   should  be  made   to   help   the

deteriorating economy. The Government should repeat

their assurance given just before the formation  of

Malaysia that the Bank of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



China  will  carry on. So much trade, commerce  and

industry in Singapore depends on the Bank of China,

and  uncertainty about its future will heighten the

present economic crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the stock market in Wall Street affects

the  whole  capitalist world, so  the  stoppage  of

trade  and commerce between Indonesia and Singapore

affects  the  whole of Singapore. It creates  ever-widening  repercussions like  whirlpools.  Hawkers,

barbers,  taxis,  trishas,  coffee-shops,   hotels,

salesmen,  all shops, the professions,  dressmakers

and  garment-makers, lightermen,  lorry-owners  and

attendants,  Harbour Board and  waterfront  workers

are  only some of the categories that are affected.

If the economic confrontation were to persist until

June  next year, I am afraid that many white-collar

workers  would  also be retrenched. The  Government

must  not  adopt a wait-and-see policy, hoping  for

the  best.  Positive measures for immediate  action

and  result  must be taken. The Jurong scheme  will

not help the present crisis. When the United States

tried  to  strangle Cuba's economy,  Cuba's  allies

came  to  her  aid. The Singapore State  Government

should   come  out  openly  and  ask  the   Central

Malaysian Government to help by channelling some of

the  primary produce from the Federation, Sabah and

Sarawak  into Singapore as a substitute  for  those

raw materials which Indonesia has not been shipping

to Singapore since 22nd September, 1963. Sir, it is

a  fair and reasonable request because if Singapore

had  not joined Malaysia, Indonesia would not  have

adopted  economic confrontation which is  primarily

aimed  against Singapore. The rest of  Malaysia  is

now  enjoying unprecedented prosperity as a  result

of  Indonesia's economic confrontation. The  prices

of  tin, rubber, copra, pepper, coffee, rattan  and

all  other  produce  of  the  soil  have  gone   up

considerably  after 22nd September.  It  is  widely

believed  that  were it not for  Indonesia's  trade

boycott,  the  price of rubber  would  have  fallen

below  60  cents. Singapore is now part of Malaysia

with  a  similar obligation as the rest of Malaysia

to defend Malaysia. When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



Cuba faced the same economic confrontation recently

from  the United States. Cuba's allies came to  her

rescue.   Singapore  has  every  right  to   expect

economic  assistance  from the  rest  of  Malaysia.

After  all, the Singapore Government has generously

offered  or given $150 million as aid to Sabah  and

Sarawak for their development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore put forward the following

proposals for Government's consideration:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to request the Central Government to enter

into negotiations with the Indonesian Government as

early as possible with a view to the resumption  of

diplomatic  relations  and  the  calling   off   of

Indonesia's economic confrontation policy;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to ask the Central Government to channel some

of   the   primary   produce  of  other   Malaysian

territories  into  Singapore as  a  substitute  for

Indonesian  raw materials the import of  which  has

been totally stopped;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to request the Central Government to waive,

for  a  definite period of time, import  duties  on

Singapore's manufactured goods into other Malaysian

territories;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to reduce as many types of taxes and licence

fees   wherever  practicable  so  as  to   increase

spending    power   which   has   been    curtailed

considerably  by the trade boycott;  to  exempt  or

reduce  licence  fees  and  taxes  on  trades   and

occupations directly hit by the Indonesian economic

boycott;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to convene a conference of all banks

immediately and call upon them to exercise  a  more

flexible  policy  towards traders  and  businessmen

when calling back bank overdrafts on 31st December;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) to repeat the same categorical assurance

Government  had  given  before  the  formation   of

Malaysia on the future of the Bank of China;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) to assure Indonesian citizens that their

assets in Singapore will not be confiscated;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) to appoint a high-powered Committee to

utilise immediately part of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



State's  $400  million revenue surplus  for  labour

intensive  projects like roads, drainage and  other

rural projects;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) to give and expedite public assistance to all

those  workers whether inside or outside factories,

whether  directly  or indirectly  affected  by  the

Indonesian boycott;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) to allow S.I.T. dwellers who have lost their

jobs   as  a  result  of  the  Indonesian  economic

boycott, special rent concessions as long  as  they

are unemployed;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(xi) to negotiate with the Sabah and Sarawak State

Governments   to   absorb   half   of   Singapore's

unemployed  workmen on a three years' visa  in  the

first  instance to go to these territories to  help

in  the  development  of the country.  At  present,

Sabah  only  wants  to  recruit  skilled  technical

personnel which Singapore finds itself short of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are my humble suggestions. I hope the

Government  will consider these proposals  and  not

consider  them  with  indifference  or  even   with

hostility  because they come from  the  Opposition.

These  proposals are made in the best  interest  of

the country.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, may  I  assure  the  hon.

Member  for Hong Lim that the Government understood

the  gravity of the results arising from Indonesian

confrontation, a confrontation for which he and the

Barisan  Sosialis  are partly responsible,  because

they  gave  the  Indonesians the idea  that  within

Malaysia  itself there is a strong body  of  people

who  are  against it? We understand the gravity  of

the  situation. Steps are being taken to  alleviate

it.  Some of the steps have been enumerated by  the

Minister  for Finance in his speech.  Some  of  the

steps  have  been enumerated by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, listening to the speeches of the

Barisan Members, one cannot help but conclude  that

they are little children afraid to grow up and face

reality.  Malaysia is a fact and yet  these  people

are hoping against hope that they can continue with

their  subversive machinations to  break  this  new

nation which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



has  come  into being because the majority  of  the

people have decided that it is a good thing to come

together and be an independent nation. Independence

brings   with   it  certain  responsibilities   and

problems,  and it is up to us as grownups  to  face

them  squarely  and try to solve them  so  that  no

matter  what  the enemy does, we will  fight  them.

However,   the  Barisan  Sosialis   do   not   like

independence. Just like little children, they  like

to hide behind their mother's skirts whenever a big

bully  comes along. I feel that they still want  to

be  a colony under British protection. In fact,  at

one  time they seriously thought that there  was  a

distinct  possibility  that  they  could  form  the

government  under  the British  and  now  they  are

willing  to  crawl  on their  hands  and  knees  to

Indonesia  to  seek their indulgence  in  order  to

safeguard  our  economic  welfare.  Is   this   the

attitude  of an independent mind? I say no.  Having

been  stooges  of a foreign ideology for  so  long,

they  are  unable to stand on their  own  feet  and

would  not like others to stand on their  own  feet

too.  So at the slightest sign of danger they  want

to  go on their bended knees to their aggressor and

say,  "Please do not do what you are  doing  to  us

because  it  hurts." They say they  fight  for  the

poor.  I  say  they do nothing of the kind  because

they  have  always  been  trying  to  obstruct  our

development schemes, schemes which will improve the

conditions  of the people. Instead they  prefer  to

leave   the  people  in  squalor,  to  mislead   or

intimidate   them  to  continue   to   live   under

unhygienic conditions rather than see them in  well

planned  sanitary  quarters. For  example,  in  Toa

Payoh  the  Government  had a special  resettlement

scheme  for  those  who lived in  the  area.  As  a

special scheme, 196 terrace houses were built at  a

cost of about $5,000 each. Each of these was to  be

given in exchange for one of those badly built huts

which  the  squatters owned and  which  had  to  be

demolished in order to prepare the site for the Toa

Payoh  satellite town. Now, anyone  in  his  senses

would say that this is a good deal. Yet the Barisan

Sosialis  intimidated the people of Toa  Payoh  and

prevented  them from accepting the generous  offer.

Fortunately common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



sense  prevailed  in  the end  and  ultimately  the

settlers took advantage of the offer and moved  out

of  their  huts  into  the  new  houses  which  the

Government built for them and which they now own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned that the people

are not allowed to build attap huts. I am glad that

he   has   no  influence  in  the  policy  of   the

Government, otherwise Singapore, which is now  very

short of land, will soon be filled with attap  huts

which  are  not  only insanitary and  a  hazard  to

health,  but  also a fire threat and  a  danger  to

lives.  The many fires which have recently occurred

are  proof  of this. Thousands of people have  lost

all  their meagre belongings and it has indeed been

fortunate  that no lives have been  lost  in  these

tragic  fires.  With  the very  rapid  increase  in

population  and  with  the  increasing  demand  for

modern  accommodation with facilities  like  water,

electricity,  better roads, modern sanitation,  and

the  like, it is no longer possible for a city like

Singapore to develop on the basis of building  only

two-  and  three-storey  buildings,  much  less  to

continue  to build attap huts. Some of these  attap

huts  will  remain  and may  even  continue  to  be

constructed in the rural areas. But soon  with  the

pressure of population they too will have  to  give

way  to  better building. This, may  I  remind  our

young  Barisan Sosialis who refuse to grow  up,  is

the  price of progress. May I also remind them that

like  the  human spirit's desire to  be  free,  the

force  of  progress in democratic countries  is  an

inexorable   one  and  no  ideology   or   stubborn

opposition can stand in its way. Our people can see

for  themselves  whether or not the  Government  is

trying hard to improve their standard of living: to

build  a better, a more just and equal society  for

them and their children. Our people will be able to

realise  what  is progress, and in the  end  common

sense will prevail. Whatever may be the efforts  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis to obstruct the  Government,

these  are bound to fail because they do  not  have

the  support  of the majority of our people.  Their

wanton  claim that they represent the masses sounds

very hollow indeed in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



Chamber,  especially after the referendum  and  the

recent general elections. The Barisan Sosialis must

be  bereft of ideas for they have taken the  S.P.A.

line in saying that thousands of flats built by the

Housing  Board are vacant, that the flats  are  not

really  low-cost, that the rents are too high,  and

that  the  Housing  Board is making  money  like  a

landlord.  In  the same breath they also  say  that

truth  will out. Indeed truth is out, for otherwise

they  will be on this side of the House instead  of

breathing  the  rarefied air in opposition  and  in

diminishing numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the real part of this success

story  in public housing is that no longer is there

a  waiting list of 13,000 families clamouring for a

few  flats that become available now and again, and

rejoicing as if they had struck a lottery when  one

is  allocated  to them. Far be it.  All  those  who

needed flats had been given one and more are  being

encouraged  by the difference they can see  between

the  spick and span condition of the modern Housing

Board  flats and the abject over-crowded conditions

in  the  more  dilapidated parts of  the  city.  To

appreciate that, for the same amount of money  they

can  get  a  much  better  bargain.  As  a  result,

thousands  of people have moved into our flats  and

are continuing to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the last elections are a conclusive

endorsement  by  the  people who  count.  In  every

electoral   ward  where  there  has  been   housing

development, the people returned a P.A.P. candidate

by an overwhelming majority. Of course, the Barisan

Sosialis  got  some votes. This is  democracy,  and

there is a freedom of choice for everyone. This  is

a  repetition  of the lies of the Barisan  Sosialis

that the Housing Board flats are not built for  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain that every month more than

1,000   housing  units  are  completed  and  become

available  for  allocation. It is unavoidable  that

for  a  period  of  time some of these  units  have

remained unoccupied. This period of vacancy will be

extended  as  and  when  our  people  become   more

particular in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



the  choice of their homes when they know that they

can  get  one  without much difficulty.  It  is  an

indication  of success that we have  been  able  to

attain a stage when our people can not only get low-cost  housing  but  can also afford  to  have  some

choice.   In   fact,   at  the   moment,   whenever

allocations  are made, 30 per cent  of  the  people

reject  them for the simple reason that  they  know

that  we  are building very fast and very  soon  we

will  be able to build and give them a house  in  a

locality  that  they want. Or perhaps  the  Barisan

Sosialis want us to go back to the old S.I.T. days

when,  having built only a few flats,  there  would

not  be  any  vacancy and no one in his right  mind

would  dare refuse an allocation however unsuitable

it might be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board flats are low-cost flats and it

is  acknowledged by experts from all over the world

that  our building costs are the lowest. It is also

a  fact  that nowhere in South-East Asia has  there

been  any effort of this kind by any government  to

house  25  per cent of its population  in  low-cost

flats  at  the  rate that we are now charging.  Far

from  being a landlord and making money out of  the

rentals  of  the flats, I would like to state  that

the   Housing  Board's  accounts  show  an   annual

deficit.  I challenge the Member for Jurong  if  he

can  point  out to me anywhere else  in  the  world

where fiats of a similar standard that are built by

the  Housing Board can be built or are being  built

at  a  lower  cost  than we  are  building.  And  I

challenge him to show me any place in the world  or

any  government  which has been able  to  house  or

rehouse  1,000  families in a short  space  of  two

months as we did in Toa Payoh. Now, if that is  not

success in housing policy, I do not know what is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last four and a half years

of  the  P.A.P.  Government has been  a  period  of

construction, and we can look back with  pride  and

with  some satisfaction on our achievements.  There

are  enough houses for people who really need them.

No  child need go without education. Communications

and  roads have been improved both in the urban and

rural areas. Services in the form of street lights,

electricity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



water, have been brought to the people in the rural

areas.  Farmers have been provided with  veterinary

services and every effort is being made to ensure a

free  flow of their products between Singapore  and

Malaya  in  order  to  maintain  stability  in  the

marketing  of  their  products.  Preparations   for

industrialisation are being made and many factories

have   been   opened  in  Jurong,   Tanglin   Halt,

Bendemeer, and Kampong Ampat Estate, so  that  more

jobs  may  be  made available to  our  growing  and

increasing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We inherited a State Treasury which was almost

depleted   of   reserves  and  on  the   verge   of

bankruptcy,   and  in  spite  of   the   tremendous

development  projects we still have  a  surplus  of

$400  million.  It  is  by  careful  husbanding  of

resources,  pruning  of  unnecessary  expenses  and

increase in efficiency that we are able to  do  so.

All in all, the last five years have been spent  in

laying  the  foundation upon which we can  build  a

brighter and a more prosperous and equal society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, looking around the House today

one  can  see that the people of Singapore  endorse

our  policy because they have returned us  to  this

House  again with a greater majority. In case there

are those who fear that we might be dictatorial and

bulldoze our way through, I would like to reiterate

that  the P.A.P. upholds the principle of democracy

and  will  never, never abuse the trust  which  the

people  have  placed in us. However,  Sir,  as  the

Prime Minister has said, with the establishment  of

Malaysia,  the  focus of attention is  now  shifted

over  to  Kuala Lumpur. The major political  issues

have  to be fought out there. But this House  still

is  in  charge of the well-being of a State of  one

and   three-quarter  million   of   very   skilful,

industrious, sophisticated and discerning people, a

State  which, because of its geographical position,

is  the cross-roads of the East and West and is the

natural show-window of Malaysia. Therefore, Sir, it

is the duty of the Government and the duty of every

citizen  of this State to be prepared to  play  our

part in making this State a show-window which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia   can  be  proud  of.  It  is   fortunate,

therefore,  that with the experience gained  during

the  last five years, the P.A.P. Government and the

civil  service are in a better position  to  expand

and  build upon a foundation that has been so  well

and  truly laid. We have, on the Government  bench,

leaders who understand every twist and turn of  the

pro-Communist  disruptive  elements.  We  have   an

efficient  civil service within which  there  is  a

hard   core   of   young  men   with   professional

qualifications whose theoretical training  has  now

been strengthened by practical experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I would like to go

briefly  over what the departments which are  under

my Ministry have done, are doing and will be doing.

The  Government has devoted considerable effort  to

assist   the  farmers  and  fishermen  to  increase

agricultural   production  and  reduce   production

costs.  Our  emphasis has been on  introducing  and

teaching   the   farmers   and   fishermen   modern

scientific techniques and on the provision of  more

efficient primary production services. A number  of

veterinary  centres have been built  in  the  rural

areas  to bring primary production services  within

easy reach of the farmers. The Government plans  to

establish more centres as and when they are needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Film Unit of the Primary Production Department

has  produced several films on agriculture,  animal

husbandry,   fishery  subjects,  and  these   films

illustrating  better farming techniques  have  been

shown  to  farmers and fishermen at their villages.

Talks   and   lectures   on  various   aspects   of

agriculture  are being given. Illustrated  booklets

and  pamphlets  on  farming are also  produced  and

distributed  to  farmers by the Primary  Production

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal husbandry experimental stations have been

set  up to provide improved breeds of pigs and day-old

chicks for distribution to farmers at very low

prices. The production of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



piglings  and  day-old chicks will be increased  in

future  to  meet the growing demand of our  farmers

for a better breed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural insecticides, fertiliser mixtures and

common veterinary drugs are easily and cheaply made

available   to  farmers  at  the  rural   community

centres.  A mobile unit has been set up to  provide

these  and  similar  services to  the  farmers  and

fishermen  residing  in  the  adjacent  islands  of

Singapore, especially Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin  and

the  Southern Islands. To provide further extension

services,  a  primary production investigation  and

demonstration   centre  is  being  established   to

produce improved seeds for vegetables, bark grafted

fruit  trees and better fertilisers, as well as  to

demonstrate  to them modern farming techniques  and

the  growing of new crops. This will eventually  be

of   considerable   assistance   to   our   farming

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A veterinary diagnostic laboratory will be set up

to  investigate  the livestock disease  problem  in

Singapore  and  to  devise effective  curative  and

preventive  measures to counter these diseases.  An

animal  nutritional investigation  centre  will  he

established to investigate into the nutritive value

of  locally  available animal feed  stuffs  and  to

ensure  that feed stuffs sold on the market are  of

good quality and are of a high standard. Plans  for

a  modern  slaughter-house and  provision  for  an

efficient  veterinary health service  to  encourage

the  meat  canning  and meat packing  industry  are

being  drawn  up  and  eventually  will  be  of   a

sufficiently  high  standard  as  to   be   readily

exported  to  overseas countries. This  means  that

there  will be a bigger market for our farmers  who

rear pigs and poultry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slow start, the Public Works Department is

now in a position to take on a considerably heavier

volume of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



work  than it has been able to achieve in the  last

four  years. It is the intention of the  Government

that  the  P.W.D. should spend more money on  roads

and bridges over the next few years. The P.W.D. has

carried  out a number of major projects this  year.

An  important link road has been completed, namely,

the  Serangoon Garden Estate link road  which  will

now  enable easier and quicker access to  and  from

the  city.  Other  major improvements  in  progress

involve  the  widening and realignment of  existing

trunk  roads, such as Ayer Rajah, Clementi, Jurong,

Changi, past Coast and Yio Chu Kang Roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress in the construction of the outer ring

road  system, involving the widening and conversion

of  Alexandra Road, Farrer, Adam, Lornie, Braddell,

Bartley  and  Paya Lebar Roads into a dual-carriage

way  has been possible this year because there  was

not   the  usual  delay  in  land  acquisition  and

clearance. The settlers living in these  areas  co-operated  with  the Government and would  not  lend

their  ears  to  the  efforts of the  pro-Communist

elements who were instigating them to stay as  long

as  possible  on  the site in order  to  delay  the

construction programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three new roads have also been completed to serve

the  light industrial areas of Queenstown,  namely,

Queensway,  Commonwealth  Avenue  and  Jalan  Bukit

Merah.  The new West Coast Road and Boon  Lay  Road

which  are to serve the new Jurong industrial  town

are  also on the way to completion. Other new roads

being constructed are the Dunman Road extension and

Jalan   Delta.  A  total  of  18  private  streets,

involving an approximate length of 3.11 miles  were

made up in l963, while another 12 streets totalling

two  miles  are  still  under  construction.  These

street  works  are  carried out  either  under  the

Municipal   Ordinance  or  the   Local   Government

Ordinance and the costs are recoverable from owners

of houses fronting them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of new round-abouts to ease

congestion   at  important  traffic  junctions   is

continuing at Jambatan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



Merah,  Braddell Road, Serangoon Garden  link  road

junction  and  Geylang,  Guillemard,  and   Tanjong

Katong  Road  junction.  Along  Bukit  Timah,   new

traffic  bridges and foot bridges have  been  built

across  the  canal thereby allowing for  a  one-way

traffic  system along Bukit Timah Road and  Dunearn

Road  in  order  to  facilitate the  free  flow  of

traffic along this highway to the mainland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four other important highway bridges are being

planned.  These  are  at  Sungei  Kallang,   Sungei

Pandan,  Dunman Road and Clementi Road,  and  work

will  commence next year. Construction  work  on  a

number  of  important road bridges  is  continuing.

Four   of   these,  namely,  Beach   Road   Bridge,

Clemenceau Avenue Bridge, Edinburgh Bridge and  Lim

Ah  Woo  Bridge were completed this year,  and  six

others    are   still   progressing   and   nearing

completion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To relieve the traffic congestion at rush hours

along Fullerton Road/Collyer Quay thoroughfare,  an

overhead pedestrian bridge across Collyer Quay near

Change   Alley  and  also  an  under-path  on   the

esplanade   side  of  Anderson  Bridge  are   being

constructed   so  that  through  and  uninterrupted

traffic  will be possible. This pedestrian overhead

bridge and underpath will be completed next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of money has been spent by the Government on

flood  alleviation and drainage schemes  to  reduce

the  consequences and loss suffered through  flood.

Four  schemes were completed this year,  at  Bedok,

Chong   Pang  Village,  Mandai  and  Bartley  Road.

Important  canals  are being  built  with  concrete

lines   to  improve  the  flow  of  water  and   to

facilitate cleansing and maintenance. Work  on  the

Ulu  Pandan  scheme is progressing but it  has  not

been  possible to implement the final phase of  the

Geylang scheme which is to reduce flooding  in  the

area  north of Geylang Serai because of  the  heavy

concentration of squatter huts in these areas,  and

work cannot commence until they have been resettled

elsewhere.  The  resettlement  of  these  squatters

alone will constitute a major operation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is continuing with its scheme to

extend  the water pump sewerage system outside  the

city  area. This extension must of necessity  be  a

gradual process, and over the next few years it  is

expected  that some $70 million will  be  spent  on

providing more modern sanitation facilities to  new

homes.  To cater principally for the needs  of  the

proposed  Toa Payoh new town, a sewerage scheme  is

now  in the course of implementation. Contracts  to

the   value   of  $8  million  have  already   been

committed. Other small programmes to cope with  new

development  and  also  for  normal  extension   of

sewerage facilities to other non-sewered areas  are

progressing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural and access roads are also being

built.  Altogether 200 miles of  rural  roads  have

been  built.  The programme will be intensified  to

benefit  those  living in the  rural  areas.  Other

improvements include the provision of footpaths and

bus  shelters, local drainage and flood alleviation

measures  and  extension of water  and  electricity

supply to the kampong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Airport building at Paya Lebar will be

opened  about  March 1964 almost concurrently  with

the  multi-storey  car park at  Cecil  Street.  The

temporary  television building  for  the  temporary

T.V. services  was also completed  by  the  P.W.D.

which  is  now  working on the  proposed  permanent

building  on  Caldecott Hill. The  total  value  of

these buildings completed by the P.W.D. to date  is

some  $60.538  million; projects under construction

value  some  $8.315  million;  projects  for  which

working drawings are being prepared another $29.576

million; while projects for which sketch plans  and

estimates are being prepared value $15.076 million.

While  these figures reveal a satisfactory position

as regards our building programme, having regard to

the  shortage  of technical and professional  staff

during  the initial days of the present Government,

steps  are  being taken to increase the  efficiency

and output of the department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board will complete

its  first  five-year programme of building  61,000

units  slightly ahead of schedule.  In  the  second

five-year housing development programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



to  be  initiated in the latter part of  1964,  the

Housing  Board will continue to build  and  provide

low-cost flats along the periphery of the  city  at

the  rate  of  12,000  units per  annum.  With  the

housing  problem under control, the  Government  is

able to look into the question of encouraging house

ownership. Some discredited political elements have

claimed that this was their idea. Let me suggest to

these people that to dream dreams is one thing, but

to  turn them into reality is another. These people

might occasionally have visions, but it is only  an

honest,    energetic,   effective   and   efficient

Government that can produce results. There has also

been  irresponsible  talk about  reducing  interest

rates  and thus reducing rents. May I inform  these

irresponsible elements that on the scale  that  the

Government is building houses, we cannot afford  to

play  about with the finances of the State? We  can

either build a few hundred flats and subsidise them

to  such  an  extent that the rent  is  practically

negligible  and thus make such flats  available  to

only a privileged few, or we must reduce costs, cut

down  on  maintenance  and exercise  the  strictest

economy  in  order  to make our  resources  go  the

longest  way  to enable as many people as  possible

who  require  housing to get it. In  the  last  few

years,  we  have  cut down costs  of  construction.

Where  an S.I.T. flat used to cost $7,000 to $9,000

per unit, we are now producing them at about $4,000

to  $6,000.  Where the maintenance cost  under  the

S.I.T. was $220 per flat per year, this  cost  has

been  reduced  to  $60  per flat  per  annum.  With

Malaysia,  it  is expected that greater  prosperity

will  accrue  to our citizens. With rising  income,

our  people can look forward to ownership of  their

flats rather than mere tenancy. We can already  see

that  many  people in the middle and  lower  income

groups are beginning to think in terms of motor-car

ownership. The time is thus opportune for  them  to

choose  between owning a car or the house in  which

they  live.  The  Government  is  working  out  the

details  to make this ownership of house a distinct

possibility.  In  the next few  days,  concurrently

with  building the usual 12,000 units of  flats  to

let, the Housing Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



will  set  aside some of these flats  for  sale  to

satisfy the needs of one section of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Housing Board will actively

participate  in  the formulation and implementation

of  the  urban redevelopment plan to redevelop  the

central areas to ensure better economic and special

utilisation  of  valuable land in the  city  areas.

Old,  dangerous  and insanitary structures  in  the

city  will  be  demolished and replaced  by  multi-storeyed  units  of housing for all income  groups.

New   offices  and  commercial  buildings,  hotels,

restaurants,  theatres,  public  parks  and   other

social  and  community  facilities  for  the   city

dwellers will be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended to incorporate into this plan a

system  of  speedier mass transportation of  people

within  and out of the city. The Government intends

to  acquire sites that are dilapidated and due  for

demolition,  clear  them  and  redevelop  them   in

accordance with the urban redevelopment plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that private enterprise will be

invited  to  participate in this gigantic  task  of

urban  renewal. A pilot project, which is the first

phase  of the urban development programme, will  be

put  into  operation. Development in  the  southern

part  of  the city totalling an area of  about  132

acres  will begin in 1964. This area is bounded  by

New  Bridge  Road, Outram Road and Have-lock  Road,

including  the century-old Outram Prison  which  is

already being demolished. A second pilot project is

the  redevelopment of an area of 82  acres  on  the

northern  side  of  the  city,  bounded  by  Nicoll

Highway,  Jalan Sultan, Kallang Road  and  Crawford

Street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A census is being conducted in this area to

determine  what alternative accommodation  must  be

provided  for  the people affected. The  experience

that  will  be gathered in these two projects  will

assist  us in planning future redevelopment  areas.

Urban  redevelopment is a gigantic task and, to  be

successful,  must  have the full  support  and  co-operation of all the people in the State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, by the end of 1964, our first satellite town, Queenstown, will be fully developed with 17,500 flats, ten primary schools, three secondary schools, one vocational school, five markets and shopping centres with several community centres, clinics, children's playgrounds,

public   parks  and  other  amenities,  serving   a

population of about 150,000 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second satellite town will be Toa Payoh.

Progress  on  this  scheme has  in  the  past  been

severely  hampered  by pro-Communist  elements  who

instigated settlers to resist all efforts  made  by

the Government for their resettlement. In spite  of

this  strong  resistance, sufficient  progress  has

been  made  for  construction to  begin  on  a  new

satellite town which will eventually house about  a

quarter  of  a  million people. There  will  be  20

schools,  four markets, several community  centres,

creches, clinics, theatres, 500 shops, public parks

and  other amenities. Provision is also being  made

in  this  plan to set aside 43 acres  of  land  for

industrial uses. This construction is proceeding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While construction is proceeding in Toa Payoh, the

Housing Board will be investigating the site for  a

third satellite town. One possible site is the area

bounded by the Malayan Railway track, Telok Blangah

and  Alexandra  Roads, where about 1,000  acres  of

undulating land is to be earmarked for development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of suitable land for building is

steadily  becoming  one of the  major  problems  in

Singapore. To alleviate this shortage of  land,  it

is proposed to reclaim some 400 acres of swamp land

in  the  Kallang Basin. Earth for this  reclamation

project will come from the development of Toa Payoh

satellite  town.  Two  Bailey  bridges  have   been

purchased by the Singapore Government and will soon

be constructed across Serangoon Road for the direct

transportation  of  the earth  from  Toa  Payoh  to

Kallang  Basin. These bridges are necessary  so  as

not   to  interrupt  the  flow  of  traffic   along

Serangoon Road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reclamation and development is completed, the

Kallang Basin industrial and residential town  will

be   the  fourth  self-contained  region  providing

housing  accommodation in some 300 acres for  light

industry, it is expected that the final development

of  this Kallang reclamation project will be worked

into the comprehensive urban redevelopment plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have briefly outlined the projects we have in hand, projects which will provide the physical amenities of a civilized society for Mr, and Mrs Singapore and family.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, we have been accused by the Party  in

power;  sometimes  they accuse  us  of  being  pro-Communists;  sometimes they accuse us  of  abetting

Indonesia;  and  sometimes  they  describe  us   as

children. It is easy to level such accusations  and

blame at anybody. But the question is whether  such

accusations can stand up to fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, the Minister for National

Development described us as children, as though  he

was  a  grown-up and those opposite us were  grown-ups.

In the recent general elections, the leader of

the  P.A.P.,  Mr Lee Kuan Yew, went  down  to  the

rural  areas to tell the people that if the Barisan

were  elected, then the troops from the  Federation

of Malaya would march in. This is a very ridiculous

argument.  Many capable leaders in our  Party  have

been  arrested. Three of our Assemblymen have  also

been arrested and detained; and two of us, for fear

of  being arrested, have no choice but to hide. The

P.A.P. now turned round and said that these people

are  new men, they do not know anything. This  talk

can  serve  as propaganda material, but it  is  not

substantial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development a little

while ago elaborated on the plans of his department

and  accused the Barisan Sosialis of having smeared

the P.A.P.'s housing plan. I would like to touch on

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public housing for the people is a good thing.

Nobody  will  object to it. But we of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  oppose their way of doing things  because

their motive is not really in the interests of  the

people.   Actually,  they  are  doing  things   for

themselves,  and  the building of the  houses,  the

funds  and amenities also come from the people.  We

have  heard the Minister say that about 25 per cent

of the population of Singapore could live in houses

provided  and  built  by  the  Government  and   he

challenged  us to point out anywhere in  the  world

where  such facilities can also be provided by  any

government.  But the question is not whether  there

is  any such example to be found in any part of the

world.  Whenever a fire breaks out in any  part  of

Singapore, the Minister will go there and grab  the

land    for   building   houses,   ignoring   other

considerations. How can the fire victims afford  to

move  into  Housing Board flats  after  having  had

their belongings burnt down? Have the P.A.P. looked

into  this? They are only building houses  on  the

sufferings of the people. They build for  the  sake

of building. As to the other questions, I will deal

with them later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, let me now touch on the P.A.P.'s education policy. No matter how the Yang di-Pertuan Negara brags in his speech about the P.A.P.'s education policy - saying that the Budget is providing one-third of the whole expenditure on education, and that Government will build 26 new

schools and will raise the standard of teaching  of

second and third languages - all this is grand  talk

of  gigantic  figures - this beautiful talk  cannot

cover  up the failures and the great mistakes  that

the  P.A.P. have made in their education policy and

in  their handling of education problems. There are

five main errors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have always been making use of the

slogan of equal treatment to deceive our people. In

fact,  the  P.A.P. have never given equal treatment

as they had claimed. Recently the number of English

schools  is  increasing; it is even more  now  than

under the colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



regime;  whereas  the  number  of  schools  in  the

Chinese,  Malay  and  Tamil streams  is  dwindling.

According  to the Prime Minister's speech published

in  the  Sin  Chew Jit Poh of 26th  November,  many

parents send their children to English schools  for

two reasons. The first reason is that students from

English schools have better prospects of employment

and  they  can  also  learn Chinese  and  Malay  in

addition  to  English.  According  to  him,  it  is

because  the  English schools are able  to  provide

teaching  in  four languages that parents  like  to

send their children to English schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason, according to the Prime

Minister,   is  that  there  has  been   too   much

disturbance,  like  boycotting of  classes  in  the

Chinese  schools,  and the parents  dare  not  send

their  children to Chinese schools.  This  kind  of

talk by the Prime Minister is a smear, smearing the

efforts  of  those who have worked hard  to  better

Chinese  education.  Let us analyse  the  question.

Before  the P.A.P. came into office, there was  the

government  of  the  S.P.A. The number  of  student

troubles  then was more than that under the  P.A.P.

Another  point  is that the S.P.A. Government  also

advocated the destruction of Chinese education.  At

that time the number of students in Chinese schools

was  not smaller than it is now. This explains  the

Prime Minister's talk of unrest in Chinese schools,

thereby  causing a decrease in enrolment  in  them.

This  talk  is  false. According to logic,  Chinese

schools  should  develop very fast because  in  the

Federation  there is almost no student  trouble  at

all in Chinese schools. I hope that when the P.A.P.

Members go to the Central Parliament, they will  go

round  and find out the reasons for the absence  of

student  trouble in the Chinese schools  there.  If

that is so, then Chinese education will prosper. In

the  Federation  a lot of Chinese  school  teachers

have become unemployed. If they have an opportunity

to  understand  Chinese education, I  am  sure  the

Prime Minister will not dare to say that because of

the student unrest the enrolment in Chinese schools

has dropped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P.'s policy on education is to destroy

Chinese education. It is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



easy  for  us to give examples. We do not say  that

the  P.A.P. education policy is good. What we  want

is  to  strive  for  equal treatment  for  all  the

various  streams of education. And we  do  not  say

that only under the P.A.P. can Chinese education in

Singapore  prosper and thrive. Nor do  we  advocate

that  we  could give autonomy in education back  to

the  Central Government. I want to cite a few well-known  examples to prove my argument.  It  is  true

that    English-educated   students   have   better

prospects  of employment. That is not because  they

know  Chinese and Malay in addition to English.  It

is  because  the civil service recruits people  who

have a good knowledge of English. Of those in  the

civil  service  only about 10 to 20 per  cent  come

from  Chinese, Malay and Tamil schools. That  is  a

small  number. The rest are recruited because  they

have a good knowledge of English, i.e. they possess

a working knowledge of English. If they do not know

English, they will not be recruited into the  civil

service. Is this not serious? Is this not  a  fact?

If  they have a conscience, they will not deny this

fact.  Of  course, for the sake of their children's

future, some of the parents send their children  to

English  schools.  On the other  hand,  the  P.A.P.

build  many English schools to surround one or  two

Chinese schools, e.g. at the 5th and 6th m.s. Bukit

Timah  Road, the Government have built many English

schools. They have built about four to five English

schools  to  encircle some of the  Chinese  schools

there. I am sure they will not deny this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Government build English

schools  only in places where there are no  Chinese

schools. For example, in Queenstown, there  are  at

present   six  English  schools.  These  Government

schools  are all English schools. But the  one  who

decides  on education is not Dr Lee Siew  Choh  in

that   constituency.  Many  fire  sites  have  been

cleared  and  the fire victims have to  send  their

children  to English schools because there  are  no

Chinese schools around their area. If they want  to

send  their children to a Chinese school, it  would

not  be  convenient because some  of  the  Chinese

schools are very far from their homes. How can they

afford to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



send  their children to a faraway school when  they

can  hardly feed themselves? Neither is it possible

for  them  to  engage a person to look after  their

children in a school which is far from their homes.

Therefore,  they find it necessary  to  send  their

children to a nearby English school. The Government

says that the people have a choice of sending their

children to whatever language school they like. But

have  they got this free choice? I believe most  of

the  Government Members are Chinese and some of the

Malay  Members  know better because  they  find  it

difficult to send their children to a Malay  school

which  is  some 10 miles away. All this shows  that

the  P.A.P.'s  education policy  is  discriminating

against  other  vernacular education.  They  favour

only  English education. About ten of  the  Chinese

vernacular  schools in the rural  areas  have  been

closed down. They have been forced to close down on

the  ground that they are not up to sanitary health

standards,  and  that they do  not  have  a  proper

playground.  But it is the Government which  should

give  them  land  to  build playgrounds  and  other

facilities   and   provide  them  with   sufficient

sanitation. As a result, teachers in those  schools

are  now unemployed. When I say this, I do not mean

that  I  do not like English education. As a matter

of  fact,  we  want  every  person  to  acquire   a

knowledge  of English. What I am trying to  say  is

that they are only paying lip service to the slogan

of  giving equal treatment to the various education

streams,  whereas,  in  fact,  they  are  favouring

English education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the pamphlets on education policy

entitled Youth is the spring source of our  nation,

which  was  announced  by the former  Minister  for

Education,  he said that at present the vernacular

schools  are communal in nature. They are  isolated

from  one  another. It is only in  English  schools

that  we can find children of various races working

together,  studying together, playing  together  in

the  same playing field and able to accept the same

values of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-P.A.P. Minister for Education cannot deny

that  he  had said these things before. We are  not

interested in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



whole passage. But there is one paragraph which  is

enough  to show that the P.A.P. is only making  use

of  the  slogan  of  equal treatment  in  order  to

deceive the people. This shows that the P.A.P. does

not recognise the value of Chinese, Tamil and Malay

education. Not long ago, some Malay school students

also staged a boycott against the discrimination of

the  Government's education policy. Another example

is  that they forced the former Vice-Chancellor  of

the  University  of Singapore to  resign  from  his

post.  The  fact  that  the Government  forced  the

resignation  of Mr Tan Lark Sye from  the  Nanyang

University Council is another example to show  that

the  P.A.P. intends  to  control  all  educational

institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Prime Minister in his speech accused

those  people  who  have helped the  Government  to

build  schools,  especially the Chinese  merchants,

although he did not mention them by name.  He  said

they  wanted  to make pretensions to the  greatness

and fame of Mr Tan Kah Kee. This is a great insult

to  the members of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

Mr  Tan Kah Kee is a real patriot. He devoted  all

his  wealth  to  the  cause of education.  He  also

fought the Japanese during the Japanese Occupation.

He  was  an anti-colonialist, anti-Japanese and  he

called  upon all others to follow him. It  is  well

and  proper for these merchants in Malaya to admire

him and to follow his example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that he is a Chinese. But to me patriotism and anti-colonialism transcend all national boundaries. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government should encourage people to build schools. Let me quote an article from our Party organ on the building of schools by civic

organisations and the public. This was published in

the  24th  issue  of our Party organ.  The  article

deals  with the question of education and it  reads

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The population in Singapore is increasing very

rapidly and the school-going age students are  also

becoming  more and more. How are we  to  deal  with

this  problem? Experience in some of  the  advanced

countries  has  told us that it is  not  enough  to

depend upon the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



Government to build schools. The only way to remedy

this situation is to encourage the public to donate

money  to  build  schools so  that  the  Government

schools  and  the schools run by the community  can

flourish  together  so as to  raise  our  education

standard which is lagging far behind other  Western

countries. Only then can we solve our grave problem

of development in education.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong for the Government to build schools

alone  and  control all of them, and  not  to  have

confidence in the public in the field of education.

The Government should not monopolise education when

they actually cannot do anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, talking about schools built by the public, I will now touch on Nanyang University. The Ministers have been accusing Nanyang University of being a ground for fostering Communists and that it is sponsored by pro-Communist elements. I would like to point out that all the sponsors of Nanyang

University are merchants and people in all walks of

life.  These  people  have  contributed  money  and

effort  towards the building of Nanyang University.

When  the Minister for Labour smeared these people,

he was actually doing a great wrong. He himself was

also  educated in one of the Chinese schools  which

produced students for Nanyang University.  How  can

he say that the sponsors of Nanyang University have

been  fooled  by the Communists? The  Minister  was

distorting the good points of the schools built  by

the  effort of members of the public. He also  said

that  members  of  the families of  principals  are

engaged  as teachers in the schools; that there  is

nepotism  in  Chinese schools in  general.  He  was

educated in a Chinese school before.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



it  would appear that he does not quite understand

the question of Chinese education. In fact, he does

not  know  anything about it at all. He  has  wiped

away  the efforts of all those who have worked hard

to  support  Chinese education and has collaborated

with  the colonialists in their colonial education.

Without  the  support  of the general  public,  how

could the P.A.P. come to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



power?  Another mistake made by the  P.A.P. is  to

monopolise education. There are several examples to

substantiate  my argument. Firstly,  Mr  Lim  Seck

Kian  was  arrested. He was the  President  of  the

Seventh   and  Eighth  Councils  of  the  Singapore

Chinese School Teachers' Union. He was appointed  a

member  of  the  School  Curriculum  Committee   in

Mathematics  and  also a member of the  Educational

Advisory  Committee. Later on he dared to stand  up

and   criticise  the  4-2  system  and  expose  the

P.A.P.'s  so-called  equal treatment  of  the  four

streams  of  education. Then the P.A.P. Government,

in  co-operation  with  the  British  colonialists,

arrested Mr Lim on the 2nd of February this  year.

This  is  because he had the guts to stand  up  and

expose  the  falsity  of the  P.A.P.'s  educational

policy.   But  before  he  criticised  the   P.A.P.

Government's  policy, he was very much  appreciated

by  them  and  he  was appointed  as  a  member  of

important councils. The P.A.P. only made use of him

when  he was in their favour. When he opposed them,

they  nabbed him, without taking into consideration

that he had devoted half his life to education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say something about the things that have

happened  after  his arrest. Since his  arrest  the

results  of  the secondary entrance examination  in

the school where he was Principal have dropped from

70  per cent to about 30 per cent. That is why  the

members  of the Management Committee, the  teachers

and the students have not forgotten him. Mr Lim is

a  devoted educationist. It is a great loss to  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fact is that the P.A.P. Government have

sacked  a  lot of teachers with progressive  ideas.

These school teachers, clerks, principals, and even

I myself, were sacked. I will deal with the details

of  my  sacking  later. But at the  victory  dinner

party  at Sembawang the Prime Minister said he  was

surprised  that I was sacked when I  disclosed  the

news  to  him. He was a bit doubtful. I  will  deal

with my personal matters later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, there is at present a special

committee dealing with Chinese educational matters.

They are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



preparing a blue-print to sack more Chinese  school

teachers  with  progressive ideas. The  P.A.P. are

preparing  a  black list of about 200 teachers  who

are  to  be sacked next year. According to  what  I

have  heard,  these people who  are  to  be  sacked

include  those who were together with Mr Lim  Seck

Kian.  They  had  been responsible members  of  the

Seventh  and  Eighth  Executive  Councils  of   the

Chinese  School  Teachers' Union. Another  fact  is

that when I said the P.A.P. sacked me - the Minister

for  Education  is not here now or  else  he  would

stand  up and say that the authority who sacked  me

was  not  the  P.A.P. but  the  School  Management

Committee.  But  I will disclose something  to  let

everybody know the true picture of the whole matter

relating  to  me. The P.A.P. have  never  paid  any

attention  to  those  persecuted,  suppressed,   or

wronged.  If the P.A.P. want to keep close  to  the

truth,  reason  and justice, then they  should  not

brush off all the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all very young and perhaps we can still see

our  future. The Minister for Labour yesterday said

that  the  P.A.P. intended to fix us. Now,  let  us

see.  Let  me  relate  the matter  relating  to  my

sacking,  to let this House as well as  the  people

know.  The  intention to sack  me  started  at  the

victory  dinner of the P.A.P. branch in  Sembawang.

Some P.A.P. Assemblymen and defeated candidates ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order. I thought we

are  debating  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech

and the amendment. He is talking about his personal

trouble.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is talking about himself, but the

subject  which  he  is discussing  relates  to  the

subject the Assembly is discussing. I think  he  is

quite in order. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  the  P.A.P. are short of  reasons  and  have

nothing  to  say, they will always try to  stop  us

from advancing our reasons and the truth. They  try

to seal our mouths --- [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must allow the Member to

proceed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So those members and

defeated    candidates   coerced   the   Management

Committee  of the school into sacking me  in  their

own  names.  But this suggestion by the P.A.P. was

not  accepted by them. Following that,  the  P.A.P.

pressurised  the School Management  Committee  into

sacking  me.  We know that certain members  of  the

School Management Committee found it difficult  and

awkward  not to take this suggestion seriously.  So

in  the  end, on the 28th of October, I received  a

letter  from the School Management Committee saying

that   "This   is  to  notify  you  that   on   the

instructions  of  the Ministry of  Education,  your

services  to the school are terminated as from  the

31st  December, 1963." No further reason was given.

I  do not quite know the reasons for my sacking.  I

graduated from Senior Middle III. Though I did  not

graduate from the T. T.C. final year, I had been in

attendance  there for three years.  My  examination

number was 2097. But later on I was notified that I

was  not  allowed to sit for the examination.  This

shows  that  the  P.A.P. are  ruthlessly  adopting

measures to deal with their political opponents. If

they  can  adopt these measures to persecute  their

political  opponents, we can very well imagine  how

they can deal with other people --- [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, do not let me expose more of your evil deeds.

Do  you  want to force me to expose your  misdeeds?

Let me say something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Besar said I misbehaved

myself  in school. As a matter of fact, the  P.A.P.

had  been making use of my school as their  branch.

The  principal of my school is the branch secretary

of  the P.A.P. in that area. But I have no personal

grudge  against  my principal. And  in  the  School

Management  Committee there is one  member  who  is

also  a treasurer of the P.A.P. branch there.  Now,

who has converted that school into a P.A.P. branch?

It is the P.A.P. and nobody else.



Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have said just now that  they dismissed me because I am an Opposition Member.  If they can do this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



they can do worse things to other people. The Prime

Minister  yesterday said the P.A.P.  Government  is

prepared  to  accept criticism from the Opposition.

That is why I am now airing my views. I want to see

how  they  are going to answer my question.  Or  do

they not want to answer my question at all? Or will

they  ask  the  Press  not  to  publish  my  speech

relating to my personal case?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth mistake in the education policy is that

they  spend more time in shouting slogans  than  in

implementing their education policy. They talk more

than they do. Previously they talked of raising the

standard  of  science teaching. Now  they  want  to

raise   the  standard  of  the  second  and   third

languages.  It  is no use merely shouting  slogans.

What  is important is that we must get rid  of  the

colonial influence on our education system  and  to

popularise  education. It does  not  mean  that  by

shouting  empty slogans the standard  of  education

will be raised. To eradicate the colonial education

system,  you must change the substance and,  nature

of  education for the better. It does not mean that

by  building some Chinese, Malay or Indian  schools

it  will  be  amounting to equal treatment  to  all

streams  of education. To conduct Malay classes  in

Chinese and Indian schools ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is five o'clock. I propose to

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  the  break I was talking about  the  fourth

point  - about  the  P.A.P. Government  raising  the

standard  of  teaching  of  the  second  and  third

languages in our schools. If the Government  cannot

truly deal with this problem, it is useless just to

put up some slogans that will not be of any good to

education.  If  they can achieve that  by  shouting

slogans,  then  everybody  can  become  an   expert

educationist.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been Press reports that certain

Ministers  officiated at the opening ceremonies  of

certain   schools  and  after  some   time,   other

Parliamentary Secretaries and members of the P.A.P.

officiated  at opening ceremonies of certain  newly

built  schools.  If  such acts were  to  constitute

success  in  education, then  it  would  be  merely

making  a  laughing stock of the P.A.P.'s education

policy.  It would not deceive the people  nor  make

them believe that the P.A.P.'s education policy  is

the best in this part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, about interference of academic freedom and

university autonomy. The students of the University

of   Singapore   went   on   strike   against   the

Government's  action  against  the  University   of

Singapore. Also, the Nanyang University Council had

not  accepted the conditions attached to Government

aid  to  Nantah;  and  the P.A.P. had  forced  the

resignation of Mr Tan Lark Sye, because Government

aid  to Nantah was given with strings attached. The

Nanyang University Council did not accept the  aid.

It  is  a  smear and a slander to say that  without

Government  aid,  Nantah would  be  turned  into  a

training  ground for Communist cadres.  What  about

the  University  of  Singapore?  It  also  receives

Government aid. How is it that there were incidents

in  the  University of Singapore where the students

went  on strike in protest against the Government's

action?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear that the Government is making use

of aid to universities in order to control them and

to  introduce P.A.P. politics into them  so  as  to

turn  them into P.A.P. universities. Only when  the

universities are not controlled by the  P.A.P. can

there  be  safeguards for university  autonomy  and

academic freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding academic standards in Nantah, this is

something  that can be assessed by the  public  and

not  by  the  P.A.P. alone. To label a  university,

which  has  received the support  of  thousands  of

people,  one  that has produced many  students  who

have  gone  abroad with high academic  achievements

and merit, recognised by universities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



abroad,  as  low  in  academic standard  is  really

ridiculous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past Nanyang University had never received

a   single   cent  from  the  P.A.P.  Instead   the

Government had tried to put many restrictions on it

and had banned publications by its students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour yesterday described the Nantah students' participation in University Week as the behaviour of students devoid of learning. What about the University of Singapore students who went on strike in protest against the Government's action relating to university autonomy? Can the Minister use the same terms to describe these students? I will not want to criticise the Minister by using the same terms as he has applied to Nantah students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said in this House yesterday that the Governments tasks were, firstly, industrialisation, secondly, housing programme, thirdly, education - especially, technical education - and fourthly, the raising of social standards. These plans only show the P.A.P.'s superficial

actions.  They  want to put up a  beautiful  facade

without actually going down to the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the Government can have money as a

prerequisite to that object, the people should have

money.  This can only be realised when  the  people

have  work  to do. But these factors  will  not  be

forthcoming because Malaysia is not and  cannot  be

for  the  interest of the people. The establishment

of  Malaysia  is  only for the benefit  of  foreign

capitalists and monopolists in order to exploit the

people.  Secondly,  the  confrontation  policy   as

applied by Indonesia has caused thousands of people

to lose their jobs. This, in turn, has affected the

livelihood  of  thousands of people  in  Singapore.

This  series  of chain reactions has  caused  great

suffering and difficulties to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the markets both inside and outside Malaysia

are  controlled  by  foreign capitalists.  Our  own

industrialists  and merchants cannot  compete  with

them.  On  top  of  this, our Government  will  not

encourage our local merchants to compete with them.

Instead it is helping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



the   foreign   capitalists.  The  present   market

available  is  that  of the so-called  ten  million

people  of  Malaysia,  but due  to  the  Indonesian

confrontation policy, this market cannot  flourish.

When  the  people  do not have  money,  it  is  not

possible  for  the Government to have more  revenue

from  taxation  to  carry out the various  projects

such  as  industrialisation, housing  and  provide

other public construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic problems will be one factor that will

cause  an economic chain reaction. When the  people

are poor, when their coffers are empty, how can the

Government do anything? All the schemes for  social

welfare and education will have to be discarded. In

the  end,  the people will be worried  about  their

livelihood and there will be robberies and  thefts,

and  people may try to take to the highway, and all

sorts  of  social evils will arise.  The  so-called

paradise  in  South-East Asia as described  by  the

Minister for Labour will turn out to be a  hell  on

earth.   That  is  why  the  Prime  Minister   said

yesterday in this House that the P.A.P. Members  of

Parliament  would strive to have an impact  on  the

Malaysian Parliament to try and gain entry into the

Central  Government and replace the M.C.A. in  the

Alliance Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, our Party has long ago

pointed out this intention of the P.A.P. The P.A.P.

has  all  along  been souring up  the  relationship

between  the  M.C.A. and the U.M.N.O. in  order  to

fish  in  troubled  waters, thinking  that  if  the

M.C.A. is defeated in the towns in Malaya, then the

P.A.P. would have a chance to go into the political

arena in Malaya while the Minister for Finance (Dr

Goh  Keng  Swee)  could  become  the  Minister  for

Finance  of Malaysia to replace Mr Tan  Siew  Sin.

The  Prime Minister of Singapore would then  become

the  second or third most important person  in  the

hierarchy  in the Central Government. But  this  is

impossible  because although the  magician  may  be

clever, the devil is cleverer. The M.C.A. is clever

enough to know the intentions of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P.  The relationship between U.M.N.O. and

the  M.C.A is still going strong. In spite of  what

the  P.A.P. are  trying to do,  this  relationship

cannot  be  soured up for the time  being.  So  the

people  of  Singapore have the  right  to  ask  the

P.A.P. to  stop indulging in their fantasies.  The

P.A.P. should turn over a new leaf and try to solve

their  problems  by more constructive  means.  They

must  come back to face the realities of  life  and

solve their problems in a practical way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we urge them to call on the Central

Government  to  commence  negotiations   with   the

Indonesian    Government   and   the    Philippines

Government to stop the confrontation. We also  urge

the  P.A.P.  Government to stop scolding Indonesia.

It   was  very  bad  of  the  Minister  for  Labour

yesterday  to  scorn  the people  of  Indonesia  by

saying that they have to live on roots and barks of

trees  and  even  on  rats  at  times.  Now,   such

accusations  will do no good to anybody.  To  prove

his  point,  he even went to the extent  of  saying

that our colleague, Mr Chan Sun Wing, had to carry

two  bags of notes in order to do some shopping  in

Indonesian  streets.  Yesterday  the  Minister  for

Labour  resorted to jingoistic talk to  refute  the

validity of our amendment to this motion. This  act

of  the  Minister will give the world at large  the

impression that this House in Singapore is full  of

the spirit of jingoism, because he seems to suggest

that  it  is useless to solve problems by  peaceful

means  and  round a conference table. He  seems  to

have  forgotten that the poverty of Indonesia stems

from  colonial economic aggression and exploitation

rather   than  from  their  confrontation   against

Malaysia.  He also seems to suggest that the  bases

in Singapore are meant to protect Singapore against

any aggression from outside. Now, this goes to show

that  they  are praising the colonial  masters  for

their military bases in Singapore and that they are

trying  to defend their colonial masters for  their

possible future military actions. He seems to  have

become the defence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



counsel  for the British to have military bases  in

Singapore. What a shame! The P.A.P. have all  along

been harping on the theme that the Barisan Sosialis

is  receiving instructions from Indonesia to oppose

Malaysia. Now it is the Minister for Labour of  the

P.A.P. who  turns round and says that  it  is  the

Barisan  Sosialis who is encouraging Indonesia  in

its    opposition   against   Malaysia.   What    a

contradiction of statements! This is their kind  of

logic! What kind of logic is this? On the one hand,

they  say that we get directions from Indonesia  to

oppose  Malaysia and, on the other hand,  they  say

that   we  are  encouraging  Indonesia  to   oppose

Malaysia. This is their logic!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour quoted an extract from our Party organ to say that we are toeing the Indonesian line. But if there were anybody toeing anybody's line, then it would be Indonesia that is toeing our line. This quotation was made out of context. And I am inclined to believe that our

Minister for Labour does not know very much of  the

Chinese language, for he used certain phrases which

are entirely out of place. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I know better Chinese.

I  am  just  trying to give you the facts.  And  if

Members on the Government side can prove for a fact

that  they  know better Chinese than I do,  then  I

shall be very happy to listen to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us go back to the speech of the

Minister  for  Labour. He said yesterday  that  the

Nanyang University undergraduates are making use of

their vacation "to train soldiers, groom the horses

and arm themselves". He used this Chinese phrase in

his  context  as  though the Nanyang undergraduates

are  now training themselves for military purposes.

Now, this phrase, "to train soldiers and groom the

horses",  has been used entirely out of place.  And

this wrong use of the Chinese idiom made his speech

ridiculous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our Party has previously issued a warning that if the opposition against Malaysia outside this region is not considered and is disregarded entirely, then a sad situation will arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd August this year, our Prime Minister went

to  Kuala  Lumpur  to urge Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  to

establish Malaysia by 31st August. He was even more

interested  in  the establishment of Malaysia  than

the  Tunku himself, in spite of the opposition that

had  been generated against Malaysia abroad. So the

present troubles can actually be attributed to  the

reactionary alliance between Singapore and  Malaya.

The P.A.P. were very interested in the formation of

Malaysia  because they wanted to pave the  way  for

themselves  to  find a place in the  Federation  of

Malaya in case they could not stand in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to our desire to negotiate with

Indonesia  to  solve the problem of  confrontation,

the  Minister for Labour made his wonderful  speech

yesterday  giving  people  the  idea  that  he  was

belligerent.  He  boasted of the high  standard  of

living  that  Singapore has achieved. He  described

Singapore  as  a paradise on earth, forgetting  the

fact  that  it  had been exploited by the  colonial

masters for over 150 years and that the people  are

living  in  misery. Even the real  stooges  of  the

colonial  masters  will  shout,  "Bravo!"  for  his

wonderful performance in this Chamber yesterday. If

he  cares to go round the rural areas and factories

in  Singapore,  then he will be able to  appreciate

the  difficulties  that the  Singapore  people  are

facing  now.  Then he will think  twice  before  he

makes  wonderful speeches about Singapore  being  a

paradise!  If  you  turn over  the,  pages  of  the

newspapers,  every day you will see a lot  of  news

items  about suicides, robberies, murders and other

miserable  stories of the man in the street.  There

has  been a lot of news in the Chinese papers about

widows  and  children who have to live on  charity.

The newspapers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



have  to  issue  public appeals for donations.  Are

these  events  consistent with  Singapore  being  a

paradise?  As  a matter of fact, the  Minister  for

Labour  seems to disregard completely the realities

and   the  true  difficulties  of  the  people   in

Singapore.  He describes those who are dissatisfied

with life as people who take the wonderful state of

affairs  as  things for granted. But  I  will  turn

round  and say that he is living so close to a  sty

that he does not smell the bad smell.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No single factor is more likely to bring about a

more fair and just society than equal opportunities

for  education  for  all. The ideal  to  which  all

nations  in the world aspire is the utilisation  of

its human resources to the maximum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these words from the policy statement by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara must ring in the ears of the people of this country with much greater significance than in other South-East Asian nations. For us, it is no longer a statement of intention, but one of fact. Free universal

education  for six years is a fact. Free  universal

education for at least ten years will be a fact  in

the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Malaysia, who are involved in nation-building, this signal achievement has even greater

significance. In practice, it means equal treatment

to the Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English streams in

our  education  system with Malay as  the  national

language.  It  means  reducing  to  the  minimum  a

contradiction which existed for more than a hundred

years. In intent and purpose, it paves the way  for

inter-racial and inter-communal harmony and  peace.

The free choice which parents make of the medium of

instruction  for  their children  gives  democratic

lustre to equal treatment for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these are the facts. At a later stage, I shall give you the figures. I wish to refer again to the fine words of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara I quoted earlier, and say quite frankly that we have been and are still earnest in everything we do. The social revolution,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



started   4½ years  ago,  will  continue   without

interruption. About a third of the budget  will  be

spent  on  education and this amount is  more  than

what many countries in Asia have ever done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never tire of this confrontation with a social

problem  such  as education because  we  know  that

ultimately it will bring good. We do not believe in

deliberately  depriving our children  of  something

beneficial and concrete for something abstract. The

Singapore Government places a very high premium  on

the  education  of its children. We not  only  have

implicit  conviction, but we try to make a  reality

of  the  importance  of education  in  the  general

progress  of our developing nation. It is  not  for

nothing  that we have autonomy in education,  among

others,  and we shall continue to decide  how  best

the  money  should  be  spent for  our  industrious

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in Singapore today 464,000 children in

our  schools. Of this huge figure, 25 per cent  are

in  our  secondary schools. This means that one  in

every four of our population is in school. This  is

a  record  which is seen in the light of  the  fact

that  our  children  go  to  school  every  morning

decently  dressed complete with shoes. They  go  to

school after having breakfast. Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is our pride that in every classroom in Singapore's

schools  there  can  be found  a  future  Malaysian

citizen  who will have the opportunity for  a  full

primary and secondary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great expansion was achieved in four years by

building 48 new schools and training 3,500 teachers

who  passed  out  as  qualified teachers.  Of  this

figure  for  schools,  30 are primary  schools,  18

secondary schools - namely, nine secondary academic,

four   secondary   technical  and  five   secondary

vocational schools. In addition, eight primary  and

secondary  schools were extended to  take  in  more

students.   The  Teachers'  Training  College   has

likewise expanded in accordance with the policy  of

giving  equal treatment to all the language streams

of  education  and  the relative increases  in  the

various language streams.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this broad framework of a system which has

won the support and acclaim of all loyal and right-thinking   citizens,  the  Government  intends   to

present  a  White Paper on the next Five-Year  Plan

next  year.  In  this  will  be  incorporated  such

recommendations   of  the  two   Reports   of   the

Commission  of  Inquiry  into  Education   as   are

acceptable to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To utilise the ten years of free education to the

best   possible  advantage  with  a  view  to  "the

utilisation of all human resources to the  maximum"

is  our  major national objective. The  social  and

economic   needs   of  a  changing   society   will

necessarily  demand  a  dynamic  approach  to   our

educational  problems. We must always be  ahead  of

the  situation and Singapore, more than  any  other

constituent State in Malaysia, needs a well-planned

programme   to   cater  for  the   commercial   and

industrialised State we are heading for.  We  could

not turn to agriculture even if we wanted to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national language and one or two more

languages  is  the  ideal  armour  for  the  future

Malaysian.  Whether it is for knowledge, employment

or   nation-building,   or   pure   interest,   the

acquisition of an extra language is an asset. Plans

are  in  hand to raise the standard of teaching  of

the  second  and the third languages to make  every

school-leaver  at  least bi-lingual,  if  not  tri-lingual.  This  will mean that the  integration  of

schools  using different language media, introduced

by  the  P.A.P.  Government in its  first  term  of

office, will be brought one stage further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall establish bi-lingual schools where

instruction in different subjects will be given  in

two  languages. At the same time, the study of  the

national  language  will  be  intensified  in   all

schools and at all levels as more and more teachers

are  trained and qualified to teach in the national

language.  The curricula in secondary schools  will

be  reviewed  so as to allow every  pupil  a  wider

choice of subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planning and administration of all

scholarships and fellowships as well as awards  for

training  overseas  are  now  centralised  in   the

Scholarships Co-ordinating Committee of the  Public

Service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



Commission.  This  new unit will  ensure  that  our

needs  for  various  types  of  training  are   co-ordinated  and  accorded the proper  priority.  The

policy  of  making generous awards in the  form  of

Government bursaries to all institutions of  higher

learning  and  at all levels will be continued  and

further increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every effort has been taken in the last four

and  a  half  years  to expand and  cope  with  the

strictly  educational opportunities of our children

of all races, there remains the problem which since

the   end   of  World  War  II  has  beset  Chinese

education. This is the use the Communists  make  of

Chinese  educational issues as a  cover  for  their

nefarious  subversion  of  students  and  even   of

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been successful to the extent that

sometimes   they   have  brought  about   confusion

regarding educational issues and followed this with

mass agitation against the Government. Fortunately,

however, the growing consciousness on the  part  of

the  people  and political developments leading  to

independence  through Malaysia have  out-paced  the

Communists,  and  it is my earnest  intention  that

before  long  they will be completely isolated  and

exposed   as  being  nothing  more  than  dangerous

political opportunists who have all along  utilised

education  and educational issues to further  their

own sinister ideological ends. This will not be  an

easy task and it will take many years of relentless

determination  before the Communists  finally  lose

out at the hands of the people themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It becomes necessary for me to put before the

House  the  problem of Communism and discipline  in

the schools. It is imperative that the people get a

panoramic  view of the whole problem and understand

the  intricacies therein. In this  way,  they  will

understand the position themselves and consequently

understand what Government has done and will do  in

the  future  in dealing with what has for  so  long

appeared to be an insolubly knotty problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With national independence, Communism and

Communist   activities   in   Chinese   educational

institutions  in the State have become  a  security

problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



which  affects the peace and harmony of the  races,

particularly  the  Malays  and  Chinese   in   this

country. It nonetheless constitutes a threat to the

democratic basis of our society and our Government.

Clearly  in  a  matter  of  struggling  against   a

totalitarian  ideology  which  aims  at  destroying

individual freedom and human values which  we  have

learned to cherish and uphold over the years, there

cannot  be  any compromise or neutrality.  Seen  in

this light, even the most ardent existentialist  in

the  precincts of our older university  will  agree

that  democrats  too must draw  the  line  when  it

involves their own survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see why the Communists have found the field

of  Chinese  education a fertile ground  to  pursue

their vile activities. Whether it is Israel, Kenya,

Thailand  or Malaysia, it is a fact that  immigrant

communities  tend  to stick together  to  safeguard

their  "common" interests. The Chinese in  Malaysia

are  no  different. Under colonial  domination  and

discrimination which is the inevitable sequence  of

divide  and rule, it is common knowledge  that  the

colonial power in Singapore and Malaya took  little

or  no  interest  in the education of  the  Chinese

community.  The  creation  of  an  English-educated

compradore and clerical class was incidental to the

general scheme of colonial exploitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese immigrants therefore took upon

themselves   the  task  of  building  schools   and

educating  their  sons and daughters.  Against  the

background  of  a long civilisation going  back  to

5,000  years of scholarship and culture, chauvinism

was  given  added  impetus by  the  oppression  and

discrimination of the colonial power whose  primary

concern  was the exploitation of immigrant  labour.

The  revolutions and renaisance in China in  recent

years  could  not but reinforce the  trend  towards

chauvinism   and   Chinese   consciousness.    Pure

admiration, if nothing else, is enough to  rekindle

nostalgia  for the old country. So would Malays  of

Indonesian origin feel if not for the mess that  is

the lot across the Straits of Malacca today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempts to "do something" about Chinese education

in the early post-war



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



years were more in the nature of apologies for more

than  a  century of dismal neglect. While education

in   the  English  language  opened  all  doors  to

employment,  it  brought about  frustration  and  a

feeling of being unwanted to tens of thousands  who

passed  out  from  Chinese  schools  annually.  The

Communists took this golden opportunity to  exploit

the  growing fear which they themselves  helped  to

spread, that Chinese education, built by the  sweat

and  toil of the Chinese community for more than  a

hundred  years, will be gradually eliminated.  From

the colonial power there was no evidence at all  of

any  attempt  to  accommodate  school-leavers  from

Chinese schools, let alone help in their expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, true to their deceptive ways,

found   enthusiastic  allies  in  the  chauvinistic

leaders   who   champion  the  cause   of   Chinese

education. It is well known that members of  School

Management  Committees are predominantly  merchants

and  towkays who in their time have contributed  to

the establishment of these schools. Some members of

the  Management Committees found nothing  wrong  in

joining  forces  with the Communists  who,  on  the

surface,  appeared  to  be  fighting  for   Chinese

education.   This  was  one  ground   where   their

respective  ideological,  political  and   economic

beliefs  were  sufficiently  sunk  for  the  common

objective of "saving" Chinese education and Chinese

culture.  Before  long, many innocent  people  were

jointly  voicing  slogans  like  "Struggle  against

attempts  to destroy Chinese education and culture"

and  "Preservation  of Chinese education,  language

and culture" and "Do not forget our ancestors" with

the  Communists. Communists and Chinese chauvinists

have  struck common ground. The traditional respect

for  scholarship  and culture lent  force  to  this

unholy alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this atmosphere, the Communists were able to

carry out planned activities to further their cause

under  the cover of Chinese education. In the field

of  education,  this  was the beginning  of  united

front  tactics  pursued with skill and  cunning  by

people who openly and proudly proclaim Marx, Engels

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



Stalin as their guiding light and inspiration. They

manipulate   the   School   Management   Committees

whenever  they can and plant their agents  wherever

they   want.  They  "eliminate"  members  of  these

committees who show independence of mind and action

and refuse to be used as pawns by the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are others who willingly lend support

and knowingly allow themselves to be manipulated by

the  Communists  in  the fond belief  that  if  the

Communists  are  helping to further  the  cause  of

Chinese  education, then there is nothing wrong  to

co-operate  with  them  to help  further  the  same

cause.  Mr  Tan  Lark Sye is one such  person.  He

typifies  others who sit in Management  Committees.

Two recent incidents in the Nanyang University show

this.   The   first   is   the   assault   on   six

undergraduates  by pro-Communist students  on  12th

September,  1963, on which he took no  disciplinary

action  and, second, his support given to the  pro-Communist Nanyang University graduates standing  as

candidates  for the Barisan Sosialis  in  the  last

general elections by issuing statements drafted  by

these  pro-Communist  graduates.  Then  there   are

political  innocents  who  want  to  be  with   the

Communists  in  the hope that the  "revolution"  is

just around the corner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The united front tactics of the Communists in

exploiting Chinese education issues is carried into

students'  organisations, old  boys'  associations,

trade   unions,  Management  Committees,   cultural

bodies,  sports and welfare organisations and  even

mutual benefit societies. They use leaders of these

organisations  mentioned  to  obtain   support   by

statements,   by  cajoling  others   to   join   in

demonstrations  they secretly organise.  They  have

bamboozled many a unionist to take part in  strikes

and  in  1961 they had again succeeded to a certain

extent  in using these united front tactics to  get

students to stage examination boycotts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their methods might differ from one organisation

to  another depending on the degree of support, co-operation,  response, hostility or indifference  on

the  part  of  the leaders of these  organisations.

Where they meet with ideological



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



opposition from men with principles and guts,  they

are  quick  to  use smear tactics.  They  will  not

hesitate  to delve into the private lives of  their

opponents  to discredit and smear them.  They  have

branded  those who have opposed them with  epithets

like "selling out Chinese education", "running dogs

who  destroy  Chinese education and  culture",  and

"ungrateful people who forget their ancestors".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intimidation and direct assault and violence is

not  altogether  unknown  in  the  tactics  of  the

Communists.  As  recently as  12th  September  this

year, there was such a case of Communist strong-arm

method.   On   that  day,  the  Nanyang  University

Consumers'  Co-operative Society held  its  general

meeting in the Assembly Hall of the Faculty of Arts

building. The pro-Communist students had planned to

capture  it  at the elections of the Committee.  At

this  meeting, six students, most of whom were from

the   Commence  Faculty,  were  assaulted  by  pro-Communist students after the meeting. One  of  them

was    seriously   injured.   The   incident    was

investigated by the Board of Student Welfare  whose

secretary,  Lim  Kim  Hiong,  is  known   to   have

associated with Communist elements since his school

days.  It was later disclosed that one of  the  six

attacked had stood as a candidate for the Society's

Executive Committee. When the six injured  students

were  interviewed, the Chairman  of  the  Board  of

Student Welfare repeatedly asked one of the victims

why he had gone to the police station to report the

matter. Is it not strange that in the civilised age

of today there are leaders of "student welfare" who

question  the wisdom of reporting cases of  assault

to  the  police?  Are  they seriously  thinking  of

taking   the   law  into  their   own   hands   and

administering  rough  justice  according  to  their

whims  and  fancies?  What discipline  is  it  that

eliminates  all  others who  do  not  accept  their

dictatorial leadership?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board decided that a thorough investigation

would  be  instituted to identify the students  who

were  responsible  for  the violent  incident  that

evening and that the whole case would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



submitted  to the University Disciplinary Committee

for  action. Three months have passed. Neither  the

Disciplinary  Committee, which is  chaired  by  the

Vice-Chancellor, nor Mr Tan Lark Sye, the Chairman

of the University Council, has taken or ordered any

action.  Four days after this unfortunate incident,

a  group  of  under-graduates  who  were  about  to

celebrate  the  founding of Malaysia were  forcibly

prevented  from  carrying out  their  celebrations.

Again, no disciplinary action was taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cases of indiscipline and lawlessness in the

Chinese  schools  have  been  brought  out  by  the

Commission of Inquiry into the Examination  Boycott

set  up  in 1961. Members of the Assembly  remember

vividly the incident at Chung Cheng High School  in

1950, the anti-national service action in 1954, the

camping-in  campaign  and  involvement   in   trade

disputes  leading to riots in 1955  and  1956,  and

more  recently the examination boycott in  1961  to

further  the  Communist opposition  to  merger  and

Malaysia.  The  very  recent  attempt  to  use  the

Singapore  Rural Dwellers' Association premises  to

run  kindergarten classes to indoctrinate  children

and subvert parents is one of the many examples  of

their methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, against this background of subversion, intimidation and open violence is the record of positive growth and expansion in the field of Chinese education planned and executed by the P.A.P. Government in the last four and a half years. Against this base accusation of attempts to

destroy Chinese education is the splendid record of

achievements  which  stare  in  the  eyes  of   the

Communists   and  pro-Communists,  who  fortunately

cannot  blind the people to hard facts and concrete

proof of solid achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all their deception and lies, they cannot deny

that  in 1959, the year the P.A.P. Government first

assumed  office,  there were only  four  Government

Chinese primary schools with an enrolment of 2,508.

As  at 30th June, 1963, there are 21 (including  14

integrated) Government Chinese primary schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



with  an  enrolment of 12,073 - a fourfold increase.

The  increase  in the Government Chinese  secondary

schools  is equally impressive. In 1959 there  were

four Chinese secondary schools with an enrolment of

4,056. In June this year there were nine (including

three  integrated)  schools with  an  enrolment  of

10,428  students  - another big increase.  When  the

proposal  to raise the standard of second  language

is implemented next year, the figures are likely to

double in 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures nail the lie that the P.A.P.

Government  tries to destroy Chinese education.  On

the  other hand, they show that, for the first time

in  the history of Singapore, Chinese education has

been  given  a place to flourish and  grow  in  the

context of the larger national entity. The irony of

the whole thing is that while the anti-national pro-Communist champions of Chinese education shout from

the   roof-tops  about  "preservation  of   Chinese

education"  and  that Chinese parents  should  send

their   children   to  Chinese   schools   to   the

accompaniment  of  intimidation,  assault,   sit-in

strikes,  examination boycotts and  demonstrations,

more  and  more  Chinese parents are sending  their

children to English schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By their ceaseless agitation, intimidation and

violence,  it  is the Communists and pro-Communists

who  are  helping to destroy the growth of  Chinese

education and culture. Their complete disregard for

student  discipline and student welfare has brought

disrepute to Chinese schools and fear among Chinese

parents. Non-Chinese parents no doubt are observing

this  trend  with  great interest  and  alarm.  The

Communists and pro-Communists know that they are to

blame for the present state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter for regret that while it is

becoming increasingly clear to the people that  the

tactics  and  the anti-national activities  of  the

Communists  only  help  to  retard  the  growth  of

Chinese  education,  there are  still  waverers  in

influential journals who are unwilling to  confront

the realities of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



situation.  Whether  it  is about  indiscipline  in

schools,  which  is  tied  up  with  the  Communist

problem, or whether it is outright subversion which

has  today been bared by the Government in numerous

acts  of indiscipline, these people prefer to evade

the  issues of the day. Are they, like some members

of  Management Committees, also easily  intimidated

and cowed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a relatively large expansion of

Malay-medium primary schools. For the first time in

the  history  of  Singapore,  two  Malay  secondary

schools  were  established in  the  first  term  of

office   of   the  P.A.P.  Government.  There   are

altogether  128 Malay secondary classes in  schools

all   over   the  island.  The  first  Malay-medium

secondary  students  have  already  sat   for   the

Federation  of Malaya Certificate Examination  this

year.  Malay  parents  do not  fear  sending  their

children  to  Malay  secondary  schools,   as   the

Communists  have so far not been able to  penetrate

Malay  primary and secondary schools. However,  the

utmost  vigilance  against  subversion  is  equally

necessary in the Malay stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New schools which will begin functioning in

January  1964 are the Blakang Mati Primary  School,

the  Tanjong Rhu Primary School, the Queenstown  IV

Primary School, the Sembawang Malay Primary School,

the  Joo  Avenue Primary School, the  Thomson  Road

Secondary  Vocational  School,  the  Queenstown   V

Secondary   Vocational  School,  the  Old   Kallang

Airport  Secondary Vocational School,  the  Dunearn

Road  Secondary  Technical School,  the  Balestier

Hill  Secondary  Technical  School,  the  Serangoon

Garden   Secondary  Technical   School,   and   the

Queenstown IV Secondary Technical School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the following schools will be under

construction in 1964 and are expected to  be  ready

by January 1965: Wallich Street Primary School, New

Market  Street  Primary  School,  Queenstown   III

(North) and Queenstown III (South) Primary Schools,

Changi Road, 10 m.s. Primary School, Queenstown III

Secondary   Vocational  School,   Queenstown   III

Secondary Academic School and the Changi  Road,  10

m.s. Secondary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



Academic School. Other schools which will be  under

construction  towards  the  latter  part  of   1964

include  the  following: Primary schools  at  Bukit

Timah  Village, Holland Village, Jurong  Industrial

area,  Balestier  Hill West, MacPherson  South  and

Farrer   Road;  secondary  vocational  schools   at

Geylang  Serai, Jalan Ampas, Upper Serangoon  Road,

Whitley   Road/Dunearn  Road  junction;   secondary

academic  schools at Kaki Bukit, Still Road,  Bukit

Ho  Swee; and secondary technical schools at  Upper

Aljunied  Road, a site near the Government Printing

Office, Kim Seng Road and Alexandra Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958, there were 2,000 trainee teachers at the

Teachers'   Training  College.   With   the   rapid

expansion in the school building programme  and  in

the  educational needs of the people generally, the

number  at the T.T.C. has increased to 5,000.  Next

year plans will be ready to build extensions to the

Teachers'  Training  College.  Two  large   lecture

blocks,   catering  mainly  for  technical  teacher

training  and later a library block and a hall-cum-gymnasium will be built at the present site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Polytechnic, entry requirements to the

Professional Diploma Course are being raised,  thus

paving  the way to higher standards and to a higher

status for the institution, the largest of its kind

in  South-East Asia. The Report of the Committee on

the Establishment of a Faculty of Technology in the

University of Singapore is receiving attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generous bursaries have been awarded to

approximately 50 per cent of Singapore students  of

Nanyang   University,  like   the   University   of

Singapore.  To  date, about 500 Nanyang  University

graduates have been appointed to various Government

departments and Government aided secondary schools,

after  selection by the Public Service  Commission.

It  is  a  pity  that  despite  reminders,  Nanyang

University  authorities have so far  not  indicated

whether  they are prepared to accept the Government

Upper  Secondary  II Examination Certificate  as  a

qualification for admission to Nanyang  University.

With  the  abolition  of  the  Senior  Middle   III

Examination in 1962, the first Government Upper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



Secondary  II  Examination  in  Chinese  was   held

recently. This certificate has been accepted  as  a

qualification  for admission to the  University  of

Singapore in 1964. Chinese secondary school leavers

can now join the University of Singapore, after six

years    of   secondary   education,   like   their

counterparts in the English stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these then are the impressive and concrete achievements of the forward planning launched 4½ years ago. They can stand the test of time as much as they can stand any amount of destructive and senseless attacks from any quarter. As a matter of fact, they are like the thick armour

of the tortoise - the more knocks they get, the more

they  reveal  the  achievements, progress,  growth,

expansion   and   development   of   education   in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have listened to the Minister

for  Education. When he first stood up he  gave  us

the impression that he was going to let us know how

the  four  streams of education were  going  to  be

treated  equally,  and  what plans  the  Government

would  have  to  implement  this  policy  of  equal

treatment.  But surprisingly and strangely  enough,

the  Minister concerned has not made any  reply  to

the  points raised by our Members on this side. All

he   has   been   talking  about   is   Communists,

Communists. If we have to count how many times  the

term "Communists" has been used by him, I will  not

be  surprised that it will come to a great  figure.

So  we  just  wonder whether the P.A.P. is  really

interested  in giving equal treatment to  the  four

streams of education in Singapore; and whether  the

Government now can speak on behalf of all those who

are interested in getting equal treatment. In fact,

it  is  very  clear that the P.A.P. is  now  giving

special  favouritism to English  education,  rather

than  any other stream. I hope the P.A.P. will  be

able  to  explain  this  allegation.  The  Minister

concerned   has  not  been  able  to  explain   the

qualifications  required for entry into  the  civil

service.  He  has  not  been  able  to  answer  the

question as to the number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



of  schools  built in respect of each of  the  four

streams  of education. The figures for the  schools

for each stream of education are not available even

up to now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the question of education autonomy, I

shall go into this matter further when I deal  with

the motion under discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has taken a lot of time in this House to give people the impression that his Ministry has done a great deal to improve the lot of the rural people. But he seems to have forgotten the real difficulties of the rural people. Concerning the aid that the Minister for National Development says is being given to the rural people, I shall deal with it later when I go further into the motion. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not beyond our expectations that the policy statement of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has shown that the P.A.P. has been very clever in evading the main issues. In this policy statement of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, all that the Government has said is, "Oh!

these  questions belong to the Central  Government.

They  are the responsibility of Kuala Lumpur."  So,

from  this  tune  in  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech,  we can note three characteristic features.

Namely,  shirking of responsibility and passing  it

on  to the Central Government, deceptive propaganda

of  the P.A.P., and hollow arguments. These are the

three  characteristics of the recent speech by  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very strange, Mr Speaker, that in his

lengthy   speech  delivered  on   behalf   of   the

Government, there has been no talk of the political

future and development of Singapore. There has been

no plan for the political development of the people

of  Singapore. The P.A.P. now has seen fit to avoid

the  use  of such common phraseology as a "common",

"happy", "prosperous", "socialist society". In fact

the  P.A.P. has entirely forgotten  the  political

rights  of the people. It is not quite correct  for

the  State  Government to leave out  the  political

issues of the people entirely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the solution of the problem of

unemployment, I dare say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



this  is a problem that occupies the minds of  many

people  in  Singapore, and is  the  most  important

question  awaiting solution. But  regrettably  this

matter  has not been adequately dealt with  in  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech. In fact,  it  has

been  entirely left out rather than dealt  with  in

any  manner. Instead the speech goes to some length

to deal with the talk on industrialisation. We ask,

is  this P.A.P. Government a new Government for the

first  term? They have been in office for one term,

but  what  has  been done to solve the  problem  of

unemployment  over these years? We  say  they  have

done  nothing.  On the other hand, the  problem  of

unemployment is getting worse. This can be shown by

the  swelling number of hawkers that  one  sees  at

every  street  corner of this island. The  swelling

number  of hawkers is a standing monument to  prove

the  gravity  of  the  problem of  unemployment  in

Singapore, and this problem has been aggravated  by

the confrontation that Singapore is facing now.  At

present,  there  are  at least  100,000  unemployed

people  in  Singapore. This is enough to  show  the

gravity  of  the  problem  and,  coupled  with  the

confrontation  between Malaysia and  Indonesia,  it

has  become  worse. Why should the  P.A.P. try  to

cover  up this unemployment problem and turn  round

and pretend to say that Singapore is a paradise  on

earth and an oasis of plenty? We must realise  that

a  lot of merchants, employees, stevedores, harbour

workers  and  hawkers in the waterfront  have  been

thrown  out  of  employment  and  they  are  facing

bankruptcy  as  a  result of the present  political

situation.  Who  has  brought  about  this  unhappy

situation?  I  say that it is the P.A.P.  And  this

situation  will  give  rise  to  a  vicious   chain

reaction  of an economic nature, but the P.A.P. is

pretending not to know of the existence of  such  a

situation.  If  the  P.A.P  still  maintains   that

industrialisation  will  solve   the   problem   of

unemployment, then I say that this is  a  statement

of self-deception. There are several kinds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



of  industrialisation.  You have  the  capitalistic

industrialisation, imperialistic  industrialisation

and  socialistic  industrialisation.  As  long   as

Singapore's  economic  structure  is  still  of   a

colonial nature, the unemployment problem will  not

be  easily solved. Let us look at America which  is

supposed to be industrially advanced. There are  at

least  six  million people unemployed  in  America,

which   is   supposed  to  be  at   its   peak   of

industrialisation.  There  are  about  1.8  million

people unemployed in Britain, which is also another

industrially advanced country. So this  shows  that

industrialisation alone is not sufficient to  solve

the problem of unemployment. We do not have to wait

for   five   years  to  see  that   the   so-called

industrialisation programme of the P.A.P. will  not

solve  the  problem of unemployment  in  Singapore,

because  at  the  very  most  a  hundred  per  cent

achievement   of   the   P.A.P. industrialisation

programme  will not give more than 40,000  jobs  to

the  people  of Singapore. So the industrialisation

programme  will not be able to produce enough  jobs

for  the  increasing  number of  job-seekers.  This

situation  can be likened to the attempted  pursuit

of  the  sun by the moon. There will never  be  any

possibility of the moon overtaking the sun. So  you

will  see  and  you can expect that the  people  of

Singapore, in spite of what the P.A.P. is trying to

do  in industrialisation, will continue to live  in

misery  in  the next five years - if not in  greater

misery.  And  this problem of unemployment  in  the

face of a declining economy will come to a head  in

time  to  come  and, coupled with the confrontation

which, according to the Minister for Finance,  will

put  our  economy  back by two years,  will  become

worse.  So,  by that time there may  be  a  lot  of

parks,  swimming pools and fountains in  Singapore.

[Interruption] Mr Speaker, Sir, we therefore  urge

the  P.A.P. to put forward a concrete plan to solve

the  grave problem of unemployment in an honest and

practical  way  instead  of  evading  it.  In  this

connection, the P.A.P. seems to be totally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



helpless  and entirely at a loss. Singapore  has  a

revenue  of  $400  million,  but  as  a  result  of

Malaysia,  it  will  have to  pay  to  the  Central

Government more than $100 million, and as a  result

of  the confrontation, it will have to lose another

$290  million.  The Prime Minister pretends  to  be

calm  by saying that the confrontation of Indonesia

only  affects  our economy by eight per  cent.  The

fact  is  that,  according  to  the  Minister   for

Finance, the loss of $290 million has brought about

the lowering of our national income by 8.7 per cent

and  this  is  not insignificant.  So  no  one  can

pretend  that  this  loss  is  insignificant.   His

admission is sufficient to show the falsity of  the

speech by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the question of economy, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech is also full of pessimism. It shows that the Government is at best only able to prevent the present standard of living from falling. That means in the next few years the standard of living of our people will not be

raised.  All  that  the Government  can  do  is  to

prevent  it  from  falling.  That  means  that  our

standard of living will remain at a standstill.  Is

this talk not full of pessimism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning trade in Singapore, it has been stated

in  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech  that  the

problems  relating to trade between  Singapore  and

Indonesia  will  have  to  depend  on  the  Central

Government. Now, as a responsible State Government,

the P.A.P. should at least have the courage to urge

the  Central Government to solve the problems.  You

just  cannot  say that you have to  depend  on  the

Central Government every now and then. For how long

are  you  going to depend on the Central Government

if  you keep on saying this? Singapore is, in fact,

now  faced with a great problem as a result of  the

confrontation by Indonesia. The P.A.P. seem to give

the  impression  that if you  want  to  trade  with

Indonesia,  then  you  must go  and  speak  to  the

Central Government as this is not a matter for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



State  Government.  Now, this is  an  irresponsible

attitude  to  take. On the face of  it,  the  State

Government seems to be very servile to the  Central

Government,   but  actually  it  is  shirking   its

responsibility  towards the  people  of  Singapore.

This attitude will not bring about national unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On economic problems, the P.A.P has made a lot of

presumptions. For example, it is stated in the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's speech that  there  are  great

differences between the Government of Singapore and

the  Government of the Federation of Malaya insofar

as  economic problems are concerned and that if the

Federation Government should take rash action, then

such  action would reverse the enlightened policies

of the State Government of Singapore. It is strange

that  at the beginning of the speech, it is  stated

that the people of Singapore and the Federation  of

Malaya  have been united by Malaysia but later  on,

it  goes  on  to  state that there  are  a  lot  of

unpleasantness  and  differences  between  the  two

Governments. Now all these are indications to  show

that  there will be unhappiness in future and  that

the P.A.P. Government has not got the guts to bring

up  economic problems for solution with the Central

Government. In other words, our orders have  to  be

decided  by  the  Central Government  and  this  is

stated  in the policy speech of His Excellency.  If

we  disregard,  as the policy statement  says,  the

social   problems   and   economic   injustice   in

Singapore, then we shall run the risk of having  to

face  dissatisfaction generated by  the  Communists

and  the pro-Communist cadres. Now, this is the way

by  which  the P.A.P. hopes to coerce  the  Central

Government  into  giving in to the  P.A.P. in  the

economic field. In other words, the P.A.P. seems to

indicate that if there is any dissatisfaction  over

economic  problems, then the responsibility  should

be   placed   on  the  shoulders  of  the   Central

Government. And so the Central Government, in order

to  avoid such blame, should give in to the  P.A.P.

From  this,  we  can  see that  the  phoney  merger

brought about by the P.A.P. is actually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



a  sell-out of the interests of the people  to  the

Central Government. It also goes a step further  to

show  that the P.A.P. is trying to play a  game  of

deception between the people of Singapore  and  the

Central  Government. [Interruption] As a socialist,

I  have  to face facts and realities. You  can  say

whatever you like. These are your usual tactics  to

smear others. The Central Government is reactionary

in  nature.  We  dare to say that, and  so  is  the

P.A.P.  We  say that the P.A.P. is cunning  and  we

have  said it many times. In spite of the fact that

we  have  been  conscribed and  restricted  by  the

Government, we have said openly that we  have  full

confidence in our future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of autonomy in education, a clear

statement was made in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech. What is meant by autonomy in education? The

statement  says  that  it is essential  that  there

should  be  confidence and good faith  between  the

Central Government and the State Government in  the

handling of the security problem in all educational

institutions,  including the incipient  problem  in

the  University of Singapore. It is only  when  the

Central   Government  does  not  doubt   that   the

Singapore  Government has no intention of hindering

the Central Government from discharging its primary

duty  of  ensuring  that no Communist  activity  is

subverting  the nation in educational  institutions

that  we can exercise our autonomy in education  to

the  best advantage. I dare not believe that  there

will  be  autonomy  in education.  If  autonomy  in

education  is  revoked, it will  be  unpleasant  to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about equal treatment for the four streams

of  education, it is another well-known fraud.  The

Government intends to provide $8.5 million to  help

the  University of Singapore and if  the  questions

are settled, this amount will be increased further.

But   what  has  the  Government  done  to  Nanyang

University? The Government has not given  a  single

cent  to  Nanyang University. It is said that  when

the problem of reorganisation of Nanyang University

is   settled,  the  Government  will  provide  some

financial aid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget no provision is made for

Nanyang  University and, according to  the  Budget,

there  will  be  only  $300,000  surplus.  Now,  if

Indonesia     continues    with    its     economic

confrontation, our entrepot trade will be  corroded

still  further. In order to give financial  aid  to

Nanyang  University, the Government will then  have

to  increase the burden of taxation on the  people,

using the aid as a pretext.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the so-called integrated schools, it is

another scheme to foster English education  at  the

expense of Chinese education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech deliberately omits the important

problem  of  rural  farmers.  Our  farmers   yearly

produce  about $150 million worth of farm products.

In   the  1959  elections,  the  P.A.P.'s  election

pamphlet  talked  about the importance  of  finding

ways and means to increase our food production.  It

is  as  important as industrialisation. Now,  after

having been in office for five years, what has  the

P.A.P. done to help these farmers and to carry  out

its  pledge? We cannot find from the speech of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  anything  concerning  the

rural  farmers.  They have increased  our  national

wealth   and   help  to  solve   the   problem   of

unemployment. This fact cannot be denied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. manifesto says that the farmers have

produced a large number of poultry, pigs and  eggs,

that  we are quite self-sufficient, and that  there

is an excess for export. The manifesto also goes on

to  say  that our farmers have achieved this solely

by  their efforts and industry. The past Government

and the present Government have done very little to

support  and  to encourage them. Now  let  us  see.

After  having been in office for five  years,  what

have  they  done  to encourage and to  support  the

farmers?   It   is  true  the  Primary   Production

Department  has sold some pigs to the  farmers  and

has   carried  out  injections  for  poultry,   but

whenever the poultry of the farmers is attacked  by

disease,  the Government is helpless. It cannot  do

anything. The Primary Production Department  serves

only   as  a  propaganda  machine.  Some  effective

medicines which can cure the disease are  not  sold

to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



farmers on the pretext that these are poisonous. Do

you think the farmers will kill themselves by using

these drugs? Facts are facts. This is an example of

Government  trying to limit the food production  of

our farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, such an important policy speech has totally neglected the 200,000 odd farmers. Do they think that our food products will compete with foreign food products? Or has the Government no intention to help the farmers? Our farmers are waiting for their answer. The most urgent problem

for  them is the question of security of their land

and  the security of land lease. The Government has

not  made  any  legislation to protect  their  land

lease.  In the 1959 elections the P.A.P. said  they

would make use of the power of land acquisition  to

help  farmers acquire land and give them  permanent

land  lease.  They are deceiving the  people.  What

they said they have not carried out. "Land which is

used  for speculation will be requisitioned by  the

Government to give to the farmers who have no kind,

and  the rent of the land will be reasonable."  The

pamphlet  also says that the land will be  reserved

for the farmers only and not for other people. Now,

we  want to ask the Government, where and when  has

the Government done this? What land has it acquired

for the farmers? The facts show to the contrary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Master Plan of Singapore about 100,000

farmers  will have to face eviction. This Plan  was

drafted  by  the past Government and recognised  by

the P.A.P. This Master Plan will be detrimental  to

the  interests of the farmers and will only benefit

the great land speculators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I learned that in Lim Chu Kang area

the  Government made use of police and riot  squads

to evict farmers from their land and demolish their

houses.  This is not the first occasion.  This  has

happened  in the past. And this picture  shows  how

the  P.A.P. help  the farmers. They  make  use  of

police  and  riot squads to evict the farmers.  The

farmers' families have been expelled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



from  their  houses.  We hope the  Government  will

solve  the  fundamental  problem  of  the  people's

livelihood  and  not  just  build  houses.  It   is

imperative for me to tell this House that  in  1960

the  P.A.P. bought a piece of land at Lim Chu  Kang

for the purpose of agriculture, but they demolished

about  forty houses on this piece of land belonging

to  the farmers. In 1962 these farmers sent a joint

letter  to  the Government asking them  to  provide

them  with  land so that they could  continue  with

their farming activities. But what was the reply of

the  Government?  They used  the  police  and  riot

squads  to pull down their houses. This is the  way

the P.A.P. helps the farmers, and this is their so-called  rural  policy. How can you  say  that  what

happened  this  morning was absurd,  did  not  take

place?  The P.A.P. Government are singularly silent

on this important question. Instead they talk about

the  building  of roads and providing water  supply

and  other facilities for transporting the farmers'

produce.  These are important to a certain  extent,

but  they  should have been done in  1963,  because

these works were scheduled to be completed in 1963.

But the Government did not make use of the funds as

provided  in  the Budget. On the other  hand,  they

boast about the so-called surplus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P. Government deliberately neglect the question of protecting the farmers and stabilising the prices of food products but instead talk about building houses, is this not a case of putting the cart before the horse? You only build roads and bridges and houses. This is

consumption, this is not production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. neglect the interests of the vast

majority  of the people in favour of a  few  vested

interests. Now, how have the Government dealt  with

the  problem  in  Yio Chu Kang district?  What  the

P.A.P. can boast of is how many houses  they  have

built.  "We build houses for the people  to  stay."

The  rural people are not foolish people. They know

the  importance of sanitation. Everybody knows  how

to enjoy life. The P.A.P. have evicted farmers from

their land in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



order  to clear the sites for building houses,  and

this is not what the people want. In the past,  the

P.A.P. talked about building houses  to  suit  the

lower  income  group of people. But they  have  not

done  so. Attap houses in the rural areas have been

demolished and squatters have been chased here  and

there.  They  have lost their means of  livelihood.

How  can  you  expect  them to  stay  in  so-called

beautiful houses built by the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the rural problem, you may remember

that  the  P.A.P. owe a debt to  the  people.  For

example,  the  P.A.P. talked about  protecting  the

people's  land  and  about  lowering  the  cost  of

production for the farmers. They also talked  about

building  a model rural fishing village. These  are

things which can be done and should be done because

they  are very urgently required. They are not  the

moon, the sun, and the stars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best that the P.A.P. can do is to implement

the past Five-Year Plan. Have they the guts to face

facts? Have they the guts to face the criticisms of

the  people? All this depends on whether  they  are

sincere in improving the lot of the people. Whether

the  implementation  of  their  policy  will  bring

benefits to the people or not depends upon  whether

they  are going to discard and abandon their  anti-people stand.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only want

to  spend  a  few minutes to reply  to  the  points

raised by the Member for Hong Lim, one of which was

on  the Indonesian confrontation. I would not  like

to  waste  the  Assembly's time  by  rebutting  the

absurd statements uttered by Barisan Members  about

economic policy, rural development, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has raised a number of

proposals  which  he  has  asked  us  to   consider

seriously  and  not to reject them  merely  because

they  came from the Opposition. Sir, the Government

has  always  been willing to consider  constructive

proposals  from the Opposition, even  from  Barisan

Opposition  if  they should by  some  miracle  have

something constructive to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the speech of the Member for Hong Lim on the

subject    of    Indonesian    confrontation    was

refreshingly  different from his  former  habit  of

engaging in a political harangue. He tries to trace

in  some  detail  the  consequences  of  the  trade

boycott.  But I think he exaggerated the extent  of

the   damage  which  confrontation  can  bring   to

Singapore when he said that we will suffer a 50 per

cent  decline of our national income. The Estimates

made  by  the  Government were  based  on  recorded

statistics of imports and exports and on  estimates

of national income made each year by the Department

of  Statistics.  The Member for Hong  Lim  believes

that  the  figures for Indonesian trade  have  been

grossly under-valued for various reasons. I do  not

agree that in respect of manifested cargo, that is,

cargo  for  which  documents are presented  to  the

Import  and Export Department, there has  been  any

significant  degree  of  under-valuation,  for  the

simple reason that Singapore is a free port.  There

are  no  import  duties or export duties  on  these

goods,  and there is accordingly no inducement  for

traders  to falsify their declarations.  I  do  not

know  and  I  would not hazard a guess  as  to  the

accuracy   of   the  documents  prepared   at   the

Indonesian  end,  but our figures  of  imports  and

exports  are  based on documents submitted  to  the

Department  of Imports and Exports, although  there

is  a  certain amount of unmanifested  cargo  which

goes   in  small  boats  or  wooden  boats  or   as

travellers'  personal effects. But I do  not  think

the  total  amount of such trade  amounts  to  very

much.  I  am very glad to hear from the Member  for

Hong  Lim that it is his earnest hope that we  will

take  measures to ensure that Singapore  continues,

in his own words, "her old prosperity". This is the

first   time  that  he  has  admitted,  unwittingly

perhaps,  that Singapore has been prosperous  under

the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Hong Lim raised ten specific

points and I will deal with them in turn. First  he

proposed  that  we  ask the Federal  Government  to

negotiate   with  the  Indonesian  Government   for

settlement  of confrontation. I can assure  Members

that we have left



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



no   stone   unturned  to  secure  an   honourable

settlement   on   the   differences   between   the

Indonesians  and  us. But as Tun Razak  once  said,

this  settlement  must be final as  it  is  no  use

reaching a temporary settlement which can be broken

at  any  time. And nobody will be happier  than  we

will be to see a permanent end to confrontation and

the   restoration   of  friendly   and   honourable

relations between Malaysia and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim next proposed that we

request  the  Federal Government to  channel  goods

from  various  parts of Malaysia  to  Singapore  in

order  that  our factories and traders affected  by

confrontation  can continue their  businesses.  Now

one  of  the  first  acts of the P.A.P.  Government

after  confrontation  was to  put  exactly  such  a

request  to  the Federal Government. A meeting  was

arranged  in Kuala Lumpur more than two months  ago

at  which  representatives from all  the  Malaysian

territories  were  present.  Ways  and   means   of

ensuring  a  supply  of  goods  to  Singapore  were

discussed. As a result of this meeting, a Singapore

Trade  Mission will shortly visit Sabah and Sarawak

with  a  view  to  increasing  the  supply  of  raw

materials  for  those  territories.  Already   some

fairly  good results have been achieved in  respect

of  copra  and we are now working on plans  whereby

the imports of copra from Sabah and Sarawak may  be

increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third proposal of the Member for Hong Lim is

to  waive import duties on Singapore goods entering

the  other territories of Malaysia. This, in  fact,

is  precisely what the common market is designed to

achieve. The machinery for the establishment of the

common   market  is  in  an  advanced   degree   of

preparation, and early next year we should see  the

first  step towards the establishment of  a  common

market taking place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the fourth proposal of the Member for Hong Lim

is  to  reduce  licence  fees  for  businesses  and

factories  affected by confrontation.  He  did  not

give  any details as to what licence fees could  be

reduced  to advantage. As far as I am aware,  these

licence fees are nominal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



administrative    charges   levied    by    various

departments and they are by no means onerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth proposal. The Member for Hong Lim also

drew  attention to the credit squeeze  difficulties

which  merchants involved in Indonesian  trade  are

experiencing,  particularly  in  regard   to   bank

overdrafts. He expects that the credit squeeze will

take place on or before the end of December 1963. I

have  already  given attention to this  matter  and

have  held discussions with leading bankers on  the

subject.   Their   view  is  that  the   Indonesian

confrontation, far from resulting in a tight  money

supply to Singapore, will in fact produce an easier

credit  situation. There is therefore little reason

to  believe that banks will bring undue pressure to

bear  upon these merchants towards the end of  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth proposal relates to an assurance that

the  Bank  of  China will be allowed  to  continue.

Under the terms of the White Paper on Merger, which

the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  had  in  the  past  so

strenuously    denigrated,   control    over    the

registration or de-registration of banks rests with

the  Singapore  Government and  I  have  previously

given an assurance that the Bank of China will  not

be closed down. That assurance still stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh point of the Member for Hong Lim is

that  the Government should give an assurance  that

we will not take reprisals in the way of seizure of

properties   and  assets  belonging  to  Indonesian

nationals  in Singapore. It is not the practice  of

the  Government  to  seize  assets  and  properties

belonging to private citizens, be they nationals of

this  country  or  nationals  of  other  countries,

without due process of the law and without adequate

compensation.  We  have  taken  action  to   freeze

certain  external accounts of Indonesian  nationals

in  Singapore banks to ensure that this money  will

not  be  used against us. But unlike the Government

of  Indonesia,  we  do  not  regard  the  arbitrary

seizure of properties and assets as a proper policy

of Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim in his eighth point

recommends  labour intensive projects. This  matter

is  already  in hand and the Minister for  National

Development is personally taking charge to step  up

the  construction of roads, drains  and  irrigation

canals and other labour intensive projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two points raised by the Member for Hong

Lim  relate to public assistance and Housing  Board

rent  concessions. The Government's  policy  is  to

assist Singapore citizens in distress and it is for

this  purpose  that substantial sums of  money  - in

fact  $1  million a month - are paid out by  way  of

public  assistance. As regards Housing  Board  rent

concessions,  it  must  be  remembered  that  while

genuine   cases  have  always  been   viewed   with

sympathy, there is a limit to the arrears  of  rent

that can be allowed to accumulate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point of the Member for Hong Lim is to

request  the  Governments of Sabah and  Sarawak  to

make  a  special  effort to absorb  the  unemployed

workers  in Singapore who have been laid off  as  a

result  of confrontation. More than a month  ago  I

have  written  to the Federal Government  with  the

request that early discussions be commenced on this

matter.  The  Member  for Hong Lim  will  doubtless

recollect  that under the financial  terms  of  the

Malaysian  Agreement,  which  he  had  so  bitterly

denounced  as being utterly inadequate.  Sabah  and

Sarawak  will employ from Singapore half  the  work

force  on  their development projects  financed  by

money from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all the worth-while proposals which the Member

for  Hong  Lim  made in his speech have,  in  fact,

since  confrontation, been items of policy  of  the

Singapore  Government. Some of these, in fact  most

of  these, have already been made public. I am very

pleased to note that the Member for Hong Lim  makes

it  a  habit  to make a serious study of Government

statements in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the immediate future there are two practical

measures that we must take. There is need to ensure

that  the  workers who are laid off do  not  suffer

abject  poverty and penury. And this is the purpose

of the economic defence scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



which I have described in my Budget statement  last

week.  The next thing that needs to be done  is  to

ensure  that  where workers can be  re-employed  in

other   industries,  this  is  done  in  the   most

expeditious manner possible. The machinery to carry

out these two measures has already been set up, and

I  have laid before the Assembly two Bills to  give

legislative   authority  for  the   Government   to

implement these measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  after  hearing  the  Minister   for

Finance,  I  cannot help but come to the conclusion

that he has been lying. In his reply to the various

points  raised by the Member for Hong Lim, such  as

the  request  to  be made to Sabah and  Sarawak  to

absorb Singapore labour, the Minister says that  he

has  taken  steps to ensure that Sabah and  Sarawak

will  absorb  about  half  its  labour  force  from

Singapore in projects financed by Singapore. I have

some  facts  and figures to show that he  has  been

lying on this point. This is a newspaper of ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Jalan Kayu note

that  he  must  not make personal  attacks  on  the

conduct  of  a  Minister? I think he has  suggested

that the Minister has been lying. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I am saying

is  that the Minister concerned has engaged himself

in irresponsible talk. I have here the Sin Chew Jit

Poh of Sunday, the 8th of December. Mr Stephens of

Sabah is reported to have said that he would rather

have   labour   elsewhere  than   from   Singapore.

[Interruption] You are all kayu. You are led by the

nose   by   the   capitalists   and   imperialists.

[Interruption]  You  are  all  blockheads.  It   is

unfortunate that your parents have given  birth  to

people like you. You can see for yourself that this

is  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh of Sunday, 8th  December,

1963, page 1 of Malaysian News. According to  this

news  item,  there  are several measures  taken  by

Sabah;  one of which is the application for permits

by  labourers from outside before they can ever  be

allowed  to  enter  Sabah and  Sarawak.  The  Sabah

Government lays down that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



any  applicant who wishes to be employed  in  Sabah

must  already  be drawing a salary  of  $1,200  per

month before he can be admitted into Sabah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the problem of education, the Minister

for Education has been boasting about the number of

students  in  schools. There are  still  a  lot  of

delinquent urchins in the streets of Singapore. The

P.A.P. say  that the Barisan Sosialis  is  running

literacy classes to indoctrinate these children. Is

it possible to inculcate Communistic ideas into the

heads  of such young children? As a matter of fact,

these young children need others to help them  when

they  mess themselves up. They are not even capable

of  understanding and the P.A.P. talk of adults  in

these  classes.  How can they be  indoctrinated  by

Communistic ideas? All that I can say is that  this

talk  of  Communism  only goes  to  show  that  the

Ministers  and  Backbenchers  of  the  P.A.P. are

suffering  from the Communist phobia, and  that  is

why they always indulge in accusing others of being

Communists. They even say that children are capable

of accepting Communism. What absurd talk!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I know that this speech has been

drafted   by   some   Political   Secretaries    in

conjunction  with  some  Permanent  Secretaries  in

Government  service. There is nothing  new  in  the

speech. I fully support the amendment, moved by  my

colleague, to the motion in the name of  the  Prime

Minister.  As  time  passes, the  validity  of  the

opposition of the Barisan Sosialis to Malaysia  can

he proved. We oppose Malaysia out of our patriotism

and love for our country. There are facts to refute

the allegation that we are loyal to foreign powers.

As  a matter of fact, the British imperialists  and

colonialists have in a very cunning way made use of

the  local  stooges  to  look  after  their  vested

interests  and these stooges have fallen  into  the

trap of the Fascists. They are making use of "white

terror" to deal a blow to those who are opposed  to

imperialistic  colonialism.  Malaysia  has  brought

disaster to this region, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. are  running  away  from  such  realities.

Instead of squarely facing such realities, they are

shifting the blame to others. They accuse those who

oppose  Malaysia  of  being  Communist  and   anti-nationalist elements. They brand them as stooges of

foreign  powers. They do this in order to  put  the

blame for the bad consequences of Malaysia on other

people. Malaysia has brought about some unrest  and

greater unemployment in Singapore. There has been a

trade  recession  in  Singapore  as  a  result   of

Malaysia brought about by the P.A.P. It is not  the

result, as the Minister for Labour has accused  us,

of the action of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. are not only indulging in "white terror", but they are also pretending to make use of the open argument to deceive the people into believing that they are democratic. The open argument has been harped upon time and again over the last few years. But what are the facts? The

facts are that they control the Press, with all the

advantages of the publicity machinery, and this has

been used by the Government against the population.

There have been arrests of trade union leaders  and

the  suppression of the Opposition. All these facts

show  that they have departed from their policy  of

the  open  argument. If you really  want  the  open

argument,  then you must not have any control  over

the freedom of association of the people, the trade

unions  and other civic organisations. They  should

not restrict others from making speeches freely  if

they  really believe in the open argument. If  they

still  say  that they believe in the open argument,

then  they  should  allow others to  publish  their

statements  freely in the newspapers.  They  should

not  control the newspapers. As a matter  of  fact,

statements issued by the people, other than  P.A.P.

statements,  are  usually not given  any  space  in

publications. How can you then say that there  is

in   existence  the  open  argument?  So   far   as

understand,  the so-called Communists described  by

the  P.A.P. are  none other than  their  political

opponents. The so-called Communists referred to  by

the  P.A.P. are none other than the true  patriots

like us in the Barisan Sosialis. All



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



that  the new Members over there can do now  is  to

describe  their political opponents  as  Communists

and  then  put the blame on them. That  amounts  to

giving a dog a bad name and hang it. These are  the

tactics  adopted  by  the  British  against   their

political   opponents.  The  Communist  Party   was

declared  an  illegal organisation.  They  were  in

opposition to Japanese aggression after the  Second

World   War.  They  then  rose  to  oppose  British

colonialism and, as a result, they were declared an

illegal Party by the British Government. From  that

time  onwards  all patriots have been described  as

Communists by the British Government which was then

in  Singapore.  Now the P.A.P. are using  the  same

tactics    against   their   political   opponents.

[Interruption] Look at yourselves. You have changed

your allegations against the Barisan Sosialis. When

we  were  first organised as the Barisan  Sosialis,

you described us as the open-front organisation  of

the  Communists getting directions from  Indonesia.

Later   on   you   said  that  we  were   receiving

instructions from Russia. Then you changed and said

we were pro-Communists, pro-Indonesia and what not.

You start changing your stories from time to time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for

your  direction. Yesterday they changed their usual

stand.  All their speeches were mainly concentrated

on  the argument that we were to be blamed for  the

disasters and failures and all the bad consequences

that  have been brought about through Malaysia.  In

other  words, they are saying that all  these  evil

consequences  have been brought about  through  the

instigation  of the Barisan Sosialis in  persuading

the  Indonesian Government to boycott us. They  are

saying that all this has been brought about by  our

instigation  and collaboration with the  Indonesian

Government. Mr Speaker, why should the P.A.P. make

such  speeches? They twist the facts. It is because

they  cannot  disclose what they are doing  to  the

people.   That   is  why  they  are   making   such

sophisticated  talk. That is why they  are  putting

the  blame  on  us  for  Indonesia's  confrontation

against  Singapore. In the past Right-wing elements

in Indonesia were directed by the U.S. imperialists

and  they  started anti-Chinese moves in Indonesia.

They  thus caused dissatisfaction among the Chinese

population  in  this region. The P.A.P. have  been

using this tactic in order to make the people  have

doubts  about us. Now they are trying  to  put  the

blame for the bad consequences of Malaysia on us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, neo-colonialism after the

formation  of Malaysia, according to the Government

report,  has  caused economic losses  to  Singapore

amounting  to  8.7 per cent of our national  income

and about 8,000 workers are affected by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia's confrontation policy. According  to  my

information,  these figures are  not  correct.  The

prosperity of Singapore has been brought about as a

result  of smuggling between the two countries.  We

have  to  depend more on Indonesia. These smuggling

activities  have  been curtailed by  confrontation.

The  sudden  change in the economic  situation  has

caused  a  loss of more than 8.7 per cent  and  the

number of workers unemployed is more than what  the

Minister has made it out to be. As far as  I  know,

the  workers affected number about 50,000. All this

has  been due to the P.A.P.'s subservience to their

colonial masters in taking their directions. It  is

you  who have brought about these consequences  and

you must bear the responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk on other points made in the

policy speech. The Government taxes the people  and

therefore  it  should be obliged to provide  social

amenities  and  social facilities for  the  people.

Since  the  people are obliged to pay  taxes,  they

should then have the right to enjoy social benefits

and  facilities. These are not free gifts.  Because

of  limitation  of time, I would  like  to  try  to

shorten my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with one important question

because  my colleagues are also very interested  in

this question. As a farmer myself, I make my speech

on  behalf of the farmers. At present, there  is  a

very serious problem faced by the farmers which  is

caused   by  the  Government's  misdeeds  and   bad

policies.  This  is  about  the  problem  faced  by

poultry  farmers; that is, pullorum, a  disease  of

the  chickens the spread of which is very  serious,

and  the  risk  of this disease spreading  is  very

great  indeed. Once this disease infects a chicken-shed,  thousands  of chickens will  perish.  It  is

something like cholera, but it is not so serious as

this  particular  disease, which  is  prevalent  in

Singapore  and causes the farmers much  loss.  When

they went to see the veterinary officers, they were

told that the Government at the moment did not have

the drugs to prevent the spread of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



disease because the Government had put a ban on the

import of such drugs. The veterinary officers  also

said that the disease originated elsewhere. It  has

been spreading in Singapore for more than one year.

This  is  a very serious problem which the  farmers

have  been faced with. But for more than  one  year

the  Government  has not tried to  do  anything  to

resolve this problem. Does this not go to show that

the  Government is not really interested in solving

this problem in the welfare of the farmers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch on some other points.

The  P.A.P. have  all  along  been  stressing  and

harping  on their four objectives, one of which  is

housing.  I will now rebut this. The Prime Minister

said that the first objective was to industrialise.

But  I  would like to point out that they are  only

making propaganda and paying lip service instead of

doing    the    actual   work.   The    plan    for

industrialisation  has been declared  for  so  many

years  and  yet nothing has been done about  it.  I

would  like  to ask, since there has been  so  much

publicity about industrialisation: how many workers

have   been  employed?  To  what  extent  has   the

unemployment  problem been solved?  The  Government

dare  not  give  any reply. I would  say  that  the

Jurong  industrialisation project is a  product  of

neo-colonialism  because the  neo-colonialists  are

making  use of this project to control our  economy

through  a new tactic. I would say that since  this

industrialisation plan is controlled  by  the  neo-colonialists  it  can  never  succeed.   Industrial

products  will have to depend on available markets.

They  claim  that  there  is  a  common  market  in

Malaysia.  But  before any success can  be  derived

from  the  common market, there should be  economic

freedom,  without  which nothing can  be  achieved.

Now,  this  common  market is  designed  to  enable

foreign imports to be free from import duties,  and

the half-finished products to be assembled locally.

It   will  provide  a  convenient  cover  for   the

interests  of the foreign capitalists.  Thus  after

these  half-finished  products  are  brought   into

Singapore and manufactured into consumer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



goods, they can be exempted from tariffs and  other

taxes     under    the    cover    of     so-called

industrialisation. This plan is really a design  to

help the ---
