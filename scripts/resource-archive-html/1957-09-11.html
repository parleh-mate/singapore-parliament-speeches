to Mr Speaker of the Federal Legislative Council the

resolution of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received a reply from Mr Speaker of the Federal

Legislative Council dated 22nd August, 1957. It reads

as follows:



"Dear Mr Speaker,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your letter . . . dated the 21st

August, 1957.

of  certain  other Members of this Assembly  to  have

been  able  to be present in the Federal  Legislative

Chamber on 3rd September, 1957, when the Message  was

conveyed   to  Members  of  the  Federal  Legislative

of  any  such  case. The second part of the  question

arise.

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare whether he is aware of the inconvenience

to  people in having to wait in a long queue, and  of

the  hardship  to  them in having to incur  transport

expenses, when collecting allowances under the Public

Assistance  Scheme at the Social Welfare  Department;

and whether he will arrange for such allowances to be

paid at the post offices nearest to their homes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware of

the inconvenience referred to by the Member for Tiong

Bahru.  For  this reason additional staff  have  been

recruited  and are now being trained for the  setting

up  of  branch relief centres for the convenience  of

relief  recipients. It is hoped to set  up  two  such

branches  early next year, one in Bukit  Panjang  and

the other in Geylang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of post offices for this purpose has

already been suggested as part of a general review of

the social security system in Singapore. I would like

to  assure  the Member for Tiong Bahru  that  if  the

arrangements  for using post offices are practicable,

they will be implemented.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE SPORTS STADIUM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon</b> asked the Chief Secretary, with

reference to the Singapore Sports Stadium,-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many members are at present serving on the

Board of Management;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many vacancies are there in the Board;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether any action has been taken to fill the

vacancies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) whether the Government will provide the Board of

Management with the necessary funds and facilities to

build a sports stadium;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) whether any land has been earmarked for the

building of such a stadium; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) whether he is aware of the inactivity of the

Board of Management and the reasons therefor.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, the Stadium Board has been

allowed to lapse because the funds required to  build

the    stadium   were   not   forthcoming.   In   the

circumstances,  I  do  not think  that  the  detailed

points raised by the Member call for a reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

can  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary tell  us  then  is

there any intention by the Government to re-establish

this  Board  in  view  of the  sports  activities  in

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> The position of the Board, Sir, is that

it  has  been allowed to lapse because we can see  no

prospect  of  the funds required to build  a  stadium

being obtainable. In the absence of some prospect  of

funds  I  do  not  think any useful purpose  will  be

served by reappointing the Board.

<div align="center"><b>TAX ORDINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Financial Secretary

whether  and what action has been taken to set  up  a

Committee  to  review the Income Tax Ordinance  (Cap.

166).



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, the hon. Member will recall

that  during  the  debate on his motion  at  the  May

sitting  of the Assembly, the Hon. the Chief Minister

said that taxation policy was the sole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2522</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  of Government and  that  he  was  not

prepared  to  delegate  this  responsibility  to  any

independent  body. Again the hon. Member will  recall

that  during  the  same debate the  Acting  Financial

Secretary  said  that  a suitable  committee  already

existed  in the Economic Committee of the Council  of

Ministers and indicated that this Committee would  be

charged  with  the task of examining  the  suggestion

made  by the hon. Member. Sir, the answer to the hon.

Member's  question is therefore that a  committee  is

already  in  existence  and  that  it  will  consider

suggestions  as  soon  as  the  necessary  background

material has been collected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Hon.

the  Financial Secretary tell us when will the report

of  this Committee be made public or when the  public

will know who are the members of this Committee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I can tell the hon. Member the

composition of the Committee. It consists of the Hon.

the   Chief  Minister,  the  Hon. the  Minister  for

Communications and Works, the Hon. the  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry,  and  myself,  and  at   all

meetings  of the Committee the advice of the Economic

Adviser  is obtained and in this particular  instance

the advice of the Comptroller of Income Tax will also

be obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know when the Committee will be in a

position to report to the Council of Ministers  (that

being  the body to which it must report). We  are  at

the  moment  in  the  process of  obtaining  as  much

information  from  neighbouring and  other  countries

about schemes for dependants' allowances which are in

existence   there  and  about  their  experience   in

operating   these   schemes.  This   information   is

voluminous  and  will take some time  to  digest  and

consider.  In  these circumstances, I regret  that  I

cannot give any indication when the Committee will be

able to report to the Council of Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Hon.

the  Financial Secretary tell us has there  been  any

meeting held so far?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The Economic Committee of the Council of

Ministers of course meets constantly, Sir, It has not

yet  met  on  this particular question of dependants'

allowances  for  the  simple reason  that  the  basic

information  which I have detailed has not  yet  been

obtained in full.

the  reply  to (a) is that the new Housing  Authority

made  for this purpose; (b), it is intended that  the

specific case in mind I am prepared to look into  the

matter and see whether any delay can be avoided;  (b)

alterations to the Master Plan are being  made  as  a

result of objections and representations made by some

the circumstances were in fact as follows. A pleasure

boat with two Singapore passengers, one of whom is  a

fisherman, was detained by the Indonesian authorities

when  they  were off Pulau Kusu on 25th  July,  1957,

that is five days before the Hock Huat incident. This

pleasure craft developed engine trouble after a storm

off  Pulau  Kusu and was taken to Pulau Samboe  where

the  two  passengers  were  detained  in  the  police

station for 15 days. They were subsequently released,

the  Chief  Police Officer of Pulau Samboe confirming

that  they had not committed any offence. The persons

concerned  who were detained had no permit  to  enter

Indonesian territorial waters.

<div align="center"><b>VETERINARY AND HUSBANDRY STATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry  whether  he  will   make   a

statement  on  the  progress  of  the  Lim  Chu  Kang

Experimental Veterinary and Husbandry Station.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. The Lim Chu Kang

District  Veterinary Station was planned in 1954  and

commenced   operations  the   following   year.   The

extension  work  done  from this  station  is  highly

successful  and  during the last 18 months  over  500

stud  animals  and 1,000 poultry have been  bred  and

distributed  to  farmers and co-operative  societies.

There is a long waiting list for such assistance. The

pedigree  stock  at  Lim Chu Kang  include  pigs  and

poultry presented by the Commonwealth and  Australia under  the  Colombo Plan. Nearly 1,500,000  pigs  and

poultry  have  been given protective vaccinations  by

the  team  operating from Lim Chu Kang  so  far  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim Chu Kang is used to produce improved stock but

the  normal  research work planned for Sembawang  has

been  increased as far as facilities allow since  Dr

Kelly  arrived in Singapore in December. The research

work  is  conducted amongst pigs, poultry and  cattle

and  the  work  now in progress involves establishing

parental strains from which controlled breeding  work

will  evolve.  Eighteen strains  of  pigs  have  been

selected  and  the  progeny which  will  perform  the

parental strain are now coming forward and from these

the  first  generation  of developed  stock  will  be

produced.  One thousand two hundred poultry  are  now

growing  under  trap-nest conditions  and  the  first

parental  strains will be selected from these  birds.

Their  progeny will not be ready until March  because

there is no room at Lim Chu Kang to develop this work

further.  Special poultry extension work  is  planned

for the central station at Sembawang.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 40 cows and four bulls from Pakistan at

Lim  Chu  Kang  and the first progeny are  now  being

produced.  They will be distributed when  they  reach

suitable age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As facilities for nutritional research do not exist

at  Lim Chu Kang this work is planned for the central

research  station  which it is hoped  to  operate  at

Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although increased inoculation services and also the

issue  of  improved  stock from  Lim  Chu  Kang  have

increased the production of pigs and poultry all over

Singapore  in  recent years, a brief survey  made  in

January  this  year showed that in the Lim  Chu  Kang

area production was 300 per cent higher than in other

parts  of  the  island. This is the  more  remarkable

because four years ago the Lim Chu Kang area was  the

most   poorly   developed  area  in   Singapore   for

livestock.  Now, more pigs and poultry  are  produced

there  than in any other area of comparable  size  in

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important functions at Lim Chu Kang

lies  in  the  benefits from the  close  associations

between  the  station staff and surrounding  farmers,

which  have  induced a degree of trust and  faith  in

Government  policy  of  helping  farmers  with  their

everyday difficulties. The operations of the  station

show very clearly that farmers' troubles require  on-the-spot  help from officers who know their  problems

and are equipped to render prompt assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite of

the  excellent work done by the station may I ask the

Hon.  Minister  whether he is  aware  that  it  still

cannot cope with the work of meeting the needs of the

farmers there?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am aware, Sir, that there is

need  for  further expansion of veterinary department

services to the farmers all over the island, and with

that purpose we are now going ahead with building the

Sembawang station.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The answer, Sir, is no. To both

consumer  and  producer alike, such daily  broadcasts

are  not  particularly useful  and  are  not  popular

because  (a)  only the previous day's prices  can  be

given at a time when housewives are out marketing and

when they already know the previous day's prices, and

(b)   by  the  time  the  prices  are  available  for

broadcasting  the producers have already  sold  their

produce.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2530</b></font><br><br>



Such  broadcasts therefore do not give the housewives

an idea of prices before they go to market and do not

products.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> I am afraid the Hon. the

cleverness of the middlemen and probably also on  the

cleverness of the farmers in trying to get  the  best

prices  for their produce. The prices are  not  on  a

standard rate and therefore the Government would  not

be  in a position to give a standard rate paid by the

<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



The  second clause of this Bill is designed to ensure

that  the  power  to  pass a sentence  of  preventive

detention,  which must by law be for a period  of  at

least     five    years,    shall    be     exercised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2531</b></font><br><br>



only  by  the  High Court. As the Criminal  Procedure

Code  stands at present, it is not clear  that  these

sentences of preventive detention can only be imposed

by  the  High  Court, although it is clear  that  the

somewhat  lesser sentence of corrective  training  is

one  restricted to the High Court. Clause 2 will make

the position quite clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill is designed to avoid any doubt

as  to the powers of courts to remand accused persons

in  such  custody  as the courts  think  fit.  It  is

necessary sometimes for accused persons to  be  given

the  opportunity, in their own interests, of pointing

out  individuals or places which have  a  bearing  on

cases under investigation. This cannot be done if the

person  is  remanded  in  prison,  and  it  is  often

undesirable,  particularly in the initial  stages  of

investigation, that a person should be  granted  bail

merely  for the purpose of enabling him to point  out

witnesses  or places that are relevant to  the  case.

This clause will bring the Criminal Procedure Code of

the  colony into line with the provisions which  have

been  in  existence in the Federation for some  years

and  have  worked well there, but with the difference

that  whereas in the Federation there is a period  of

15  days during which this custody other than  prison

can  subsist,  it  is thought that in  Singapore  the

ordinary period of eight days should suffice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill is in two parts. The first part

is designed to make the offences of unlawful assembly

and   rioting  not  bailable  as  of  right.  It   is

considered  that in cases of this nature, the  courts

should  have  a  discretion to  refuse  bail  if  the

circumstances  so  require, and in  order  that  they

should  be  able to do that, it is thought  right  to

make the alterations referred to in paragraph (a)  of

clause 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of this clause is designed to remove

any   doubt  that  might  exist  regarding  a  police

officer's  power to arrest without warrant  a  person

who  obstructs  him in the discharge of  his  duties.

Whereas section 31 of the Code



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2532</b></font><br><br>



quite  clearly  gives  police  officers  that  power,

Schedule A to the Code - in referring to section 186 of

the  Penal  Code - at  present says that  ordinarily  a

warrant  should  be  obtained  before  arrest.  Quite

clearly  with  offences  of  this  nature,  immediate

arrest  is necessary. This amendment will remove  the

doubts that have existed in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth clause deals with the provisions of what

is  elsewhere known as the Borstal system. At present

Schedule D to the Criminal Procedure Code which  lays

down  the  detailed provisions regarding  reformative

training,  as  we call it in Singapore,  allow  of  a

person  being  kept in a reformative training  centre

for  a  period of more than four years,  whereas  the

normal  practice is that a person should be  so  kept

for  only  three  years  as a  maximum  and  for  the

remainder  of  the four years from the  date  of  the

imposition of the sentence be under supervision. That

period  of  release under supervision is regarded  as

one  of  the  very  important  parts  of  reformative

training  and  it  is thought that the  system  would

suffer if we allowed to remain in the law this  power

to  keep  a  person in detention beyond the  ordinary

period of three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be thought that an anomaly had crept in

when  the  Schedule was originally drafted  and  this

clause  is  designed to put the matter right  and  to

ensure   that  every  person  who  is  sentenced   to

reformative training shall have the opportunity of  a

period  of  freedom under supervision  after  he  has

undergone  the  training in the reformative  training

centre itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this Bill, which provides for the

management and control of the Raffles Museum, I  wish

to  state that for many years the Raffles Museum  and

the Raffles Library have been working under an out-of-date  Raffles Society Ordinance. The former union  of

the   Museum  and  Library  was  to  a  large  extent

fortuitous  and not in the best interests  of  either

once they had begun to develop. The separation in the

administration  of  the Raffles  Museum  and  Raffles

Library took place at the beginning of the year  1955

which in effect rendered obsolete the Raffles Society

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a simple one because the statutory

requirements  of  a display and research  museum  are

very  limited, and this Bill now brought up  for  its

Second  Reading contains only two significant  points

to  which I would like to draw the attention  of  the

Assembly. One of the innovations is in clauses 3  (3)

and 6 whereby the Governor may by notification in the

Gazette authorise any member of the staff to exercise

within the Museum and Museum grounds the powers of  a

police  officer.  This  is an important  point  since

previously although the Director was responsible  for

the safety of the building and collections he had  no

general authority for preventing misdemeanour.  I  am

sure  that hon. Members will agree that the  valuable

collections  in the Museum need protection  and  that

the  Director  should be empowered to deal  with  any

contingency that may arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second innovation, Sir, in this Bill is in

clause 4, which gives official



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2534</b></font><br><br>



recognition to the Advisory Committee on  Art,  which

was  set up in 1953 and 1954, in anticipation of  the

Raffles  Library  moving to its  own  building.  This

provision  under  clause 4 will  give  this  Advisory

Committee a permanent status so that in the years  to

come  we can hope that Raffles Museum will contain  a

collection  of objects illustrating the  art  of  the

Chinese  people, the Malays and the Indians who  have

by  their culture and way of life made Singapore into

what  it  is  today. It is also hoped that  this  Art

Committee  will  in  the course of  time  assist  the

Director in building up exhibition galleries  in  the

Museum devoted to art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

speak on one aspect of this Bill which I consider  to

be  rather  unsatisfactory and which falls  short  of

what  I think we should aim at in legislation of this

sort. I refer to clause 4 (1) and (3) (a) which reads

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) There shall be constituted an Arts Committee

appointed  by the Minister comprising of persons  who

are  knowledgeable  in, or have specific  information

on,  matters pertaining to Chinese, Indian and  Malay

art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) (a) The functions of the Arts Committee shall be

to  advise  the  Director on  the  acquisition  of  a

collection  of objects illustrating particularly  the

arts  of China, Malays and India, in order to reflect

the  art,  culture  and way of life  of  the  various

communities who have settled in Malaya;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my objection is to the implied limitation of

the  arts to Chinese, Indian and Malay art. My  first

reaction, I must confess, was to suggest an amendment

for  the  inclusion of European art  with  the  other

three,   thinking  on  the  lines  of   our   present

multilingualism, but my second thought was that  this

amendment  would  not be getting  us  away  from  the

narrow,  somewhat communal drafting of  this  clause,

which is entirely alien to a proper artistic outlook.

We  have in sub-clause (1) of clause 4 the inclusion,

for example, of Malay art but what about Malayan art,

for it is that very fusion of the arts which we would

like  to  see  encouraged in this  country:  and  yet

Malayan art finds no place in this clause.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all it is a fact that there is already

developing a Singapore school - or if "school" is  too

ambitious  a  word,  a Singapore "style" - of  painting

which  is  individual to this island. Cheong Soopieng

is  a  Singapore artist - or a Malay - an artist  if  you

prefer  it - of whom we have every reason to be  proud,

and  there  are  other painters here of  considerable

promise.  The work of a young man called Chiao  Hsien

was  exhibited  the  other day  which  is  distinctly

interesting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we limit ourselves to Chinese, Indian and Malay

art  in  this piece of legislation, we are  also,  by

implication,  leaving out Indonesian art,  which  has

had  a  considerable influence in  this  country,  or

Siamese  art, or the art of the Philippines of  which

we  have  had  a recent exposition in Singapore.  And

when  Singapore  could  so  easily  be,  through  its

universities and flourishing societies, a centre  and

a  fountain and a blending of the art forms, it would

be  a  thousand pities not to reflect this even in  a

minor  piece of legislation like this Raffles  Museum

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to see clause 4 (1) and (3)

(a) amended to read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) There shall be constituted an Arts Committee

appointed  by the Minister comprising of persons  who

are  knowledgeable  in, or have specific  information

on, matters pertaining to the arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The functions of the Arts Committee shall be-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to advise the Director on the acquisition of

a  collection of objects illustrating the arts of

all  nations, in order in particular  to  reflect

the  art, culture and way of life of the  various

communities who have settled in Malaya;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in clause 4 (3) (a) would still be on

the  arts of the various communities who have settled

in  Malaya,  as  it should be, but the impression  of

exclusiveness  will  have  been  removed.  Government

policy can still direct that emphasis should be given

to  Malay, Chinese or Indian art, but Indonesian art,

or  European  art, or Malayan art, for  that  matter,

will also find its natural place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government and indeed this House

will accept these

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need of a Bill to provide for the

management  and  control  of  the  Raffles   National

Library  is  the same as that for the Raffles  Museum

Bill  which I moved earlier. I pointed out then  that

Raffles  Museum and Raffles Library have  worked  for

many  years  under  an out-of-date Raffles  Societies

Ordinance,  and that it is in the interests  of  both

institutions that a separate Ordinance should now  be

provided for each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to mention that a generous donation by the

Lee  Foundation in 1953 has given us this opportunity

to provide not only for the setting up of the Raffles

National  Library but also for the extension  of  the

library services to all parts of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various functions of the National Library are

set  out  in  clause 5 of the Bill  and  it  will  be

several  years  before  all these  functions  can  be

implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2538</b></font><br><br>

I   wish  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  Assembly

especially to clause 8 of the Bill which provides for

the  constitution of a Raffles National Library Board

to  advise  the  Minister on  the  operation  of  the

Library. It must now be accepted that because it is a

national library, the interests of the various  races

living  in Singapore must be met in the way of  books

in the various languages. We hope that in the not too

distant future the Raffles National Library will  not

only  have a collection which can be read by the many

races  living  in  Singapore, but also  will  provide

services in every nook and corner of the island

<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, this is a short and simple Bill

which   seeks  to  set  out  the  framework  of   the

administration   of   the   Botanic   Gardens.    The

administration of the Botanic Gardens is  at  present

technically   governed  by  the   Raffles   Societies

Ordinance  (Cap.  312), but this Ordinance  has  long

been  a  dead letter in so far as the Botanic Gardens

is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, together with the Raffles Museum Bill and

the  Raffles  National Library Bill which  have  just

been  passed  in this Assembly, will jointly  replace

the  Raffles  Societies Ordinance (Cap.  312),  under

which the Botanic Gardens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2539</b></font><br><br>



Raffles Library and Raffles Museum are governed.  The

conjunction   of  the  three  institutions   in   one

Ordinance  was  artificial and it is clear  from  the

preamble  to that Ordinance that the three Bills  are

designed to enable the administration of each of  the

three institutions to be separately conducted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, the Bill sets out the

framework  for  the  administration  of  the  Botanic

Gardens.   Clause   4   enables   rules    for    the

administration  of  the Gardens to  be  made  by  the

Minister, and prescribes the purposes for which  such

rules may be made. Sir, I beg to move, 'That the Bill

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the word "Botanical" was used in the Bill

because it was the word used in the Raffles Societies

Ordinance and also because the Gardens was  known  by

that   name   by   many  people.   However,   further

consideration  has been given to the  name  following

representations made by experts, one of whom  was  of

course the Director, Botanic Gardens, that while both

"Botanic"  and "Botanical" are grammatically  correct

in   describing  the  Gardens,  in  scientific  usage

"Botanic"   is   the  correct  term,   and   records,

correspondence  and manuscripts dating  back  to  the

1880's   show  that  the  word  "Botanic"   and   not

"Botanical"  has  been used in  connection  with  the

Gardens.  Sir,  the present Director of  the  Gardens

also agree with this view. For these reasons, Sir,  I

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have the Governor's consent to move, and I  do

now  formally  move, "That the Bill  be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a short Bill compared with the Local

Government  marathon but it is our basic  charter  of

citizenship. With the general purpose of  this  Bill,

Sir,  there will be no disagreement for it must be  a

matter  of pride to us all that our progress  towards

nation-building  has reached the stage  when  we  can

discuss  this Bill. Nations are not created from  the

top  and  then citizens fitted into the  nation.  The

nation is a group of individual citizens whose  drive

and  loyalty  create the feeling of nationality,  the

feeling of being a distinct and distinctive group. It

is in the heart and from the heart of each individual

citizen  that grows the vital and fertile seed  of  a

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the problems of the constitution focussed

on our discussions in London have roused interest and

discussion, the constitution can be no stronger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2541</b></font><br><br>



than  the  dynamic of the devotion it  harnesses  and

guides;  or to put it in another way: the first  step

in  establishing  self-government is  to  define  the

"self"  which will govern, and the "self" is the  sum

of  our  citizens. This is not done in any spirit  of

exclusiveness  from  others, let alone  hostility  to

others.  A  nation, like an individual, must  have  a

distinct personality but that does not stand  in  the

way  of friendship. In fact, without it there can  be

no friendship between national groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a Singapore citizenship has always

been  in the forefront of our policy. There have been

legal difficulties of definition. There has been  the

need   to   keep  in  tune  with  our  constitutional

discussions. Even though it was not possible to us to

get  the  independence of the  full  members  of  the

Commonwealth like our neighbour (which is closer than

a  neighbour),  the  Federation of  Malaya,  we  have

always  sought  to  have  the  same  status  for  our

citizenship as if we were independent. My predecessor

as  Chief Minister got it as one of his chief  hopes,

and  the Secretary of State for the Colonies has  not

raised  political  or fundamental objection.  He  has

always  accepted  our  case  and  most  recently  and

finally, hon. Members will recollect paragraph 51  of

the  Report  of  our constitutional discussions  last

April which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty's Government propose that section 1 (3)

of  the  British  Nationality Act,  1948,  should  be

amended  to  include  Singapore,  so  that  Singapore

citizens would be recognised under the Act as British

subjects and Commonwealth citizens,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons, Sir, why this is an

essential step. We as elected Members of the Assembly

owe  our power to our representing the views  of  the

people as expressed through the secrecy of the ballot

box.  As  individuals,  whatever  our  abilities   or

claims,  we have no power other than the power  which

derives  from the people. In defining the rights  and

qualifications  of  those who sent  us  here  we  are

giving   the   only  democratic  authority   to   the

Legislative Assembly of the self-governing  Singapore

to speak for the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2542</b></font><br><br>



of   Singapore   in  defining  policy,   in   framing

legislation, and in raising and allocating the public

funds of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, citizenship not only gives political

rights  but  also responsibilities, and  it  must  be

clear on whom these responsibilities fall and on whom

the  state  can  call  for  the  services  which  the

community requires. As therefore the citizens  create

and  control  political power,  their  qualifications

must  be  clearly defined, but this is  more  than  a

matter  of  legal  definition.  That  is  the   first

essential step but it is not enough. The legal  forms

must  be  given  the  warmth and  vitality  of  human

emotions,  but there can be none of the  associations

of a homeland, of belonging to Singapore, until there

is  a  clear definition of those who are at  home  in

Singapore.  And  it is equally clear that  those  who

become  our citizens and make this their home  should

declare their clear loyalty to Singapore. It  is  for

that reason that the Bill requires an oath of loyalty

and, in certain cases, an oath of renunciation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a state of peoples of many races and

cultures,  and  as  a  commercial  port  our  windows

are - and must always, be - open to all quarters  of  the

globe.  In  this lies our richness and our  vitality,

but  it also means that our loyalties must be all the

stronger, not to be overwhelmed by the many pulls  on

us  from  cultures  older and nations  stronger  than

ourselves.  We have to build up our own  personality,

drawing elements from what ever source can contribute

to  us,  but it must contribute to our own integrated

personality.  We must not be an unstable  association

of  outside  influences with no internal strength  or

distinctive  character.  If  we  cannot  create  this

character,  this  way of life of our  own,  something

which  is  uniquely ours, then all the constitutional

and  legal  apparatus  of  self-government  will  not

provide a satisfying life for us or save us from  the

creation   and  exploitation  of  domestic  divisions

motivated   by   external  influences  for   external

purposes hostile to ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also a new community. Before the war, the

majority  of the people of Singapore were  immigrants

who had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2543</b></font><br><br>



not  come with a fixed intention to stay and who  did

not  look upon themselves as Malayans. This has  been

changed by the effects of our population growth  and

the  experience of the Japanese occupation.  For  the

first time in our history, the majority of the people

and  the  very great majority of those under  21  are

Singapore-born  and our citizens. Our  population  is

predominantly and increasingly young, and the need to

give  an emotional and forward-looking element  to  a

self-governing  state is all the more  important.  We

must  generate a feeling of pride in our achievements

which,  though they may be small, can nonetheless  be

significant   for  Asia  because   of   our   special

opportunities and inheritances, and because we are  a

shop-window on the great arterial sea routes of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look upon ourselves as perpetual poor cousins,

always  deprecating ourselves and  our  achievements,

and  praising everything from other countries, we arc

ensuring  our decline. The proverb blames  those  who

gave  a  dog a bad name which sticks, but  there  are

some of our community who believe that the dog should

not wait to be given a bad name but should give a bad

name  to  itself. That attitude, Sir, is the negation

of  nation-building and self-government. We  must  be

proud of ourselves and be confident we can build  our

future  as a nation. It is our aim to build ourselves

as  part of the Malayan nation, whose birth has given

inspiration  to  us  all  and  a  profound  sense  of

admiration   for,   and   congratulations   to,   our

neighbours.  But  the  fact  that  we  seek  to  find

ourselves  does  not  prevent the  marriage  of  true

minds,  which we look forward to, with the Federation

of   Malaya   when   they  have  decided   that   our

temperaments are not too incompatible. As  the  Irish

might  say,  Sir,  better divorce for incompatibility

before marriage than after, and the better the chance

to learn compatibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are too, Sir, the great number of adult

citizens   who  have  made  this  country  of   their

adoption.  This  is  their land in  which  they  have

worked patiently and productively. They have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2544</b></font><br><br>



all  contributed,  each in their  different  way,  to

building  up the commercial prosperity of  Singapore,

and  their families with the education of our schools

and with the opportunities and new horizons opened to

them  here have endowed us with a widening community,

the   new   talents  and  skills  and  wider   social

activities  of our younger generation  on  whom  must

fall  the  crucial burden of making  or  marring  our

great   experiment  in  self-government.  They   have

retained  contacts  with  their  families  in   their

countries of origin for predominantly filial  reasons

but  as  the declining amount of remittances and  the

growing movement to Singapore of parents have  shown,

this  country has become the country where they  wish

to  live  in  the loyal focus of their families  who,

removing to Singapore, have had new opportunities  to

settle.  Our  success depends on the  achievement  of

their loyalty and their Malayan outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this group, Sir, who will have the greatest

opportunity under this Bill. They have been reluctant

to  take up the citizenship of the United Kingdom and

the    Colonies   which,   apart   from   its   legal

difficulties,  appeared to give up  one  non-Malayan

nationality  for  another. They have  felt  that  the

process  of  naturalisation was a cumbrous  one  and,

above all, they have not appreciated to the full  the

necessity    for    taking    part    in    political

responsibilities when that position  seemed  to  have

any element of uncertainty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they have been in this position - citizens in

fact  but without taking full legal rights - they  have

in  some ways had the worst of both worlds. They have

been  vulnerable  to criticism of  their  actions  by

those  in  our  midst and overseas  who  have  sought

reasons  to doubt their essential loyalty. This  Bill

will give the opportunity to our older contemporaries

to  set  the rumours of wagging tongues at rest.  The

citizenship  which they are offered  is  a  Singapore

citizenship and their oath of loyalty will be to  the

constitution  of  Singapore. The  procedure  will  be

simpler  and the administration be under the  control

of  the Government of Singapore exclusively. It is we

in Singapore who will adjudicate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2545</b></font><br><br>



their  claims  for citizenship and  will  select  our

citizens, for it is we who know our fellows  and  who

will  suffer  the  consequences  of  misjudging   the

loyalties  of those to whom we are prepared  to  give

the full powers and responsibilities of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, they will have the free choice whether

to  give  their uninhibited and undivided loyalty  to

Singapore or whether to remain as aliens, welcome and

friendly   but  nevertheless  aliens  and  passengers

rather  than actors, in our drama of self-government.

They  will  share  the final say in  all  matters  of

policy, political, social or economic, and they  will

have  every right and opportunity to play a full  and

satisfying  and  creative part in  our  community  of

widening horizons. In doing this it is misleading  to

say  that they will be welcome, for they are welcome,

as they have been welcome, and we have treated them as of ourselves. But there has been no legal right, no

legal  rebuttal of malice or mischief. This they  can

now  have.  They will not only be one of the  family;

they  will have title deeds as members of the  family

in our Singapore homeland. And as such they will have

an  equal right in our democratic system to the vote,

to  stand for election and to strive for the  highest

office whatever is their religion, their language  or

their calling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we have a large element who continue

legally to be aliens, we think of communities not  so

much  in  terms  of racial groups  but  in  terms  of

countries  of  origin. But now that we  will  all  be

Singaporeans  together, we  will  be  judged  by  our

country,   which   is  Singapore,  and   the   common

allegiance will grow in strength of idea and  emotion

until  the  communal divisions take  the  subordinate

place  which they inevitably must if Singapore is  to

be  a  name  of peace and harmony and not a  name  of

unrest and disharmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have already seen the Bill and studied

its clauses. These with the summary have already been

published  in  the  Press,  and  Members   will   not

therefore  expect  me  to  go  through  the  Bill  in

complete  detail. The Bill follows in  the  main  the

pattern of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2546</b></font><br><br>



citizenship  laws in the Commonwealth  countries  and

many  of  its  provisions are taken from the  British

Commonwealth   Act.  Citizenship  is  a   complicated

subject and must be adapted to an infinite variety of

circumstances and, for that reason, must be  set  out

in precise detail. Perhaps, Sir, I may quote from the

London  Times  an example of the kind of complication

which arises:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Lewis born in France to an American airman

and  his  English wife is in the predicament at  four

months  of  being a stateless person. His  father,  a

United  States  Air  Force  sergeant  stationed  near

Paris,  assumed the child would automatically  be  an

American,  but  the  United States  Embassy  has  now

disillusioned   him:  an  American  who   marries   a

foreigner must have lived in the United States for 10

consecutive  years for his children to have  American

citizenship,  whereas  Sergeant  Lewis  was  born  in

Germany and has spent only eight years in the  United

States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife suggested that the child should be British

but  was  told  at the British Embassy  that  British

nationality is transmitted exclusively by the father.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young couple then proposed that the son should

be French, only to discover that a foreign child born

on  French  soil must be registered with  the  French

authorities  at  birth  in  order  to  claim   French

nationality, and now too much time has elapsed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in general, the status of a citizen of

Singapore   may   be  acquired  by  birth, descent,

registration or naturalisation. The basic pattern  is

that  those born in Singapore, or those born  outside

Singapore whose father at the time of his birth was a

Singapore  citizen, shall be automatically  Singapore

citizens. Citizenship can be acquired by registration

by  those born in the Federation of Malaya, by  those

who  are  citizens  of  the United  Kingdom  and  the

Colonies,  and  generally  citizens  of  Commonwealth

countries.  Women  who  are married  to  citizens  of

Singapore  will  be  eligible  to  be  registered  as

citizens  of  Singapore. Special provision  is  made,

Sir,  to  enable persons who would not  otherwise  be

eligible  and  who  are of good  character  and  have

resided   in  Singapore  throughout  the   10   years

immediately  preceding the coming into  operation  of

the provision, to apply for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2547</b></font><br><br>



citizenship by registration. The application must  be

made within two years of the coming into force of the

provision  and  the  Minister has the  discretion  to

grant  or refuse the application. Persons who  become

citizens  of Singapore by registration must take  the

oath of allegiance, and if the person is a subject or

citizen  of  a foreign country he must also  renounce

such  foreign nationality or citizenship and,  if  so

required  by  the  Minister, divest himself  of  such

foreign nationality or citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to the 10-year residential

qualification,  I received a letter dated  1st  July,

1957,  from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce

reading as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Chamber is always keenly interested in

Singapore  citizenship  which concerns  some  200,000

overseas  Chinese who are qualified to  become  local

citizens.   It  is  understood  that  the   Bill   to

enfranchise  them will be tabled soon.  The  question

was  discussed at a Committee meeting of this Chamber

held  on 28th June. The Committee think that it  will

be  much easier and simpler for an applicant to apply

for   such  citizenship  if  eight  years'  residence

instead of 10 be a qualification, which can be proved

by   Identity  Cards  issued  in  1948.  The  meeting

resolved  that  a  proposal  be  made  to  the  Chief

Minister  with  a view to enabling any  residents  of

Singapore who has been here for eight years from  the

date  of  the  coming into force of the Ordinance  to

apply  for such citizenship. This proposal is  hereby

presented to you for your favourable consideration."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I indicated to the representatives of the

Chamber  at an interview that while I was sympathetic

to  their request I had to point out that the 10-year

residential qualification had been agreed  to  by  an

All-Party  conference  held  in  February  1957   and

endorsed  by the Legislative Assembly in  March  this

year,  and was subsequently accepted by the  Colonial

Office when the All-Party Delegation negotiated for a

new  constitution during the last visit to London  in

March/April this year. I expressed the view that this

matter  would have eventually to be debated  in  this

Assembly  before  it  could  be  taken  up  with  the

Colonial  Office. Sir, I propose to commit this  Bill

to a Select Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2548</b></font><br><br>



which  will  no doubt take due note  of  the  views

expressed  by  hon. Members in this  debate  in  this

connection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, citizenship can also be acquired by

naturalisation   by  persons  intending   to   reside

permanently  in  Singapore who are of  full  age  and

capacity, of good character and have resided  in  the

colony   for  at  least  10  out  of  the  12   years

immediately  preceding  their  application.   Special

provision is made for persons who are serving in  the

armed  forces.  The  Minister  has  a  discretion  in

approving  applications  for  naturalisation,  and  a

person  who  acquires citizenship  by  naturalisation

must  take  the oath of allegiance, and if  he  is  a

subject  or  citizen  of a foreign  country  he  must

renounce such foreign nationality or citizenship, and

at  the  end, if so required by the Minister,  divest

himself  of  such foreign nationality or citizenship.

Minor  children of persons who obtain citizenship  by

registration   or  naturalisation  may   be   granted

citizenship by registration on application being made

by their parents or guardians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in calculating residence in Singapore periods

of  absence  for purposes of education or health,  or

any  other  cause  approved by the Minister,  may  be

treated  as residence in Singapore, and short periods

of  absence amounting in the aggregate to  less  than

six  months  will be disregarded. Periods of  service

with the armed forces not maintained in Singapore  or

with departments of the United Kingdom Government  in

the  case of persons not recruited in Singapore  will

not be counted as residence in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for renunciation of citizenship

and  deprivation  of citizenship follow  clearly  the

provisions  in the British Nationality Act.  Where  a

person makes a declaration renouncing his citizenship

of   Singapore,   the  Minister   shall   cause   the

declaration   to   be  registered   and   upon   such

registration that person will cease to be  a  citizen

of  Singapore. It is provided that the  Minister  may

withhold registration of any such declaration if made

during any war in which the Queen may be engaged. The

Minister  has  power to declare  that  a  person  has

ceased to be a citizen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2549</b></font><br><br>



if  he  is satisfied that that person has voluntarily

acquired  citizenship  of  any  foreign  country   or

exercised the rights of a citizen in such a  country.

The Minister may also deprive of citizenship a person

who  has  acquired the citizenship  of  Singapore  by

registration  or naturalisation if it is  shown  that

such   citizenship  was  acquired  by  fraud,   false

representation or mistake, or if the person has shown

himself  disaffected  towards  Her  Majesty  or   the

constitution   of  Singapore,  or  has   in   wartime

unlawfully traded or associated with an enemy, or has

been  sentenced  to  a term of imprisonment  for  two

years  or more, or has for seven years resided  in  a

foreign country. In all such cases the Minister must,

before   depriving  a  person  of   citizenship,   be

satisfied that it is not conducive to the public good

that  the  person should continue to be a citizen  of

Singapore.  Notice in writing must he  given  to  the

person  affected  before an order of  deprivation  of

citizenship  is made, and such person will  have  the

right  to  have his case referred to a  committee  of

enquiry consisting of a chairman who must be a person

qualified to be a judge and two other persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there may be differences over the details of

this Bill and, as stated earlier, I propose that  the

Bill  should be committed to a Select Committee. Sir,

as  the date of the general elections, which is  also

the  date  of  the  coming  into  force  of  the  new

constitution, is geared to our citizenship proposals,

it  is  the intention of the Government to  have  the

Third  Reading  of this Bill at the sitting  on  16th

October.  I  would  therefore urge  upon  the  Select

Committee when appointed to expedite deliberations of

the  Bill and endeavour to report back to this  House

in time for the October sitting in order to allow the

maximum time for the period of registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however much difference there may be in detail,

I am sure that we all welcome this Bill towards which

every  Party  represented in this House  has  made  a

contribution.  I feel it a privilege  that  as  Chief

Minister it falls to me to move the Second Reading of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2550</b></font><br><br>



this  Bill  which  represents  a  major  advance   in

Singapore's political development. We have now become

a  settled community and, with this view, the loyalty

of  those who have made this island their second home

will  find  legal recognition. This  brings  a  great

strengthening  of  our community, a strengthening  in

the  sense  of  our  common  responsibility  for  the

building  of  a  Singapore which, by  its  policy  of

social welfare, by its achievement of political unity

and   by   its  co-operation  in  building   economic

prosperity, will make a reality in our public life of

all  the warmth and inspiration we associate  in  our

domestic  life  with  the words  "home  and  family".

Through  this Bill, Sir, we will be able to say  with

united voice, "Majulah Singapura!", and tomorrow with

even greater strength and unity, "Merdeka Singapura!"

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.32 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

long  last the Citizenship Bill has come before  this

House  for  the Second Reading. I say  at  long  last

because this Bill should have come before this  House

a  very long time before. In 1956 when we first  went

to  London,  we  too  had an All-Party  Committee  to

deliberate on what we should do with this question of

citizenship, and there was agreement then,  agreement

not  only  amongst  the  Parties  but  also  between

Singapore  and  London, lithe  Government  had   the

intention  of pushing the Bill through it could  have

drawn it up, and it could even have been presented to

this  Assembly a year ago. But there was always  that

long  delay  and only until questions in  this  House

were asked as to when this Bill could be presented to

the Assembly, I think then Government started working

on it and put up this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Complete

nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> But anyway, I am happy that the

Bill  has  come to this House for Second Reading  and

whatever we can say the Government seemed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2551</b></font><br><br>



to  think  that it is time they should speed  up  the

work  and are now asking that we should hurry through

it  as quickly as possible. Yes, if it is a case  of

getting  this Bill through as quickly as we  can,  we

have  always been of the opinion that it should  have

been  passed a long time ago and we shall  give  them

that co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good thing, Sir, that at last we have a Bill

that  will make all who reside in Singapore  and  all

who  regard  Singapore as their home  and  object  of

loyalty a chance to become citizens of Singapore. It

is most peculiar, especially in this country, that we

have  a population half of which is not its citizens.

All  along  we  have heard dissatisfaction  from  the

people because, they say, although they contribute to

the  coffers  of the colony they have never  had  the

opportunity of a say in its affairs. They have wanted

to  be part and parcel of this country. We give  them

this  opportunity;  we recognise  this  long-standing

unsatisfactory state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I agree with those who say that

the  destiny  of Singapore is in the hands  of  those

born  here,  but  those who created the  citizens  of

Singapore  who now have the vote have never  had  the

vote.  During the last elections, of course, the  old

stable  elements, the people who can  think  soberly,

could not exercise a voice in its affairs. With  this

new  Bill and with the rights given them, I think the

future  of Singapore will he bright because then  the

stable  elements  will have as  much  a  say  as  the

younger people, their sons, their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With inequality in a country affecting a large

proportion  of people, the Government can never  rule

efficiently.  There will not be that  degree  of  co-operation  when  the people think that  they  do  not

belong to this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this Bill because of all these aspects.

However,  Sir, on looking through this Bill,  I  must

say that I am not satisfied with some parts of it. If

we  turn,  Sir, to clause 22 (3) (a) on page  8,  you

will see that the Minister may, by order, deprive  a

citizen of Singapore by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2552</b></font><br><br>



registration or by naturalization of his  citizenship

if  he  is  satisfied  that that  citizen  has  shown

himself   by   act  or  speech  to  be  disloyal   or

disaffected  towards Her Majesty or the  Constitution

of  Singapore.  Sir, I have been wondering,  if  this

Bill  comes into force, whether such people who have

raved  against the Rendel Constitution  of  Singapore

should be deprived of their citizenship. And this,  I

think,  affects  not only Ministers but  Assemblymen.

What  is the "Constitution of Singapore"? Is  it  the

Rendel Constitution we are thinking about, or  is  it

the constitution that is coming into force? It is all

in  the  air.  What  I am thinking  is  probably  the

Government   may  be  thinking  of  the   "State   of

Singapore".  But  still we are not a  state;  we  are

still  not an independent country. And I would  like

the Hon. the Attorney-General to show us examples  of

how,  in  the matter of speech or act, the Government

will take action against such persons to deprive them

of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, Sir, deals with the registration of

citizens  of persons residing in Singapore throughout

the  last  10 years. I agree with the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  that all Parties have come to an  agreement

on  this matter, but my Party has proposed that it be

seven  years. We will stand by what we have  proposed

before  on compromise,, but we are agreeable to  hear

all  views  put  forward, and  we  can  certainly  be

persuaded to come to a period of eight years. In fact

I  personally  think that eight  years  is  the  most

reasonable time. We say that we follow the Federation

of  Malaya  in all things and in a case like  this  I

think  in  the  Federation they fixed the  period  as

eight years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 (a) fixes the period of absence from the

colony  at  less  than  six months  for  purposes  of

calculation of residence. I think since this Bill  is

going into Select Committee, I would like Members  on

the Select Committee to consider this question of six

months very carefully. Singapore is a commercial city

and  many  people have to travel to  do  business  or

other things, and it may be that a longer period will

be possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, however, Sir, we support this Bill and

we   hope  that  when  it  comes  up  the  people  of

Singapore - those who are eligible or who will be made

eligible - will  come forward and claim  themselves  as

citizens  of Singapore. I hope too, Sir,  that  since

they had a long period to think about this matter  of

whether  to be Singapore citizens or aliens,  I  wish

that  they  will  make  their  decision  as  fast  as

possible.



<br><br>11.43 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  do  agree with the Hon. the Chief Minister as well

as  the  Member  who  has just spoken,  that  we  all

welcome this long-awaited Citizenship Bill. With  the

exception  of clauses 9 and 15. I consider this  Bill

is  as  satisfactory  as it  can  be.  It  is  rather

regrettable that in spite of the representations that

have been made by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce  as

well  as other public bodies, Government has not seen

fit  to  reduce the residence qualification to  eight

years as in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is almost a unanimous clamouring by

the  Chinese Press for such a reduction, I  have  not

seen any Press statements or otherwise giving a valid

reason  against it. The only one I have seen  is  the

one  in  the editorial of the Straits Times  on  28th

August,  1957. In fact the editor advised me  that  I

should not ask for such a reduction as he was of  the

opinion that I would never be successful. The reasons

given  by  him against such a proposal are  two.  The

first is that I was satisfied then and the matter  of

reduction  was an afterthought; the second,  it  will

only affect 5 per cent of the number of persons to be

enfranchised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the argument that it is a question of

afterthought.  Yes,  I  agree  that  we  were   quite

satisfied then because we believed that 10 years  was

a  fair compromise, but in view of the publication of

the  Constitution  for  the Federation  I  think  the

period  of 10 years should be reduced to eight.  What

is  wrong  with  afterthoughts?  Are  we  not  making

amendments  to Bills at almost every sitting  of  the

Assembly   in   view   of  experience   of   changing

circumstances? If we can do that, there is no  reason

why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2554</b></font><br><br>



we  cannot  amend  this Bill to  reduce  the  period.

Secondly, the question that the proposal affects only

5 per cent of the people to be enfranchised. Assuming

that  the number to be enfranchised is 200,000;  five

per  cent  of this will be approximately 10,000  and,

together  with dependants and relatives,  the  number

affected will be nearly 30,000 to 40,000. The  entire

European population, including women and children,  I

understand, is approximately 18,000 people.  Does  it

mean  that  because  there are  only  18.000  people,

whatever  fair request by them should be  ignored  by

the  Government? With due respect to the  paper  that

must have the biggest circulation amongst the English-speaking public, I must say the argument put  forward

is hollow indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of looking at the question of a

Citizenship Bill. One is where a certain party  asked

for  it  and  we just  put up a  Bill  but  to  place

whatever obstacles we can think of in the way  so  as

to  prevent  as many people as possible from  getting

it. Another way of looking at it is that we sincerely

believe  that  these  people  who  are  about  to  be

enfranchised  are beneficial to this colony,  and  do

everything  possible  to help  them  to  obtain  such

citizenship.  I do not believe anyone in  this  House

has the opinion of the former and therefore we try to

do   what  we  can  to  help  the  people  to  obtain

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before going into the matter any further let us

just  try to see what type of people we are about  to

enfranchise. Are they beneficial to this  colony,  or

do  they form a potential danger to it? These people,

mostly Chinese, must have come from their native land

when  young  and, through sweat and hard  work,  have

helped  to  build up the prosperity of  this  colony.

Apart  from  the  Europeans, I believe  they  are  in

control  of  most of the big industries and  business

houses  today. With the exception maybe of a  few,  I

think  they are all anti-Communist. These  people,  I

believe,  will  be an asset to this colony  and  with

citizenship I am sure they will strive hard to make a

better  Singapore,  as  they can  then  devote  their

entire loyalty to this land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for reduction of the period to eight

years  is  that  I believe the best way  of  checking

residence  qualification is  by  the  Identity  Card.

Identity  Cards  were issued from the  beginning  of

October  1948  and  dragged over in  1949.  From  the

information   given  by  the  National   Registration

Office,  50,000  of these cards were  issued  in1949.

With a view to registering about 200,000 people in  a

matter of a few months, in order that they should  be

placed   on  the  electoral  rolls  for  the   coming

elections,  I think the one and only way  is  through

the Identity Card system, if the question of 10 years

is  to be insisted upon, then the earliest a man  can

prove   his   residence  qualification  through   his

Identity Card is October 1958, making the question of

elections in August 1958 an impossibility. There  may

be  persons  who  may  not be  able  to  furnish  the

evidence   of   residential  qualification   to   the

satisfaction of the officer concerned. In this way we

will be defeating the purpose for which this Bill  is

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking for this reduction to eight years, I

sincerely  believe it will not harm the interests  of

any community, otherwise I would not ask for it. I am

glad  that  the Hon. the Chief Minister has  proposed

that  this  Bill  should  be  referred  to  a  Select

Committee, where this matter will be further thrashed

out.



<br><br>11.54 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully  agree  with the hon. Member for Serangoon  in

his comments that this Bill has at long last made its

appearance in this Assembly. The Government  in  fact

should  or  could have prepared or drafted this  Bill

much earlier. To force it through now, to rush it  in

a  matter of a month and five days and report back to

this  Assembly, is too fast work. If  this  Bill  had

been  prepared  much earlier, I do  not  think  there

would be need for this rush. But I would not, just as

the   hon.  Member  for  Pasir  Panjang,  attack  the

Government   for  not  seeing  fit  to   reduce   the

residential  qualification period to eight  years.  I

presume that this Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2556</b></font><br><br>



was  drafted  under an all-Party  agreement  and  it

should  be  drafted  in  the  way  that  was  agreed.

Therefore  I must congratulate the Government,  after

representations made by the public, the Chinese Press

and  the Chamber of Commerce, that it is prepared  to

commit  this Bill to a Select Committee so that  all

references made here and in public could be carefully

gone  into. I also hope that the Committee will  take

into  consideration and make available  opportunities

for   oral  representations, and  not  only  receive

written representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While going through this Bill, Sir, there are two

points  of  importance which should  receive  careful

consideration,  and my two points  agree  again  with

those of the Member for Serangoon. The first point is

the powers of the Minister, and the second again the

question  of residential qualifications. I will  deal

now with the first point. To entrust the whole burden

of  discretion  on  the  hands  of  the  Minister  is

definitely  too heavy a burden. Although there  is  a

clause which gives provision for appeal, to give  the

Minister arbitrary powers to withdraw any citizenship

that has been given or to disallow any citizenship is

too  much.  We have a Council of Ministers comprising

of nine Ministers with the Governor as chairman.  I

think that all such powers should be entrusted to the

Council  of  Ministers rather than  to  the  Minister

alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of residential qualification;

why  10 years? Why not five, or three, or even  seven

or eight?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Or none at all!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Or none at all? The hon. Member

for  Pasir  Panjang has suggested eight and  quite  a

number of people, too, have the opinion that eight is

quite  reasonable. When ten years was agreed, I think

the  question was not carefully gone into at the  all

Party  meeting,  and  I think  this  is  because  the

Independents were left out! Otherwise the  suggestion

would  have  been  made. The hon.  Member  for  Pasir

Panjang  said it is now an afterthought; although  he

agreed originally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2557</b></font><br><br>



it  should  be 10 years, it should now be reduced  to

eight  years.  An  afterthought  is  never  too  late

because  if  it  is  good, in the  interests  of  the

people, it should be considered. I understand,  Sir,

that  in the United States only five years' residence

is   required  to  apply  for  citizenship, in   the

Federation, as the hon. Member for Pasir Panjang also

said, it requires only eight years; and our Singapore

law for naturalisation only requires seven years.  So

why  then  a  figure  of 10 rather  than  considering

eight, seven or five? If we take eight years, I agree

with  the comments of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce

that  as the Identity Card system came into being  in

1948 it will be very convenient for the Government as

well   as  the  public  to  prove  their  residential

qualifications through their Identity Cards; with the

figure 10, nothing can be produced to prove residence

of 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister said lately that he

would  call  another all-Party conference to  discuss

this  matter. I wonder if he has done it and, if  so,

what  is the result of that conference and why a Bill

drafted  in  this  way  has been  placed  before  the

Assembly.  One thing that strikes me, Sir,  I  cannot

understand    why    the   period   of    residential

qualification is two years longer than that  required

in  the Federation? The Hon. the Chief Minister  said

this  morning that he is looking forward to  the  day

when  Singapore could be merged with the  Federation.

If  that day should come, what would happen, Sir,  if

the  Federation  requires only  eight  years  whereas

Singapore  requires  10? What of  the  difference  in

policy then and how will both Governments, which will

then be one Government, deal with the matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, naturalisation only requires

seven  years and if we are going to enforce  stricter

qualifications for the application of  citizenship  I

think we shall be losing sight of the basic principle

of relaxing qualifications and encouraging our people

to become Singaporeans. All political Parties whether

in this House or outside this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2558</b></font><br><br>



House  have always claimed that they will  fight  for

the  rights of the people. I think this is the chance

now to show their sincerity, and this is the time  to

show that they will, in fact, fight for the rights of

the    people,    by   relaxing   these   residential

qualifications. If we really enforce this  period  of

10  years  I  doubt that we will be  encouraging  the

people to become Singaporeans. But if we relax it, as

the  hon. Member for Pasir Panjang said, we will have

an  average of 10,000 people - I estimate it at  13,000

because  260,000  may  be  affected - and  13,000  more

people   will  be  allowed  to  register  or   become

Singaporeans.  That  will again help  them  to  elect

their representatives to this Assembly and have their

rights.  If  we are going to enforce 10 years  it  is

tantamount  to  forsaking our  own  people  here  and

discriminating against our own people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compare the residential qualifications required

for  citizens or residents of the Federation,  or  of

the  Commonwealth countries, or even  of  the  United

Kingdom. If you read clause 8, Sir, it merely says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person shall be entitled, on making application

therefor to the Minister in the prescribed manner, to

be  registered  as  a  citizen  of  Singapore  if  he

satisfies the Minister that he-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is of full age and capacity; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) has resided in the Colony throughout the two

years   immediately  preceding  the   date   of

application; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) is either-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a person born in the Federation of Malaya; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) citizen of the United Kingdom and

Colonies; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) citizen of a Commonwealth country which has

been specified by the Minister

by   notification  in  the  Gazette  to  be   a

Commonwealth   country  to  which   this   sub-paragraph applies."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, why discriminate against our own people?

Why  do  we  allow people from outside  to  have  two

years' residential qualification?

says, "Allah ma!" He cannot express more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that when this Bill goes to the Select

Committee, very careful thought will be given  to  it

so that there will not be an afterthought or a second

thought  or  a third thought, and so that  when  this

said  it  may be ten years, eight years or  even  two

years.  I  expect that every Member of this  Assembly

should come here with a definite thought in his head,

and  not  come here and say things which he  may  not

mean. Now the hon. Member for Queenstown compares the

eight-year  qualification  with  the  period  in  the

Federation of Malaya. I suggest that he should  study

the Federation law. There it is eight years for those

born  in  the  Federation - that is the  difference - and

they  must also have another qualification, and  that

is  the language test. I suggest that the hon. Member

for  Queenstown study the provisions more  thoroughly

before he comes and speaks to us.



<br><br>12.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

listened  with considerable interest to the Hon. the

Chief  Minister's  exposition on this  Bill.  He  has

explained  a number of points but there are  quite  a

few  more  which require elucidation. It is important

that   the  citizens-to-be  of  this  country  should

understand clearly what the intentions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2560</b></font><br><br>



Government are, particularly as representations to  a

Select Committee of this House are to be invited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to relate the definition of

"Commonwealth country" in clause 2 to clause 8 (2) as

proposed  to be amended. Clause 2 as proposed  to  be

amended  lists  the  Commonwealth countries  and  now

indirectly  by  reversion to the British  Nationality

Act,  1948,  and these are presumably to  remain  the

same countries as listed in the present clause 2. But

in  clause 8, whether in the present version  or  the

version with the proposed amendment, the Minister can

apparently pick and choose the Commonwealth countries

he considers eligible for citizenship by registration

by  notification  in the Gazette.  In  this  context,

Pakistan  could be excluded, Ghana could be excluded,

Australia could be excluded. It seems to us important

that the Government should explain the intentions  in

this  matter.  Why not leave clause 8 (1)  (c)  (iii)

that permits a citizen of a Commonwealth country with

no powers of exclusion handed to the Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I wish to relate together clauses 8, 9 and

15.  Clause 8, which states briefly a person born  in

the  Federation, or a citizen of the  United  Kingdom

and  Colonies, or a citizen of a Commonwealth country

must   have  two  years'  residential  qualification,

remains permanent. On the other hand, clause 9  which

refers  to those excluded under clause 8, has a  two-year  life  and  lapses al the end  of  that  period.

Clause  15,  referring to naturalisation,  presumably

(because  further  explanation is  needed)  virtually

comes  into  operation after two years and supersedes

clause  9  but  not clause 8. Nobody,  one  imagines,

would  want to naturalise so long as clause 9  is  in

operation,  and nobody eligible under clause  8  will

ever  want  to  naturalise. If this is the  case  and

clause  15 is, so to speak, a follow-on to clause  9,

then it seems that if the words "to whom section 8 of

this Ordinance does not apply" should be inserted  in

clause 15 as they have been in clause 9.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to clause 9, there is only one observation

I  would  wish to make. Regarding the period  of  ten

years or eight years or whatever it might be that the

Select  Committee may consider, we  are  quite  happy

that  this  matter be thrashed out by that Committee.

Reference  has been made to the fact that  we  should

follow  the Federation period of eight years  but  we

should  be  careful to see whether our  clause  9  is

exactly parallel. In the Federation Constitution, the

relevant  section  states that  a  person  must  have

"resided  in  the Federation during the twelve  years

immediately preceding the date of his application for

a  period amounting in the aggregate to not less than

eight  years".  Clause 9 of this Bill,  the  relevant

section  is  that  he  has  "resided  in  the  Colony

throughout  the ten years immediately  preceding  the

date  of  the coming into operation of this  Part  of

this Ordinance". Quite apart from the question of ten

years   or  eight  years,  there  is  a  considerable

difference  between the two sections. The  Federation

period  is counted from the date of application;  the

Singapore  period  is  counted  from  the   date   of

operation  of  the Ordinance. In other  words,  if  I

understand it, if in Singapore you apply to  register

at  the  end of the two-year period, you will,  under

the  present  Bill,  have to have resided  almost  12

years  in the colony. This seems to us open  to  some

objection and will require looking into in the Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to clause 22, where there is another

difference from the Federation Constitution.  At  the

end of subsection (3) of section 25 of the Federation

Constitution, which is parallel to sub-clause (3)  of

clause  22  in  this Bill, there is a  proviso  which

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that no person shall be deprived of his

citizenship under this clause if as a result of  such

deprivation he will not be a citizen of any country."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proviso has been omitted from our Bill although

it  seems to be needed, particularly in view  of  the

remarks  made by the Hon. the Chief Minister  in  his

speech, and we would like to know whether this is  an

intentional omission or an oversight.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2562</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in clause 22 I would refer the Hon. the Chief

Minister  to  sub-clause  (3)  (c),  deprivation   of

citizenship  if  the citizen "has within  five  years

after  registration or naturalisation been  sentenced

in any country to imprisonment for a term of not less

than  two  years." Surely this should be  limited  to

imprisonment  for  crimes of  a  serious  or  heinous

nature? Would it not be absurd to deprive a person of

such a precious thing as citizenship if the crime  is

a motor accident?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I come to clause 25. The Bill itself is one

thing but the procedure by which it is to be put into

effect  will  make  or  mar its success.  There  will

presumably   be   two   forms  of   application   for

registration  of  citizens, one  for  those  eligible

under clause 8 and one for those under clause 9.  The

former group will for the most part be those who will

have to be struck off the present electoral rolls but

apparently are not specified as having to be of  good

character. The latter group are those who so far have

been  aliens ineligible for the vote and who have  to

satisfy the Minister that they are of good character.

But whether application is to be made under clause  8

or  clause  9,  it  is essential  that  the  greatest

possible  simplicity in procedure  is  observed,  and

those eligible to apply are not frightened off  by  a

multiplicity  of requirements as if they  were  being

subjected  to  an inquisition. If similar  forms  are

used  as  those now used for naturalisation  and  the

same expense is involved, nobody will register except

those  regimented  to do so. We hope  the  system  of

finding  four  persons  of  high  status  to  sponsor

applications  will  not  be  introduced.  Sponsorship

under  the present naturalisation rules are virtually

a waste of time. However high and mighty the sponsor,

it is practically of no avail-the ultimate test is  a

pass of good character by the C.I.D.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only simplicity, and I would add speed, in

procedure,  without any feeling of  persecution  will

bring   forward  the  registration  as  citizens   of

Singapore  the 200,000 or so for whom  this  Bill  is

primarily  designed, and I hope  that  the  Hon. the

Chief Minister will indicate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2563</b></font><br><br>



what   is  in  his  mind  in  this  respect  so  that

confidence can be engendered in the public mind  here

and   now.   In   addition,  the  places   to   which

applications  for registration will be made  must  be

numerous  and  easy of access, and the officials  who

assist  the  applicants must  be  trained  to  be  as

helpful as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the passing of the Bill is one

thing,  but  the  right  psychological  approach   to

Singapore's  future citizens in order to  obtain  the

maximum   registration,   is   the   most   important

consideration. In this the Government  bears  a  very

heavy responsibility.

this  Bill  as  presented  to  the  House  today   is

acceptable in the main to us and we more than welcome

this Bill because from the very beginning when  the

Rendel Constitution was being discussed for elections

to   this  House,  we  presented  the  case  for  the

registration of voters to be automatically taken from

the  register  of  identity  cards  rather  than   by

application through registration forms. We have  been

consistent  in  trying to enlarge  the  franchise  in

order  that  the  people of this  country  can  speak

through the representatives voted by them and because

of  this  we  also  asked that the period  for  which

persons who were to be granted citizenship should  be

seven years instead of eight years when there was  an

all-Party conference before the delegation  left  for

London in 1955. In order to present a common front to

London, we agreed to a compromise and we accepted ten

years  but  now that the Federation in its generosity

has granted citizenship to

12  years  I  think, Sir, we have a case to  ask  Her

Majesty's Government to reconsider the clause in  our

constitution  whereby we agreed  to  ten  years.  Her

Majesty's  Government has always  been  gracious  and

understanding  of our problems and I  am  quite  sure

that  if the Hon. the Chief Minister were to take  up

this  point with Great Britain and submit the remarks

that   we   have   made  in  this   House   and   the

representations we have received from the people, Her

Majesty's Government will be willing to grant us this

concession  and  we  should be able  to  receive  Her

Majesty's Government's assent whilst deliberating  on

this Bill clause by clause in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very glad that some 300 persons will now be

entitled to exercise the vote to help us to steer the

ship of state.

people  on  the whole have contributed much  to  this

country's  progress and development to make Singapore

the  prosperous  and  fine  city  that  it  is  today

comparable with any of the big cities in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Singapore and I can say that most of

us  who were born here have taken an easier course in

life  in  that  we have entered the professions -  the

clerical services, the less-tiring work - whereas these

people  who have been immigrants have done  the  hard

work and the real toil; they ran the small shops  and

when  they  prospered  they  started  industries  and

helped in all the manufacturing that is going  on  at

the  present  moment.  It is only  right  that  these

people should as rapidly as possible be given  a  say

in the government of this country.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you

have heard from this side of the House that all of us

welcome  this Bill. Our complaint is this: this  Bill

should have come after the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2565</b></font><br><br>



Marshall  Conference in London. Although the  mission

was  not  successful, at least this Bill  giving  the

fundamental  rights to the people  of  Singapore  who

have  settled  down  over  here  and  who  have  made

Singapore as it is now should have been given to them

much  earlier. However, I did expect that  this  Bill

would  have come immediately before this Assembly  as

soon  as  our  present Chief Minister  returned  from

London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we wanted elections as early as possible in

August this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> That has passed. If that was done,

I do not think the Labour Front would have lost -

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> -their great leader. However during

the  course of the talks, the Chief Minister told  us

that  we  could hold the elections by  April  at  the

latest  though  we  were  anxious  to  hold  them  in

December 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is a short one and a very important

one.  The  contents have been known to the public  of

Singapore  for the last two years and I am sure  that

the  Select  Committee can finish their deliberations

in two to three weeks at the latest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there is one thing I want to stress:

we  want to hold the elections at the earliest moment

and  one  of  the Members of my Party on  the  Select

Committee will move a proviso that those who want  to

register  should  register as early as  possible  and

that  those  who  register by  31st  December,  1957,

should  get a chance in the first election.  This  of

course  will not debar the others. They can  register

if  they  want  to a little later in a year  or  two.

Their right of registration does not go away. But  we

do  not  want  to wait any longer for internal  self-government.  I must stress and remind  the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister that in his speech he said  that  his

Government was a caretaker Government; this was  some

time in May or June 1956. This is September 1957  and

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2566</b></font><br><br>



are  nowhere near it. Any attempt to delay it - I  hope

they  will not do that in their own interest - will  be

attacked by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have many post offices on the island. They

can  be made registering centres for the citizens  of

Singapore  who want to register themselves there  and

at  the  same  time those who need screening  can  be

screened  there. The argument will be, "Oh,  we  have

got  250,000 voters." Yes, what does it mean? We have

so many centres and we have the staff. The Government

jolly  well knew that this Bill was coming  and  that

the  elections were wanted. It was their duty to make

the machinery ready.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many points were discussed during the debate

this  morning regarding the details and they will  be

taken up in Select Committee but I would like to draw

attention to clause 22 (3) (a) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may, by order, deprive a citizen of

Singapore by registration or by naturalization of his

citizenship if he is satisfied that that citizen-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) has shown himself by act or speech to be

disloyal or disaffected towards Her Majesty

or the Constitution of Singapore;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand that: "Constitution of Singapore"

will be internal self-government. Now suppose someone

or  anyone  demands  that he wants complete  freedom;

will  he  be  deprived  of his right  of  citizenship

because   that   will  be  against  the  constitution

prevailing  then?  I  hope  the  Committee  will  pay

attention to the wording of the clause which  I  have

just  pointed out. Otherwise, Sir, we are quite happy

with this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Citizenship Bill marks the first step in

the  process of rationalising who we mean when we say

the  "people  of  Singapore". The next  step  in  the

process of rationalising is who we mean when  we  say

the "people of Malaya", for we do not want to be just

the  people of Singapore. Today all kinds  of  people

just  because they are living and working  in  Malaya

have  claimed  the right and are in our  local  Press

called "Malayans", Indeed some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2567</b></font><br><br>



political commentators of foreign origin and  foreign

loyalty  have  the  audacity to  write  articles  and

editorials  in  which they cloak their foreign  views

behind  the  phrase "we Malayans". This  offence  has

been most often committed by European journalists  in

the  colonial-owned Press. After this Bill has become

law,  such  people will be exposed. Only  those  with

Singapore citizenship can include themselves  in  the

phrase  "we  the  people  of Singapore".  This  is  a

healthy step in nation-building and we welcome it  in

that spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not here to make an electioneering speech to

win  over  the  potential  votes  of  those  who  may

register   under   this   Ordinance.   All    Parties

contributed towards the taking of this step  forward.

Let  us  not descend into communalism just for  vote-catching  or  we will ruin what we hope  to  achieve,

namely  a  united  and  happy  Singapore  and   later

Malaya - a  people prepared to work, to  live  and,  if

necessary,  to die for Malaya above everything  else.

Let  every  Member  in this House  ask  himself  that

question. If the answer is yes, then he qualifies.

I  rise  to support the Bill which has been presented

by  this  side of the Bench. However, I  am  somewhat

perturbed  to listen to the speeches of some  of  the

Members of this Assembly, one after another, who have

been standing up making suggestions or proposals that

the  residential qualification for citizenship should

be  reduced  from ten to eight years. Arguments  have

been  brought forward particularly by two Members  of

this  Assembly who said that if in the Federation  of

Malaya the residential qualification is eight out  of

the last twelve years then why we in Singapore should

not  also adopt the same policy. Well, Sir, I do  not

see  the  logic of this argument. If we are going  to

follow  what the Federation does, I say this: let  us

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, in my hand a document which is the

Report  of  the  Singapore Constitutional  Conference

held  in  London in March and April 1957. This  is  a

document  which  is  an agreement  drawn  after  long

deliberations  and discussions and it was  signed  by

Members  of  this  Assembly who themselves  represent

responsible political Parties. I hope, Sir, that this

document  will  not be turned into a piece  of  scrap

paper.



<br><br>2.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has to

be  judged according to whether or not it measures up

to   the   Report  of  the  Singapore  Constitutional

Conference  held in London in March and  April  1957.

All  Parties signed this Report and the proposals  on

citizenship are contained in paragraphs 49, 50 and 51

of  the  Report.  The  spirit of  our  intentions  is

contained in this Report. Whether or not that  spirit

has been translated into the administrative machinery

of the Bill is the test by which I suggest the Select

Committee be guided in its deliberations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship is essentially a question of loyalty. A

man  is  a  citizen of a state and has the  right  to

determine the future of the state because he is  part

of  an entity. It is really a subjective question: Is

this my country? Do I owe it undivided loyalty? Am  I

prepared  to fight and die for it, if necessary?  But

there  is  no  known test yet that you  can  apply-no

known lie-detector or psychological machine to record

the  heart beats or the brain beats of a man to  test

this.  If  there  were, then we can  scrap  all  this

question  of  whether  it is  ten  years'  residence,

whether one speaks a certain language or whether  one

swears   an  oath  of  allegiance  or  an   oath   of

renunciation.   You   can  go   through   all   these

formalities and still have no loyalty to  a  country.

That is why every country is faced with this problem.

The test is really qualitative. But the law and human

knowledge  do  not provide us with the  apparatus  to

measure  the  mind and the heart. Hence the  law  has

devised  quantitative tests. One rule  of  the  thumb

says, "If a person has been born and brought up in  a

particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2569</b></font><br><br>



community  in a particular country, the  chances  are

that he is loyal to it, will live, fight and die  for

it."  And  so  certain countries in this  world  have

developed in their laws the principle of jus soli - the

right of citizenship by place of birth. It is because

we  are  part of the British Empire that we had  this

particular  system drafted into our laws. Whoever  by

the accident of his birth is born in any of the three

Settlements in Malaya which in British legal  fiction

was  British territory, becomes a British-subject and

enjoys the rights of a citizen but those born in  the

Protected States, both the Federated Malay States and

the   Unfederated  Malay  States,  which  by  British

constitutional fiction were not British  territories,

did   not   automatically  acquire   the   right   of

citizenship. Our problem in Malaya is the  result  of

British colonial policy in the last hundred years.  I

am  not flogging a dead horse when I say this because

I  think  one  of the greatest sins that the  British

colonial administration committed in this country was

that,  in their desire for rapid exploitation of  the

natural  resources  of  this  country,  they  had  no

immigration  policy  and  no  education  policy.  The

result  is that today the building of one nation  and

one  people is the most difficult of all tasks facing

Malaya.  It has certainly created the most  acute  of

problems in the South-East Asia region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are other systems where

they do not measure loyalty by the accident of birth.

The  quantitative test of loyalty of the Germans  and

the  Chinese is whether the father is a German  or  a

Chinese.  If  a  German  gives  birth  to  a   child,

according to German and Chinese theory, he is  always

faithful to the fatherland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we in Singapore are now going to adopt as part

of  our  legal system the theory that place of  birth

ensures loyalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for better or for worse, we have to face the

problems  that  are existing. I ask  the  House  when

considering  this Bill to remember that this  is  not

just  a  question of electioneering,  of  whether  it

should be eighty years or eight years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2570</b></font><br><br>



or  ten  years. Can we devise a quantitative test,  a

rule  of thumb, which on the average, in the majority

of  cases,  would mean that a man is  loyal  to  this

country? That is the acid test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind this House by referring to

the  Federation  of  Malaya Constitutional  Proposals

(No.  41  of 1957) where they have attempted to  deal

with  this  problem  of a large immigrant  population

which  has  no political rights. It says in paragraph

9:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is proposed to accept an amended form of the

recommendations  of  the Commission  with  regard  to

citizenship  by registration of persons  who,  though

not  born  in  the Federation, were resident  in  the

Federation on Merdeka Day."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first qualification is residence in the

Federation on Merdeka Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is recognised that those who have shown their

loyalty  to  the Federation and have  made  it  their

permanent  home should participate in the rights  and

duties  of  citizenship. But  such  persons  will  in

effect be obtaining citizenship by a process akin  to

naturalisation and it is therefore proposed that  the

Government  should be in a position to exercise  some

discretion  in  the  grant of  citizenship  to  them.

Accordingly,  where  the  registration  authority  is

satisfied   that  an  applicant  has  the   necessary

qualifications,  as  recommended by  the  Commission,

that  authority shall give notice to that  effect  to

the  Minister appointed to exercise the functions  of

the  Government of the Federation under Part  III  of

the  Constitution; and unless the Minister  otherwise

directs  within such period as may be prescribed  the

authority shall register the applicant accordingly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All countries all over the world have laws to deal

with persons who are not born part of a community but

who  would like to be part of a community and who  go

through  a  process  by which they demonstrate  their

unflinching  loyalty to the new community.  One  hon.

Member  today  quoted the American  citizenship  laws

which say that one has only to reside in America  for

five  years. I would like to remind that hon.  Member

that if he landed in Long Island he would wind up  in

some immigration warehouse and would be packed out of

America  in  a very short time. There is  already  an

entrenched   and  established  community   and   that

community  sees  to  it that its  cohesiveness  as  a

social and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2571</b></font><br><br>



cultural  group remains intact and secure before  the

immigrant is taken in and absorbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the British when they went round the world and

carved  out dominions for themselves, like the United

States  of  America which were once British colonies,

Canada, Australia, New Zealand and even South Africa,

saw to it that they were "the people". This is a very

important  thing.  You  must start  off  with  "self"

before you can have "self-government." There must  be

a  self. So the British when they enter a colony say,

"We  are  'the self'." Thereafter they say,  "Whoever

they  may  be, even Hungarian heroes of  the  October

revolution  who became exiled from Hungary  after  an

abortive  revolt,  they go to Australia  on  a  quota

basis. Then the Australian Government sees to it that

they  learn the Australian language (which  is  quite

different from the English language if one listens to

it),  and  the  Australian  way  of  life.  They  are

absorbed  into an Australian community so that  there

is  no  danger  of the Australian community  becoming

something  different." So they did in  South  Africa,

Canada  and  the United States. They carried  on  the

British  tradition. Anybody who goes  to  the  United

States of America learns how to speak American, faces

the  American  flag - I do not know  whether  he  sings

"Stars  and  Stripes"  or "Star Spangled  Banner" - and

demonstrates  his  loyalty  in  no  uncertain  terms,

before  he  is digested into the American complex  of

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what happened in the British colonies? They in

their arrogance thought that they were the world.  So

like  the  Romans,  they said,  "We  will  coin  this

concept Pax-Britannica. The peace of Great Britain is

just  like Pax-Romana, the peace of Rome."  And  they

who  were part of the subject people, not British  by

birth,  race,  origin or culture, but  British  as  a

result  of conquest and conversion in mind - those  for

instance   who  converted  their  native   names   by

acquiring Western initials in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2572</b></font><br><br>



order   to  convert  themselves  into  Europeans - were

accorded  this privilege. That was what  the  British

wanted to do and what in fact at the height of  their

power  they did succeed in doing. When a person said,

"I  am  a British subject," he was like a man in  the

old  days of Rome saying, "I am a Roman citizen"  and

must  be  treated differently from the other  natives

who are not Roman citizens. As a result of this, when

the  British went away from India to Burma, a lot  of

Indians  went with them to Burma. When they  came  to

Malaya,  a lot of Indians and British and  a  lot  of

other  people  besides came to Malaya. In  the  early

days  when they introduced elections in 1948, we  saw

all  these native expatriates claiming the  right  to

represent  the  people  of  Singapore.  In  fact,   I

remember  one who although not born in this  country,

because  of her right as a British subject  succeeded

in   becoming  a  representative  of  the  people  of

Singapore. I am told that a warrant was later  issued

for  her  arrest because quite a large sum  of  money

belonging to local citizens was missing and  she  had

absconded back to the country of her origin. That was

the  kind  of lunacy that we had in this Colony.  For

cheap  labour, they allowed unrestricted  immigration

without any plan, without any policy and without  any

intention  of creating or preserving the self.  I  do

not  condemn the immigration as such, but  I  condemn

the Government which has no regard for the people  of

the  country  who have been assimilated and  did  not

bother  to educate or to provide education for  those

coming  in.  Today,  with  the  renaissance  of   the

motherland   of   each  of  the   immigrant   groups,

chauvinist  tendencies  are  incited.  Yet  at   this

critical   juncture  we  have  to  call  upon   these

immigrants  to  give  this  country  their  undivided

loyalty.  But  that we must do because  there  is  no

other way. Either we do that or we face a long period

of   further  unrest,  more  unhappiness   and   more

instability.  Let us face the facts:  eventually  the

object  of  this  whole operation  is  to  build  one

people, and one nation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2573</b></font><br><br>



whose object of their loyalty must be Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we did not achieve that when we went to London

because  we  did not succeed in getting independence.

We  only got internal self-government, and hence  the

rather quizzical remark of the Member for Tanglin. He

asked, "Why should there be this discretion to refuse

to   afford   reciprocal   rights   to   Commonwealth

countries?"   We   made  the   distinction   in   our

proposals - and   the   distinction   is    not    made

sufficiently  clear  in  the  Bill  itself - between  a

Federation  citizen and a Commonwealth citizen.  This

idea  of Commonwealth citizen is the product  of  the

"British  subject" concept. As all these  independent

colonies   became  Dominions  they  had   their   own

citizenship laws but the British coined a new concept

"the   Commonwealth  citizen".  Now  it  is  absolute

nonsense  to  say that because you are a Commonwealth

citizen  you  can roam from one Dominion to  another.

You  cannot. If a Commonwealth citizen of India tries

to  immigrate into the Dominion of Australia, he will

find that he is locked up in an immigration depot and

sent back. Similarly if any Commonwealth citizen from

the  Federation  goes to Canada or to  Australia,  he

will  find  that his "Commonwealth citizenship"  does

not  entitle him to political rights in the other Dominions  within that Commonwealth. What has  happened

is  that  all  these  countries have  developed  into

nations  by  themselves and have  created  their  own

nationality laws. It is only the British who wish  to

carry  on with this theory of Pax-Britannica  to  its

logical conclusions and still allow a person born  in

Britain  or in any British colony an automatic  right

of  entry  into  Britain. Now that, Members  of  this

House  will  remember, led to a lot  of  difficulties

when  a  great  number of West Indians went  over  to

Britain.  The British Government at one time  thought

of  changing  the  laws  when they  found  that  this

idealistic  concept  was going  to  militate  against

their own working class. It was because of that  that

we  had  to make this concession: whereas a foreigner

wishing to naturalise in Singapore would have to  go

through  the  ordinary naturalisation regulations,  a

Commonwealth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2574</b></font><br><br>



citizen need only stay here for two years. Now,  Sir,

we  think it is monstrous that we should be asked  to

accord  this privilege to Australians, South Africans

and others who do not afford this privilege to us and

who  in  fact  would prevent us from  entering  their

countries.  Hence  the rider in this  Report  of  the

Singapore Constitutional Conference held in London in

March and April 1957 at paragraph 50 (d) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(d) citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies,

and  other Commonwealth citizens, who had resided  in

Singapore  for a continuous period of not  less  than

two  years, and whose application for citizenship  in

the  prescribed manner and form had been accepted  at

their  discretion by the Government of Singapore.  In

determining  whether for this purpose  a  person  had

resided  in  Singapore for a continuous period,  the

Singapore  Government  would  have  a  discretion  to

disregard periods of absence from Singapore which did

not appear to them to be inconsistent with continuity

of  residence or loyalty to Singapore. In  exercising

their  discretion [these are the operative words]  to

accept  an application for citizenship the Government

of Singapore would take into consideration whether or

not   the   Government  of  the  applicant's  country

afforded  similar reciprocal rights  to  citizens  of

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the operative words. In fact, we did not

want  to  afford anybody such rights as we considered

this  fiction of the Commonwealth citizen  not  worth

preserving. The Member for Tanglin will remember that

even  a  man who has been called the most pro-British

statesman  in Asia, Perdana Mentri Persekutuan  Tanah

Melayu  Tunku Abdul Rahman, went back to London  and

rejected this proposal because he said, in Malaya, we

have  special  conditions and we cannot  accept  this

idea of reciprocal citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He has. I have the Constitutional

Proposals but I do not have the Constitution  itself.

No  Commonwealth  citizen goes to the  Federation  of

Malaya,  resides there two years and  says,  "Please,

may   I   register  myself  as  a  citizen   of   the

Federation?"  because,  said  the  Tunku,  "We   have

special problems in Malaya. We want to make sure that

what  we  are now creating is a self which will  have

complete cohesion and complete permanence."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2575</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite this defect in our new citizenship laws

we  say  that this is a step forward but the ultimate

step is to have our exclusive citizenship laws in one

Malaya.  If  we  are  honest  about  merger  and  the

building  of  one  nation,  when  we  draw   up   our

citizenship  laws, we must see where it is  going  to

dovetail into the Federation citizenship laws because

the  moment  the principle of merger is  accepted  we

have  to  discuss the conditions for it. One  of  the

first  conditions that would have to be  settled  is:

who are the citizens of the Federation of Malaya?  If

we  draw  up  a list of rules making all  and  sundry

citizens  of Singapore in a way which the  Federation

Government    will   later   find    obnoxious    and

unacceptable,  we  will be placing ourselves  in  the

most  difficult position of having to scrap all those

who have acquired Singapore citizenship and make them

apply anew for Federation citizenship. I do not  know

if  the hon. elected Ministers on the other side have

had  the  opportunity or the desire to discuss  these

matters even informally on a purely speculative basis

with their colleagues in the Federation. But it would

be  most unfortunate if at a later stage when we have

agreed  on principle to a merger and are working  out

the details, the Federation Government were to insist

on a completely new set of rules and a completely new

registration  for  citizens  of  the  Federation.   I

therefore  say that this question of eight  years  or

ten  years  should  be  viewed  from  this  angle.  I

appreciate the intensity of feeling of the Member for

Pasir Panjang (Mr Wong Foo Nam) which led to a  very

impassioned  speech  despite  his  loyalties  to  the

Alliance.  The Minister for Education was wrong  when

he said that in the Federation you have to be born in

the  Federation and to reside eight years.  That  was

one  of the original proposals for discussion but the

ultimate   position   is  as   represented   in   the

Constitutional Proposals which say - I have not got it,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir: I was told when  I  went  to  the

library  that it might be in the Chamber  itself  but

there were no amendments to these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2576</b></font><br><br>



proposals  as  I  understand them:  but  I  would  be

obliged if the Hon. the Chief Secretary would give me

his  copy. Article 17, and this is the Article  under

which  subsequently  we will have  to  reconcile  the

rights  of  our citizens who have not  been  born  in

Singapore, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to Article 18, any person of or over the

age of eighteen years who was resident in the

Federation on Merdeka Day,".



<br><br>First qualification: if you are out of the

Federation on Merdeka Day you are out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"subject to the provisions of the Second Schedule,",



<br><br>which I shall come to later,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to be registered as a citizen upon making

application to the registration authority if he

satisfies that authority-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that he has resided in the Federation, during

the twelve years immediately preceding the date

of the application, for periods amounting in the

aggregate to not less than eight years;".



<br><br>That is correct: eight out of twelve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) that he intends to reside permanently

therein;".



<br><br>That is also in accordance with ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(c) that he is of good character;".



<br><br>That is also in accordance with ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) except where the application is made within

one  year after Merdeka Day and the applicant has

attained the age of forty-five years at the  date

of  the  application, that he has  an  elementary

knowledge of the Malay language."



To  put it in simple language, it means that you have

to  show  to the officer in charge that you  have  an

elementary knowledge of the Malay language unless you

are 45 years of age and you apply within one year. So

even though you apply within one year and you are not

45  years of age you go through that drill.  That  is

the  authority on which the Member for Pasir  Panjang

and  the Member for Serangoon are asking for revision

from  ten  to eight. The Member for Pasir Panjang  at

least  I  must say is an honest man. In no  uncertain

way he said that he was in favour of eight, years but

the Member for Serangoon in fact said, "I am ready to

be seduced into changing my mind." He did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2577</b></font><br><br>



say  that  he  wanted  to be seduced  but  he  issued

invitations  to  people  to make  representations  in

order  that he can say, "Alas, although I  agreed  to

this  White  Paper  and I signed this  Constitutional

Report in London, what to do, I am a weak woman."



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> He is not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> So much the more pity for him.

But  what  does our law say? It does not say anything

about language test which I think will be one of  the

tricky  points later on with the Federation,  but  it

says  this: ten continuous years. Now, Sir,  when  we

amend  this  (if we amend this) let us bear  this  in

mind. If the change we are going to make is going  to

bring our laws more in line with the Federation  laws

then  on principle my Party supports it. If the  move

will make our laws more incongruous with the laws  of

the  Federation,  my  Party  opposes  it.  I  do  not

consider the question of eight or ten years a  matter

of  life  and  death  but  I  do  consider  that  the

principle of congruity with the Federation's  laws  a

matter of great importance. I therefore suggest  that

when the House appoints a Select Committee to go into

this  Bill,  the  Select Committee will  accept  that

principle.  I can understand the unhappiness  of  the

Hon. the Deputy Chief Minister; he has the right  to

call upon us to honour the bargain. We had all worked

out a compromise in 1956. We reaffirmed our agreement

to  the  compromise  in 1957 and for  anyone  of  the

Parties  to that agreement to back out on any  excuse

or  pretext is most unfortunate. At the same  time  I

would  like to remind the Deputy Chief Minister  that

if  the Federation is prepared to accept eight  years

in  the  case of those who resided in the  Federation

perhaps  he  may not be stretching the  point  if  he

conceded  that  same  principle to  people  who  have

resided in Singapore. But whatever it is, it would be

in  the interest of everybody to try to sit down  and

argue  this  thing out rationally in a friendly  way,

keeping  in mind the overriding principle of communal

unity  and  solidarity, rather than  coming  to  this

Assembly  to  make  electioneering  speeches  I  know

everybody



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2578</b></font><br><br>



has  in his mind the big question mark: how many  can

my  Party workers get registered and how many  can  I

bring to the polls in my cars to vote for me? That is

part  of  the process of electioneering but all  that

said  and  done,  we have to run this  country  as  a

coherent  community. It is not  in  our  interest  to

start, like the Deputy Chief Minister has done, on  a

very   stiff  and  determined  stand,  or  like   his

colleague  in  the  Alliance, the  Member  for  Pasir

Panjang,  to assail the proposals with such vehemence

and  with  so  uncompromising  an  attitude.  We  can

resolve this and I hope in Select Committee we  will,

to the satisfaction of everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, this problem which the Member for

Serangoon and his colleague the Member for Telok Ayer

queried - clause  22  of  the  Bill - the   question   of

deprivation  of  citizenship. Now I  can  excuse  the

Member  for Serangoon because, unlike the subject  of

boys'  clubs, he is not very conversant  with  this

matter. I know that he is an authority on boys' clubs

and  I  know  that  he  does not  pretend  to  be  an

authority  on the laws of citizenship, but  I  cannot

excuse the Member for Paya Lebar (his colleague)  for

allowing  him  deliberately to mislead  himself  into

misleading us and misleading the people of Singapore.

Every  acquired citizenship in any part of the  world

runs  the risk of termination. There is only one kind

of  citizenship of which one cannot be  deprived  and

that  is  one  acquired by right of  birth.  This  is

British   constitutional  theory.  There  are   other

theories,  I  think, where although you  are  born  a

citizen, you can still be deprived of it to make  you

a stateless person. But in British legal theory there

is  only  one kind of citizenship of which  a  person

cannot  be  deprived, namely, where you  are  born  a

British subject. As a result of that, w, have to face

up  to the fact that all acquired citizenships can be

revoked  and let us read what the Federation says  on

this question of termination of citizenship; this  is

paragraph  11  of  the White Paper  No.  41  of  1957

(Federation of Malaya):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to drafting amendments, it is proposed to

accept   all   the   main  recommendations   of   the

Constitutional Commission with regard-to  termination

of citizenship other than those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2579</b></font><br><br>



dealing  with  deprivation  on  the  acquisition   or

exercise  of  citizenship of a foreign  country.  The

Commission recommended that the Federation should  be

entitled to protect itself against disloyalty of  any

citizen   who  either  voluntarily  acquires  foreign

citizenship or takes advantage of his being a foreign

citizen  under the law of his country of  origin.  It

has   been   agreed  that  this  recommendation,   if

accepted,    together   with   the   other    related

recommendations of the Commission would not give  the

Government adequate powers to require that  undivided

loyalty to the Federation which is considered  to  be

so  vital  for  the future. It is therefore  proposed

that if the Government of the Federation is satisfied

that  any  citizen has at any time after Merdeka  Day

acquired  by  registration, naturalisation  or  other

voluntary  and  formal act (other than marriage)  the

citizenship  of  any country outside  the  Federation

(i.e. including Commonwealth countries),".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which shows the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) that

this  business  of  the Commonwealth  being  all  one

family  sharing the same house is just nonsense!  The

operative words are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the Government may by order deprive that person of

his  citizenship. It is further proposed that if  the

Government is satisfied that any citizen has  at  any

time  after  Merdeka  Day  voluntarily  claimed   and

exercised  in a foreign country any rights  available

to  him  under the law of that country, being  rights

accorded  exclusively to its citizens the  Government

may  by order deprive that person of his citizenship.

It  has also been agreed that persons who have become

Federal  citizens  or citizens of the  Federation  by

registration  or  naturalisation before  Merdeka  Day

should  be liable to be deprived of their citizenship

under the above provisions as if they had obtained it

by registration or naturalisation after Merdeka Day."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be honest about it then. There is no country

anywhere  in  this world which gives  foreigners  the

right  of  citizenship without that reservation  that

the  citizenship  can  be  terminated  under  certain

conditions.  We can say that we must make  sure  that

the   citizenship  rights  are  not  arbitrarily   or

unjustly terminated. We can provide machinery to  see

that  it  goes  before  some kind  of  quasi-judicial

tribunal before the final administrative act or  even

after  the final administrative act. But deliberately

to  allow  the  Member for Serangoon  to  expose  his

ignorance in order that we can all be misled is quite

unfair  and  quite unworthy of the  Member  for  Paya

Lebar.  In  spite of his many years in the  world  of

commerce and housing. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2580</b></font><br><br>



could  not  have  forgotten one  of  the  fundamental

features   about  nationality,  namely,  an  acquired

nationality is one which can be revoked. I say  right

here  and now that if any person acquires nationality

and then goes back to Formosa or Jamaica or-

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Peking or British Guiana or

Britain, and as a result of changing his mind  he  no

longer desires to be a subject of this country,  then

he ceases to be one and that is all there is to it. I

sincerely hope that when we go to Select Committee we

are not going to spend a long time haggling over what

is  established constitutional practice. I would like

to make our position quite clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think we will be deceiving the people of

Singapore and deceiving ourselves if we believe  that

by this act we have solved our problems. This is only

the  first step in the act. First, to those  who  are

prepared to make this their home and be part  of  our

nation, we take them in and afford them all political

rights.  Then we give them all that goes  with  these

political rights. It is only when you give  flesh  to

the  bones of a political constitution that  we  make

loyalty a living reality. The British failed to  make

their  Pax-Britannica a living reality  because  like

the  French  they  never believed in  it  themselves.

First,  they  said, "All those are citizens  who  are

British   subjects,"  and  then   with   a   lot   of

hypocritical  legislation  they  distinguish  between

British  subjects of U.K. origin and British subjects

of non-U.K. origin. Many of us will remember the long

years before this whole myth exploded, the myth  that

those of U.K. origin were entitled by divine right to

expatriation pay, home leave, etc, and those  not  of

U.K. origin were not entitled to these things. At one

stage before the war, local British subjects were not

entitled  to enter the same service. After  the  war,

they  were put in the same service but they were  not

entitled  to certain other privileges. That  was  the

reason  why  it failed, because it was not  practical

and it was not made a living reality. The French have

tried it: this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2581</b></font><br><br>



business   of  Algiers  being  part  of  metropolitan

France. Nobody, not even the Frenchman, believes that

because you are a French citizen therefore you  enjoy

all the rights of a Frenchman. That is the reason why

the  whole  idea collapsed and failed.  We  must  not

allow this to happen in Malaya. In Singapore we  have

no  control  over the situation in the Federation  of

Malaya, but as a matter of plain common sense if  you

say to a man that he is a citizen of a country and he

has  got to bear all the obligations of a citizen but

you  do not afford him the same rights as every other

citizen  then  you  are  not going  to  inculcate  or

stimulate  in him the undivided loyalty  which  other

citizens  who enjoy these privileges would  give.  In

fact you cannot expect it from him. This is the first

step.  The  next  step is slowly to  integrate  these

people  who are going to register under our Singapore

Citizenship  Ordinance into part of  the  society  of

Singapore because only then can we make them part  of

"the  people" and when we say the people we mean them

and us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to

join  issue  with  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar's

exposition  and  theories on the background  of  Pax-Britannica  or  his  ideas of  the  failings  of  the

British  citizenship law. I want to refer to quite  a

separate  and  comparatively  humdrum  side  of  this

business which was raised earlier in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear from remarks which have been made that

there  is  still some apprehension about the workings

of  the procedure which we contemplate when this Bill

is  made  law,  and  I  should like  to  state  quite

categorically, to remove such misapprehensions,  that

the  whole  purpose of the procedure under this  Bill

when  it  is  enacted will be to make the process  of

applying  for citizenship as simple and  as  easy  as

possible.  I think one of the reasons for  wanting  a

Singapore citizenship was the desire to simplify  the

procedure  and to shape the terms to the  necessities

and  the susceptibilities of the people of Singapore,

and  that  will be very much in our minds in  working

out  the mechanism of dealing with applications under

clauses 8 and 9 - the applications to be registered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2582</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have determined that we will charge no fees. We

shall not require sponsors and we shall do our utmost

to  keep  the  form  down  to the  simplest  possible

request  for  the  information  which  is  absolutely

required in order to come within the terms laid  down

in  the  law. We will do our best to see  that  these

forms  are provided not only in English but in Malay,

Tamil  and Mandarin so that they will be intelligible

to   a  person  who  is  literate  in  any  of  those

languages.  We will also do our best to  decentralise

the   whole   procedure  by  setting  up  sub-offices

wherever  we  can find suitable premises - post-offices

have  been suggested - and they are of course very much

in  our minds. We intend, Sir, if we can, to organise

a  widespread machinery throughout the island so that

persons who wish to apply under these two clauses can

do  so  as  near as possible to their homes with  the

minimum amount of officialdom and without expense  or

with  the minimum expense to the applicant.  I  would

like to make it quite clear that we shall do our best

to  make the machinery as simple as possible  and  to

make it work as quickly as possible.

break  with  the colonial era. Before,  the  test  of

political rights is whether a person is part  of  the

British  Empire and not whether he is  a  Malayan  or

Singaporean.  So  we  have the  unholy  spectacle  of

back to India having the right to stand for election,

but  not  those who were born in Johore because  they

are not British subjects. Now we are going to put all

this  nonsense right. This Bill does not go  all  the

way  to put it right but it is the first step and  we

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Members of the Liberal-Socialists which

Party  has been hoping to be the ruling Party  during

the next election - God bless them-



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> God bless Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> -have been saying in this

Assembly  a  number  of things  which  appear  to  be

childish  and  which  indicate  that  they  have  not

studied the Bill properly nor do they appreciate  the

purpose of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the residential qualification, Sir,

I  said  that I was in sympathy. If we had wanted  to

play party politics, we could have boldly inserted in

the  Bill an eight-year residential qualification and

try   to  claim  that  it  was  a  decision  of   the

Government. We do not wish to play party politics  in

a  matter  which has been the result of an  all-party

unity.  We  would not have been successful in  London

during  our  negotiations if there had been  no  all-party  unity. I even said in my earlier speech,  Sir,

that this was a Bill in which all Parties represented

had contributed towards it. We did not claim that  it

was  ours  and  ours  alone  although  this  Bill  is

actually  in discharge of an election pledge  of  the

Labour Front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy), Sir,

seems  to have the craze for early election.  Surely,

Sir,  this  Government  is  also  anxious  for  early

election  but it must not be forgotten that the  date

of the general elections which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2584</b></font><br><br>



is the same date as that for the coming into force of

the  new constitution is governed by paragraph 54  in

the  agreement  signed  in London  by  the  All-Party

delegation.  Under this agreement, it  is  no  longer

left  to  the  Government to choose a  date  for  the

elections  but it is to be left to this  Assembly  to

move  an Address to the Governor that it is time  for

general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir, raised by Members of the

Opposition  has in part been answered by  the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar but as this Bill is going  to  be

committed  to a Select Committee, feel that  all  the

points  raised that have not been answered  could  be

answered by the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<div align="center"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under

Standing Order No. 48, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee

consisting  of  Mr  Speaker  as  Chairman  and   the

following as Members:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Yew Hock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Swee Kee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E. P. Shanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Choon Mong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Koon Teck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

everybody  will  agree that this is a very  important

Bill.  The Hon. the Chief Minister did mention to  me

during  the  luncheon adjournment that he wanted  the

Members of the last Constitutional Mission to  be  on

the Select Committee and two others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it would be in the interest of all if

we  enlarge  this Committee either  to  9  or  to  11

because  my  Party  considers that  it  would  be  of

advantage  if there were two of us on this Committee.

The Government will understand that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2585</b></font><br><br>



this  is a Bill to which all the communities are  most

sensitive  and  I  would  like  to  propose,  if  the

Government agrees to the enlargement of the number of

persons on the Select Committee, that the Member  for

Sembawang and one other gentleman of Indian origin be

included in the Select Committee - not that we want  to

be   communalistic  about  this  but  in  order  that

everybody in Singapore will understand that all views

have  been  represented and adequately heard  in  the

Select Committee. It will be most unfortunate if when

the  Bill  comes  back  from Select  Committee  there

should  be  clauses recommitted for open debate  from

which  a great deal of acrimony may arise. I  do  not

know  how the Government feels about it. Perhaps  the

Liberal-Socialists may not like  the  idea  that  the

People's Action Party with only three members  should

have the same number of representatives on the Select

Committee  as the Liberal-Socialist Party with  seven

members - I am told that at any moment now there may be

eight  members as a result of the activities  of  the

Member  for  Telok Ayer. Be that as it may,  if  they

want  to have three as compared to P.A.P.'s two, well

let them have three. I say juggle the figures how  we

will  but let us make this a representative Committee

so that nobody can say, "We were not adequately heard

or represented."



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would appear then that the Member

for Tanjong Pagar would be suggesting an amendment to

the  second part of the motion. Under Standing  Order

No. 48, there can be no amendment to or debate on the

motion  that  the  Bill  be  committed  to  a  Select

Committee. Therefore I put that Question first, "That

the  Bill  be  committed to a Select Committee,"  and

then  I  will propose the second part of the Question

so  that  a debate can take place on it. The Question

now  before  the  Assembly  is,  "That  the  Bill  be

committed to a Select Committee."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2586</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Select Committee do consist of Mr

Speaker as Chairman and the following as Members:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Yew Hock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Swee Kee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E. P. Shanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Choon Mong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Koon Teck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Tanjong Pagar will move an

amendment, a debate can emerge from that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move that
