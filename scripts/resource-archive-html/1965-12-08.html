<br><br><!-- Inche Yusof bin Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Inche Yusof  bin Ishak) (In Malay)</b>: Honourable  Members,

we    are   gathered   today   to   complete   the

constitutional  formalities  consequent  upon  the

promulgation  of  the independence  of  Singapore.

When  we last met in this Chamber, little  did  we

foresee that in two years we would meet here again

as  a  sovereign  Legislature  of  an  independent

nation, a separate member of the Commonwealth  and

of the United Nations. It is a chastening reminder

that history is not written by legal draftsmen  or

pre-determined at constitutional conferences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, the 8th of December, nearly a quarter

of a century ago, in 1941, the people of Singapore

awakened  to the reverberation of bombs  heralding

the  grim  prospect  of  a  new  order  for  Asia.

Japanese  bombs  shook  the  foundations  of   the

European Empires in Asia. Nationalist forces  were

let  loose throughout the whole of this continent,

upsetting the old order. A new balance of  forces,

indigenous to Asia, has yet to be found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our survival as a people, distinct and separate

from  our  neighbours in South-East Asia,  depends

upon  our patience and resolution in dealing  with

physically  bigger and hence difficult  neighbours

and  upon  our  perseverance in seeking  long-term

solutions to the problems of finding a new balance

of  forces in this part of the world, a task  made

more  difficult  by  the  migration  of  different

racial  groups  into South-East  Asia  during  the

period of European domination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four months since the 9th of August have

given us time to take stock of our bearings,  time

in  which to push emotions into the background for

a   calm  and  realistic  appraisal  of  the   new

opportunities  which independence offers  us,  the

greater  authority  to bring about  what  we  have

always  thought  necessary,  a  tolerant  society,

multi-racial, multi-lingual, multi-religious,

welded ever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



closer together by ties of common experience  into

a  satisfying  society, satisfying  both  for  the

indigenous peoples and for those of migrant  stock

who came during the period of British rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the best guarantee of our future as a

distinct and separate people in South-East Asia is

the  creation of a tolerant multi-racial  society,

we  must however expect obstruction and resistance

to  this  from  groups inside Singapore  and  also

groups    outside   Singapore.   They   are    the

Communalists and the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first disruptive group will continue to be

the  communal extremists, the Ultras in our midst.

There  are people in Singapore who, even  after  a

few  months of separation, still talked raucously,

albeit foolishly, about the implementation of  one

language - the national language -- in teaching at

all  levels including the university.  If  such  a

policy  was unwise when we were part of the  wider

framework  of  Malaysia, now  in  the  context  of

Singapore,  the  lunacy of such statements  should

have been manifest to all. Yet they are being made

and  given  considerable  publicity  in  the  Jawi

press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's declared intention that

its  policy  of four equal and official  languages

with  Malay  as  the common and national  language

shall  remain.  This policy was valid  before  and

remains valid after Malaysia, for this policy  was

not  arrived  at out of expediency. In formulating

it,  the  immutable factors of geography  and  the

hard  facts of demography were taken into account.

Separation  has  not rendered  invalid  the  major

premise  on which this policy was based.  Needless

to  say,  the more extreme any community is  about

one  race, one language and one religion, the more

likely  it is to arouse counter chauvinism amongst

the other communities to the detriment of all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second disruptive group, and in the long run

the more potent, is the Communists. They also play

on  communal heart strings, if only more skilfully

and  cynically. Their followers within  Singapore,

with  backing  from  outside  sponsors,  want   to

disrupt our consolidation of national identity  by

consciously



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



exploiting  appeals  to  chauvinist  and  communal

sentiments. This can be seen from their change  in

tactics  over questions of language,  culture  and

education. Five months ago, in June this year,  at

a  time  when  all  multi-racial and  non-communal

leaderships  throughout Malaysia were gathered  in

Singapore  to rally and strengthen the forces  for

tolerant   multi-racial  policies,   pro-Communist

groups  in  the political and trade  union  fields

denounced the analysis of the Malaysian Solidarity

Convention  that in a multi-racial society,  where

the  races were divided in the percentages of  40,

40 and 20, it is not possible for any one group to

impose its one language and culture on the others.

These  pro-Communist groups then joined the chorus

of   the  Malay  communalists  that  to  refer  to

percentages  of the racial components of  Malaysia

was itself an encouragement to communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet within ten weeks of Singapore's independence,

these  same people cynically switched their  line.

They  now  urge  a revision of the status  of  the

Chinese  language on account of Singapore's  large

Chinese majority, even though Chinese has been one

of the four official languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect them to intensify their

exploitation  of  these issues  as  they  seek  to

recover their lost ground. But we cannot afford to

forget  that  all  this is designed  not  for  the

preservation of the Chinese language and  culture,

but for the disruption of orderly construction and

progress  so that out of the resulting chaos  they

stand a better chance of grabbing power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us the problem is simply how to be ourselves,

and  not  be  swallowed up in some  more  backward

whole.   We  must  never  be  isolated  and   left

friendless  in  South-East Asia,  in  a  Singapore

encircled  by  a  hostile  sea  of  communal   and

obscurantist  forces.  So  we  must  never   allow

ourselves  the luxury of forgetting that  survival

depends upon rallying and strengthening the forces

in  the  area who are for a secular, rational  and

multi-racial approach to the problems of  economic

backwardness   and   the  legacy   of   unbalanced

development in the colonial era.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have travelled a long road to reach

independent  Singapore. Historians  will  find  it

hard not to acknowledge that our independence  was

the  result  of the determination and spiritedness

of the people of Singapore and their leaders. Long

accustomed  to  independent ways  of  thought  and

vigorous  modes of expression, it was not possible

to  muffle and contain them by communal terror and

intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we in Singapore can succeed in establishing a

tolerant  multi-racial society, then the  catalyst

effect  on the rest of the region is bound to  set

off   social   change  within  these   territories

themselves leading to the emergence of  a  secular

nation  state.  In  such a  secular  nation  state

obscurantist  slogans of one race,  one  language,

one  religion will give way to the concept of many

communities  bound together by ties of  geography,

common experience, and economic betterment for all

in  close  co-operation as  one  compact  national

unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must anticipate and prepare for every

contingency.  What happens to us if our  neighbour

of  over  100 million people becomes embroiled  in

even   greater  economic  difficulties?   Will   a

government emerge that will concentrate its effort

on  reconstruction and ultimate prosperity, or  on

greater and more hazardous external adventures?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we always expect that the Government in

neighbouring  Malaysia will  if  not  friendly  at

least   be  neutral  and  unaggressive?   It   was

significant  that the Prime Minister  of  Malaysia

should,  soon after getting Singapore out, explain

to  the world that repression was contemplated  as

an  alternative.  Let us never forget  that  there

were   quite  a  number  of  persons  who   openly

disagreed   with  the  Malaysian  Government   and

ostentatiously absented themselves when  the  vote

was   taken   in  the  Malaysian  Parliament   for

Singapore's  expulsion. It was  not  because  they

loved   Singapore  as  a  component  part  of   an

increasingly  multi-racial  society.  They  simply

wanted  to suppress us, not knowing what the  cost

was going to be. These people view an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



independent     multi-racial    Singapore     with

considerable  distaste and  apprehension.  And  we

cannot  afford  to  assume that such  people  will

never come into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are a few of several imponderables around

which  our  destiny will be determined. We  cannot

afford  to  be caught unprepared. The  unthinkable

must be thought out to the most unpleasant logical

conclusions. Every safeguard and counter  must  be

worked  out to meet these contingencies.  None  of

the  forces and factors that made South-East  Asia

so   turbulent  an  arena  of  conflict  has  been

mitigated by our separate independence.  All  that

has changed is the constitutional framework within

which   we  now  must  work.  And  if  independent

Singapore  does not fulfil our desire for  a  more

stable  and  more  secure basis  for  building  an

enduring  nation, let us be thankful that  it  has

given us more independence of action to seek  that

larger and more secure basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) Honourable Members can lake heart at

the  thought  that there are few new  problems  to

bedevil  this  House. This House has gone  through

many  a struggle, first against Colonialism,  then

Communism,  and then Communalism. And  there  have

always been opportunists to cloud and confuse  the

issues.  But  we have now a much more  experienced

and  discerning people. The difference now is that

any   setback   may   never  be   retrieved.   For

sovereignty is absolute and there are no more back

stops to any slide to perdition other than the use

of  force,  a  hazardous undertaking in  any  area

already bedevilled by too much use of armed force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our duty, that of Honourable Members and of

every citizen who wants a future for his children,

to  ensure that the country is never imperilled by

reckless policies or foolhardy adventurers, for it

is  not  just the two million people of Singapore,

but  nine  millions more in Malaysia who  are  one

people with us, whose hopes will be dimmed  if  we

fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremors from those bombs the Japanese dropped

on  8th  December, 1941, nearly  a  quarter  of  a

century  ago, have not yet subsided, for  they  in

turn triggered off an explosion of nationalist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



forces.  These  forces wrecked the foundations  of

Western  empires in Asia. But we have  as  yet  to

find  a balance of our own making on the continent

of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many of our neighbours and we ourselves would

not  have  a  separate existence if  purely  Asian

forces  were  to  settle the shape of  decolonised

Asia. So we shall have to accept British bases for

some  time  to  come. But we must effectively  use

that  time to seek a more enduring equilibrium  in

this  corner  of  Asia. We must  succeed  if  only

because we have already built so much that is good

in  South-East Asia and there is no other time  or

other place to start all over again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this sombre backdrop of our abiding

destiny  at the southernmost tip of the  continent

of   Asia   that  we  spell  out  the  legislative

programme before this House. They are the steps to

be  taken  to get into better command of  our  own

separate destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Independence Bill which recites

consequential  provisions  arising  out   of   the

declaration of independence on the 9th of  August,

1965,  will  be  presented at the  first  business

sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will the Singapore Constitution (Amendment)

Bill  changing  the nomenclature of  the  Head  of

State  and  this Legislature and the procedure  by

which  the Head of State will in future be chosen.

These  two  Bills will complete the constitutional

change  from  a Singapore as state  in  a  Federal

monarchy  into a Singapore which is an independent

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Commission to look into means to ensure that the

rights of our citizens shall be equal not only  in

law  but  in  practice will be set up.  The  Chief

Justice  will be Chairman and the Speaker,  Deputy

Chairman  of  this Commission. After  hearing  all

views on how the rights of racial, linguistic  and

religious    minorities    can    be    adequately

safeguarded, recommendations will be made to  this

House  on  the  provisions to be included  in  the

Constitution. In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



drafting  of these provisions the Commission  will

consult    the   Chief   Justice   and/or    other

constitutional  experts  of  certain  Commonwealth

Governments so that the provisions will  have  the

benefit   of  the  experience  and  constitutional

expertise of some of the best trained judicial and

legal   minds   in  the  Commonwealth.   But   the

responsibility  for deciding on  these  provisions

will  be  that of this Legislature. The  terms  of

reference of the Commission will be wide enough to

enable them to consider ways whereby all views  of

all  minority  groups  in the  population  can  be

adequately  heard on all matters  concerning  them

before any legislation is enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independent Republic, we have assumed two

new  responsibilities   -  Defence  and  Foreign

Affairs - subjects closely related to our survival.

We  must  quickly achieve sufficient  strength  to

deal   with   any  internal  security  contingency

without  depending on outside help. An  Army  Bill

will be introduced to provide the framework for  a

hard  well-trained if small regular army supported

by  a  large people's volunteer force. But however

small  the  regular  army or large  the  volunteer

component   of   the  armed  forces,   they   will

nevertheless form a significant item in our annual

budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too will the establishment of our Missions

abroad.   Missions  will  first   be   established

immediately  in  some  ten  countries  either  for

reasons   of  geographical  proximity   or   their

importance to us in matters of defence or trade or

Afro-Asia solidarity. Foreign Affairs and  Defence

are  closely inter-related subjects. The  policies

which  we  pursue  in  foreign affairs  inevitably

decide  our  defence commitments and  our  defence

commitments in turn limit the range of options  of

our  foreign  policy.  Our security  depends  upon

having  the minimum number of unfriendly countries

and the maximum number of friendly ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the least number of countries to be

hostile to us if for no reason other than that  we

wish  to  be  as  independent of  foreign  defence

assistance as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



But   there   must   be   creditable   alternative

guarantees  for our security before we can  afford

to be talked into a position where we give up firm

guarantees of our independent survival  in  return

for  not very credible treaties of friendship  and

everlasting brotherhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the business of government and

administration  must  proceed.   In   a   separate

memorandum*  which is being tabled in this  House,

my   Government   has  set  out  the   legislative

programme  and the policies which will occupy  the

time  of  this  House for this Session.  They  are

designed to ensure our continued economic progress

in  the  shortest possible time under the new  and

vastly different circumstances we are faced  with.

Radical  changes arise out of our  severance  from

Malaysia.  Our  plans  for  industrialisation  and

economic development require the re-formulation of

a new basis, for it is clear that there will be no

Common  Market with Malaysia. A compelling  reason

for  our  seeking merger and Malaysia was to  give

our  workers a way in which we could industrialise

behind  the  comfortable  buffer  of  a  protected

domestic market comprising the combined population

of  Malaysia. This never came about, even  in  the

two  years  we were in Malaysia. Now  we  have  to

break into the markets of certain nations who  may

find  an  interest in Singapore's survival  as  an

independent democratic non-Communist country,  and

into  such countries in Africa and Eastern  Europe

who may find trade with us beneficial economically

and politically.



(*See Appendix I)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These nations, beginning with those with whom we

have  defence  associations ---Britain,  Australia

and  New Zealand --- must first be convinced  that

our  problem  is  finite, and  that  it  does  not

involve too much of a sacrifice on their part. The

rate  of  natural increase of our  population  has

been steadily declining in the last six years.  It

is now 2.5 per cent and will probably stabilise at

below  2 per cent. This is a modest and manageable

increase for a total population of two million. So

the  other matter to be controlled is an  increase

in population through immigration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already taken and will

complete    certain   policies   to   limit    the

responsibilities of the Government to the citizens

of  Singapore.  On re-registration  all  Singapore

citizens  will be issued with new plastic identity

cards.  This will be completed before the  end  of

next   year.   Meanwhile   regulations   will   be

introduced  to  require  the  possession  of  work

permits  for  any  person who is not  a  Singapore

citizen,  and whose income is less than  $750  per

month.  These work permits will be given liberally

in  the case of skilled workers, but will have  to

be as restrictive in the case of unskilled workers

as our own unemployment problem requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An infinitesimal percentage of the domestic

markets  of certain highly developed countries  if

open to us by the removal of quota restrictions or

restrictive  tariffs will be more than  enough  to

maintain  buoyancy  in our economy.  Economic  and

political  stability can thus be assured.  But  in

the  long  run, our viability depends upon  having

the  widest  spread  of economic  links  with  the

largest number of countries in the world, so  that

the economic levers on our political policies will

not be in the hands of a few Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But assured markets alone are not enough. Our

workers  must  understand  that  the  creation  of

industries  and job opportunities  will  in  large

measure  depend upon their capacity for hard  work

and  disciplined performance in factories, a large

proportion  of  whose markets  will  be  overseas.

Products  must  therefore  not  only  be  of  good

quality,  but  at  competitive  prices.  In  other

words, there must be greater efficiency at factory

floor level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excesses of irresponsible trade unions in the

early `50s and even in the early `60s are luxuries

which  we  can no longer afford. This  means  that

people  with industrial capital, managerial talent

and the manufacturing know how must be assured  of

sane and stable labour conditions and trade unions

do  not  indulge  in  obstructionist  policies  or

stoppages  of production for reasons of  political

manoeuvre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these two years of confrontation we have

demonstrated  to the Indonesians that  it  is  not

within  their  capacity to destroy or  hinder  the

economic growth of Singapore. The expected loss of

8.7 per cent of our national income as a result of

confrontation by Indonesia has been more than made

up  and  a  net increase of 2 per cent is recorded

for  1964,  over 1963. After we have  demonstrated

our capacity to expand and prosper in independence

on  our  own, we can rationalise our relationships

with our immediate neighbour, Malaysia. We may  be

two  countries, but we are one people. The  sooner

all  face  up  to  this problem,  the  better  the

chances   of   working  out  a  matter   of   fact

relationship  of interdependence on the  basis  of

equal  and  mutual benefit. We must gird ourselves

to  meet these tasks. We must demonstrate not only

our  will but our capacity to defend what we  have

got and improve on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we lack in size of area and population we

more  than make up in strategic location  of  area

and  quality  of population. Given dedication  and

determination  there is little  to  stop  us  from

setting  the  pace of social change  and  economic

development  in  the  region. An  industrious  and

talented  people striving to secure  their  future

will  surge forward to prosperity and strength  if

they are given honest administration and effective

leadership. That so much has already been achieved

in  the  six years since 1959 in spite of constant

strife and turbulence is source for inspiration to

greater endeavour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically, Singapore has achieved creditable

progress  in  the past year. Our nation  not  only

completely   overcame  the  economic  effects   of

Indonesian confrontation but indeed achieved a net

increase in national income. When Indonesia  began

its  hostile confrontation against us in late 1963

it  was estimated that the consequent severance in

trade  with our neighbour would lead to a  decline

of  about 8.7 per cent in national income. Happily

the resilience and dynamism of Singapore's economy

not  only  absorbed the loss but we were  able  to

show  a net increase of 2 per cent in our national

income.   In  1964  Singapore's  national   income

totalled  $2,811  million compared  with  $2,744.6

million the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength and resilience of Singapore's

economy  is best reflected in the increasing  rate

of  capital  formation  achieved.  In  1964  gross

capital  formation  totalled  $415  million  which

represents  an increase of 28 per cent over  1963.

This  rate  of capital formation is a  significant

break-through for it exceeds the average  rate  of

annual  increase of 22 per cent for the period  of

1959   to   1963.  Though  this  rate  of  capital

formation  is gratifying, gross capital  formation

in  1964 still accounts for only about 15 per cent

of  national  income. To achieve  sustained

self-generating  economic growth, Singapore would  need

to  invest  20  per  cent of its  national  income

annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic progress made in 1964 is not an

isolated achievement. It is a step upward  in  the

chain of steady progress achieved in the past five

years.  In  1965  we see the close of  Singapore's

First  Five-Year Development Plan. By the  end  of

this  year  total  planned expenditure  will  have

amounted to $944 million of which $588 million  or

62  per  cent  would have been spent  on  economic

development projects and $343 million or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



36  per  cent on social development projects.  The

remaining  2  per cent was spent on administration

facilities.  Expenditure in the public  sector  in

turn  stimulated investment in the private sector.

In  the first four years of the plan period,  i.e.

1961  to  1964,  gross capital formation  totalled

$1,219  million.  At  the  same  time  Singapore's

national  income also rose from $2,304 million  in

1961 to $2,811 million in 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the rate of progress achieved has been

gratifying,  the task ahead is still a challenging

one  as  we begin our first year as an independent

sovereign nation. The basic economic challenge  is

one   of  providing  remunerative  and  meaningful

employment  to our predominantly youthful  people.

Whilst  the  problem  of  unemployment  is  within

manageable proportions at present, the future both

economically and politically will be fraught  with

danger  if  we  do  not create  enough  employment

opportunities  for  the  rising  expectations  and

rising sophistication of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence my Government is constantly exercising its

mind in the search for new avenues for solution of

this  problem. Our long-term economic  development

will  be  based on a continuation of the  policies

successfully applied in the First Five-Year  Plan.

My  Government  will devote a large  part  of  its

resources  to  expand and firmly  consolidate  the

infrastructure necessary for progress. At the same

time  it  will also provide adequately the  social

amenities  such as education, housing  and  health

facilities  which  are  necessary  to  enable  our

citizens  to  lead meaningful lives.  Hence  about

$976  million  or  64 per cent  of  total  planned

expenditure in the next five years will  be  spent

on    economic   development   projects.    Social

development  expenditure  will  account  for  $486

million or 32 per cent of plan outlay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An onerous but necessary drain on our resources

will  be the provision of capital expenditure  for

defence  and  internal security.  This  burden  we

accept  as  one of the hard facts of our existence

as an independent nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Five-Year Plan envisages an

expenditure  of $1,520 million. It is  hoped  that

this   will  in  turn  generate  matching  private

development expenditure of between $1,250  million

and  $1,300  million.  This should  result,  given

favourable  opportunities  for  exports   in   the

growing  industrial sector of the economy,  in  an

increase  of national income of about 5  per  cent

per  annum.  As  Singapore's  rate  of  population

increase has now fallen to about 2.5 per cent  per

annum  this  would  enable  Singapore  to  achieve

sustained economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independent sovereign nation, we have

reluctantly to assume that our neighbour  Malaysia

will  from  now on treat Singapore  as  any  other

third  country  in trade relations.  On  our  part

however  we  hope that Malaysia will treat  us  in

terms  no  worse  than  any other  third  country.

Singapore will have to search for more alternative

foreign  markets  for its' manufactured  products.

Excluding processing activities industrial  output

in  1964 increased by some 16 per cent over  1963.

To  export  we  shall on our part  have  to  raise

industrial  productivity. On the  other  hand,  we

hope  that  our friends and allies will not  place

artificial   and  discriminatory  trade   barriers

against  our products. We shall therefore  explore

ways  of  expanding  trade  with  our  traditional

partners  and  also look for new opportunities  in

Africa and Eastern Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we shall strive to export more of our

products  my  Government  will  not  overlook  the

necessity to maintain Singapore's present level of

entrepot  trade. This will be achieved by creating

a free trade zone where imports can be broken down

and  re-exported expeditiously without payment  of

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to protect Singapore's new infant

industries  in  their  first  crucial  years,  the

Government has imposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



tariff duties as well as quantitative restrictions

on  a  range  of imported products. The protective

duties  will have to be imposed for some years  to

come  until  the  new industries have  established

themselves.  Quantitative  restriction   will   be

removed as soon as it is opportune to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the emergence of Singapore as an

independent   nation   has   brought   about   new

challenges  it  has also given us independence  of

action.  Thus  regressive taxes imposed  while  we

were in Malaysia have been rescinded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mid-November purposeful fiscal incentives were

announced to encourage manufacturers to export  as

well  as  advertise  more abroad  and  locally.  A

faster  rate of write-off for depreciation of  key

industries which are export orientated can now  be

granted. The fuel tax imposed during the Malaysian

phase was also lifted for manufacturers using fuel

oil for manufacturing purposes.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Affairs is an extension of the domestic

policies  of  the  Government into  the  field  of

international  politics.  Our  policies  must   be

designed first to secure the physical survival  of

Singapore,  its territorial integrity, and  second

its  economic  growth. We seek to be friends  with

all,  to    establish   cordial   and   fruitful

relationships particularly in the field  of  trade

and  industrial development. But the  prerequisite

of   friendship  is  that  there  should  be

non-interference  in  the  internal  affairs  of  each

other.  Not unnaturally, the governments  we  feel

closest  to  are  those  with  similar  background

experiences  of colonial subjugation  and  similar

political  aspirations and policies  to  create  a

more equal and just society. Hence our affinity to

many Governments in Afro-Asia, whose leaders have,

after   successfully  striving  for   independence

against colonialism, now seek to establish  a  new

social order, more just, more prosperous than  the

one they inherited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the past should never be allowed to distort

and  deform our judgment of the wider and the long

term future. No



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



memory  however bitter of British exploitation  in

the   past  should  blur  our  assessment  of  the

capacity  of Britain, and other white  members  of

the  Commonwealth like Australia and  New  Zealand

who  are now the minority in a predominantly

Afro-Asian  grouping  to  make a  contribution  to  our

security   and  to  assist  us  in  our   economic

development. That their policies were designed  to

keep  us  down in the past makes no difference  to

the fact that today they have neither the will nor

indeed the capacity to deter us from pursuing  our

independent  goals. Indeed I believe they  realise

that  it  is in their own basic national  interest

that  we  should continue to survive and  even  to

thrive and prosper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DEFENCE AND SECURITY</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have to bear the heavy duty of protecting

our   citizens  against  external  aggression  and

internal subversion. While we want to be  left  in

peace  to  develop our economy for the benefit  of

our  citizens, outside interests may not allow  us

to  do  this. So we will over the next  few  years

have  to assign a considerable amount of manpower,

material and finance towards protecting our  homes

and  our way of life from the predatory intentions

of  our  much bigger and more powerful  neighbours

against our homeland. This duty and responsibility

though  necessary and accepted as part of our  new

status  will nevertheless throw heavy  burdens  on

us.  For  some, it will mean the carrying  of  the

financial  burden for their less fortunate  fellow

citizens:  for our youth it will mean volunteering

for  military service in the defence of the  State

but  for  one and all it will mean loyal sacrifice

in  one  form or other. These burdens will  appear

onerous  and at times exacting but we have  always

to  remember that the price of freedom may be life

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our internal security, the Government is

determined  to  safeguard  the  institutions   and

attitudes of democracy against subversion even  if

it  means unpleasant action against certain

anti-national  elements.  We  will  not  tolerate   any

attempt to disrupt the unity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



harmony  of  the  people  and  the  economic   and

political stability of the State. We have  clearly

shown  recently  that we are  not  loathe  to  act

against Communists or anti-national elements  when

at  the behest of a foreign power they decided  to

use  unconstitutional measures  in  the  political

struggle. We are prepared to meet them in the open

and  in  public to prove to them and to the  world

that   both   our  past  performance  and   future

programme  have the full support of the people  of

all races of Singapore. If, however, having failed

in  the  open argument against us, the Communists,

their  agents and open front operators  decide  to

take  the law into their hands to force the  issue

or  revert to the underground conspiracy congenial

to  them,  then  we  will  not  hesitate  to  move

decisively and firmly against them.

<br><br><i> Re-Registration  of  Population   and   Issue   of

Identity Cards </i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Government proposes to re-register the

population by issuing them with plastic  laminated

identity  cards.  The  fundamental  aim  of   this

exercise  is  to obviate the forging  of  identity

cards   on  a  mass  scale  for  sale  to  illegal

immigrants. The scheme for re-registration of  the

population will ensure that the new identity cards

are forgery-proof and that Singapore's survival is

not   jeopardised   by  immigrants,   illegal   or

otherwise.  It is proposed to issue two  types  of

identity cards, one for citizens and one for

non-citizens  who  are  permanent  residents  so  that

citizens   and   non-citizens   can   be    easily

distinguished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new system of registration will give each

Singapore resident a number which will be used for

all purposes in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Permits



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictive measures have now to he introduced to

safeguard  the  interests of our citizens.  Before

and  after Malaysia, workers from Malaya have been

freely allowed to take up employment in Singapore.

It   is  with  considerable  reluctance  that   my

Government decided to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



reverse  this  policy. But in the  absence  of  an

economic common market the Government must prevent

the  influx of unskilled workers from outside  and

increasing   the   pressures  on  our   employment

opportunities,  housing and  social  services.  In

1964  alone  there  was  a  net  increase  of  ten

thousand  workers  from Malaya.  Since  separation

from  Malaysia the rate of immigration has  nearly

doubled.  If  measures are not taken,  Singapore's

economic and social burdens will be unmanageable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade Unions



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy is to promote the

development of a healthy non-Communist  democratic

trade  union movement, as an essential element  in

our economic life. The Government will continue to

give  every assistance to the non-Communist unions

who now represent the more than three quarters  of

the organised workers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To foster the growth of a healthy non-Communist

trade  union  movement certain amendments  to  the

trade union ]aw will be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Relations



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of experience gained from the

operation of the Industrial Relations Ordinance in

the  last five years, it has become apparent  that

certain  amendments are necessary.  An  Industrial

Relations (Amendment) Bill will be introduced  for

this purpose in this Session of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour Legislation



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of changed economic, political and

social  conditions, active consideration is  being

given  to improving four other Ordinances, namely,

the  Labour  Ordinance, 1955, the Shop  Assistants

Employment  Ordinance, 1957, the Clerks Employment

Ordinance,  1957,  and the Workmen's  Compensation

Ordinance  (Cap. 157). An Amendment Bill  will  be

prepared  in  respect of each of these  Ordinances

for  introduction into Parliament in  one  of  its

subsequent sittings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health and Education are not only the rights of

our   citizens  as  individuals,  but  a   crucial

investment in the quality of our citizens which is

our pride and basic human investment for the years

ahead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue with its policy of

equal  treatment  to  the four  language  streams,

namely, Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of a second language, other than the

medium of instruction, will be made compulsory  in

all secondary schools. Instruction will begin with

Secondary 1 in 1966. After 1969, when next  year's

Secondary  1  pupils  reach  Secondary  IV,  every

candidate  will  be  required  to  pass  a  second

language in the School Certificate Examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis will be given to scientific, vocational

and  technical education. Diversification  of  the

curriculum  to meet the needs of industrialisation

will  take place by the incorporation of  workshop

facilities    into   the   Secondary   educational

structure.  To overcome the traditional  prejudice

against  technical  and  vocational  education,  a

vocational  guidance plan will be  introduced  for

primary school-leavers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time teacher-training will be re-introduced

in  1966  and  more attention will be  devoted  to

providing   in-service   courses   for   qualified

teachers  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in the next stage of development

will  be  on the expansion of secondary education.

The school building programme, therefore, will now

be  geared  to  the  building  of  more  secondary

schools.   Every  child,  eligible  for  secondary

education, will continue to be assured of a  place

in a secondary school using the language medium of

the parents' choice. A number of special secondary

schools  to be known as "Junior Colleges" will  be

established  for pre-university students  so  that

the  staff  and facilities can be used to  maximum

advantage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the all-round development of secondary

students,  a  plan  is being implemented  so  that

participation  in sports, games and  other

extra-curricular  activities will be  recognised  as  an

integral  part of the education system. A Physical

Education  Centre, incorporating a  Music  Studio,

will   be  built  as  a  headquarters  for

extra-curricular activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a second Teachers' Training

College  to provide full-time teacher-training  is

now  well in hand. Pending the completion  of  the

new  College, full-time teacher-training  will  be

introduced  in  1966, using the  existing  College

temporarily. In the existing College, the  numbers

involved in part-time in-service training will  be

reduced  gradually so that eventually all

teacher-training  in  the  State will be  on  a  full-time

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements have been finalised for the

Singapore  Polytechnic  professional  courses   in

Engineering, Architecture and Accountancy to  lead

to  degrees  to  be awarded by the  University  of

Singapore.   Long-term  plans   are   also   being

formulated  for  the Polytechnic to  move  to  new

premises   and  to  expand  into  a  technological

university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the University of Singapore, the expansion

programme includes the setting up of new faculties

in Social Sciences and Technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have been taken to reorganise Nanyang

University  to  make  it  a  university  of   some

standing  and more in line with the needs  of  our

society  to  which  it  can  make  a  distinctive,

intellectual   and   cultural   contribution.   In

addition  to  subsidizing the University's  annual

recurrent   expenditure,  Government   will   make

provision for its capital development in the  next

five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adult education, the manifold activities of

the  Lembaga  Gerakan  Pelajaran  Dewasa  will  be

further expanded with the building of a new  Adult

Education Centre.

<div align="center"><b>HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The separation of Singapore from Malaysia does

not  affect our Health Service in any way, because

Singapore had autonomy in health even when it  was

part of Malaysia two years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the Thoracic Unit at Tan Tock Seng

Hospital is nearing completion and expected to  be

in  operation  by  early  1966,  when  modern  and

advanced  surgical  facilities for  chest  surgery

will  be  available  to  relieve  the  over-worked

Surgical  Theatres  at  the  Outram  Road  General

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tuberculosis Control Programme has progressed

very  satisfactorily. So far 378,000  persons  had

been examined and by the middle of 1966 Mass X-Ray

Examination of the adult population (by  electoral

divisions) would have completed its first round of

the whole island. To facilitate easy access by the

people  for their chest X-ray, a new Static  X-Ray

Unit will be set up in the City area, next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response to B.C.G. vaccination to immunise

against  tuberculosis remained good. Up  to  date,

more  than half a million children had been  given

protection against Tuberculosis by this method.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A project which represents an advance in the

Medical   Services  in  this   region   has   been

undertaken in co-operation with the University  of

Singapore.  The  Medical Progress Fund  will  help

build   a   $4   million  Institute   of   Medical

Specialities,  in  the  compound  of  Outram  Road

General  Hospital. This 9-storied  Institute  will

have units for Radiotherapy, with super-voltage

X-ray apparatus and radio-active isotopes for cancer

treatment, a Cardiac unit for the investigation of

heart   conditions  as  well  as  for  Open  Heart

Surgery,  a  Neurology  and Neurological  Unit,  a

Kidney Unit with an Artificial Kidney machine,  as

well  as units for investigation of blood diseases

etc.  Government has guaranteed meeting  half  the

cost  (i.e, up  to a maximum of $2.375  million).

Public response in support of the Medical Progress

Fund  has  been generous. The original  target  of

$4.75 million had now exceeded the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



$5.5  million mark. The foundation stone  of  this

Institute  was  laid  on 27th November,  1965  and

building operations are to commence soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A White Paper on Family Planning was published in

September, consequent on Government being asked by

the  Singapore Family Planning Association to take

over   Family   Planning  activities   now   being

conducted  in Government Institutions. The  5-Year

Programme, 1966/70 contained in the White  Paper,

aims  at reducing the present crude birth rate  at

32  per  thousand  by one-half, by  making  family

planning   service  available  to  all   currently

eligible married women in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dental Services continue to expand with the

provision  of 6 new school clinics for the  coming

year.  In the 46 school dental clinics and  the  2

large  school  dental centres  at  Pegu  Road  and

Institute  of  Health,  a total  of  over  150,000

patient-attendances was recorded in 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future development of the dental services will

include  the establishment of more dental  clinics

in  primary  schools  and in  Maternal  and  Child

Health  Centres, and the building of an  extension

to  the  existing  dental clinic  at  Outram  Road

General  Hospital to accommodate a  new  operating

theatre  for  oral  surgical cases,  and  a  large

polyclinic for dental outpatients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-organisation and expansion of the

Environmental  Health Services, Public  Cleansing,

Anti-Mosquito Services and Hawkers Department  are

being  taken  in  hand  and initial  measures  for

improvement  of transport, equipment,  enforcement

of  discipline  and training of  supervisors  have

commenced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of new legislation which was passed

at  the end of last year, it has been possible  to

take  firm measures to control the cattle nuisance

in Singapore from the beginning of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent completion of the Woodlands Home

for  old people, the Department now administers  a

total of 12 welfare institutions. There are plans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



to  set up two more old people's Homes as well  as

for  extensions to two existing Homes for boys and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Aid Bureau has extended assistance from

October  last  year  to  proceedings  before   the

Shariah Court. It gives Muslims free legal aid for

disputes  relating to marriage, divorce  according

to the law of Islam and other related matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parks and Recreation Division will seek to

improve  recreational  facilities  in  Singapore's

parks and playgrounds. A programme of improvements

within  the  Botanic Gardens is at the  moment  in

progress to enhance the beauty of the Gardens as a

tourist and recreational resort; at the same  time

plans are being formulated to expand the botanical

and horticultural research side of the Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a densely populated city like Singapore there

is  need  to  ensure  that the  fire-fighting  and

prevention  services are up to date  and  provided

with  the  latest  equipment and  techniques.  The

Singapore  Fire Brigade is now equipped  with  the

latest  fire-fighting devices, including a Snorkel

for  rescue work from high buildings and two  Foam

Cannons for dealing with oil fires. There  are  at

the  moment  five fire stations in Singapore,  and

plans  have  been formulated for the establishment

of  two new fire stations, one at Toa Payoh  where

building operations are expected to commence  next

year and another at Jurong, at a total cost of  $5

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio and TV Singapura will continue to inculcate

national attitudes and political understanding and

to  inform, educate and entertain the public. With

independence we have the new task of informing the

world  especially the peoples of Afro-Asia of  our

personality,  our situation and of  our  views  on

issues   of  an  international  nature  like   the

unilateral   declaration   of   illegitimate   and

undemocratic independence by Rhodesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TV studios in the new building at Caldecott

Hill  now  under construction are expected  to  be

ready for use by the middle of 1966, when it  will

be   possible  to  introduce  more  varied   local

productions and generally to diversify and improve

existing services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial Radio and Television will help to meet

the increasing cost of expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing literacy in the State has been reflected

by  the  popularity  and growth  of  the  National

Library,  whose  membership now  exceeds  100,000,

seventy-five  per cent of whom are children  under

the  age  of  15.  The Library  will  continue  to

provide essential Library and information services

to  both  adults  and  children  in  the  National

Language,  Chinese, Tamil and English. The  mobile

book-service started last year, will  be  extended

to  cover  more  Community  Centres,  Housing  and

Development  Board  Estates and  the  rural  areas

throughout the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To match the demand for knowledge, the Library

plans to extend its reading hours and to offer its

services  to Government Departments, commerce  and

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publications, posters, field talks, cinema shows

and exhibitions keep the people informed of events

concerning  them and their country's  future.  The

weekly almanac "The Mirror" now published in  four

languages  has a circulation of 50,000. An  active

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Five-Year Housing Programme (1961-1965), produced 51 ,000 units of low-cost housing

at  the cost of $192 million. Together with 23,000

units  built by former governments, they now house 400,000  persons  or  23 per cent  of  Singapore's

population  of 1.8 million. Under "Home  Ownership

for  the  People" Plan, 2,068 units at  Queenstown

have   been  sold  to  the  public  on  instalment

payments. Another 1,416 units at MacPherson Estate

are being made available.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Five-Year Housing Programme (1966-1970) aims to produce 60,000 units of low-cost

housing in urban renewal and suburban areas  at  a

cost  of $268 million - output target 12,000 units

a  year.  The number of units for sale  under  the

Home  Ownership  Scheme to meet increasing  demand

will be decided upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main construction activity will be

concentrated in Toa Payoh, the new Satellite Town.

It is an area of 620 acres of which 100 acres have

already  been  cleared and construction  on  3,500

units   of  housing  commenced.  Toa  Payoh   will

ultimately  provide 36,000 residential  flats  and

shops  for  an  expected population of  �  million

people. It is estimated to cost $150 million  when

completed by 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Land Reclamation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth from Toa Payoh has been used to reclaim the

swamp  at the Kallang Basin. Eventually 400  acres

of  swamp  land  will be reclaimed  and  used  for

developing  into  an industrial estate  for  light

industries.  The  cost  of  this  development   is

estimated  to be $28.5 million and the reclamation

work is expected to be completed by 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major reclamation project is the recovery

of  1,000  acres of land from the sea on  a  strip

along the east coast six miles long extending from

Bedok  to  Tanjong  Rhu.  A  coastal  highway   is

proposed which will link the town centre with  the

eastern suburbs. The cost of reclamation alone  is

estimated to be $53 million. The removal of  earth

from   the  landward  side  will  result  in   the

preparation  of  some  600  acres  of   land   for

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Urban Renewal and Planning</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two pilot Urban Renewal Schemes will be

implemented - N1 (Crawford) and S1 (Outram Road) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) N1 area 90 acres to hold 6,250 new

residential  units  with schools,  community

centre,   children's  creche,   cinema   and

community   facilities.   Acquisition    and

clearance is under way. The mile long  strip

of land fronting the sea between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



Beach   Road   and   Nicoll   Highway   with

participation from the private sector,  will

be  used  for  development of  high  quality

apartments, shops, hotels, cinemas, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) S1 area 130 acres. 7,785 units will be

built and the road system within and on  the

boundary   of   this   precinct   will    be

redesigned  and improved. Private enterprise

will  also  be  invited in redevelopment  of

this area.



<br><br>Because  much of the land involved is  already  in

State  ownership, the success of these  two  pilot

schemes  is  assured. Nevertheless much experience

can  be  gained from these two schemes for further

urban redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maximise benefit from our development and to

make  use  of  the experience of other  countries,

United  Nations Special Fund assistance  has  been

sought  to help in the comprehensive planning  and

redevelopment   of  the  whole   island   on   the

scientific basis. Singapore can always be proud of

her  efforts at urban redevelopment - a task which

many  cities yearn to do but few have the will  or

capacity,  the  resources or  resourcefulness  for

success.  Our efforts may therefore be of interest

to  others  in  conditions similar  to  ours.  The

United Nations Special Fund has indicated that our

application  for  assistance  is  likely   to   be

approved  in  January  1966.  The  assistance   if

approved  will  consist of a programme  lasting  4

years  (1966-1970)  with  experts  to  help  local

officers   in  the  preparation  of  comprehensive

development and transportation plans to cater  for

the needs of a population of 4.0 million in 1990.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Physical Planning and Building Control</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps are in hand to secure more effective and

better   co-ordinated   physical   planning    and

development  control in the State.  A  Ministerial

Committee with the Prime Minister as Chairman  and

the  Ministers for Finance, and Law  and  National

Development as members has been established to

co-ordinate   policy  with  regard  to  comprehensive

planning,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



urban renewal, rural and new town development  and

slum  clearance. The Planning Department  will  be

reorganised  and expanded. Expert assistance  will

be obtained. Development Control functions will be

transferred  to  the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's

Department  so  that  delays  now  experienced  by

developers can be obviated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Building Surveyor's Department will be

reorganised  to  ensure better and more  efficient

service  being rendered to those wanting to  build

houses  or  develop land. A more vigorous  control

will be exercised on unauthorised structures which

had  been  very much of a social problem over  the

last few years but which problem should not be  so

pressing  now  that  the housing  shortage  is  no

longer acute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Public Works Department</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department will concentrate its

efforts  on roads, bridges, drainage and  sewerage

works  to  meet the increasing needs of a  growing

population and a development economy. Drainage and

sewerage  works will be carried out in  accordance

with  long-term plans drawn up to meet the demands

of  new development, new housing estates and urban

and rural expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a comprehensive transportation and traffic

plan  is  drawn up to guide long-term development,

the  efforts  of  the  P.W.D. will  be  channelled

towards  short-term or intermediate-term  measures

to  alleviate traffic congestion and to  ensure  a

smooth  flow  of  traffic on our  roads.  Wherever

possible  existing roads will be widened  and  new

roads constructed. The outer ring road system will

be widened to provide dual carriageways to connect

different   parts   of   the   island.   Difficult

intersections   will  be  improved   and   certain

intersections  will be provided with  flyovers  to

ease congestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department will work jointly

with  the Urban Renewal Unit to redevelop  Kallang

Park  on a comprehensive basis to provide  for  an

Exhibition, Recreation and Sports complex.  In  it

there  will  be  a  National  Stadium  of  Olympic

standard, extensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



car  parking  facilities  as  well  as  landscaped

gardens    and    parks,   floating   restaurants,

exhibition  and  trade  centres  and  probably   a

tourist hotel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Primary Production and Rural and Urban Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective is to help our rural residents

to increase productivity and to reduce costs so as

to attain a higher standard of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater effort will be made to enable our farming

population   to   achieve   self-sufficiency    in

vegetables  and fish for Singapore. Certain  areas

of  swamp  land  (Sungei Poyan and Sungei  Pandan)

will  be  reclaimed for intensive agriculture  and

market  gardening. A new Fisheries Ordinance  will

be  drawn  up  for deep sea and off-shore  fishing

(including trawling).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The needs of the peoples in the urban and rural

areas will continue to be catered for by the Urban

Rural   Services  Committee.  Schemes   to   bring

electricity  and  water  to  more  people  and  to

provide  better communications and  drainage.  The

policy  now  is  to go beyond the  stage  of  just

providing a free stand pipe. Mains will be laid to

the  bigger  kampongs so that pipe  water  can  be

available  to individual households. Every  effort

will also be made to encourage greater development

of  the resources in our islands, particularly the

bigger ones like Ubin and Tekong.

<br><br><i>COMMUNICATIONS</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's position as an international centre

for  communications  in South-East  Asia  will  be

strengthened  when the final stage of  the

South-East  Asia Commonwealth Submarine Telephone  Cable

System which links Singapore, Jesselton, Hongkong,

Guam,  Madang, Cairns and Sydney is  completed  at

the  end  of  1966. This cable will be linked  via

Guam  (where this Commonwealth system will have  a

Commonwealth-owned  cable  station)   to   similar

cables  in the Pacific and the Atlantic, and  will

enable telephonic connections to be made with  the

American and European continents as well as Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities at the Singapore international Airport

will  be  further developed in order to  meet  the

increase  in the number of international  airlines

which operate through Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Telephone Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Telephone Board will continue to

expand  its plant and exchanges to meet  the  ever

increasing  demand for telephones  and  expect  to

provide an additional 4,600 lines and 50 telephone

kiosks in 1966.

<br><br><i>LAW</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Land</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Land Acquisition Bill will be drafted and

introduced  in  the coming year.  This  Bill  will

embody  the  principle  [contained  in  the   Land

Acquisition  (Amendment  No.  2)  Bill  which  was

considered by Select Committee of the Assembly  in

1964]   that   increments   in   value   of   land

attributable to public expenditure will be creamed

off   when   acquisition  of   land   for   public

development takes place. The Bill will also  alter

the  procedure  in  dealing with Land  Acquisition

Appeals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Public Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for electricity and water steadily

mounts   with  the  increase  in  population   and

development. Plans for keeping abreast  to  ensure

that  consumer needs are met are being  constantly

reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opening of the Pasir Panjang Power

Station  on  15th  October this  year  marked  the

completion  of Phase One of the project  when  120

megawatts  were added to the generating  capacity.

By the end of 1966, there will be an increase of a

further 120 megawatts, when Phase Two of the Power

Station is completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathering momentum of the State's industrial

progress  has necessitated the construction  of  a

new   power  station  for  the  Jurong  Industrial

Complex.  Jurong  Power  Station  will  eventually

provide  an  additional  480  mega-watts  to  meet

industrial needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy of rural electrification

has  resulted in 155 kampongs being supplied  with

electricity. Ten other supply schemes for kampongs

are  in hand whilst surveys have been carried  out

on an additional 97 projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average consumption of water has likewise

increased from 32 million gallons a day in 1949 to

over  80 million gallons a day now and this figure

steadily increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new booster station, which aims at increasing

the  pumping  capacity of MacRitchie Reservoir  is

nearing  completion.  Plans  for  increasing   the

domestic storage capacities of our reservoirs  are

also  being actively pursued. In order to  improve

the storage capacity of Seletar Reservoir, a $23.6

million  Seletar Dam is to be constructed shortly,

with  the  aim of increasing the storage  capacity

from 100 million gallons to 4,500 million gallons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Port Authority</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statute implementing Government's intention

to  bring  under one authority control of  matters

relating   to   shipping,  navigation   and   port

development  became operative on 1st April,  1964.

With  the growing volume of sea traffic, expansion

of port facilities to ensure quicker turn-round of

shipping becomes imperative and the Port Authority

is geared to achieve this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Lagoon Development Scheme involving the

reclamation   of  40  acres  of   land   and   the

construction of a breakwater and new berths  at  a

cost  of  $50  million  is  well  under  way   and

reclamation work has reached an advanced stage. In

the second phase of this scheme it is proposed  to

construct four more deep water berths, in addition

to the four already constructed in Phase I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority has negotiated for a World Bank

Loan of $45 million for major port development  as

well as for the purchase of craft and machines for

speedy  port  handling. This loan from  the  World

Bank  is  significant in that  it  underlines  the

viability  of the Port undertakings,  the

credit-worthiness  of  the State and world confidence  in

Singapore's ability to achieve progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Tourism</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the tourist trade in the

economy   of   Singapore   has   increased    with

independence.  Overseas  publicity  campaigns  are

being  intensified with a view to winning tourists

in  S.E.  Asia  and  the Pacific  Areas.  Overseas

publicity has so far resulted in attracting a  $30

million investment in tourist hotels in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are also under way to improve local tourist

facilities with the object of developing the State

into a major tourist centre of South-East Asia.
