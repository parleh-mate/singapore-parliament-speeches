<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if the Educational Advisory Council  has

hitherto  been  an efficient source  of  advice  on

matters of educational policy and development.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the

individual members of the Educational Advisory

Council have rendered invaluable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



service, the Council, as a whole, has not been an

efficient source of advice on educational matters,

mainly because of its unwieldy composition. The

Council has a membership of no less than 21,

including six members of the Education Finance

Board, a body which has become defunct as a result

of the changes in the financial procedure of the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that educational planning may keep pace

with our unprecedented expansion of school

enrolment in the past, and with the rapid changes

which are now taking place in the educational

system, it has been found more expedient to seek

advice on educational matters from small committees

of specialists on an ad hoc basis. Consequently,

the Educational Advisory Council has been largely

inactive since May 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understand the Educational Advisory Council, it is a body set up by the

Education Ordinance, 1957, and the provisions

setting up this body also make it mandatory for the

Educational Advisory Council to sit a number of

times a year. In the circumstances, how is it

possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to say

that this body is defunct?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

explained earlier, seeking advice from a large

committee is inefficient. We find it more efficient

to seek advice from small committees or from

individual members. As this method has been so

effective, we find that it has not been necessary

to convene the Educational Advisory Council since

1962.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

since the Educational Advisory Council is

inefficient and too large, would the Government

consider abolishing it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> There have, in fact, been a

couple of advisory committees on educational

policy. Since the Educational Advisory Council is

so ineffective, I would say it will die a natural

death.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary

tell us who are the members of the smaller ad hoc

committees?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The smaller ad

hoc committees are established under various

circumstances. For instance, if my Ministry require

advice on technical education, we set up a small

committee under the Ministry of Education to

provide such advice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from what the

Parliamentary Secretary has said, do I understand

that he will advise his Ministry to seek certain

amendments to the Education Ordinance of 1957 so

that a more effective body can be set up?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> The question of amending the

Education Ordinance of 1957 is, in fact, under

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as I see it, it is the taxpayers and the public

that are paying for the cost of education. As such,

I think there should be some representation from

the general public regarding educational policies.

With the Educational Advisory Council becoming

defunct, it seems to me that only professional

people are involved in the direction of policies.

Perhaps it might be a good idea to retain the

Educational Advisory Council but with certain

modifications to see that its functions ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Conceicao, you should ask a

supplementary question. You are now making a speech

and what you are saying would be appropriate to any

Bill that may be introduced to amend the relevant

provisions of the Education Ordinance.

<div align="center"><b>(Evaluation of effectiveness)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) whether measures have been  taken  to

assess  the effectiveness of educational television

as  it  is  currently programmed to  schools  as  a

medium  of  instruction; and (b) whether there  are

plans  to  expand  the  department  of  educational

television in the immediate future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, (a) a continuous

system  of  evaluating the effectiveness of  E.T.V.

programmes  has  been in operation ever  since  the

Singapore   Educational  Television   Service   was

launched  by the Ministry of Education  in  January

1967.  All  secondary schools in the  Republic  are

required  to  send  in  weekly  returns  containing

information on the reception of programmes telecast

in the previous week. This information is processed

and  analysed by machine and the findings are  used

for   effecting  further  improvement   in   future

programmes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, courses on evaluation and

utilisation  of  E.T.V. programmes  are  conducted

periodically  for all E.T.V. officers and  teachers

using the programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Plans for the expansion of the E.T.V. Service

were submitted to the Economic Planning Unit of the

Ministry of Finance as early as April 1967. In July

the  E.P.U. conducted an independent survey of  the

effectiveness of E.T.V. and reported that expansion

should  not be embarked upon until the service  has

consolidated  itself.  Subsequently,   the   E.P.U.

relented   on   this   decision   and   recommended

expansion. More recently, an internationally  known

expert   on  E.T.V. was  provided  by   the   Ford

Foundation at the request of the Government to make

recommendations concerning the E.T.V. Service. This

expert    has   submitted   a   favourable   report

recommending expansion. Whether the service  is  to

be  expanded now is purely a question of  financial

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do I understand

that  the intended expansion of television is going

to  displace  radio broadcasting to schools?  Also,

what  is  the  future  of  radio  broadcasting   to

schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

expansion of E.T.V. in relation to radio broadcasts

to   schools  is  still  under  consideration.  The

running  up  of the E.T.V. Service and the  running

down of radio broadcasts to schools has still to be

worked out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what measure

of  success  has been achieved as a result  of  the

introduction  of  E.T.V. programmes  in  secondary

schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my original

answer  to  the  hon. Member for Serangoon  Gardens

answers  this  supplementary question.  E.T.V. has

been  successful  and that is why we  are  planning

expansion.

widening of Upper Thomson Road between 4¾  m.s. and

6½  ms, has  been carried out up  to  the  maximum

possible  width.  Further  widening  can  only   be

carried  out  when  the existing shops  and  houses

which line both sides of the road are demolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board plans to

construct  two  shopping centres  with  residential

flats  to  re-site the occupants of the  shops  and

houses along this stretch of road. One centre  will

be built at the 4¾ m.s. Thomson Road, near the Home

of  the  Little Sisters of the Poor, and the  other

near  the  junction of Thomson Road and the  Island

Club  Road. In order to build these two centres,  a

few structures will have to be demolished and their

occupants resettled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The occupants of the other structures along both

sides  of  this  stretch  of  road  will  only   be

resettled  when the building of the two centres  is

completed, after which Upper Thomson Road  will  be

widened into a dual carriage way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a survey carried

out  has  shown that there are 124 shop-houses  and

211 residential homes along this stretch of road. I

cannot  say  exactly  how  many  persons  will   be

affected.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Further to the statement by

the Minister for Finance yesterday, I will now take

questions for answers.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish to seek some clarification in respect

of  employees who opt to be on the existing  salary

scales  and  draw  variable allowance  personal  to

themselves.  Will the Government give an  assurance

that such variable allowance will not be altered in

any  manner  whatsoever to  the  prejudice  of  the

employee who has so opted for as long as he remains

in Government service?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir,  I  cannot give any assurance that the  salary

scales  will  never be changed to the detriment  of

the  officers  for all time. But  I  can  give  the

assurance  that  they will remain substantially  in

their  present  form unless there is another  major

exercise  in  salary revision downwards.  In  other

words,  if  there is no general revision  of  civil

service salary scales downwards, those who  opt  to

remain on salary scales personal to themselves with

the  retention  of  the  variable  allowances  will

continue to receive them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I wish to raise two questions. Firstly, in his

Ministerial   statement  yesterday,   the   Finance

Minister  said  that  the  Government  propose   to

introduce  two Superscale posts, 'A' and  'B'  into

the  civil service. In the case of Superscale  'B',

the salary would be $2,700 a month, and Super-scale

'A'  $3,000  a month. This salary is  more  than  a

Minister's  salary, which is only $2,500  a  month.

Generally  speaking,  the  responsibilities  of   a

Minister  are  greater than those  of  a  Permanent

Secretary. If that is the case,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



I  wish to ask the Minister for Finance, if the pay

of   Ministers'   pay   will   be   correspondingly

increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I warmly welcome Government's acceptance of the

recommendations  of  the  Salaries  Commission   in

respect  of  Division IV employees. In the  Primary

Production Division there are about 90 employees. I

wish  to  ask  the Minister if these employees  are

covered by the Report. If they are not, I would ask

him   whether  he  would  consider  extending   the

implemented   recommendations   to   cover    these

employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh Keng Swee, may I suggest

that   you  answer  Mr  Teong  Eng  Siong's  first

question  first, so that if there are any questions

from  other Members on the same matter you can take

them   in  sequence  before  going  to  his  second

question  on  employees in the  Primary  Production

Department.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, Ministers' salaries will

not be revised in this exercise.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I have a series of

questions to ask.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do your questions arise out of Mr

Teong's first question?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> No, Sir, they arise out of my

first question.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I will let the

Minister answer Mr Teong's second question  and  I

will come back to you. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Commission did not deal

with   the   salaries  of  people  who   administer

injections  to chickens, whatever they are  called.

The  posts of these people are temporary.  I  think

they  carry  a  salary  of $100  a  month  and  are

probably held part-time by farmers. It would not be

true to say that there is a general upward revision

of  Division IV salary scales. What has happened is

that  the number of salary scales has been reduced,

with  the result that some people benefit by having

a longer salary scale so that they will continue to

enjoy  more increments. It does not mean that  they

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the temporary inoculators are not on any

salary  scale but receive a fixed salary,  they  do

not enjoy the benefit of a better salary scheme.  I

hope  I have made myself clear. There is no way  of

bringing  them  in because the Commission  did  not

recommend a general increase.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Will the promotion prospects

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

the  Minister for Finance yesterday dealt with  the

recommendations  of  the  Salaries  Commission   in

respect  of the increase in salaries of Division  I

and  Superscale posts. In my view, these Superscale

officers  already  have enough  to  live  well  and

Government  should  more properly  look  after  the

interest of the lower-income groups. In the case of

the  latter,  there  should  be  some  increase  in

salary. This is only right and proper because we in

Singapore practise parliamentary democracy. We must

respect these people who are not so well off. Those

officers who are getting $2,000 or $3,000  a  month

already  have  enough. Many  people  sleep  by  the

roadside and many do not have enough to eat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can these top civil servants ask for more

pay? We Members of Parliament get only $500 a month

each  and we have to contribute to the party funds.

How can we live on this small pay? Of course, I too

want  to  ask  for  a pay rise and  hope  that  the

Minister will be sympathetic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, Members of Parliament do

not  get  salaries  or pay. They get  an  allowance

which is meant to help them out by way of transport

expenses and for work in the constituencies. Again,

there  is  no  question of increase of salaries  to

Members of Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion that Super-scale

officers  are overpaid, I completely disagree  with

the  Member  for  Ulu Pandan. Let me  give  him  an

example  of how pay in the top level of  the  civil

service  compares with pay in commercial  firms.  A

managing   director  of  a  reasonably   prosperous

company in Singapore may get a total pay of $10,000

per  month  or more, which is four times  what  the

Permanent  Secretary of a Ministry is getting.  The

work  of  the Permanent Secretaries is more onerous

and more responsible. To say that they are overpaid

when they get only one-quarter of the pay of people

of  equivalent ability in the private sector is,  I

think, completely misleading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases which we are recommending for the

top posts in the civil service, in my view, are  in

themselves   inadequate  to  do  justice   to   the

situation.  But we expect that people will  make  a

career  in the civil service not entirely  for  the

purpose of making money and becoming rich.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

firstly,  I  want to make it clear that  I  do  not

grudge   Government's  proposal  to  increase   the

salaries of Superscale officers. My point  is  that

at  this juncture when the Government is asking the

private sector to make a big sacrifice, is it  wise

for  the  Government to increase  the  salaries  of

those who are well provided?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If we want to attract and

retain talent in the civil service, this is what we

must do. It is, therefore, a very wise move, in  my

view.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I agree that we need

talent.  But  I think these talented people  should

also  be  considerate.  When  the  country  is   in

difficulties,  they  should make  sacrifices.  Just

because  they  are talented, they  should  not  get

everything.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, since Government accepts a

good  proportion  of  the  recommendations  of  the

will  have  to be incurred each year. Therefore,  I

shall  be grateful if the Minister for Finance  can

enlighten  the  House  on how much  the  additional

recurrent expenditure will be for each year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If we had accepted all the

recommendations  of  the Salaries  Commission,  the

additional cost to Government would be of the order

of  $6.8  million a year. We have not accepted  the

recommendation in respect of a general increase  in

Division  I  salary scales and in Superscale.  This

recommendation would cost $1.8 million.  Therefore,

we are left with an increase of $5 million a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have decided to allow married women,

bachelors  and  married women without  children  to

convert   to   the   new  salary   scales   without

restrictions  arising out of their marital  status.

This   costs  another  $¼  million.  So  the  total

additional sum is $5¼ million a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, does it mean that the

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, since we do not print our

House  as to which company pays $10,000 a month  as

director's fees?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: are civil servants who are

serving  on the boards of public companies entitled

to director's fees?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I was not referring to

directors  or members of the board of directors.  I

was  referring to the chief executive of  companies

and they are usually known as "managing directors".

For  a managing director of a big firm in Singapore

to  get  a  pay of $10,000 a month is by  no  means

unusual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants who are members of the boards of

directors   of  companies  in  which   either   the

Government or the Economic Development Board has  a

share  of equity, do receive director's fees.  They

do  retain these fees if they are paid out  because

of  the contribution that they make to the firm.  I

may  say  that these director's fees  are  in  most

cases  very small. In some cases, the firms,  being

new ones, do not pay any director's fees.

as  compared with academic teachers? If that is the

case,   does   the  Government  not  consider   the

with  its avowed policy of promoting technical  and

vocational  education rather than  purely  academic

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think this point was raised

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, yesterday the Minister

mentioned promotion exercises. I would like to know

how frequently promotion exercises will be held  so

as  to  enable Division I officers to  be  promoted

e.g, to Superscale C, B or A posts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is the Public Service

Commission  which  decides  on  the  frequency   of

promotion exercises. Government can only propose to

them  that  more  frequent promotion  exercises  be

carried out, but the decision rests with the Public

Service  Commission,  it varies  from  Ministry  to

Ministry and from service to service. So far as the

services under the jurisdiction of the Ministry  of

Finance   are   concerned,   it   is   mainly   the

Administrative Service. The last promotion exercise

was  held some 18 months ago and I think we  should

have  one pretty soon. If possible, one would  like

to  see  annual  exercises  carried  out.  But  the

trouble may be the lack of suitable candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, subject to these reservations, I would say

that  we  should carry out more frequent  promotion

exercises starting from now. I am afraid  I  cannot

be more definite than that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

of  cases  where  senior civil servants  have  been

acting  for  quite a long time. I  am  inclined  to

agree  with  the Minister that promotion  exercises

should  be  more frequent. I hope the  time  factor

will  be taken into consideration, that is, instead

of  a  lapse  of  18 months, let us have  promotion

exercises  on a yearly basis so that  we  will  not

have senior officers acting for two or three years.

If  they  are found to be unsuitable for promotion,

another  officer ought to be found to  act  with  a

view to finding the right man for the right place.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have two questions. Firstly, regarding the mode  of

salary conversion, I would like to ask the Minister

whether  he is aware of the following: One officer,

"A",  who is married and another officer, "B",  who

is not married are now on the same basic salary. As

officer  "A" is married he draws a higher  variable

allowance  and  therefore his total emoluments  are

greater than those of officer "B". According to the

Commission's mode of conversion, officer  "A"  will

move to a higher step in the new salary scale.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should officer "B" get married after the

implementation  of  the  recommendations   of   the

Salaries Commission Report, he will still be  on  a

lower  step  vis-a-vis officer "A".  How  does  the

Minister intend to correct this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I know the reason why the date of

implementation of the recommendations of the Report

of the Salaries Commission is 1st January, 1969?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I thought I made it clear in

my  speech  yesterday that we  do  not  accept  the

Commission's   recommendation   in    respect    of

conversion,  having  a  difference  of   conversion

between  the  married and unmarried officers.  They

will  all convert on the same basis, that  is,  the

bachelor  officer will convert in the same  way  as

the  married  officer. In effect, he  will  get  an

increase in total pay on this exercise costing  the

taxpayers a quarter of a million dollars a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the date of implementation 1st January,

1969?  If  we  regard our decisions  as  final  and

refuse  to  hear representations, we  can  probably

implement it from 1st October, 1968. But we want to

hear  the  views of unions, associations and  other

people and, therefore, we have to give them time to

make  their  representations. It will  probably  be

sometime in October when we can make up our  minds.

Therefore, it is necessary to allow another two  or

three  months to pass and 1st January, 1969,  seems

to be a very convenient date.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

who  will  be  placed in any one  'of  these  three

Superscale  grades, i.e., Superscale 'A',  'B'  and

'C'?  If  it is the intention of the Government  to

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

the  moment of interruption yesterday, I  explained

clause  7. I am now going to speak on clause  8  of

the  Bill  which amends section 34 of the Ordinance

by  providing that the Industrial Arbitration Court

shall  not  inquire into disputes relating  to  the

dismissal  or  reinstatement of an employee  unless

such   an   employee   has   been   dismissed    in

circumstances  arising out of the contravention  of

section   79  of  the  Ordinance.  I  have  already

mentioned,  in  connection  with  clause   5,   the

remedial action that may be taken by an employee if

he  considers  that  he has been dismissed  without

just  cause or excuse. I would, however,  add  here

that  the  Minister's decision in  this  regard  is

final and conclusive and shall not be challenged in

any  court,  and that the Minister may  direct  the

employer  to reinstate the employee in  his  former

employment  and  to  pay  him  an  amount  that  is

equivalent  to  the wages that the  employee  would

have  earned  had  he  not been  dismissed  by  the

employer,  or  to  pay  such  amount  of  wages  as

compensation as may be determined by  him.  If  the

employer does not comply with the directions of the

Minister, then the employer shall be guilty  of  an

offence under the Ordinance and shall be subject to

the punishment prescribed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends section 57 of the Ordinance by

extending  the circumstances whereby the powers  of

the  Industrial Arbitration Court can be  exercised

by  the  President sitting alone. The inclusion  of

sections  24A,  34,  37 (4) ,  39,  42,  and  79  is

consequential upon other amendments  in  this  Bill

and  is intended to expedite the proceedings in the

court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 77 of the Ordinance by

substituting  a new proviso for the  existing  one.

This new proviso enables an employer to require, as

a  condition for the appointment or promotion of  a

person to a managerial or executive position,  that

that person shall not continue to be an officer  or

member  of  a  particular trade union,  unless  the

trade union is a trade union whose constitution and

rules   restrict  its  membership  to  persons   in

managerial  or executive positions. This  amendment

is  consequential upon the amendment in clause 4 of

the Bill which requires separate representation  by

employees  in managerial or executive positions  as

distinct  from  other  subordinate  employees.  The

existing  provision merely states that an  employer

can  object  to his employees being  members  of  a

particular  trade union. This by  itself  does  not

prevent  an  employee in a managerial or  executive

position  from joining another trade union catering

for  employees  in  these grades.  I  have  already

explained  why separate representation is necessary

in  the  course of my discussion in clause 4  There

is, therefore, no need for me to repeat it here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill amends the Ordinance by

introducing  a new section 78A which sets  out  the

circumstances under which a trade union officer may

obtain  paid leave of absence from his employer  to

attend  to trade union duties. It provides  that  a

trade  union officer shall apply in writing to  his

employer  for leave of absence stating the duration

of  and  the  purposes  for  which  such  leave  is

applied. It further provides that an employee shall

not be entitled to paid leave unless the purpose of

his  leave  is  to represent members of  his  trade

union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



in  relation  to industrial matters  affecting  his

employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will appreciate that there have been

considerable  difficulties  in  this  regard.   For

instance,  where a trade union represents employees

in  more  than one establishment, it is not unusual

for  the officers of the union to come from one and

the  same  establishment. In  such  an  event,  the

employer  is penalised in that he either loses  the

services of his employees for the duration of their

business for reasons quite unconnected with his own

establishment,  or  he incurs additional  costs  by

having  to  employ additional staff  to  cover  the

duties  of his absent employees. This, it  will  be

appreciated, is most unsatisfactory. There must  be

reason  and logic in such circumstances and  it  is

precisely to regularise matters that this amendment

has been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (b) of clause 16 of the Bill amends

section  79 of the Ordinance by the addition  of  a

new  subsection  (6)  which allows  the  Industrial

Arbitration   Court  to  commence  proceedings   in

respect of the reinstatement of an employee who  is

alleged to have been dismissed in contravention  of

section 79 of the Ordinance before proceedings have

been  commenced  in a District Court.  At  present,

allegations  in  respect of such  cases  are  heard

before a District Court which also has the power to

order  reinstatement. However, thorough  and  time-consuming  investigations must necessarily  precede

such proceedings. This has caused long delays which

are  frowned  upon  both  by  the  unions  and  the

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments to the

Industrial Relations Ordinance, particularly in the

context  of  management rights, have  evoked  fears

among  some  trade  unionists.  The  principle   of

collective  bargaining  is  in  no  way   impinged.

Collective bargaining is of the essence in  a  free

and  democratic society but vital management rights

must  not  be  eroded  if  we  are  to  create  the

necessary  climate of stability  for  investors  to

come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



in.  There  are, however, built-in safeguards,  for

safeguards  there  must be  if  abuses  are  to  be

minimised both by employers and trade unions.  Some

wise  person  has  stated that private  rights  may

become  public  wrongs. There  is,  therefore,  the

urgent   necessity  for  both   parties   to   make

responsible   decisions  - decisions   which    are

compatible  with the well-being of the country.  It

is, therefore, in the interest of all concerned  to

ensure that rights are related to functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers have their functions just as trade

unions  have,  and  it  is  imperative  that  their

respective  rights have a, correlation  with  their

respective  functions. The amendments  embodied  in

this Bill are obviously designed to correct wrongs,

balance    rights   and   functions   and    equate

responsibilities  so that an independent  Singapore

can  move  through the crucial years ahead  without

coming to grief. The Government will, however, keep

a  very  close watch on the workings of the law  on

industrial relations in the light of the amendments

that  are  being  made. If there  are  abuses,  the

Government will not hesitate to make the  necessary

adjustments. We hope, however, that employers  will

exercise their rights with responsibility, and that

they  will  take a far-sighted view of  their  real

interest. It is in their long-term interest not  to

abuse, as they can, this Bill, because then I think

there can be no expectation on their part that  the

trade unions themselves will act with the restraint

and responsibility which they have so far shown. We

hope, therefore, that employers will exercise their

rights with responsibility and that it will not  be

necessary to take corrective action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives of these two pieces of legislation

-  the  Employment  Bill and the Central  Provident

Fund  (Amendment) Bill - are, as it should be  very

clear  by  now, to help Singapore as an independent

nation  not only to meet the storms ahead but  also

to  ensure that we ride them successfully.  I  hope

that  co-operation  will be  forthcoming  from  the

employers in this regard and that the trade  unions

will make the necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



adjustments  in  face  of the  new  situation.  The

delineation of management functions and trade union

functions will do away with the "Heads I win, tails

you  lose" attitude. Let us resolve to replace this

with "Heads we all win, tails we all lose".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

comment  on  the  Industrial Relations  (Amendment)

Bill which is now being read for the Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Secretary-General of the National Trades

Union Congress, I am very pleased to note that  the

Government has incorporated into the Bill  some  of

the  suggestions made by the N.T.U.C. When we  were

first  informed by the Government of its  intention

to  amend the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1960,

we were very much taken aback by the rather drastic

scope and extent of the amendments intended by  the

Government.  We  then strongly represented  to  the

Government  that  its  objectives  could  still  be

achieved by modifying its intended amendments so as

to  minimise  the adverse effects on  the  workers.

Evidently,  as  it  appears  from  the  Bill,   the

Government has given heed to our representations.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, it was intended that the power of

the  Industrial Arbitration Court to  reinstate  in

employment  an  employee who  has  been  wrongfully

dismissed  was  to be confined to cases  where  the

employee  had  been allegedly dismissed  for  trade

union  activities.  We  pointed  out  that  such  a

provision restricting the power of reinstatement in

employment would give rise to many malpractices  or

abuses by unscrupulous employers. At present,  such

employers   are  deterred  from  dismissing   their

employees  summarily without justification  because

of  the  protection  given to employees  under  the

Industrial Relations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance.   It   would  have   been   unduly   and

unnecessarily demoralising to an employee  to  have

been  deprived  of  the  protection  given  to  his

employment    under   the   Industrial    Relations

Ordinance.  Not  every one who has been  wrongfully

dismissed by his employer can claim to be  a  trade

union officer or a member actively engaged in trade

union  work. Paragraph (d) of clause 8 of the Bill,

however,  takes care of cases of dismissal  arising

out   of   circumstances  other   than   those   in

contravention  of  section 79 of the  Ordinance  by

amending  section  34 thereof to provide  for  such

cases  of  dismissal to be referred to the Minister

who  may  himself, or through the  Commissioner  of

Labour,  inquire  into  the dismissal  and  who  is

empowered to order the reinstatement or payment  of

compensation  to an employee who is found  to  have

been wrongfully dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to note that clause 7 of the Bill

has  given  effect  to the N.T.U.C, representation

that   the   provision  cutting  across  collective

agreement  should not be unduly wide. The  original

intention  of the Government was to enact  that  no

collective agreement should contain provisions with

regard  to  terms  and conditions of  service  more

favourable  to  employees than those  contained  in

Part  IV of the Employment Act, 1968. The N.T.U.C.,

however,  pointed out that since the  intention  of

such  an  amendment  was to stimulate  and  promote

industrial  expansion in Singapore and  that  since

the   existing  collective  agreements  relate   to

employees in existing firms and factories,  it  was

only  logical  and reasonable that such  a  drastic

amendment should be made applicable only  to  firms

or  factories  which have not yet been established.

We  note  here with satisfaction that an acceptable

compromise  has  been  made by  the  Government  in

proposing  that only employees in certain specified

industries  which are established on or  after  1st

January, 1968, are to come within the scope of  the

proposed  section  24A.  We  also  note  that   the

proposed  section  24A provides that  the  proposed

restrictions on collective agreements governing the

employees within the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



specified industries are to be valid for the  first

five  years  of  the  existence  of  the  specified

industries. Such measures, though they  may  appear

to  be  rather drastic to employees engaged in  the

new  industries,  are necessary  to  stimulate  new

industries  and will then lead to the  creation  of

more job opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are happy that the Government has taken

into    consideration   our    representation    by

incorporating  some  of our  suggestions  into  the

provisions  of the Bill, as I have just  mentioned,

we cannot help noticing that the Bill also contains

provisions   which   appear  to  be   unnecessarily

unfavourable to workers. For instance, in clause  4

of the Bill, by which a new subsection (3) is to be

added  to the existing section 16 of the Industrial

Relations Ordinance, it is provided that any  trade

union  representing  subordinate  staff  may   seek

recognition  in respect of employees in  managerial

or  executive  positions or serve  a  notice  under

section  17  of the Ordinance in respect  of  those

employees.  We are apprehensive of the position  of

such trade unions at present representing employees

who may be considered to be in managerial executive

positions.  These  unions,  whose  members  consist

mainly  of  employees  in  non-managerial  or  non-executive positions, have been given recognition in

respect  of  employees in managerial  or  executive

positions  and have concluded collective agreements

on behalf of such employees. If such unions are not

to be allowed to continue to represent employees in

managerial or executive positions on the expiry  of

the  existing  collective  agreements,  then  these

employees  would  be  placed in  a  most  untenable

position.  It  must  be emphasised  here  that  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance gives protection  to

workers  only if they are members of a trade  union

which has been accorded recognition by an employer.

Where  an  employee does not belong  to  any  trade

union,  or belongs to a trade union which  has  not

been  accorded recognition by his employer, he  has

no    effective    remedy   or   redress    against

victimisation by his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



employer under the Industrial Relations Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is complicated by the fact that

there  are few trade unions to cater for managerial

or  executive employees. In fact, there are, as far

as  I  know, only two unions catering for employees

in managerial or executive positions in the private

sector.  It is inconceivable that these two  unions

would  be  in  a  position to  cater  for  all  the

employees  in  managerial  or  executive  positions

engaged  in  the various industries in the  private

sector in Singapore. Even if they are, there has to

be  an inevitable lapse of time before a union  can

be  given  recognition in respect of  employees  in

managerial  or  executive positions who  have  been

formerly  represented by a trade  union  consisting

mainly    of    non-managerial   or   non-executive

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we appreciate the principle that employees

in  supervisory positions should belong  to  unions

different  from those of the subordinate employees,

we are rather apprehensive that, in view of such  a

radical   change   to  prevailing  practices,   the

Government has not made any transitional provisions

to  safeguard the interests of employees who are in

a  managerial position and who happen to be members

of  the  trade unions representing mainly employees

in  non-executive positions. If such managerial  or

executive employees have nothing to fear from their

employers, they would never have found it necessary

to  be  members  of  the trade unions  representing

employees   in   non-managerial  or   non-executive

positions. It is a fact which should be duly  noted

by  the  Government when implementing tile proposed

amendment to the Industrial Relations Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I wish to comment on

concerns clause 5 of the Bill which seeks to  amend

section  17  of  the Ordinance. A  new  subsection,

which  seeks  to make certain managerial  functions

non-negotiable between an employer  and  the  trade

union   representing   his  employees,   has   been

proposed.  The managerial functions  refer  to  the

rights of an employer in relation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



to (a) promotion, (b) transfer, (c) employment, (d)

retrenchment, (e) dismissal and reinstatement,  (f)

assignment  or allocation of duties. We must  point

out  that  it  seems most dangerously  lopsided  to

enact   that   such   managerial   functions    are

exercisable  at  the  absolute  discretion  of  the

employer  without providing for adequate safeguards

for   the   workers.  In  the  first  place,   such

managerial  functions exist in common  law  and  it

appears rather unnecessary and superfluous to  give

statutory  protection to such managerial functions.

But   granted  that  it  is  necessary   from   the

Government's viewpoint to give statutory protection

to  these  managerial  functions,  the  failure  to

provide  ample safeguards for the workers does  not

appear to be justifiable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be more specific, in respect of the management

functions  pertaining to promotion and recruitment,

no  attempt has been made to spell out the criteria

or  limits  within which an employer can reasonably

exercise his rights. Thus it is open to an employer

to adhere most rigidly to the publicised conditions

for  promotion or employment of persons he does not

like and to waive such conditions on any pretext in

respect of applicants favoured by him. It all boils

down  to whether an employer can he relied upon  to

exercise  his management functions in  good  faith.

Although the provisions pertaining to the rights of

an employer to transfer, retrench, dismiss or order

his  employees contain certain safeguards  for  the

employees,  such safeguards are effective  only  if

the assumption that an employer always acts in good

faith is justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, we in the N.T.U.C., being used to

seeing  the uglier side of the employer's face,  do

not  share  the  .optimism of the  Government  that

employers  can be depended on to behave responsibly

and  decently towards their workers. We  are  fully

aware  that  industrial or commercial organisations

are  profit-making organisations and that it is  in

the  own interest of the management, whether it  be

professional management divorced from the ownership

of tile business or otherwise, to employ the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



best  talents available or to deploy staff  in  the

most advantageous manner. But the fact remains that

employers  and  managers are  only  human  and  may

occasionally  behave in an irrational and  perverse

manner. Our concern is that such behaviour may have

adverse repercussions for the workers and that  the

Ordinance does not seek to safeguard the rights  of

the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for

Labour  in  his  speech yesterday referred  to  the

incidence of 389 work-stoppages involving a loss of

1,284,029 man-days during the period from  1960  to

1967.  The impression that appears to be  given  is

that    the   trade   union   movement   has   been

irresponsible in the past and cannot be relied upon

to  ensure  that  work-stoppages of such  magnitude

would  not  occur  again so  as  not  to  prejudice

Singapore's future industrial expansion  programme.

I  wish  to  point  out  that  work-stoppages  must

necessarily arise out of trade disputes and that it

takes  two parties to make a trade dispute.  It  is

not  fair  and  correct to blame the occurrence  of

each  and every dispute on the union involved.  For

in  the  first place, if an employer can be trusted

to  give a fair deal to his workers, it would never

have  been  necessary for the Government  to  enact

employment   legislation  such  as  the  Industrial

Relations Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to point out that the reference to

the  period,  1960 to 1967, whether intentional  or

otherwise,  was extremely misleading,  to  say  the

least.  The  fact is that the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance was enacted in 1960 to meet the need  for

promoting  peace  and stability  in  the  field  of

industrial relations in Singapore. It takes  a  few

years for the Industrial Relations Ordinance to  be

in  operation  before its effect  becomes  evident.

This is substantiated by the published data of  the

Statistics Department pertaining to work-stoppages.

For the period 1964 to 1967, the second half of the

period referred to by the Minister, there were only

94 world-stoppages involving the loss of 11,715 man-days  which do not amount to even one per  cent  of

the total for the whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



period.  The only conclusion I can draw  from  this

comparison   of  figures  is  that  the  Industrial

Relations   Ordinance   has   become   increasingly

effective  during the last few years  even  without

the gift of managerial functions to employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now as we are discussing this Bill, there

are  employers  who  are  seeking  to  exploit  the

provisions  of  the Bill to their  best  advantage,

regardless  of  the intention of the Government.  I

have  been  given to understand that one commercial

organisation, which has previously applied for  the

extension  of a collective agreement to  which  the

trade  union concerned has indicated its agreement,

now  seeks to oppose its own application before the

Industrial  Arbitration Court. The reason  for  its

action  appears to be that the employer anticipates

certain   provisions  to  be   superfluous   in   a

collective  agreement in view of  the  Government's

gift  of management functions. Such being the case,

workers  cannot be blamed for feeling nervous  that

some employers are clearing the decks for wholesale

exploitation of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is heartening to know that the

Government has given an assurance that it will  not

hesitate to cane the naughty employers, it  is  our

hope  that the Government will not be found wanting

in  decisiveness  and firmness  when  it  comes  to

dealing  with recalcitrant employers. The  N.T.U.C.

will  not be silent if it finds that some employers

take  undue  advantage of the powers of  managerial

functions given to them under this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   what   is  the  true  industrial   relations

situation?  Are the workers suppressed or  are  the

employers terrorised? Neither proposition describes

the  real  situation.  But  apparently  the  former

Minister  for  Labour has quite  suddenly  come  to

think that the workers have gone out of hand and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



must be straightened up by harsh administrative and

legal  sanctions. It is also apparent that  he  has

not  given a factual account of the real situation.

Those  who  are deeply involved and concerned  with

industrial  relations will readily say that  labour

and  management  have matured since  the  turbulent

years of the 1950s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Labour Department sources we gather that

there  are  fewer and fewer strikes and  lock-outs.

The  number  of work-stoppages for each year  since

1955 are as follows: -



<pre>

               1955 - 275       1962 - 88

               1956 -  29       1963 - 47

               1957 -  27       1964 - 39

               1958 -  22       1965 - 30

               1959 -  40       1966 - 14

               1960 -  45       1967 - 30

               1961 - 116

</pre>



In  the  first five months of 1968 there have  been

only two work-stoppages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were 18 more strikes, in 1959 than

in  1958,  there were fewer man-days lost  in  1959

than  in  1958 due to work-stoppages. In the  1950s

the    work-stoppages   were   mainly   politically

motivated,  and so were those in the  early  l960s.

Whatever  the laws might have been, they would  not

have  made any difference to the trend and line  of

action  in those years. However, since those  days,

industrial relations have gradually progressed  and

found their own balance, and restrictive laws  will

not  at all be conducive to the further development

of better industrial relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial relations have made a marked

improvement  in  the last few years,  and  this  is

eloquently stated in the Singapore Year Book  1966,

which  is published by authority. In Chapter Eight,

page 189, it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The marked improvement in industrial relations

noted  in 1965 continued throughout the year. There

were  only 14 work stoppages during the year -  the

lowest since 1961, the peak year for work stoppages

when there were 116 strikes. For the first time, at

the  end  of  the  year there were  no  outstanding

strikes.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



In the same chapter, in page 200, it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The two noteworthy features in the fields of

industrial relations were firstly, that there  were

only  14 work stoppages - the lowest since  1961  - and,  secondly, the short duration  of  these  work

stoppages. Nine stoppages lasted from 1 to 5  days,

four from 6 to 40 days and only one lasted for more

than  40  days,  which  altogether  involved  1,288

workers  as  against 3,374 in 1965  and  43,584  in

1961.  The  number of man days lost as a result  of

the 14 work stoppages was 17,807.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, surely there have been disputes - disputes on union recognition, dismissal and

retrenchment.   Some   were   settled   by   direct

negotiations,  some  were  settled  in  the  Labour

Department, and some were settled in the industrial

Arbitration  Court. The cases  brought  up  to  the

Labour Department were settled under the very  eyes

of  the former Minister for Labour, and in some  of

the  cases, the employees' objections were  upheld.

It  was  true  also that the Industrial Arbitration

Court  has  ruled in favour of the trade unions  in

some   dismissal  and  retrenchment  cases.   These

decisions   of  the  Labour  Department   and   the

Industrial  Arbitration Court prove the point  that

employers   can  abuse  their  powers,   and   that

employees  should be allowed to protest, to  object

and  to  dispute  the actions taken  by  management

which  they consider are prejudicial to  their  own

interests. The very fact that an employer can  act,

intentionally  or  unintentionally,   against   the

present or future interests of his employee, should

be  convincing enough to any man with common  sense

and,  more, with a sense of justice, to accept  the

plea  that an aggrieved employee should be  allowed

to  have  the  full protection of his  trade  union

against  the  high and heavy-handed action  of  his

employer.  If  we  accept the  concept  of  a  free

society,  and a society of law and order,  then  we

must accept accordingly the democratic right of  an

individual to protest, to object and to dispute  an

action  which  he  considers  is  against  his  own

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that an aggrieved employee

should be given the right to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



seek  justice in the Court, and it would be a shame

to  clip  the  powers of the Industrial Arbitration

Court. The Industrial Arbitration Court is a  sound

industrial relations procedure, and any attempt  to

circumscribe the jurisdiction and function  of  the

court  is  unacceptable. The Industrial Arbitration

Court  has  obtained  the respect  of  the  workers

because  it operates on sound principles.  In  this

connection, I quote Chapter Eight, page 202 of  the

Singapore Year Book, 1966:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The principle upon which the Industrial

Arbitration  Court operates is that of offering  to

employers and trade unions of employees an award or

decision  which will fairly and justly reflect  not

only the interests of both parties to an industrial

dispute  but also to the community as a  whole,  as

well as the economy of the Republic.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words of the Labour Department in

mind,  it  is hard to understand the move  to  take

away the powers of the Industrial Arbitration Court

to  hear  cases on dismissal and retrenchment,  and

the  contingent  powers to reinstate  dismissed  or

retrenched employees and grant suitable reliefs. It

is   imperative  to  note  that  all  dismissal  or

retrenchment   cases  that  came  up   before   the

Industrial  Arbitration Court were either  disputes

arising   out   of  the  operation  of   collective

agreements  or  disputes jointly  referred  to  the

court,  or  disputes directed to the court  by  the

Minister, and included in the latter category would

be  cases which his Ministry had failed to  mediate

successfully. In all these cases, the trade  unions

have more than accepted the awards of the Court. In

fact,  they  have come to respect the  court  as  a

place  of wisdom and justice. Notwithstanding  this

realisation,  the  trade  unions  have   discreetly

settled their disputes out of court. The records of

the  court  show this attitude. In 1967, the  Court

heard four dismissal cases, three union recognition

cases and five retrenchment cases; and in 1966  the

court   heard  13  dismissal  cases,   five   union

recognition cases and two retrenchment cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Department, however, still have the

monopoly   of  dismissal  and  retrenchment   cases

referred by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



trade  unions for conciliation and arbitration.  Of

the  702 disputes referred to the Labour Department

in  1966  for  conciliation,  34.9  per  cent  were

dismissal  cases; and according to the same  Report

(Command  7  of 1968), "Retrenchment  was  again  a

minor cause amounting to only 6.6 per cent." Is the

former  Minister for Labour suggesting  that  trade

unions are also terrorising him, his officials  and

the court when they were defending their members in

the  Labour  Department and in the  court?  Is  the

former Minister for Labour claiming that there is a

free-for-all   situation  with  organised   workers

terrorising the employers? I think it is a  figment

of his imagination. If anything is true, it is that

he  possesses the quality of a fiction story-teller

quite common among some reporters who rub in highly

sensational ideas to make a no-story a tall story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out to the Minister that the

general  consensus of opinion of workers, not  just

trade union members, is that clause 5 and clause  8

of  the  Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill  to

amend  section 17 and section 34 of the  Industrial

Relations Ordinance, 1960, is an open invitation to

wield  the  axe. However, much depends on  who  the

Minister  is,  and if the Bill is passed,  I  think

workers will have to cross their fingers, and  wait

and  see how he plays his hand in dealing with  the

bully-boys amongst unenlightened employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude, rightly or wrongly, arouses the

hopes  and  fears of workers, because the  proposed

labour legislation is brimming with prejudice.  The

fear  created by the new labour legislation in  the

worker is that if he is unfortunate to be sick  for

too  long,  he will not get a vacation  leave,  and

probably  he  will leave his family destitute.  The

fear created in the worker is that if he proves, in

the  opinion of his employer, to be not  so  useful

any  more, he will lose his job. The worker is told

if  the  new  labour legislation is not introduced,

there is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



prospect  of  a grim future for him, and  when  the

economic  situation becomes bad, unlike  money  and

managerial men, he is stuck fast here. It is  fear,

fear, fear without limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be more sensible to invoke the

patriotic  spirit to work hard to be more efficient

and   productive,   and  to  make   the   necessary

sacrifices.  I think the workers must  be  made  to

feel  they  are  important,  useful  and  effective

digits  in society. They must be allowed to  decide

the  future of the country, and feel that  they  do

not  get  the worst deal, whether the circumstances

are  favourable  or poor. Some may be  inclined  to

believe  that the workers in Singapore  have  never

had  it so good, and if things are going to be bad,

they  must have the worst. This is not the  correct

attitude  to  take  towards the workers.  I  firmly

believe that there will be greater participation by

the  workers in the affairs of the undertakings  if

they  are  to understand most clearly, to give  out

the most and receive the best in return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common assertion that it is the employers'

right   to   make  business  decisions  free   from

collective bargaining is based on property  rights.

Such  a contention is valid as far as the right  to

organise  and  to direct machinery,  materials  and

money  is concerned, but never men. As far  as  men

are  concerned,  the property basis  of  management

carries  no legal duty, and no legal compulsion  to

co-operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An authority on industrial relations has this to

say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While property rights carry with them a power of

disposition  of goods, they do not carry  an  equal

power  to  use  those goods if the co-operation  of

others  is  necessary  to that  use.  Co-operation,

without  which the property right is reduced  to  a

power  of disposition, cannot be commanded. It  can

be  won  only  by consent. And there  is  no  legal

compulsion upon the workers to cooperate. There  is

no  legal  statement  of the  terms  on  which  co-operation must take place. The definition of  those

terms  is  left directly to those parties involved,

and  there is nothing in law to stop the union from

demanding as the price of the co-operation  of  its

members   a   voice   in  some  matter   previously

independently determined by management.  Since  the

property  rights do not mean that one  has  command

over others, management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



may  find it essential to share its authority as  a

means   of  inducing  co-operation,  in  order   to

maintain  the  value of a going  business.  Over  a

period  of  time,  it  becomes customary  to  share

authority  in order to win co-operation in  certain

recognised  areas  of  business  decisions  -   for

example,  wages,  hours, or perhaps  the  speed  of

assembly lines.'



<br><br>The  only  institution where a man can be  managed

and ordered about is the military institution where

authoritarian  relationship  exists   by   consent.

However,  a military-like regime can never  run  an

undertaking successfully for long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have strongly emphasised the need for greater

participation  by  workers  in  the  management  of

undertakings,   because  this   is   a   world-wide

phenomenon. The International Labour Organisation's

Recommendation   130   lays  down   that   workers'

representatives should participate in  the  framing

of  personnel  policy and the  solution  of  social

questions within the undertaking. The problems that

require the workers' participation cover conditions

of  work, welfare services, safety, employment  and

discipline,  training  and  a  range   of   matters

involving    the   workers   and   having    social

consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is clear now that the introduction of

clause  5  to  prohibit  collective  bargaining  on

procedures   on  promotion,  transfer,  employment,

termination,    dismissal,    re-employment     and

assignment  of  work is a denial  of  the  workers'

right   to   participate  in  the   affairs   which

immediately  affect his life and that  of  society.

Let  me be explicitly clear that trade unions  have

never   desired  to  arrogate  to  themselves   the

functions of management in directing the affairs of

the enterprise. Labour only wants the establishment

of  rules  for  management to follow in  exercising

their  functions. This must necessarily be so,  for

workers  will suffer if the undertaking is  managed

inefficiently  or  may  have  to  suffer   if   the

undertaking is to be run more efficiently.  In  the

former case, it is clear how all those involved  in

the enterprise will suffer, but in the latter case,

because  of the workers' own productivity, some  of

them  might  be  dispensed with. Arising  from  the

points I have just made, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



think  no self-respecting worker and trade unionist

will  agree to the matters listed in clause 5 being

withdrawn from the field of collective bargaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 8 of the Bill seeks to

remove  from the Industrial Arbitration  Court  the

power to hear and decide upon claims by unions  for

the  reinstatement of employees and  to  order  the

reinstatement where the court is satisfied that the

dismissal  was wrongful. Perhaps we in  this  House

should  try  to trace the events that  led  to  the

amendment that was made to the previous section  38

of  the Industrial Relations Ordinance (now section

40  of  the Reprints Supplement). A glance  at  the

original provisions contained in section 38 of  the

Ordinance  seems  to indicate that  the  court  had

extremely  wide powers. Section 38 gave  the  court

the  power to make an award on any matter or  thing

for  the purpose of settling a trade dispute or  of

preventing  any further trade dispute  even  though

the matter or the thing was not one of the specific

reliefs claimed by the parties before the Court. My

trade  union colleagues, who had occasion to appear

before  the Industrial Arbitration Court  in  cases

for  reinstatement, had on every occasion been told

by  the  senior  representative  of  the  Singapore

Employers  Federation, who had argued  against  the

unions, that the court did not possess the power to

reinstate.  His  main argument  was  that,  in  the

absence  of  a  specific provision  empowering  the

court  to  order the reinstatement of  a  dismissed

worker,    the   court   could   not   order    any

reinstatement. Also, he had, on occasion,  compared

the   powers  given  to  industrial  tribunals   in

Australia  where  the tribunals  were  specifically

given  the  power to reinstate and he had proceeded

to  emphasise that without such a power  the  court

could not reinstate any dismissed employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present provision contained in section 40 of

the Reprints Supplement of the Industrial Relations

Ordinance  was a direct result of certain proposals

put  forward by the National Trades Union  Congress

following  the adoption of a resolution urging  the

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



to   amend   certain  sections  of  the  Industrial

Relations  Ordinance, particularly those  contained

in section 38. This took place on the 4th of April,

1964,  at the Victoria Memorial Hall, at its  first

Annual Delegates Conference. The Recommendations of

the  N.T.U.C. on the amendment to section 38 of the

Industrial Relations Ordinance were as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The powers of the Court are very wide as set out

in  this sub-section. There ought to be a provision

here  ensuring  that  before the  Court  makes  any

award,  especially in relation to  a  matter  which

does not come within the specific relief originally

claimed by any party, the Court must first bear  in

open  Court  the  submissions thereon  of  all  the

parties  who  are  eventually to be  bound  by  the

award.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific clause ought to be included here

stating  that the Court has the power to order  the

reinstatement  of  employees  no  matter  for  what

reason they have been dismissed if for any good and

sufficient reason the Court thinks it fit that such

employees should be reinstated.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as a result of this proposal that the

Government decided to amend section 38 (now section

40  of  the  Reprints Supplement) giving the  court

specific  powers  to reinstate an employee  who  is

dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already stated my objection to clause 5,

but my opinion on clause 8 is quite neutral because

it  does  not  matter  very  much  whether  general

termination cases are dealt with in the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court  or  the  Ministry  of   Labour.

However,  I  give  my support not to  withdraw  the

jurisdiction  of the District Court to  hear  cases

subject  to section 79 of the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I wish to make

an  observation  on the futility of  clause  5  and

clause  8. Even if the matters listed in  clause  5

are  non-industrial  matters,  as  defined  in  the

Industrial  Relations  Ordinance,  there   can   be

disputes  not  arising  from  the  terms   of   the

collective   agreement.  Such  disputes   are   not

necessarily  bound to be referred to  the  Minister

under  clause 8. That is the defect I wish to point

out. I come now to the crucial point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



where  it  may be necessary to take extra  remedial

legislative  measures to make it unlawful  to  take

industrial  action  over "non-industrial  matters".

Sad  is  the  day  when more restrictive  laws  are

adopted. Let there not be such a day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill must not

be  considered  in isolation. It  is  to  be  taken

together  with the Employment Bill and the  Central

Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill as each is part and

parcel  of a deal designed to achieve new norms  in

industrial  relations,  terms  and  conditions   of

service and to increase domestic savings which will

benefit our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already explained fully that,

in connection with the Employment Bill, the purpose

is  to strengthen our economy and ready us to  face

the economic challenges ahead. The other Members of

this  House,  leaders  of  industry,  commerce  and

labour have expressed their views. Academicians and

economists  have  studied and debated  it  and  the

general  consensus  of opinion has  been  that  the

Government  is  not only right but  indeed  has  no

other  choice.  It  has to take stringent  measures

even at the risk of being unpopular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill sets

industrial relations in its true perspective.  This

Bill may appear to the superficially minded and the

superficially  inclined  as  a  move  against   the

interests of labour, but in reality it is  not  so.

What  it seeks to do is to rationalise the position

to  prevent in-roads into functions which  properly

belong  to management. These inroads, whether  made

consciously   or   unconsciously,   have   led   to

aberrations in industrial relations which  in  turn

have  dampened the incentive for some employers  to

continue  in  business, have made them hesitate  to

expand  business  and, worst  of  all,  discouraged

potential new investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the function of management is

to  manage and workers must accept this fact. It is

only under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



such  conditions that we can hope to  maintain  the

present  buoyancy  in  our economy  and  promote  a

climate of stability for further expansion  of  our

economy so that more jobs can be made available for

our  people.  The  Government's  measures  are   an

attempt to establish a balance between the needs of

the  workers  and the requirements of entrepreneurs

in  the  context  of  our  national  interest.  The

Central   Provident  Fund  (Amendment)  Bill,   for

example, will enable our workers to own houses  and

have a stake in our country. Although the employers

will have to pay more under the new rate of Central

Provident  Fund contributions, I am sure none  will

grudge  the extra payment when the money is put  to

good use.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise not to

oppose  the Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill;

neither  do I completely support it. It is  obvious

that  the Government has good intentions for moving

the  amendments.  I think the Industrial  Relations

(Amendment)  Bill has the same motivations  as  the

new  Employment  Bill.  It  would,  therefore,   be

superfluous  for  me  to  go  into  the  whys   and

wherefores  for the introduction of this  amendment

Bill.  But I will not be discharging my duty  as  a

Member  for  Parliament with  labour  interests  at

heart  if  I  do  not  point out the  objectionable

portions  of the Bill as they appear to  me.  These

amendments seek to vest in the management  absolute

power  and  a completely free hand in dealing  with

the  employees without any real safeguards for  the

interests and welfare of the workers. Such are  the

provisions  of  this  Bill  that  even   the   most

scrupulous of employers would be stupid not to take

advantage  of  them  to  the  detriment  of   their

employees.  In the overall interest of the  working

class,  the  dangers  and threats  posed  to  their

security  by  this amendment Bill must be  squarely

faced in the hope that employers would also rise to

the  occasion and not abuse the absolute managerial

functions handed to them in this "silver statute".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek a further amendment to this Bill,

but it is obviously not possible because neither I,

nor  my  colleagues  from the  unions,  have  given

notice.  However,  I would like  to  bring  to  the

notice  of  the Minister the necessity  of  further

protective measures in the provisions of  clause  5

of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to new subsection (2) (d) of section

17  of  the Industrial Relations Ordinance relating

to   termination  of  service  on  the  grounds  of

redundancy  and reorganisation. I do  not  wish  to

imply  that all employers are anti-labour;  neither

are  they pro-labour. It therefore stands to reason

that  there  must be some employers  who  will  not

hesitate  to exploit the provisions quite blatantly

and,  under  the  guise  of reorganisation,  create

redundancy  where none exists in order to  retrench

some of their employees. Here I would like to quote

an  example to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and

Minister  for  Labour  who  was  an  editor  of   a

newspaper before. He knows that if a sub-editor  is

made to read the proof, at the stone, there will be

redundancy  in  the proof-reading department.  That

kind  of reorganisation cannot be justified.  If  a

part of the proof-reading job is taken over by  the

"stone"  editor, the proof-readers will lose  their

jobs.  I  do not doubt that the Minister knows  all

about  this.  There  is nothing  in  this  Bill  to

prevent   such   employers  from   engaging   their

relatives  or  friends  a few  months  after  their

alleged   reorganisation  to  fill  the   positions

previously held by the retrenched employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no intention to take

steps  to  negative this clause, but I do  ask  the

Government  to qualify this clause with  protective

sub-clauses  so  that  no  employer  may  be   able

unjustly  to exploit it. As the proposed  amendment

now  stands,  an employer may effect a retrenchment

and  the  union  may  only  discuss  the  terms  of

severance  pay  for those retrenched employees  who

have more than three years' service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill, which was read a Third time

yesterday, makes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



provision  for  the  payment of  such  retrenchment

benefits should the union and the employer agree on

the benefits to be paid. The issue can obviously be

referred  to  arbitration. It is the criterion  for

the  termination of service which only is precluded

from the purview of negotiation or arbitration.  In

some  ways, it may be even cheaper for an  employer

to retrench his serving employees and save whatever

compensation is due to them, because the amount  so

paid   up  will  be  more  than  recouped  by   the

subsequent  savings from employing new and  cheaper

labour.  Further, the employer can always  retrench

employees  every  two years and eleven  months  and

thereby pay no severance benefits. Such a situation

is  not as far-fetched as the Government would have

us   believe.   It  is  because  of  the   distinct

possibility of such malpractices and abuses that  I

urge the Government to provide more safeguards  for

workers. The protective clauses I seek are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Where the union feels that the retrenchment is justified, both employer and union make a joint application to the Arbitration Court to determine the issue. This should be determined by the President sitting alone. While the issue is under the Court's jurisdiction, the employer may go ahead with the implementation of the re-organisation or retrenchment. The Court's decision, when handed down, will determine whether the retrenchment was justifiable or not.'



<br><br>Sir, it will neither cost the employer anything nor

will  retrenchment be delayed, but such a provision

will prevent abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(2) Where retrenchment has been effected and

upheld  by  the court or where the  union  has

agreed  that it was justifiable, the  employer

is  free  to  engage  new staff  to  fill  the

vacancies within six months from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



date of  retrenchment. If the employer  finds

it  necessary to recruit staff, then he  shall

offer  the  appointments  to  those  who  have

already been retrenched.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not believe that any enligtened

employer    will   object   to   these   protective

provisions,  because he will not abuse  the  powers

that  are,  as the Minister has said,  restored  to

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of dismissal, there is an avenue

for  appeal under the pro-visions of the Employment

Bill  when  it becomes law. The dismissed  employee

may  appeal to the Minister through his  union.  If

the  employer  feels that the dismissal  cannot  be

justified  and  in  order to obviate  the  risk  of

ministerial  intervention,  he  will   effect   the

dismissal  as "retrenchment" it is only calling  it

by    another   name   -   on   the   pretext    of

"reorganisation". This can happen. As the amendment

stands  today, the Minister will be in no  position

to  intervene  and wield the much  publicised  "big

stick".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are my reasons for asking the

Government   to  consider  giving  some   form   of

protection  to  workers  by  means  of  restrictive

clauses designed to prevent abuse of the provisions

by employers.



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am of the view that the introduction of  the

Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill is mainly for

the   purposes  of  creating  a  climate  that   is

conducive to investments in Singapore. It will also

allay the doubts and fears of foreign investors who

intend  to  set  up  business  here.  If  a   wrong

impression  is  created, it will be detrimental  to

our policy of encouraging more foreign investors to

come here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our pro-labour policy of

industrial   peace  with  justice,  the  industrial

relationship between employer and worker  has  been

very  good  in  the  last  few  years.  Many  trade

disputes  have been resolved by arbitration.  There

has  been  a  marked reduction  in  the  number  of

strikes and trade disputes. We must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



try  to  maintain  the  present  good  relationship

between  employer and worker. This  Bill  is  quite

fair  to  both  employer  and  worker  because   it

provides that the transfer of any employee must not

be detrimental to his existing terms and conditions

of  service. It will therefore prevent unscrupulous

employers from exploiting their employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that in the case of an

employer  who  abuses  his  rights  by  sacking  an

employee, the latter can, within a month, appeal to

the  Minister  for Labour for a withdrawal  of  the

notice   of   termination  of   service   and   for

reinstatement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the trade union leaders in the

National  Trades  Union  Congress  look  after  not

merely the interest of labour but also that of  the

nation  as  a  whole.  In  doing  so,  they  seldom

interfere with the rights of employers. They merely

advance advisory opinions and this is not construed

as interference with the rights of employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the introduction of this Bill will

not  affect  our  policy of industrial  peace  with

justice  and  that this policy will be  maintained.

The  present  era is not the time for employers  to

increase  their  wealth  at  the  expense  of   the

workers.  The employers should treat the  employees

fairly  and, at the same time, the employees should

work  harder. It is only in this way  that  we  can

contribute to our economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill for all these reasons.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  with the enactment of the new Employment Bill

into  law,  a new chapter in the history of  labour

legislation in the Republic will have been  written

with  the complete overhaul of three previous  Acts

which  were  legacies  of  the  colonial  past.  It

engenders   a  fertile  and  attractive  investment

climate  for  both local and foreign  capital.  But

even  with  these  new  terms  and  conditions   of

employment as set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



out  in the new Bill, investors will still be  wary

about  investing  in  our Republic  unless  certain

management functions such as employment, promotion,

transfer, dismissal, retrenchment and reinstatement

are  restored to the rightful party. These are  the

inalienable  rights of a company's  management.  In

other  words, the Industrial Relations  (Amendment)

Bill,   1968,  is  a  natural  follow-up   of   the

Employment Act. These two pieces of legislation are

just like Siamese twins and cannot be separated  if

they  are  to produce the desired objectives  which

the Government has in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years before 1966 when the history of

our  industrial relations was nothing to  be  proud

of,  the  unions  encroached  upon  the  management

functions  of commercial and industrial  companies.

For  instance,  it was almost impossible  in  those

years  to  get rid of a malingering and bad  worker

because he could take shelter and protection  under

the  umbrella of his union. Very often if a  single

worker  was  dismissed  on  strong  and  legitimate

grounds, it would result in protracted negotiations

between   union   and  management,   and   if   the

negotiations came to nought, it usually ended in  a

strike resulting in heavy losses of revenue to  the

company.  Very  often, if it was a foreign  concern

and  the losses were too heavy to bear, the concern

would just fold up and go away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to remind the trade

union  Members of this House that no  sensible  and

responsible  management will try to get  rid  of  a

trained  and exemplary worker when he is a manpower

asset  in the viability of the company. The profits

of the company depend on his productivity and skill

and  the effort he puts into his work. How then can

an  employer  afford  to  dismiss  such  a  worker?

Instead,  management has to think of incentives  to

reward  his  contribution to  his  company  and  to

induce  him  to  work as long as possible  for  the

company,  because a worker takes many years  to  be

trained  before  he  is  really  effective  in  his

contribution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, provisions are incorporated in the Bill

by  which  wrongful dismissals, as  stated  by  the

Minister, can be referred to him, and his decisions

to  redress  any wrong are final. This  is  a  more

satisfactory   procedure  to  avoid  time-consuming

dialogues  between the two parties to justify  each

other's  actions. Therefore, these two  Bills  will

provide  a  solid foundation to woo  local  trading

companies,  which  are  now hesitant,  and  foreign

industrialists  to invest in our island  state,  as

investment is necessary for our economic survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the British military bases

provides almost 20 per cent of our national income.

This 20 per cent income comes from abroad. With the

British  withdrawal  by 1971,  the  whole  of  this

source  of income will be reduced to zero. We  will

face  a cruel world which does not owe us a living.

We must make up for the loss of this income derived

from  the  presence of the British  military  bases

here.   We   also  face  competition   with   other

industrial countries in Asia. We must also maintain

our  present standard of living which is the second

highest  in Asia. To succeed in all this,  we  must

raise  the  quality of our goods  and  improve  the

efficiency of our services to the maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers, like any other Singapore citizen, will

no longer be in a privileged position. They will be

called  upon  to  make sacrifices in  the  national

interest by increasing productivity and efficiency.

Therefore, the trade unions will now have to play a

more  positive role in educating their  members  to

respond to these changes of circumstances which are

crucial in the years ahead for our existence as  an

independent and sovereign nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 1968,

merely re-establishes the status quo between labour

and  management which is long overdue in industrial

relations.   With  an  enlightened   attitude   and

positive  co-operation on both  sides,  our  nation

will co down in the annals of history that we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



achieved  the impossible by the enactment of  these

two  Bills.  Our labour will earn the  hallmark  of

being    the    most   hard-working,   intelligent,

responsible, skilled and industrious in Asia.  When

this  objective  is reached, these two  Bills  will

have  generated the establishment of more and  more

industries.   This  will  mean  more   avenues   of

employment  for  our  citizens.  With   that,   Mr

Speaker. Sir, I beg to support the Bill.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I deal

with  some of the points raised by the hon. Members

opposite,   I   think   I   should   correct    the

misapprehension of one of the hon. Members  that  I

had  quoted statistics relating to strikes to blame

the  workers. If he will re-read my speech, he will

see  that that was not the intention. The intention

was  to  show that during the period in  the  early

1960s,  something like 57 per cent of the  disputes

arose  out  of  quarrels  over  management  rights,

retrenchment, the right to hire workers and so  on.

This   was  the  basis  on  which  this  Bill   was

introduced, because obviously there is considerable

misunderstanding  between  workers  and  management

about what are management rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill now,

for the first time, spells out something which hon.

Members, and especially the trade union themselves,

admit are common law rights. These rights have been

there. They are accepted as such. The rights of the

management to manage have not been queried,  except

by  the  Member for Kallang who has suggested  that

workers  should also participate in the  management

of  industries. That is something for  the  future.

But,  at  the  moment, there is no dispute  and  no

quarrel over the essence of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is misgiving is in regard to the

abuse  of  these  rights by certain  employers.  Of

course,  if  one  assumes that  all  employers  are

madcaps,  then  not only this legislation  but  all

other  pieces of legislation go by the  board.  But

employment laws are normally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



made on the basis that employers are reasonable and

we frame legislation to suit reasonable conditions.

But  where  it  appears to us that  the  number  of

madcap employers becomes very substantial, then, as

I  made  it  quite  clear in  my  speech,  we  will

reconsider  amendments to our Industrial  Relations

Act   with   a  view  to  controlling  unreasonable

employers. But as things are at the moment, we work

on   the   assumption  that  most   employers   are

reasonable, as most trade unionists are reasonable.

If that feeling prevails and if employers and trade

unionists  work on the basis that both parties  are

reasonable men, then I think this Bill, when passed

into  law,  will  achieve what we  really  want  to

achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate not only on this Bill but also on

the Employment Bill, there are different objectives

or  immediate objectives. Naturally for  the  trade

unionists,  they are only interested in  the  trade

unions  and the workers. The employer is  concerned

only  with  his own sectional interest. But,  as  a

Government,  our  interests are  national.  We  are

interested in the welfare of Singapore as a whole - workers, employers and professional men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main objectives of the Industrial

Relations  (Amendment) Bill, as with the Employment

Act,  is  to  resolve serious and real problems  of

economic   expansion,  new  investments,  increased

productivity. And the overriding test to  which  we

submit  any legislation is, will it help  to  bring

about  these  objectives - economic expansion,  new

investments, increased productivity? If it  can  or

if  it  gives a reasonable assurance that  it  can,

then  the  legislation must over-ride the sectional

interests, whether of employers or workers  or  any

other  groups. And this, I am convinced, will  help

and  definitely  bring about industrial  expansion,

economic expansion, new investments. If we  do  not

achieve  these objectives soon enough before  1971,

at least in the 1970s, then the arguments about the

right  to  hire  and  fire and  retrenchment  would

become superfluous and unreal, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



there  would  be  massive  unemployment.  Employers

would be checking out and concerns would be closing

down  right  and  left,  in  which  case  even  the

exercise  of  the  need  for  unions  would  become

problematical. My colleagues and I, and I am  quite

sure Members opposite also, are convinced that this

Bill  will, when enacted into law, bring about  new

investments, industrial expansion and, in the  long

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is the third of three Bills which are

designed  to meet the challenging economic problems

that   loom  ahead.  Whilst  the  purpose  of   the

Employment   Bill  and  the  Industrial   Relations

(Amendment)  Bill is to have more  realistic  terms

and  conditions  of  service and  employer-employee

relations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



consonant   with   the  need  to   induce   greater

investment,   generate  higher   productivity   and

employment,  this  Bill deals with  another  inter-related  problem  --  the marshalling  of  domestic

savings for the economic and social benefit of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I deal with the Bill itself, hon. Members

will  no  doubt  like to have the  air  cleared  in

regard  to  the Fund itself. At the  end  of  1967,

there  were 456,029 members with balances totalling

$477,315,488. The number of active accounts in 1967

was,  however,  299,157 and contributions  received

during  the  year  amounted to  $55.8  million.  An

interesting  feature of the Fund is that  about  60

per  cent  of the members earn less than  $200  per

month,  whilst about 31 per cent earn between  $200

and  $500 per month, and only about 9 per cent earn

more  than  $500  per  month.  It  would  also   be

interesting to note that about 57 per cent  of  the

total  membership have a balance of less than $500,

but  if  we  were to consider the total  number  of

members  having  a  balance  of  under  $1,000  the

percentage would be about 71 per cent. The analyses

given here will help hon. Members, in the light  of

what  I  have  to  say later on, to appreciate  the

effect  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  Central

Provident  Fund  Ordinance will have  on  the  wage

earning population of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the principal purposes of the

Bill are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to increase the contributions payable to the Central Provident Fund by employers and employees;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to enable arrangements to be made for members of the Fund to use their savings in the Fund for the purchase of houses or flats for their own occupation; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to enable the provisions of the Central Provident Fund Ordinance to be extended to cover persons who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



self-employed  and  who do  not  at  present

contribute to the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first deal with the proposal to increase

the  contributions. An amendment  is  made  to  the

Schedule  to  the Ordinance whereby  new  rates  of

contribution payable are prescribed. The effect  of

this   amendment  is  that  the  current  rate   of

contribution  of  5 per cent each by  employer  and

employee is increased by 1½, per cent to make it 6½

per  cent  each,  and the existing  provision  that

limits  the employers' and employees' contributions

to  a maximum of $25 per month from each is removed

and  a  new maximum of $150 per month from each  is

substituted.  It  should be  noted,  however,  that

employees  who earn less than $200 per month,  will

not,  as  at present, be required to contribute  to

the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the payment of an additional 1½

per  cent by the employer will, in respect of about

60  per  cent  of  the members of  the  Fund,  mean

contributions  only by employers towards  enhancing

the savings of workers. In an indirect way it is an

addition to workers' pay. The same advantages would

also  apply to employees in the higher wage groups.

However, it is not intended to apply the new  rates

to  the United Kingdom Government and its employees

and they will therefore contribute the present rate

of  5 per cent each. The reason for this is obvious

as  hon.  Members know that the British are leaving

and retrenching their employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is given powers to vary the schedule

of contributions. The intention behind these powers

is  to increase the rate by another 1½ per cent  in

the second stage. Therefore, the total savings each

month  for  the worker as a result of contributions

payable  both by employer and employee will  be  16

per  cent - that is 8 per cent each by employer and

employee.  In  the  third stage, the  contributions

will  be increased by a further 2 per cent to  make

it  10  per cent from each side, or a total savings

of  20  per  cent of salary each month.  This  will

considerably increase the savings of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



employees and build up their reserves in  the  Fund

which  will  stand  them  in  good  stead  both  by

enhancing savings and accumulating sufficient money

to purchase houses or flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very significant departure from the existing

law  are  the  amendments  to  section  25  of  the

Ordinance,  as embodied in clause 14.  This  is  to

enable members of the Fund to use their savings  in

the  Fund  for the purchase of houses or flats  for

their  own  occupation. A reasonable question  that

can  be asked in this regard is the basis on  which

Government  has  assessed  the  situation.  I  must

inform   hon.  Members  that  the  Government   has

assessed  the  purchase intentions  of  the  people

through  a  feasibility  survey  conducted  by  the

Economic  Research Centre in conjunction  with  the

Housing  and  Development Board.  This  survey  has

shown  that  49  per cent, or nearly  half  of  the

householders in Housing Board flats, expressed  the

intention  to  buy  them,  10  per  cent  expressed

uncertainty  and  41  per  cent  did  not  wish  to

purchase flats. Among those who wish to buy  flats,

16  per cent live in one-room flats, 30 per cent in

two-room flats and 54 per cent in three-room flats.

29 per cent of those who expressed uncertainty live

in  one-room  flats, 35 per cent in two-room  flats

and 36 per cent in three-room flats. An interesting

feature  was that 53 per cent of those who did  not

wish  to buy flats live in one-room flats,  27  per

cent  in  two-room flats and 20 per cent in  three-room flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures indicate that the proportion of

households   wishing  to  purchase   flats   varies

directly with the number of rooms in a flat.  While

only  24 per cent of those living in one-room flats

wish  to  buy, 50 per cent of those living in  two-room flats and 68 per cent of those living in three-

room flats have expressed a wish to buy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to Central Provident Fund balances of

households  surveyed, an interesting revelation  is

that  about  31  per cent have between  $1,000  and

$5,000  and 13 per cent above $5,000. About 10  per

cent have between $500



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



and  $1,000  and 21 per cent less than $500.  There

are,  however,  a  good number of people  in  these

households  who  do not contribute to  the  Central

Provident  Fund  but who wish to buy  flats.  These

people  are  generally self-employed. Hon.  Members

will see that there is, therefore, justification in

enabling  members to make use of their  savings  in

the Fund to purchase houses as a sizable proportion

of  our people, whether in or out of the Fund,  are

keen  to own their own homes. This should give  the

lie  to those who allege that people are forced  to

buy  Housing  Board flats. With the enhancement  of

savings  through  increased contributions,  it  can

reasonably be expected that more people  will  have

enough  funds  in due course to make down  payments

and pay instalments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central Provident Fund members who already have

sufficiently  large balances in the Fund  would  be

allowed  to  use  their balances to purchase  flats

outright,  while  those who have already  purchased

flats   will  be  allowed  to  use  their   monthly

contributions  to  pay  the  instalments  of  their

housing loans, but they will not be allowed to  use

their  balances to settle outstanding  balances  of

any existing loans. I must inform hon. Members that

regulations   will  be  introduced  to   make   the

necessary arrangements for implementing the housing

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other notable amendment is the provision to

extend  coverage to self-employed persons, that  is

to  say, persons who derive income from any  trade,

profession  or vocation. Any such person,  however,

need  not contribute after he has attained the  age

of  55  years. Provision is also made to  ascertain

from  the Comptroller of Income Tax the incomes  of

such persons. These are contained in clauses 2  and

14  which amend sections 2 and 25 of the Ordinance.

The  necessary regulations in this regard will also

be made in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Central Provident

Fund  Ordinance  are in part consequential  and  in

part designed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



improve the drafting and the administration of  the

Ordinance.  These  amendments, however,  include  a

number of others which are considered necessary for

other reasons. In particular, provisions have  been

made in clause 6 to require employers to contribute

to the Fund in respect of employees over the age of

55   years   and  to  require  such  employees   to

contribute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill introduce two new

sections  designed  to clarify  the  procedure  and

conditions of withdrawal from the Fund. The  rights

of   members  of  the  Fund  to  withdraw  will  be

affected: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) by restricting the right of withdrawal on

the  ground that a member is leaving  Malaya

permanently to persons who are not  citizens

of Singapore; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by discontinuing the existing provision

under  which  a person who has not  been  an

employee  for  more than  two  years  to  be

allowed  to  withdraw if he can satisfy  the Board  that  he  is  not  likely  to  be  an

employee again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restriction in the case of persons who have

not  been  employed  for more  than  two  years  is

necessary  in  view of the fact that provision  has

been  made  for self-employed persons to contribute

to   the  Fund.  The  existing  provision  in   the

Ordinance that allows such persons to withdraw from

the Fund is not compatible with the new requirement

that they should contribute to the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 14 of the Ordinance,

which is embodied in clause 9, enables, firstly,  a

member's balance in the Fund to be used as security

for  the purposes of purchasing a house or  a  flat

for  his  own occupation and, secondly,  deletes  a

transitional provision in the Ordinance that ceased

to have any effect some 10 years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 10 is to make new provision

to provide penalties for publication of information

by   an  employee  of  the  Board  to  unauthorised

persons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 21 in clause 11 of the

Bill  is  in connection with approved funds.  There

are  26  such  funds. It is probable that  in  many

cases  the new rates of contributions payable under

the  Ordinance  will be of greater benefit  to  the

employees who are members of such funds than  their

existing  rights as members of approved funds.  The

amendment  will  merely  enable  the  Minister   to

require  employers  who operate approved  funds  to

contribute to the Central Provident Fund for  their

employees if the Minister so directs. Further,  the

deletion  of subsection (8) of section  21  of  the

Ordinance   will  affect  between  two  and   three

thousand employees who have been exempted from  the

provisions of the Ordinance by the Board. It is now

proposed  to  exempt by Regulations to be  gazetted

employees  whose  country of  domicile  is  outside

Malaya  and  Singapore  and  who  are  employed  in

Singapore  on  an Employment or Professional  Visit

Pass issued by the Controller of Immigration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill contains a new section

dealing with the refund of amounts paid to the Fund

by  error.  Most of the provisions of the  existing

section 24 have been continued, but provisions have

now  been made for dealing with contributions  paid

in error by persons who are not employees, and with

errors  made  in  the  payment  of  interest  under

section  7A of the Ordinance. The time for claiming

refund  of  amounts paid in error has been  reduced

from three years to one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 introduces a new section 24A which is

designed   to  enable  the  Board  to   engage   in

activities    not   directly   related    to    the

administration  of  the  Fund  and  to   call   for

information   under  certain  circumstances.   Hon.

Members will appreciate that in the context of  the

present situation, when economic planning is to the

fore,  compilation of vital statistical information

relating to employees and employers may be required

from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 includes a number of amendments to

section 25 of the Ordinance, the most important  of

which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



those in paragraph (d). The new paragraphs (e) , (f)

and (g) that are added to subsection (1) of section

25  of  the Ordinance enable the Minister  to  make

regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few other amendments which are of

minor moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments to the Central

Provident  Fund  Ordinance proposed  in  this  Bill

usher  in a piece of social legislation that brings

to  the  workers benefits which they did not  enjoy

before  increased savings to provide for their  old

age  and the opportunity to buy a house or flat  of

their own. This is an exercise in social innovation

and social transformation, an attempt to create  as

large a proportion of property-owning population as

possible so that they would have a deep and abiding

stake in the country and thereby revolutionise  the

pattern of living of our people for the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of  the Central Provident Fund (Amendment)

Bill.  This  Bill makes a welcome change  from  the

Employment   Bill  and  the  Industrial   Relations

(Amendment)  Bill  in  that it contains  provisions

mainly for the benefit of workers in Singapore. The

Bill  seeks  to  increase  the  existing  rate   of

contribution to the Central Provident Fund  payable

by both employer and employee from 5 per cent to 6½

per  cent,  8 per cent and 10 per cent respectively

during  the next three years. It appears to be  the

intention of the Government that such increases  in

the  rate  of  Central Provident Fund contributions

are to be treated as wage increases. The Government

is  to be congratulated on moving such an amendment

to  the  Central  Provider Fund  Ordinance  as  the

increased  rate of contribution would,  in  effect,

increase the savings of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the increased rate of

contribution, the Bill also seeks to  provide  that

the  amount of existing deposits credited  to  each

employee in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



the  Central  Provident Fund can  be  utilised  for

making a down payment for the purchase of a Housing

and  Development Board flat and that the subsequent

contributions to the Central Provident Fund at  the

enhanced  rate of contribution can be utilised  for

paying  the  monthly hire-purchase instalments  for

the  purchase of such flats. As I see  it,  such  a

provision  would enable many workers to make  their

dream of owning their own homes come true. This  is

particularly  so  when the Central  Provident  Fund

rate of contribution is increased to 10 per cent in

three years' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I appreciate that the provisions in the

Bill  are  for  the  general  benefit  to  workers,

however,  I  wish  to  draw the  attention  of  the

Government  to the fact that whatever  benefit  the

Government  proposes to give to the  workers  under

the  Bill  may be largely negatived by  the  action

that  would be taken by most employers. It  is  the

valid fear of workers that employers may offset the

increased  rate of contribution payable under  this

Bill  against the gratuity benefits payable by them

under  a collective agreement. Members of the House

may  be  aware that in most collective  agreements,

provision  is  made  for the  payment  of  gratuity

benefit  to  an  employee  on  his  resignation  or

retirement  from the service of his  employer.  The

amount  of  this  gratuity benefit depends  on  the

length  of  his service. The rate usually  averages

five per cent of the last drawn monthly salary  for

each  year  of service, in addition to the  Central

Provident   Fund   contribution  payable   by   the

employer.  As  it  is proposed under  the  Bill  to

increase  the  Central Provident Fund  contribution

ultimately  to 10 per cent, and if the employer  is

allowed   to   offset   the   increased   rate   of

contribution against whatever gratuity  benefit  is

payable  by  him to the worker under the collective

agreement it would, in effect, mean that the worker

would  not obtain the benefit of any wage  increase

as  envisaged  under this Bill. I  would  therefore

urge  the Government to look into this problem  and

ensure that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



employer  does  not  offset the increased  rate  of

Central   Provident   Fund   contribution   against

whatever gratuity benefit is payable by him to  his

workers   under   the  collective   agreement.   If

employers do this, it will defeat the very  purpose

of  this  Bill  which is to enable the  workers  to

enjoy any increase in wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to comment on an important point

which   seems  to  be  ignored  under  the  Central

Provident  Fund (Amendment) Bill. I  refer  to  the

problem  of  persons  who  are  unemployed   before

reaching the age of 55 years, at which age they are

only  allowed to withdraw whatever sum of money  is

standing  to their credit in the Central  Provident

Fund.  Such persons, particularly those whose  ages

range  between  45  and  50,  may  find  themselves

unemployable  in the labour market which  is  being

flooded  with young school-leavers. The tragedy  is

compounded  by  the  fact  that  such  persons  are

usually  family men. The result is that  they  find

themselves  in  a  most unenviable situation.  They

have  no  jobs and no means to support the  family.

They  find  that they cannot withdraw some  of  the

monies  which  are credited to their names  in  the

Central Provident Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, appeal to the Government

seriously  to  consider allowing  such  persons  to

withdraw some of the monies credited to them in the

Central  Provident  Fund. I would  suggest  that  a

person  who has been unemployed for five years  and

has  attained the age of 45 years should be allowed

to  withdraw  up to 30 per cent of  the  amount  of

money   standing  to  his  credit  in  the  Central

Provident  Fund, and if he still remains unemployed

at  the age of 50, he should be allowed to withdraw

a  further 30 per cent of the money standing to his

credit.  Such a measure will allow him to make  use

of  the money when he most urgently needs it either

for supporting his family or for commencing a small

business. This measure also allows him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



to  retain  40  per cent of the  sum  of  money  so

deposited in the Central Provident Fund for use  in

his  old  age,  by which time some members  of  his

family  may  be  able  to take  over  the  task  of

maintaining the family.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  few  moments  ago, the Minister  said  that  the

stated  that there will be 1½ per cent increase  in

the amount of contributions and that there will  be

provision   to  enable  members  of   the   Central

Provident Fund to utilise money in credit with  the

Fund  to  buy flats. In my view, this  may  not  be

quite correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important factor is whether or not the

products  of  our factories are cheap and  of  good

quality. It is only under these circumstances  that

we  can compete in the international market. If the

products  of our factories are not of good  quality

and  are expensive, how can the workers be expected

to  contribute  1½  per cent more  to  the  Central

Provident Fund? The factories will not be  able  to

sell their goods. They may even have to close down.

Therefore, in my view this is not a very  practical

solution.  Contributions to the  Central  Provident

Fund  should  be  reduced  so  that  the  cost   of

production  to  employees may be  reduced  and  our

goods will be more competitive in the international

market. If there are more factories, there will  be

more  jobs  created. I am afraid  that  if  workers

spend their money and their rate of contribution to

the  Central  Provident  Fund  is  increased,  many

factories will not be able to keep down the cost of

production.  As a result, they may  have  to  close

down and unemployment will increase.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

fact that hon. Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



are  relieved that at least this Bill is the silver

lining  in  the black cloud which has been  hanging

over them for the past few weeks, I think there are

only  two  points to which I need reply. The  first

point  is  about  the question  of  offsetting  the

increased   contributions  to   the   new   Central

Provident  Fund  against gratuities  payable  under

collective  agreements.  I  suggest  this  is   one

instance  where  the trade unions can  legitimately

pursue their job of protecting the interest of  the

workers by insisting that ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is also good for the

Government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - the employers do stick by their

agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the possibility of allowing

people who are unemployed before the age of  55  to

withdraw     their    Central    Provident     Fund

contributions. As hon. Members will  know,  I  gave

some statistics which will show that this will  not

really  help  anyone who is unemployed  to  set  up

business.  Something  like  70  per  cent  of   the

contributors, as I have indicated, have  a  balance

of  $1,000 each. Thirty per cent of that  is  about

$300.  Any man who decides to set up business  with

$300  is  obviously going to lose that  $300  which

will be there if he does not withdraw it when he is

55.  So I suggest that this Bill will safeguard  at

least  many of the younger people. If the  Bill  is

passed, 20 per cent of their wages every month will

be put into a Central Provident Fund which, over  a

period  of 10 or 20 years, will be very substantial

enough for them to buy a house and perhaps go  into

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of higher living standards and

the  compelling desire of more and more  people  in

Singapore  to  acquire what may  be  called  luxury

consumer  goods, such as motor-cars,  refrigerators

and  television sets, there has been  a  tremendous

growth   in  recent  years  of  instalment   credit

transactions carried out by resort to hire-purchase

agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House is principally

designed to control the form and contents of  hire-purchase agreements and to spell out the rights and

duties  of parties to such agreements. It  is  also

designed  to control instalments-sale financing  to

achieve  certain objects, namely, to curb inflation

by   restricting  credit  facilities;  to   specify

classes  of  goods for particular purposes,  or  to

divert  manufacturing activity and the  lending  of

money  to more productive purposes. The legislation

provides for the exercise of this control by laying

down  minimum deposits on hire-purchase  agreements

or  by  restricting periods for which  payments  by

instalment buyers may be spread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from this, a more pressing reason

that  prompts Government to introduce this proposed

legislation is the urgent need to confer protection

upon   the  less  sophisticated  members   of   the

community  who enter into hire-purchase  agreements

and  often experience hardship because of the harsh

and oppressive conditions which sometimes appear in

these agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill takes, as it were, a middle course

between, on the one hand, the policy adopted by the

United   Kingdom  legislation  (which  limits   the

application  of  the legislation  to  hire-purchase

agreements where the hire-purchase price  does  not

exceed £2,000 sterling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



and  applies to all classes of goods) and,  on  the

other   hand,   the  Australian  and  New   Zealand

legislation (which sets no financial limit to hire-purchase  agreements and applies to all classes  of

goods).  The policy in our Bill is that  it  should

apply  only  to certain categories of  goods  which

from their nature are normally purchased under hire-purchase   agreements.  No   financial   limit   is

specified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with these broad principles in mind that

the  present legislation has been drafted and  this

Bill,  like the Malaysian Hire-Purchase Act,  1967,

incorporates many of the recent concepts that  have

been   written   into  the  existing  hire-purchase

legislation  of  the United Kingdom and  Australia.

The  Bill  has,  as  its foundation,  three  points

fundamental  to consumer protection  of  any  kind.

Part  II  provides adequate disclosure requirements

in a written statement. Built-in terms in favour of

the  buyer  as  to  the title to  goods  and  their

merchantable  quality with implied  warranties  and

conditions are found in Part III. Finally, the Bill

in  Part VII prohibits contractual provisions  that

are unconscionable in their purpose or operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "hire-purchase agreement" is defined in

clause  2 of the Bill. The provisions of this  Bill

will cover all hire-purchase agreements relating to

such  goods as may be specified in the Schedule  by

the  Minister.  The  goods to which  this  proposed

legislation  will apply are motor  vehicles,  radio

sets,   television  sets,  gramophone  sets,   tape

recorders    and    any    combination     thereof,

refrigerators, deep-freeze food preservers and  any

combination  there  of,  air-conditioners,  washing

machines  and sewing machines. The effect  of  this

provision  is,  on  the  one  hand,  to  limit  the

application of the legislation to certain specified

goods, and, on the other hand, to enable Government

to  adapt  this  legislation  to  meet  Singapore's

changing economic and social needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress, however, that, in the preparation

of this legislation, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



Government  has  not overlooked  the  consideration

that  protection should also be given to the unpaid

seller's  interest in the hired goods; he  can  re-possess  the goods 21 days after serving  a  notice

for  non-payment of instalments due.  Further,  the

rights  of third parties who may acquire possession

of  goods  that  are the subject of a hire-purchase

agreement have also been taken into account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed that in the definitions of

the   terms   "hire-purchase"  and   "contract   of

guarantee", transactions in which the  hirer  is  a

dealer of goods have been excluded. The reason  for

this  is  that,  being engaged in the  business  of

hiring, a dealer does not need the protection  that

this  Bill  is  designed to give  to  the  ordinary

members  of the public. Stocking arrangements  that

are  entered  into between a hire-purchase  company

and  a dealer are accordingly outside the scope  of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also be noted that jurisdiction over

transactions in respect of hire-purchase agreements

is  vested in the High Court except in some matters

arising under clauses 10, 14 and 23 of the Bill. In

so  providing,  this  Bill  follows  the  statutory

provisions   to  be  found  in  most   Commonwealth

countries that have legislated on this subject. The

principal reason for this is that questions of  law

arising    from   hire-purchase   agreements    are

invariably complex and are, it is considered,  more

suitably dealt with by the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A novel provision, which does not appear either

in  Australian  or United Kingdom  legislation,  is

clause  14 (5) of the Bill which confers protection

upon the owner where the hirer terminates the hire-purchase agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill outlines in

a general way the various provisions of the Bill. I

would  like  to  mention here  that  the  Singapore

Advocates and Solicitors Society has been consulted

in  the  drafting  of this Bill  and  many  of  its

suggestions   and   recommendations    have    been

incorporated in the Bill. In spite of this,  it  is

the intention of Government to refer this Bill to a

Select Committee so as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



provide  opportunities to other interested  bodies

and members of the public to present their views on

the  Bill  which I commend to Members as  a  useful

measure  for coping with the social and  commercial

requirements of our developing nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for a long

time  our  society and economy needed and  received

the  boost that hire-purchase provides in financing

what consumption and consumer need. But equally for

a  long  time there was no referee, save  a  rather

unsatisfactory  one  originating  in   the   United

Kingdom,  and even then ill-tailored for the  needs

here.  More often than not, the free play of forces

between  the borrower and the lender ended  in  the

borrower losing to the lender. This must be so, for

you  cannot afford to quarrel with the man to  whom

you are in debt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Bill, a new referee has come into the

ring.  The  provisions  in the  Hire-Purchase  Act,

1968,  as intituled, seek to regulate the form  and

contents of hire-purchase agreements and the rights

and  duties  of  parties  to  such  agreements  and

matters connected therewith. Whether the provisions

contained  in  the  Bill  will  make  a  good   and

impartial referee is something only time can  tell.

At   this  moment  the  provisions  appear  to   be

absolutely necessary. They also appear to have been

carefully  considered and drafted. Even  forms  are

being  prescribed  and the terms and  charges  laid

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the provisions of the Bill, I feel

that  the  future  borrower will  have  his  rights

protected and the future lender will know precisely

where  his relief lies. The Courts are being  given

exact  areas of jurisdiction, and I think  everyone

will  be happy except the borrower who borrows with

the intention to abscond, and the lender .who lends

with  the  intention to squeeze the purchaser.  But

the regulation and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



control of hire-purchase is a field in which  there

is  little experience in this country. It  is  true

that  the  Bill  has the benefit of  experience  in

other  countries. But the experience of  the  other

countries  is not necessarily the prescription  for

us. We are an emerging country. We are beginning to

produce   more   and  more  goods   for   our   own

consumption. It is essential that while we  try  to

curb  abuses in hire-purchase financing, we do  not

kill such financing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill and I should

like  to ask the Minister charged with implementing

it  to  consider representations carefully  and  to

introduce any amendments whenever needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That the Bill be committed to a Select

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill flow before the House seeks

primarily  to  repeal  section  32  of   the   Land

Acquisition Act, 1966, and re-enact it on the lines

of the corresponding provision in the repealed Land

Acquisition  Ordinance (Chapter  248)  to  provide,

inter  alia,  that when the claim of  an  appellant

exceeds  by 20 per cent or more the amount  awarded

by the Appeals Board, he shall not be entitled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



to  his costs, and to give discretion to the  Board

to  reduce his costs or require him to pay part  of

the  Collector's costs when his claim is considered

excessive or where he has been negligent in putting

his case before the Collector (clause 4).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable to effect this amendment, as

under  the  existing section 32  (1)  of  the  Land

Acquisition  Act,  1966, it is  provided  that  the

costs  of  an appeal to the Board shall be  in  the

discretion of the Board and shall either  be  fixed

by  the Board or, on the order of the Board,  taxed

by  the  Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the  High

Court  in  accordance with the scale prescribed  by

the rules of the court for the time being in force.

As  this leaves the question of costs completely to

the   discretion  of  the  Board,   it   could   be

interpreted that the normal High Court practice  in

awarding costs to the successful litigant is to  be

followed,  which,  in  its  application   to   land

acquisition appeals, will result in costs going the

way  of  the  appellant  even  if  he  succeeds  in

obtaining from the Board only a very small fraction

of  his  claim. The proposed amendment will restore

the  position to what it was before 1966, and deter

owners  from making excessive claims and act  as  a

restraint  against  an  owner  proceeding  with  an

appeal regardless of the Collector's award and  the

amount of his own claim, as even if he succeeds  in

obtaining  a  slight  increase,  he  will  not   be

entitled to any costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill is merely a re-enactment of

the  existing provision of section 32  (3)  of  the

Land Acquisition Act, 1966. Although it is proposed

to  repeal  section 32 of the Act, this  particular

provision, section 32 (3), is being retained as  it

does  not really deal with costs but with the power

of  the  Appeals Board to confirm, reduce, increase

or annul the award made by the Collector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken, in clause 2 of the

Bill, to amend section 8 of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



Land Acquisition Act, 1966, to enable the Collector

to  require  the  person  interested  in  any  land

acquisition to furnish information relating to  the

basis, or mode of valuation by which the amount  of

compensation claimed by such person is arrived  at.

This  will enable the Collector to rationalise  the

basis of such claim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holidays (Amendment) Bill seeks to reduce the

number  of public holidays in Singapore to  11  per

annum.  The  number of holidays  in  Singapore  has

always  been set out in an Ordinance and the number

of  'public  holidays has from time  to  time  been

varied  in such a manner that it would appear  that

each time there is a change in the number of public

holidays  in Singapore, this has been,  more  often

than  not,  towards an increase in  the  number  of

holidays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it fair to observe that until we joined

Malaysia,   the  number  of  holidays  was   fairly

constant. Although the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  now

the  President  of the Republic,  is  empowered  by

notification in the Gazette to appoint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



special  days  to  be observed as public  holidays,

such  discretion accorded to him lay only  when  an

increase  in  the  number of  holidays  or  when  a

substitution  for  an existing  holiday  was  being

contemplated.   When  we  joined   Malaysia,   this

Ordinance was repealed and in substitution therefor

the   Malaysian   legislation  was  introduced   to

Singapore.  In 1966 we re-enacted the Holidays  Act

setting out the legality or otherwise in regard  to

certain acts which may or may not be done on public

holidays. By then, of course, the number of  public

holidays had increased to the present number of  16

per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from these holidays, there were

certain  rest  days  provided for  in  the  various

Ordinances  and  Acts  dealing  with  workmen   and

labourers.   These  enactments  set   out   certain

compulsory  industrial holidays  which  had  to  be

observed  and for which certain benefits  would  be

paid  to workmen who were required to work on these

days.   In   the  recent  measures  introduced   by

Government in order to prepare the country for  the

eventual departure of the British Armed Forces  and

for  the economic upheavals that may follow in  its

wake, we have decided that the number of industrial

holidays should be reduced to 11. At the same time,

it  was  also  thought proper that  the  number  of

public holidays in Singapore should correspondingly

be  reduced  to coincide with the total  number  of

industrial  holidays per year. Not only then  would

the  workers,  but  also  all  those  resident  and

working   in   Singapore,  whether  in   Government

departments  or  in the private  sector,  be  given

every   opportunity  to  make  their   contribution

towards  the  national  effort  to  remain   viable

economically,   and  progress   even   during   the

difficult years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would perhaps be appropriate for me, in making

this  speech,  to  tell the House  that  Government

sought   the   views   of  the  various   religious

communities   in  our  society  on   the   proposed

reduction  of  public  holidays.  The  Hindus,  for

example,  given the choice of having  Deepavali  or

Thaipusam as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



a  public  holiday,  have chosen  the  former.  The

Muslims  have, after discussions and correspondence

with  the Muslim Advisory Board, retained Hari Raya

Puasa  and Hari Raya Haji to enable members of  our

community who are of the Muslim faith, to discharge

their   obligations  and  attend  mosque  on  those

specific   days.  The  Christians   have   retained

Christmas  and Good Friday, the two most  important

dates in the Christian calendar. The Buddhists have

retained  Vesak Day. Thus it will be seen that  the

choice  of  holidays  that  will  be  retained   in

Singapore  have  had the blessings  of  the  Inter-Religious Organisation, an organisation represented

by all the religious persuasions in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this Bill will bring us back to the

less  playful  conditions which existed  before  we

started  to  add on to our holidays as  we  had  to

please  more and more religious and cultural groups

in  Singapore and Malaysia. I am sure  I  have  the

support  of  hon. Members. In common with  all  the

measures that have been introduced in this House at

this  present sitting, the main object of this Bill

is  to  contribute more towards the national  well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

proposed   holidays   are  reasonably   distributed

racially and religiously and I also agree that  the

number of holidays should be reduced in order  that

we  can increase productivity. But I would like  to

propose that the Government reconsider the deletion

of Thaipusam from the list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaipusam has been celebrated in Singapore since

the later part of the nineteenth century and it has

become an important religious celebration not  only

for  the  Hindus but also for the whole population.

The  kavadi procession is an attraction to everyone

in  Singapore,  young and old. Moreover,  it  is  a

tourist  attraction,  as  we  all  must  have  seen

tourists following the procession and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



busily   taking  pictures.  It  will  be  a   great

disappointment both to the local people and to  the

tourists  if  the number of kavadi  processions  is

reduced  because Thaipusam is not a public  holiday

and,  therefore, workers will not be able  to  take

part  in the processions. I therefore propose  that

Government,  in  order  to  encourage  the  tourist

trade, should reconsider the deletion of this  very

popular public holiday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever the Government reconsiders the

question  of  public  holidays,  I  hope  Deepavali

Holiday will not be abolished.



<br><br>6.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

support  the  Bill for a somewhat different  reason

from  that  advanced by the Minister  for  Law  and

National Development. Of the six days allocated  to

the four major religions in Singapore two go to the

Christians, two to the Muslims, one to  the  Hindus

and one to the Buddhists. Quite apart from this, we

have a responsibility to ourselves, in reaching our

goal of nation-building amongst a community made up

of   so   many   races,  religions,  cultures   and

linguistic  groups,  to  look  to  the  other  five

holidays, examine what they should signify and  how

we should celebrate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Year's Day is, of course, an international

day  of rejoicing. Whether it is in the West or  in

the  East, i.e., in Communist countries or in Japan

or  China,  the 1st of January is New  Year's  Day.

This  is one occasion for rejoicing and celebration

among  all  races and all communal  and  linguistic

groups in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But much more significant than New Year's Day is

National Day which is Just around the corner.  This

is  not  a  day  merely  for  Muslims,  Christians,

Hindus,  Buddhists or the other minority  religious

groups  in  Singapore. For that matter, it  is  not

just for any linguistic or cultural group. It is  a

day which all Singaporeans celebrate by taking part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



in  various  activities organised  in  the  various

constituencies.  Just as we used to  celebrate  the

3rd of June as Constitution Day, you will find that

in   the   last   three  years  since   we   became

independent,  National Day in  Singapore  has  been

celebrated   by   people  of  various   races   and

religions, and by cultural and linguistic groups as

a  day of national significance, as a day when  we'

achieved  full  self-government. On 9th  August  we

will  celebrate  National Day  as  a  day  when  we

brought    independence   and   sovereignty    unto

ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, National Day transcends all other

religious  holidays which, in effect, are sectional

celebrations, although on these days people who  do

not  belong  to these religious denominations  take

part in the festivities too. For example, Christmas

is  celebrated  by Christians as well  as  by  non-Christians in Singapore. Likewise, Chinese New Year

is  also  celebrated by the non-Chinese; Hari  Raya

Puasa  by the non-Muslims. Yet there is nothing  to

compare with National Day. The celebration  of  New

Year's  Day  and  National Day, besides  the  other

three  holidays upon which I do not wish to  dwell,

transcends  all races, religions, or  cultural  and

linguistic groups. It is for us, the leaders of the

country,  to  help  promote  the  significance   of

National Day to an even greater degree amongst  the

people. National Day is a day of rejoicing which we

should  celebrate  with  even  more  festivity  and

greater significance and feeling. Unless and  until

this can be brought home to the people, we will  be

back in the old situation where Christmas, Han Raya

Puasa  and the other religious festivities  of  the

other religious groups mean more to these religious

groups than does National Day. This, I think, would

not be a trend towards progress in nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Day in the present context of an

independent  and  sovereign  Singapore  is  perhaps

comparable  to  the  7th  of  November   which   is

celebrated  in  the  U.S.S.R. to  mark  the  Great

October Revolution. This has nothing at all  to  do

with Islam, Christianity and all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



the  other  religions  which exist  in  the  Soviet

Union.  Yet in that country and in other  countries

with  similar  national days,  the  celebration  of

Independence  Day  or National Day,  whichever  you

call it, has meant much more to the people over the

years  than  just  the  purely religious  festivals

celebrated  by  certain sections of the  people.  I

hope  in  the  years ahead, as we  slowly  grow  to

understand   the   meaning  and   significance   of

independence,  the meaning of being  free  to  rule

ourselves,  National Day will  be  celebrated  with

greater feeling and significance by people  of  all

races in this country.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that Singapore is a multi-racial society and therefore in the provision of

public  holidays  we give equal  treatment  to  all

racial and religious groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise one point. I wonder whether

the Minister will consider the addition of one more

holiday to the Schedule to the Bill so as to enable

women  folk  to  celebrate  a  common  holiday.   I

recollect  that  the proposal for a public  holiday

for  women  was  raised in 1957. At that  time  the

People's  Action  Party was not in  power.  It  was

during  the  Lim  Yew Hock Administration  and  the

colonial  era  that we proposed Women's  Day  as  a

public  holiday.  But  we  have  not  achieved  our

purpose.   The   introduction   of   the   Holidays

(Amendment) Bill provides an opportunity. We should

consider  the  inclusion of a Women's  Day  in  the

Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe you will agree, Mr Speaker, that in

the course of Singapore's history from the colonial

era  through  the self-government stage  to  today,

when  we  are  independent, women have  contributed

much   towards  Singapore's  history.  There   are,

however,  still many women who are trapped  in  the

coils  of family life. While men are able to  enjoy

holidays  almost  all  the year  round,  women  are

confined to the kitchen. Women's Day can be  a  day

when women will be able to enjoy their freedom  and

equality with men. The inclusion of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



Women's Day is, therefore, proper and necessary.  I

hope the Minister will consider my proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  feel  that  the Holidays (Amendment)  Bill

introduced  by  the Minister for Law  and  National

Development  is  just  and fair  to  all  sectional

interests  or  groups.  The Member  for  Delta  has

suggested  the  inclusion  of  another  holiday   - Women's  Day  - saying  that women  are  in  a  less

advantageous position. They are really looking down

upon  themselves. If that is agreed,  we  can  also

suggest a Men's Day.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I remember that in 1957 when the women members

of the People's Action Party raised this suggestion

for   a  Women's  Day,  the  Member  for  Sembawang

supported it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  feel  that what the Member for  Delta  has

proposed  is not quite proper, because  today  both

men   and  women  have  equal  rights.  Both   have

contributed towards nation building. Therefore,  we

must  not  claim  special rights or privileges  for

either women or men. I feel that the proposition by

the  Member  for  Delta is not appropriate  at  the

present  juncture. I suggest that  if  there  is  a

Women's Day, there should also be a Men's Day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Member for Delta has said that there should  be

a day set aside to enable the women of Singapore to

take  time  off  their kitchens. I support  this  a

hundred  per  cent. There are 58  Members  in  this

House  but there is only one woman Member. What  is

the  reason  for this great disparity  in  numbers?

This  is because there is no Women's Day for  women

and  they cannot come out of their kitchen to serve

the  nation. There must be a Women's Day so  as  to

encourage  women  to take part in national  affairs

and  so  that there will be more women  Members  of

Parliament. I fully support the proposition by  the

Member for Delta.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank the five Members who rose to speak in support

of  the Bill. I am sure the other Members who  have

not  spoken would have spoken to support  the  Bill

had we not been running out of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, it is easy to add on holidays - whether it be Thaipusam, Women's Day or Men's Day -

because that pleases everybody. But the moment  you

cut down on holidays, then people get sad. It is my

unpleasant duty tonight - in fact, one of  my  most

unpleasant duties in Parliament today - to move  the

passage  of this Bill. As you can see, Mr Speaker,

Sir,   you   yourself   called  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Social  Affairs,

thinking  that  the Holidays Bill  was  within  the

portfolio of the Ministry of Social Affairs. I  can

assure this House that the subject of holidays does

not  come  within the portfolio of the Ministry  of

Law.  Neither  does it come under the  Ministry  of

National  Development. But somehow I am here  today

moving  something which has got nothing to do  with

any  of  my Ministries. But as I said just now,  if

you take something away, people get sad. If they do

not  get up and support the Bill, we can understand

it. The Member for Anson wants me to reconsider and

make  Thaipusam a public holiday. Like  the  Member

himself, I myself would prefer Thaipusam  to  be  a

holiday! Like the Member for Delta, I myself  would

like a women's holiday!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about a Children's Day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But in spite of the Women's Charter,

the  Member  for Delta is still not  satisfied.  In

this respect, we in Singapore give consideration to

women  every day. In fact, every day is  a  women's

holiday.  So  I  really  do  not  understand   this

request.  But she has support from the  Member  for

Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, suffice it to say that like

other  Members of the House, I myself would  prefer

more  and  more  holidays. But  as  I  pointed  out

earlier in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



my   opening   speech,  in  view  of  the   British

unemployment or economic problems following in  its

wake  - this is one of the measures we are taking  to

ask our people to work harder - which means you, me

and  everybody else. I ask Members to bear with me.

If  our  island prospers, I am sure the  Government

will  ask me to come :back here and on that day  it

will  be my pleasure to move amendments to increase

the  number of holidays. But let us first show that

we can work hard and that we deserve more holidays.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the President's Speech at the

opening  of  Parliament, it was stated that  public

health  legislation  is being consolidated  into  a

comprehensive Environmental Health Code, capable of

maintaining the highest standards of public  health

required  in  a modern complex urban society.  This

Bill before the House is the first of such codified

new  laws  which will be introduced to bring  about

effective control over public health. In this case,

it    covers   disease-bearing   insect    vectors,

principally mosquitoes and flies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill replaces the 50-year old Destruction of

Mosquitoes  Ordinance (Cap. 139) which  was  mainly

for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



control  of malaria by measures specifically  aimed

against   malarial  mosquitoes.  The  control   and

destruction   of   what  are  commonly   known   as

"nuisance" mosquitoes has become a major problem in

recent   years.  The  laws,  however,   have   been

inadequate to cope with the health problems created

by  these "nuisance" mosquitoes, such as the  Aedes

and  Culex mosquitoes which are now established  to

be  capable of transmitting diseases.  Similarly,

the  laws are also found to be inadequate  to  deal

with  health  problems created  by  disease-bearing

insect vectors, like flies, fleas, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which breeds in

artificial water-bearing receptacles, is the vector

responsible  for  the transmission of  haemorrhagic

fever, dengue fever and yellow fever. There is also

the  danger  of  bancroftian  filariasis  which  is

transmitted  by  Culex fatigans, a  mosquito  which

breeds   in  polluted  stagnant  water  in  blocked

drains.  The common house-fly is a carrier of  food

and  water-borne  diseases of the gastro-intestinal

tract,  namely,  cholera, typhoid, food  poisoning,

enteritis in children and poliomyelitis The flea is

a   parasite  which  lives  on  the  rat   and   is

responsible for rodent plague, a disease which  has

shown  recrudescence in some countries in Southeast

Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints of mosquito nuisances have remained

consistently high over the last ten years.  Factors

such  as  the  efficiency of the Health  Ministry's

work  force and the quality of the supervision  and

discipline are important but not enough to effect a

reduction   or  elimination  of  these   nuisances.

Effective action against all the creators of  these

nuisances  is  not  possible  under  the   existing

Destruction  of Mosquitoes Ordinance or  the  Local

Government  Integration Ordinance  because  of  its

limited  provisions aimed essentially, despite  its

title,  at malarial control. The rapid urbanisation

and  other physical development in Singapore in the

form  of vast building schemes and land reclamation

have  led to the indiscriminate dumping and storage

of building materials and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



blocking of natural drainage. As a result of  these

activities,  ideal  conditions  are  created  under

which  disease-bearing  insects  can  harbour   and

propagate,  unless  the necessary  precautions  are

taken  by  those responsible for these  activities.

The  high incidence of haemorrhagic fever with  815

cases,  including  21 deaths, in  1967  reflects  a

serious  health hazard which makes  it  vital  that

there  be  effective  urban control  of  mosquitoes

which   can   no  longer  be  regarded  merely   as

nuisances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolution of Singapore as the fourth largest

port in the world and the increasing air traffic at

our   Paya  Lebar  International  Airport   require

adequate provision to deal with the disease-bearing

insects likely to be brought into the country  from

ships  and  ocean-going vessels and from  aircraft.

Singapore is a "yellow fever receptive area", which

means  that  conditions  exist  under  which   this

disease   can  be  introduced  into  the   country.

Effective powers to deal with aircraft and to carry

out  disinsectisation when indicated are  therefore

necessary.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the seriousness of the mosquito

and  other insect vector problems, as well  as  the

recognition of the fact that much of this  is  man-made,  new  powers  and methods to  cope  with  the

situation are needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These insects cannot be allowed to proliferate

unchecked as they will constitute a serious  danger

to  public health. Effective legislation, based  on

modern   scientific  methods  of  eliminating   and

controlling  these  insect  vectors,  need  to   be

enacted to cope with this growing problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In framing this new piece of legislation, the

opportunity   has  been  taken   to   enhance   the

preventive and control measures and its enforcement

by   providing  for  more  effective   action   and

deterrent penalties. Powers for summary action  and

for  composition of the lesser offences  have  been

included in this Bill. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



emphasis  is on preventing the creation of  harmful

conditions  rather than allowing the conditions  to

occur and then taking remedial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also aims to recognise the changes in

the  administrative structure since the integration

of  local  authorities by adopting  the  styles  of

titles  and  form consistent with the  present  and

proposed  administrative  organisation  of   public

health services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main features of the Bill are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It retains the basic provisions in the old Ordinance that are required for the control of malaria - transmitting mosquitoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It streamlines the administrative lines consequent on the integration of the local authorities; defines the functions and powers to be exercised at different levels - the Minister, the Director of Medical Services, the Commissioner of Public Health and/or the Medical Officer of Health and the Public Health Auxiliary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It broadens the powers to take action to

cover  all disease-bearing insects and vests

new   powers  for  summary  action,  medical

examination   of  infected  persons,   blood

examination and insecticide spraying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) It provides powers to obtain information

necessary for epidemiological investigations

and control measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Ships and aircraft are for the first time

brought  within the scope of this  Bill,  as

they  are now regarded as a potential source

of  introduction of new vectors of  diseases

from some other territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinction is made between the overall policy

direction   and  the  routine  implementation   and

execution of the various provisions in the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides that the Director of Medical

Services shall have general superintendence of  all

matters  relating  to  this Bill,  subject  to  the

general or special directions of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of administering the Bill will be

largely in the hands of the Commissioner of  Public

Health  and/or  Medical  Officers  of  Health   (as

defined),  who are to be assisted by Public  Health

Auxiliaries. The Commissioner of Public Health  and

such  number of Deputy Commissioners and  Assistant

Commissioners of Public Health shall under clause 4

be  appointed  by the President. The  Minister  may

also,   by  clause  3,  invest  any  other  medical

practitioner in the service of the Government  with

all  or  any of the powers conferred on  a  Medical

Officer of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that the Commissioner, or the

Medical  Officer  of  Health, or  a  Public  Health

Auxiliary  may  enter and examine any  premises  or

vessel  between  the  hours of  6  o'clock  in  the

morning  and 6 o'clock in the evening to  ascertain

whether such premises or vessel or anything therein

is  in a condition favourable to the propagation or

harbouring  of disease-bearing insects and  further

to  carry out, if necessary, the spraying  of  such

premises  or  vessel with insecticide. The  Medical

Officer  of  Health may, in addition,  examine  any

person  from  such premises or vessel to  ascertain

whether  such  person is suffering  from  or  is  a

carrier of any insect-borne disease. If so,  he  is

empowered  to  treat medically such  person  or  to

cause a post-mortem examination to be performed  on

any  corpse  found in such premises or vessel.  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, this power is absolutely neces

sary since we know that it is quite a fashion among

some  youths in this country to grow long hair that

may  harbour  the flea that may carry  the  plague.

Where it is expedient for inspection of premises to

be  made  after the prescribed hours, at  least  24

hours' prior notice shall be given to the occupiers

thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 prohibits any person from taking, doing

or  performing  any act or thing which  may  or  is

liable to create



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



conditions   favourable  to  the  propagation   and

harbouring of disease-bearing insects. Every person

shall comply with all such reasonable directions as

may  he  given  by  the  Commissioner,  or  Medical

Officer of Health or a Public Health Auxiliary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 prohibits the breeding, collecting,

distributing, importing or exporting of any disease-bearing   insects   without  the  express   written

permission  of the Commissioner or Medical  Officer

of  Health. Such permission may be granted  at  the

discretion  of the Commissioner or Medical  Officer

of  Health, if he is satisfied that the application

is  made for the purposes of science, education  or

research and shall be subject to such conditions as

the  Commissioner or Medical Officer of Health  may

deem fit to impose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who undertakes or carries out any

operation likely to create conditions which may  be

favourable  to  the propagation  or  harbouring  of

disease-bearing  insects  must   have   his   plans

approved under clause 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 specifies the powers of the Commissioner

or Medical Officer of Health to direct any owner or

occupier  of  premises to carry out  specified  mea

sures   with  regard  to  the  premises   for   the

treatment,  destruction  or  removal  of   anything

therein   as  may  bring  them  into  a   condition

unfavourable  to the propagation or  harbourage  of

disease-bearing  insects. If the  circumstances  so

warrant,  discretionary  power  is  given  to  tile

Commissioner  or the Medical Officer of  Health  to

execute  the necessary measures himself. The  costs

and  expenses  will, of course, be charged  to  the

owner  or occupier, as the case may be. This is  an

important  power  that  gives  tile  authorities  a

speedy  means  to  bring about the destruction  and

removal of conditions favourable to the propagation

and   harbouring  of  disease-bearing  insects  and

charge  the occupiers or owners for the  costs  and

expenses incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearing of undergrowth under certain

conditions without the previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



sanction of the Commissioner or Medical Officer  of

Health is prohibited under clause 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 sets out the general measures which may

be taken by the Commissioner or the Medical Officer

of  Health, or the Public Health Auxiliary with the

consent of the occupier of any premises to whom due

notice has been given. The newer method of spraying

premises  or vessels with residual insecticides  is

provided for in clause 13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to examine medically any person who is

infected  or  suspected of being infected  with  an

insect-borne disease is provided for in clause  12.

Epidemiological   investigations  of   insect-borne

diseases  will  be facilitated by clause  14  which

enables  the Commissioner or a Medical  Officer  of

Health to demand relevant information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for enforcement and service of

orders  under the Bill is dealt with in clauses  15

and  16 respectively. Any owner or occupier who  is

dissatisfied with any of the measures specified  in

the  notice  may,  by  clause  17,  appeal  to  the

Minister within 14 days of the date of such order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 places the responsibility on the owner

or  occupier  of premises to look after  any  works

which have been executed by the Government with the

object  of  preventing  the  breeding  of  disease-bearing insects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 21, 22 and 23 provide penalties for

offences  under the Bill, while clause 24  provides

for police assistance where needed. These penalties

have been enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to deal with offenders more

expeditious1y,  clause  25  gives  power   to   the

Commissioner  or any public officer  authorised  in

writing on that behalf by the Minister, to compound

any offence committed under clauses 6, 7, 8, 10 and

13  by accepting from a person reasonably suspected

of having committed such offence a sum of money not

exceeding $500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 repeats the previous provision in the

Destruction  of  Mosquitoes Ordinance,  making  the

Bill applicable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



to all property, including that of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will provide the legal foundation to

enable  more  effective control of  disease-bearing

insects,  so  that we shall be able to prevent  the

creation  of  foci of infections,  the  wastage  of

manpower   through  ill  health  and  the  needless

expenditure  of  large amounts f  public  money  to

correct many situations which need not have  arisen

in  the  first place. A new outlook is called  for.

The   Environmental   Health   Services   must   be

considered on a broad and integrated basis with the

emphasis  placed  on  preventive  rather  than   on

remedial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I understand it, the main purpose

of  the Bill is to destroy harmful insects so as to

safeguard  the health of our people and  thus  make

Singapore  the cleanest city in Asia. I  think  the

introduction   of  this  Bill  has   a   particular

significance to the Minister for Health. Only a few

days  after he took over the reins of office, there

occurred several cases of cholera in Singapore.  Of

course, according to investigations made later,  it

was  discovered that the disease was  brought  into

Singapore from outside. In any case, the occurrence

of  this  disease indicated that, on the one  hand,

the health of the public was endangered and, on the

other,  it  posed  a challenge  to  our  young  and

energetic  Minister for Health to show  whether  he

had the ability to deal with this matter.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.57 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result showed that our young and energetic

Minister  for Health had the capacity to deal  with

this  matter, although he is suffering from a  cold

today! When the cases of cholera came



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



to   light,  he  immediately  launched  a   counter

offensive by implementing new health regulations. A

nation-wide health campaign was launched. With  the

full   co-operation  of  all  the  people  of  this

country,  we have officially declared  war  on  all

harmful  insects. We are determined to  exterminate

them entirely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "disease-bearing insect" in

this  Bill  is  very  extensive.  In  addition   to

mosquitoes  and flies, it also includes  the  eggs,

larvae and pupae of such insects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is quite meticulous and thorough. Its

aim is to eradicate all sources of harmful insects.

No  doubt this is praiseworthy. But the question is

whether  its aims can be achieved. This depends  on

whether  the  department charged with the  carrying

out of this work can do its work efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect is the co-operation of

the general masses. It is only when they understand

the  importance of maintaining hygienic  conditions

anti comply with health regulations - that is, by not

throwing  rubbish on to open spaces  and  into  the

drains  - that we can effectively maintain  a  high

level  of  public  health. Towards  this  end,  the

Ministry of Health has decided to launch a  nation-wide  health campaign in October. This  is  a  very

appropriate measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the most pressing problem

is how to destroy mosquitoes and flies. As we know,

the  reason for the breeding and multiplication  of

mosquitoes  and flies is the existence of  stagnant

water  and  the  choking of drains. There  are  two

factors  which  have brought about this  situation.

First,  the  inefficiency of the  Public  Cleansing

Department. Second, the indiscriminate throwing  of

litter by some people. If this is so, we must apply

allopathic treatment to hit the nail on  its  head.

First,  we  must  remedy the  inefficiency  in  the

Public  Cleansing Department. It must maintain  its

work  of  steadily  and  efficiently  clearing  the

drains. Second, we must educate our people to abide

by  the  health regulations and instil  in  them  a

sense of civic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



consciousness.  And  all  this  with  a   view   to

impressing   the   tourists,  because   the   first

impression of the tourists is the health  condition

of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to hawkers, they must be persuaded to

clear  their  own rubbish after their  business  is

over.   In  this  respect,  we  hope  the  hawkers'

organisations will come forward and persuade  their

members to comply with the health regulations. This

will very soon make Singapore the cleanest and most

beautiful garden city in Southeast Asia in the true

sense  of  the word. In this way, we  will  have  a

better reputation in the world. Sir, I support  the

Bill.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in rising

in support of this Bill I have two queries to make.

(1)  How is the Ministry going to destroy fleas  by

not destroying rats? (2) Why is it that cockroaches

are not included in the Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has rightly pointed out,

fleas, if infected, can cause plague and I can  see

no  way  of  getting  rid  of  fleas  by  means  of

insecticides unless rats are destroyed at the  same

time.  I was hoping that the Minister was going  to

tell  us  of  a  "get  rid  of  rats  campaign"  in

Singapore. I hope he will do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards cockroaches, they are, as everyone

knows,  scavengers among the insect world  and  may

easily be disease-bearing insects. I understand  in

certain  medical  quarters,  cockroaches  might  be

considered  to  be  carriers  of  viral  hepatitis.

Everyone  knows  that viral hepatitis  is  quite  a

fatal disease. I gather from the Ministry of Health

statistics  that there were 700 cases of  hepatitis

last  year  of  which 47 were  fatal.  I  hope  the

Minister will find ways and means of telling us how

he is going to destroy cockroaches in Singapore.



<br><br>7.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, while I welcome the purport of

this  Bill,  I must express my uneasiness  at  what

appears to be and could be an unbridled enthusiasm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



with  which  the  provisions of this  Bill  may  be

implemented  by the officials of the Ministry  once

it  becomes law. I note that this is a Bill  of  29

clauses.  One-third or nine of the  provisions  are

penal.  In  the  nine  penal clauses  which  impose

various penalties for various offences, one  clause

-  clause  6  - does not specifically describe  the

offence  for which a penalty is imposed.  There  is

another  clause which encroaches upon the universal

rule  that a person's body is inviolate and  should

not  be  medically  examined unless  he  gives  his

permission.   There  is  also  one   clause   which

disallows compensation for expenses incurred  by  a

person for damages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, therefore, that the rigour expressed in

this Bill does not herald other Bills that will  be

issuing  forth  from the Ministry of Health,  since

the Minister himself has said recently that this is

only the beginning.



<br><br>7.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

comment  briefly in strong support  of  this  Bill.

There  seems  to be too many beelzebubs,  lords  of

flies  and  insects, who, with impunity,  encourage

the  breeding  of  insects by  their  irresponsible

actions.   I  am  personally  acquainted   with   a

situation  in  which  river  dredgings  have   been

decanted on to a vacant piece of land with all  the

consequent effects on the health of the people  who

live  in  the  vicinity  - dredgings  which  contain

receptacles, rotten logs, broken pails and so on. I

hope,  Sir, once this Bill becomes law, it will  be

implemented most promptly and with great vigour. In

this,  I  beg  to differ from the hon.  Member  for

Serangoon Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Sembawang who says

that the composition of this Bill is most thorough.

There  is even a clause which states that if  there

is  any  quaint person who wishes to  breed,  keep,

collect,  distribute, sell, import  or  export  any

disease-bearing  insects,  all  he  needs  is   the

permission  in  writing of the  Commissioner  or  a

Medical Officer of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise in support of this Bill and  all  the

effective   measures  to  destroy   disease-bearing

insects  in  order  to  improve  the  environmental

health  of Singapore. We should not deal with  this

matter only on paper. We should also take effective

action at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we were told of an anti-mosquito

campaign.  But  until  today,  we  have  not  heard

anything further. There has been no vigorous action

in  this  direction. The result is that  mosquitoes

breed  everywhere in Singapore. Flies can  be  seen

all  over  the  city.  We can  even  see  flies  in

Parliament  House.  All  this  is  because  of  two

factors.  The  first  is the  inefficiency  of  the

public  cleansing workers. I have  been  told  that

there  will  be  a thorough reorganisation  of  the

Cleansing  Department.  I  feel  that  the  present

reorganisation has not been effective.  There  must

be  a  thorough reorganisation so that  the  Public

Cleansing Department will be efficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is the behaviour of the public.

These  two  factors, in my view, must be considered

together.  The  officers of  the  Public  Cleansing

Department must necessarily make an overall  review

of  their  own position. In respect of the  public,

the  Ministry  of  Health has recently  taken  some

action  to  inculcate  in them  the  importance  of

health.  In  this respect, I have a  suggestion  to

make.  In launching educational campaigns, such  as

the  campaign to be launched in October this  year,

action   should  be  taken  to  rally   all   civic

organisations  and  form an  anti  harmful  insects

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, last month there was a seminar

conducted by the People's Association on  the  role

of  community centres and environmental health. The

main  theme  of the seminar was how  to  promote  a

healthy  environment.  The participants  were  from

various civic organisations and they were ready to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



co-operate   with   the   Government   to   improve

environmental health and to turn Singapore into the

most beautiful and cleanest city in Southeast Asia.

Therefore,  I suggest that the Ministry  of  Health

call a meeting of leaders of civic organisations to

discuss the question of improving the environmental

health of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there should be a competition

to  name  the cleanest streets in Singapore.  These

should  be given recognition and rewarded. In  this

way,   we  can  encourage  our  people  to  improve

environmental    health   more    positively    and

expeditiously. This is my humble suggestion.



<br><br>7.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of

all,  I wish to thank all the hon. Members who have

spoken giving ardent support for this Bill. I would

also  like  to make some general comments  on  what

they have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to deal with what the Member

for  Sembawang has stated. He says that the problem

of  mosquitoes and flies can only be tackled  by  a

two-pronged  attack  on  it.  Firstly,  the  public

health  workers must be a disciplined and efficient

force.  Secondly,  there must be co-operation  from

members  of the public. I could not agree with  him

more  because  I myself have stated in  this  House

that  that is the only way to solve this  very  big

problem in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the reorganisation of the public

health cleansing force, I wish to tell hon. Members

that   this   is   now  nearing   completion.   The

reorganised  set-up will be in force as  from  15th

August this year. Reorganisation started less  than

four  months  ago. But I assure hon.  Members  that

after  15th  August, there should be  some  results

because  the  reorganisation will  then  have  been

implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter about which I wish to inform

hon. Members is that with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



the passing of the Employment Bill yesterday, it is

now   possible  for  the  Ministry  of  Health   to

implement  another very important programme,  i.e.,

to  get  its public cleansing workers to  work  365

days  a  year,  including Sundays and  holidays.  I

assure  hon. Members that this will also  have  its

effect on the problem of flies and mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat has mentioned two

specific problems posed by rats and cockroaches.  I

would like to correct him by saying that although I

did  not specifically mention that cockroaches  are

also  included  in the Bill, the  Bill  covers  all

disease-bearing  insects. If  the  Member  for  Joo

Chiat  says  that  cockroaches are  disease-bearing

insects,  then by definition they must come  within

the purview of the Bill. He is a medical man and as

he has given an expert opinion, I will accept that.

Therefore, cockroaches are included in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as rats are concerned, I agree with him

that  we must first catch the rats in order to  get

at the fleas. It is not that the Ministry of Health

have  not in mind a rat-catching campaign, but they

must  first  deal with the disposal of rubbish.  We

will  launch this anti-litter campaign  in  October

and I assure hon. Members that as soon as we finish

with  that, we will go on to cockroaches, rats  and

so  on.  I am sure many hon. Members here  who  are

young  and energetic will certainly co-operate  and

support us physically in our rat-catching campaign.

I  also hope that the Member for Ulu Pandan, who is

past  55  years, will also support us in  the  rat-catching campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has said that

certain  provisions in the Bill, when  implemented,

might result in unbridled enthusiasm on the part of

my  Ministry's officials. I will be very  happy  if

that is the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta, on the other hand, has

expressed   some  misgivings  that  this  campaign,

although  announced, might not come off at  all.  I

assure her and other hon. Members that it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



be  conducted with vigour, and this time I hope  we

shall succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion by the Member for Delta

about  seeking  the aid of all civic organisations,

that  is  certainly what we have  in  mind  in  our

October   campaign.  We  will  be   seeking   their

participation and if they have a mass following, we

shall invite them to participate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has also another good

suggestion  - that we should hold a competition  to

name the cleanest streets in Singapore. But we have

an  even better suggestion. We shall not only  name

the  ten cleanest streets but also the ten dirtiest

streets  in Singapore, and woe betide hon.  Members

within  whose  constituencies  those  ten  dirtiest

streets might happen to be!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I say something about the provisions

on  compensation? It is stated in clause 19 of  the

Bill  that  no  compensation will be paid  for  any

expense  incurred or damage occasioned by  any  act

done  in  pursuance of the provisions of  the  Bill

unless  such damage has been occasioned maliciously

or  without  reasonable cause. In such  matters  as

control  of  mosquitoes, flies and  disease-bearing

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance (Chapter 55), resolves that the Schedule to the said Ordinance be amended by the addition under the headings of "Old Title or Name of Office" and "New Title or Name of Office" respectively of the following: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Principal Probation Officer. Chief Probation and Aftercare Officer".

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance

provides  for  the substitution of  new  titles  or

names of officers where there has been a change  of

departmental  title. Section  3  of  the  Ordinance

provides that Parliament may, by resolution, add to

or  amend the Schedule to the Ordinance. The change

of  title  from  "Principal Probation  Officer"  to

"Chief  Probation and After-care  Officer"  is  the

result  of the implementation of the recommendation

of  the  Prisons Inquiry Commission, 1960,  wherein

the   probation  service  of  the  Social   Welfare

Department was reconstituted with effect  from  1st

January,  1967,  as  the  Probation  and  Aftercare

Department  of the Ministry of Social Affairs.  The

change  of  title in the Schedule to the  Ordinance

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



enable  the  powers  and duties  of  the  Principal

Probation  Officer  in the Probation  of  Offenders

Ordinance,  1951  (No.  27  of  1951)   and   other

legislation to be exercised by the Chief  Probation

and Aftercare Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

(Chapter  55),  resolves that the Schedule  to  the

said Ordinance be amended by the addition under the
