<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the House will remember that immediately

before  the moment of interruption at our last sitting,

the  Member for the Southern Islands mentioned  to  the

House that whilst going through the Estimates (Health),

he noted that the provisions under the various items of

Personal  Emoluments (Establishment) had  been  reduced

and  he  wanted confirmation from the Ministry whether,

in  fact,  any  of  the salaries of the  posts  in  the

Ministry had been reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, all the P.E. items in the Ministry of

Health Estimates under Head 25, 26, 27 and 28 have been

carefully  scrutinised,  and  I  confirm  that  in   no

instance  has  the salary of any grade of officer  been

reduced.  Where any decrease in the provision  for  any

post  under P.E. has been reduced, this was due to  one

of  the  following  reasons. Where a  post  has  become

vacant  due to retirement, death or resignation  of  an

incumbent,  provision is made at  the  minimum  of  the

salary scale for the post. Secondly, where officers are

transferred - in  some cases, more senior  officers  have

been  promoted or transferred out of a department - they

have  been  replaced by more junior officers.  In  this

case,  the  provision is reduced. Only in one case - that

of  the religious sisters at the Mandalay Road Hospital

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- has the total provision for their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



salaries  been  reduced  because  they  used  to  enjoy

expatriate terms and they have been placed on terms and

conditions of service applicable to local officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will also remember that the Member for

Cairnhill wanted to know why the provision for  Matrons

(Grade  II) has been increased from $15,600 to  $18,000

at  the  Tan  Tock  Seng Hospital.  He  suggested  that

possibly they got a very big bump up in salary. That is

not so, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Who said that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In 1961, the post of Matron, Grade I, was

vacant and one of the Grade II Matrons was held against

that vacant Grade I post. In the provision for the  two

Grade II posts, the Treasury took that into account, so

that  in the case of the Grade II posts, provision  was

entered  at the minimum of the salary scale,  that  is,

$550  a  month for 12 months, which is $6,600  for  one

Grade II post and the full salary on the maximum of the

scale  i.e. $750 a month for the other Grade  II  post,

making  a  total  provision  of  $15,600-$9,000   plus

$6,600.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Estimates for this year, we are making

provision  for these two Grade II posts at the  maximum

of  the  salary scale for Matrons (Grade II), which  is

$750  per  month. Hence the entry for the provision  of

$18,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a question was also

asked why it was

that  the  provision for the salary  of  the  Grade  II

Matron at the Thomson Road Hospital remained at $7,800.

The  hon. Member wanted to know why this Matron did not

receive  any  increments in salary. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

that  post  has  always  been  vacant  and  when  these

Estimates were prepared, the post was entered at a mean

salary of $650 a month. The scale for Matron (Grade II)

is the scale of $550x25A-750. On the basis of this mean

salary, the provision entered was $7,800. It was $7,800

for 1961 and it is also $7,800 for 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have explained this to the satisfaction of

Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAIN ESTIMATES, 1962 (Cont.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 27 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on Public Health Division

commencing at page 276 of the Main Estimates. The

first amendment is at page 290. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (169) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the salary scale for three Technical Subordinates

(Timescale) was $3,580 for 1961, whereas it  is  $7,180

for  1962.  That is an increase of $100 per  month  for

each Technical Subordinate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the 1961 figure of $3,580, it places the

three  officers on the first segment of the  timescale,

whereas  the  1962  figure of $7,180 places  the  three

officers in the third segment of the timescale, thereby

skipping the second segment of the timescale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to explain why there is this

big jump.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> This is a matter of change of holders.

There  are 46 posts of Technical Subordinates. Two  are

super-scale  posts, six are Special  Grade  posts,  and

there  are  38  timescale posts of which 32  have  been

filled, with six vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year, when the provision was

entered  in  the  Estimates, it was in respect  of  the

probationary  segment. This year, it is  expected  that

more    senior   officers   will   be   filling   these

appointments. Therefore, the provision has been entered

for  two  posts in the third segment above  the  second

efficiency bar, and one in the probationary segment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that explains the difficulty of the Member for

Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister said that out of

three  posts, two are put on the third segment, whereas

according to the figures before us, all three posts are

put  on  the third segment. The Minister said that  the

third post is on the lowest one. It is not so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two posts will be at the

minimum  or  above  the minimum  salary  of  the  third

segment  and  one will be in the probationary  segment.

That is how it is done.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It still cannot be so. According to

the  figure,  all  three posts are  put  in  the  third

segment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Estimates Committee can look

into  it.  It  is  a question of arithmetic,  I  should

imagine.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If the Minister will look into this,

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have had this looked

into. I am quite satisfied and am sure that two of  the

posts are entered in the third segment, that is, either

at  $220  or  above. Evidently there are  two  officers

serving  in the Ministry drawing salaries of  $220  and

above.  There is also one vacancy amongst  these  three

posts, and for that vacancy the initial salary has been

provided. There is no doubt about all this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a question of arithmetic and that

can  be  looked  into privately. I  do  not  think  the

Assembly's time should be wasted.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But the Minister says he is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am absolutely right.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. As I say, it is a question of

arithmetic and perhaps the hon. Member could get  in  a

corner with the Minister and see whether the arithmetic

is correct.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, when one gets

into  a corner with a man who insists that he is right,

but I can prove that he is wrong -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I can prove that you are wrong.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Assembly's

time  should  be taken up with this matter.  It  is  a

matter of arithmetic. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I bow to your ruling and beg leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I now come to the officers of

the Ministry of Health. I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 27 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (174) of subhead 1.



<br><br>Sir,  the  next amendment [Amendment (3)]* is related. May I submit that it is convenient to move both at the

same time?

<hr size="2" noshade>

*Amendment (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (175) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is convenient.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Sir. Item (174) shows

two  newly created posts of Senior Registrar for 1962.

The  vote asked for is $26,400, that is to say, $1,100

a  month  for each Senior Registrar. This is  correct,

Sir, as $1,100 a month is the first step in the salary

scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, item (175) shows that there are 12 Health

Officers  for 1961, but that there are only 10  Health

Officers  for  1962. From this, I  take  it  that  the

missing  two  Health Officers are promoted  to  Senior

Registrars  -  item (174). Let us take the  votes  for

1961  and  1962. These show a difference  of  $37,590.

That is, roughly an increase of $3,000 per officer and

this  works out at $250 a month increase. Sir, as  far

as the two Senior Registrars are concerned (that is to

say,  the  two Health Officers promoted to  he  Senior

Registrars),  this  increase  of  $250  a   month   is

accounted for. But can the Minister please explain how

it is that all the remaining ten Health Officers based

on  the  figures before us are each going  to  get  an

increase  of  $250 a month, whereas according  to  the

salary scale the increase is only $35 a month?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (174) of subhead 1."



<br><br>The debate may range over item (175)*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be

reduced by $10 in respect of

item (175) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the matter is very

simply  explained  as  follows. There  are  57  Public

Health  medical officers, and 12 of them  are  in  the

School Health Section. Out of these 12 posts of School

Health  Officers,  it is proposed to  upgrade  two  of

these  posts to Senior Registrar level, the  other  10

posts remaining at timescale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason for this increase is

that  more  senior  officers with salaries  above  the

second  segment  of the timescale  have  come  to  the

School  Health Section, and more junior officers  have

been  posted out. That is why there is this  increase.

To  simple  minds, it appears rather  ridiculous  that

there  should be an increase of $37,000 when all  that

is  done  is to upgrade two posts to Senior  Registrar

level. In point of fact, there have been transfers out

of  the  School Health Section of more junior officers

and  the bringing in of more senior officers from  the

public  health  service, who are above the  efficiency

bar,  into the School Health Section. It is as  simple

as that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I assure the Minister that I

took  into  account the salaries to  be  paid  to  the

Senior Registrars? And in working it out, I still  get

a   $37,000  increase.  From  what  the  Minister  has

explained, there are some health officers who  are  on

the  higher  timescale, but according to  the  figures

here every officer is on the higher timescale.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No Mr Speaker, Sir. The provision is for

more senior officers. There are 57 medical officers in

the  public  health section, and more senior  officers

are going into the School Health Section, So there  is

an increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister says the

provision was entered in the Budget. So  it  would

appear  that these posts were not filled in  1961,

and  therefore he hopes, by increasing the  salary

scale, to have the posts filled. That is simple.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir,If the Member

studies  the  Estimates,  he  will  see  that  the

various  sections  of the public  health  division

have  been  completely  recast.  A  School  Health

Section  has  been provided in the  Estimates  and

senior  public health medical officers from  other

sections  are  being taken into the School  Health

Section where more senior men are needed. This  is

all rather tiresome.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister says this is

all  very tiresome. I am sorry to see him  getting

so  tired so early in this debate. In order not to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 27 be

reduced  by $10  in respect  of  item  (234)  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was no post of Assistant

Superintendent in 1961 and this is therefore a new

post for 1962. Mr Speaker, I bring up this matter

of  Markets  and Hawkers Division  because  it  is

expected that the position of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



hawkers  as obtaining at present could  be  looked

into.  I  do  not know what is the policy  of  the

Government as regards markets and hawkers in  this

city.  It seems that they are very much at  large,

without  any  proper regulations  being  enforced.

Most of them put up stalls along public roads  and

it  can  be said that they are a danger to  public

health and traffic, to the detriment of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we consider the hawkers provide a means

of livelihood for the people, nevertheless, a loss

is  caused  to some business sections,  especially

those  shops  that have to pay rents and  licences

according to law. With these hawkers at large - they

do   not   obey  any  regulations - some  of   the

shopkeepers  have had to close down because  their

business was overrun by these hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that the Government have no

definite  plan  to carry out in respect  of  these

hawkers. Probably they fear that the hawkers would

possibly  not  support  them.  This  problem,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  is  rampant  at  the  moment.  The

interests of the public should be looked into.  If

the  P.A.P.  Government were not in  power  today,

then  whichever government that replaces it  would

have  to  face this big problem. And it is  a  big

problem indeed, because of the lack of enforcement

of the regulations. Some

quarters  feel rather reluctant to bring  up  this

problem to the Assembly because they fear the  bad

effects that might come from the hawkers. I  would

like  to  get  the Government to view this  matter

with  grave concern, and it should be done in  the

interest of public health and for the good of  the

people of Singapore.

will  the  Government provide for next year?  We  know

that  in  the  rural areas more standpipes  should  be

provided for the people in view of the water shortage.

I  also  want  to  ask the Minister this:  during  the

course  of  the  water shortage  this  year,  did  the

Government provide enough water wagons for the people?

In  applying for a standpipe, can an Assemblyman apply

on  behalf of the people? Because in my constituency,

the   residents  in  places  like  Ang  Moh  Kio   and

Clemenceau  Avenue  have applied for  standpipes,  but

their  applications have been turned down.  I  do  not

know  whether the Minister concerned is aware of this;

but   what   are  the  reasons  for  rejecting   these

applications?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  filed this amendment because I want to  ask  the

Government  to  pay close attention to the  supply  of

water  to  the  Southern Islands,  particularly  Pulau

Brani, where the water supply today is insufficient as

it  is being looked after by the military authorities.

I  feel that Government can take steps to increase the

number of standpipes in the islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further problem is that the people who wish to

install pipes in their homes cannot do so because  the

water   supply   is   controlled   by   the   military

authorities. I hope the Government will co-operate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



with  the  military  authorities  to  facilitate   the

installation  of water pipes in homes. The  people  of

Pulau  Brani  and  Blakang  Mati  pay  rates  to   the

Government, and it is hoped that these facilities will

be made available to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first question I was

asked  is: could I indicate how many standpipes  would

be  constructed  in  the  course  of  next  year?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am in no position to state  what  the

number will be. But what I can tell this House is that

today in the city area there are 1,222 standpipes, and

in  the  rural  area there are 1,126 standpipes.  Free

water   is  supplied  to  all  these  standpipes.   In

addition,  free  water  is also supplied  to  mosques.

Indian temples, opium treatment centres and the  Kwong

Wai Shiu Hospital.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the installation of new standpipes

depends   on   the  consideration  of  requests   from

Assemblymen,  the  public and field  officers  in  the

various departments. These requests are submitted  for

the views of the relevant departments, principally the

Health and Water Department. The Land Office also come

into  this.  The  requests are all considered  by  the

Urban  and Rural Services Council. If any Member feels

that  a standpipe should be installed in his area,  he

should  write to the Chairman of the Urban  and  Rural

Services  Council, who is the Parliamentary  Secretary

to  the Deputy Prime Minister. His application will be

processed,  and  if the need generally  arises  for  a

standpipe,  then approval will be given by  the  Urban

and  Rural Services Council for the installation of  a

standpipe in his particular area. As far as the Member

for  the  Southern Islands is concerned, if  he  feels

that  there  is  a  need  to increase  the  number  of

standpipes at Pulau Brani, all that he has to do is to

bring  this  to the attention of the Urban  and  Rural

Services Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been a drop in the use of

water from public stand-pipes due to the rationing, and

if  I mention a few figures it should be of interest to

the House. For instance, Mr Speaker, Sir, the cost  of

water for the standpipes in the city area in April this

year  was  $92,338.46. In the period  of  rationing  in

October that cost was reduced to $55,309.63.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr

Speaker,  I believe the translation of the speech  made

by the Member for Serangoon Gardens just now says - while

he   was  requesting  the  Minister  to  put  up   more

standpipes - that  during  a period  of  water  shortage

there  should  be more standpipes. I do not  understand

the  logic of the argument. But what I want to ask  the

Minister  is  this.  He  mentioned  free  water   being

supplied  to mosques. Could he give some indication  as

to  the  number of mosques that are now being  supplied

with  free water? Would he also indicate the number  of

applications  from  mosques to his  Ministry  for  free

water?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the information I

have, 48 mosques are receiving a free water supply. The

there  for worship. But those who live on the  premises

have  to pay for their own water supply. I do not  know

the number of applications. I will check on them.

specified streets due to loss and wear and tear, making

a  total  of  750 carrier bins. Street  bins  are  also

required, Mr Speaker, Sir. An additional supply of ten

is  for the new market bin centre at Seng Poh Road, and

40  for replacements in markets. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

cost of 750 carrier bins, at $16.75 per bin at the 1960

contract  price,  will be $12,563; and  for  50  street

bins,  at $130 per bin (the City Workshop 1960 contract

price) will be $6,500, making a total of $19,063  which

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be reduced by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vote for 1961 was $90,000. This is the

correct  estimate  for  3 Legal Officers  at  $2,500  a

month.  But  for  1962, the amount asked  for  is  only

$60,000.   The   "Notes"  show   these   words,   "Part

Provision".  Do  we  or  do we  not  have  three  legal

officers?  If we do not have them, do we or do  we  not

want  them?  And herein lies the answer  to  the  "Part

Provision".  If we want three legal officers,  then  it

has  to  be full provision. If full provision for  1961

was  made, has there now been a change in the minds  of

the  Government  that they could not  get  three  legal

officers  and  that they could only get  two?  If  they

could  only  get two legal officers, then  they  should

provide  for two and not put in three and put in  "Part

Provision" for only two legal officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention is to

recruit  legal officers who have special qualifications

in  legal drafting, criminal law, prosecution and civil

work,  especially revenue cases, to assist in the  work

of  the State Advocate-General's Chambers and to  train

the young legal officers in service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts have been made to recruit in the United

Kingdom,  Australia  and Canada,  but  so  far  without

success. There have been a number of applications, both

locally  and  from  the United Kingdom  and  Australia.

These  were  considered by the Legal Service Commission

and  the  applicants  were found not  to  be  suitable.

Recently  Mr R. M. Berriman has been appointed  senior

legal adviser to advise on income tax law and practice.

His services have been made available under the Colombo

Plan  Technical Co-operation Scheme. But his allowances

will  be  paid  from the vote for legal  officers.  Mr

Berriman,  I  may inform the House, is  a  very  senior

officer in the Australian Income Tax Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts are being made, Mr Speaker, Sir, to recruit a

required   especially   for   the   drafting   of   the

constitutional  documents on merger. We  have  made  an

approach  to  Mr Hackling, who has had  experience  in

drafting work in the Federation. We expect to hear from

him soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third post, Mr Speaker, Sir, we also need

someone  who  is very experienced in criminal  work  to

give the Member for Anson a good run for his money.  We

have  tried very hard to get this officer.  But  up  to

date we have not been successful. However, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for next year, we are entering provision for just

two  posts of legal officer. Should we be able  to  get

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is about the Director of Legal Aid. I am not

going  to  talk about this particular post. I  am  just

going  to talk about the Legal Aid Bureau. Sir, I think

it  will not beget the confidence of the public if  the

Legal  Aid  Bureau is to be under the  control  of  the

State Advocate-General, because the Legal Aid Ordinance

does provide legal aid for people charged with offences

against  the  law.  The  State Advocate-General  is  in

unchallenged control of State prosecutions.  Therefore,

it would not help to bring about the confidence of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



the  public  in the Legal Aid Bureau if it is  also  to

come  under  his control. When the Legal Aid  Bill  was

moved  in  1955,  it  was considered  that  the  proper

Ministry to which the Bureau should be attached was the

Ministry  of  Labour  and  Welfare.  I  would  ask  the

Government  to  consider  transferring  the  Legal  Aid

Bureau  back  to  the  Ministry of Labour  under  which

Ministry comes social welfare.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite in agreement

with  what the Member for Cairnhill has said. That  was

the  reason  why the Legal Aid Bureau had  always  been

kept  in  the Ministry of Labour and has only  recently

been  placed  under the control of the State  Advocate-General's Chambers. Mr Speaker, Sir, for the  present,

legal  aid  is  not being extended to  criminal  cases.

Legal  aid is granted only in civil cases. Should there

be  representations from the public and should the  Bar

support  the extension of legal aid to criminal  cases,

then  I  agree the time would be opportune to take  the

Legal  Aid  Department out of the control of the  State

Advocate-General's Chambers. But for  the  present,  as

there are knotty legal problems that arise in the Legal

Aid  Department,  it  would be of  assistance  if  this

Department  is  kept  under the control  of  the  State

Advocate-General. But I do agree entirely with what the

Member for Cairnhill says. If legal aid facilities  are

extended to criminal cases, then it may be time for  us

to  take  it entirely out of the control of  the  State

Advocate-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Political Secretary item. Sir, when

something  falls out, honest men will come  into  their

own.  I  have not used the word "rogue" because I  know

the  Prime Minister is not a rogue. He is an honourable

man.  But,  Sir,  when the Political Secretary  in  the

Ministry of Finance fell out with the P.A.P. Government

in  July this year, what did the Prime Minister say  in

his  awful  disclosures broadcast over Radio Singapore?

He  said  that Mr Lim Ching Siong was a Communist  and

that  he  was  specially given the  post  of  Political

Secretary  in the Ministry of Finance because  in  that

particular  Ministry  he could do  no  harm.  In  other

words,  paying a Party comrade $1,100 a month  not  for

doing anything good for the public whose money is being

used to pay for this post, but for containing him in  a

Ministry where he could do no harm. Now, Sir,  the  cat

is out of the bag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what did the Minister for Finance say in this

House last year when this matter was raised by us?  Let

me  quote Hansard, Vol. 14, No. 4, dated 10th December,

1960, col. 374. The Minister for Finance said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not present in the House when

unkind  words  were  said about my  Personal  Secretary

(Political). Had I been here I would have rushed to the

defence  of  this bright young man. I  can  assure  the

Member for Farrer Park that he is very fitted for  this

post.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat the Minister's words - Mr Lim Ching Siong was

"very fitted for this post."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of the people of Singapore whose money is

being spent to pay for this post, I ask the Minister

for an explanation. Who was right? Was it the Minister

for Finance when he said that this bright young man was

very fitted for the post -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Of course, at that time.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - or the Prime Minister who said

that  this  bright  young man was a Communist  and  was

given  this  job  in the Ministry of Finance  where  he

could  do no harm? Whoever was wrong, it was the P.A.P.

Government that was wrong because there is such a thing

as collective responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us go back to last year's debate when the

Minister for Finance stood up bravely and defended  his

Political  Secretary,  I felt sorry  for  him  for  the

predicament into which he was forced. He had  to  stand

up  and  defend  his  Political  Secretary.  Therefore,

because  I  felt sorry for his predicament and  I  knew

that he did not mean what he said, I tried to give  him

an opening where he could retrieve his mistake. I said,

and I quote the same Hansard, cols. 378 and 379:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, when the Prime Minister was here yesterday, he

did  say, on the subject of Political Secretaries, that

regarding  things that are of a serious  and  important

character - since the Minister for Finance was not  here

yesterday - there are a lot of things that are best  left

unsaid;  and  if  he agrees [that is  to  say,  if  the

Minister  for Finance agrees] that there are a  lot  of

things that are best left unsaid, then I am prepared to

agree  with  him. There is no need to say, let  us  not

bring   this   subject  up,  because   it   is   rather

embarrassing  to him to have to defend something  which

he is not convinced he is prepared to defend.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave him that opening, Sir. But what did the

Minister for Finance say? He stood up and said at  col.

379:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am not at all embarrassed, Mr Speaker, Sir, but

utterly bored.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utterly bored indeed! And now I say to him that the

cat is out of the bag. Shame, shame!

occasion - the  words quoted by the Member for  Cairnhill,

namely, that my former Political Secretary was a  bright

young man - was a statement of fact. No one will deny  his

brightness and his ability. As for his fitness to  be  a

Political  Secretary, let me assure the House that  very

few people are more fit than him to fulfil the duties of

a  Political  Secretary. Unfortunately,  Sir,  on  basic

matters,  we  never did see eye to eye with this  bright

young man right from the beginning. It does not come  as

a  surprise  to the Member for Cairnhill. He knows  that

that  was the position. The whole of Singapore knew that

that  was  the position and, of course, the breach  must

come,  as  in due course and, in fact, it did  come.  If

there  is any defence necessary for the former incumbent

of  this  post,  I say perhaps the Backbenchers  on  the

Opposition  benches, the Backbenchers behind the  Member

for  Hong Lim, may be more qualified to put up a defence

now  than I am. I have absolutely no responsibility  for

his conduct now. It is therefore quite wrong to say that

the cat is now out of the bag. It is only so to innocent

people,  and I do not think the Member for Cairnhill  is

an  innocent spectator. He knows what has been going  on

all  the time - the trouble between the Communists and the

non-Communists in the P.A.P. - and the cat has been out of

the  bag a long time ago. The cat jumped out of the  bag

in  1955.  The Hock Lee rioters crashed the  Member  for

Cairnhill.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the cat is now out

of  the bag and the poor Alsatian dog is trying to chase

the  cat.  Sir, we tried our very best for the past  two

years  to  try  to bring to the notice of  the  arrogant

Government then the pitfall they were falling  into.  We

warned them about such a situation developing. They pooh-poohed the idea. What was worse, they came along and put

up  a  very bold front and defended a man who, it seems,

because he is no longer with them, has been described as

a Communist and a person who was put into a job where he

could  do  no  harm. Do we use public  funds  to  put  a

comrade into a job where he could do no harm or where he

could  do  at least some good for the money he  received

from the public.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Surely, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill  does  not  expect me to  denounce  my  former

Political  Secretary  before there  was  an  open  fight

between  us.  Surely  you do not expect  us  to  do  so?

[Interruption] I mean, you have to shoot a line now  and

then, but it was obvious at that time that a defence had

to be made and face had to be saved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the work that he did in my Ministry, I

have  said  that I did try to arrange an assignment  for

him  with  Seamen's  Registry Board  to  find  work  for

unemployed  seamen. We tried to improve the  working  of

that  particular section of the Government, it was quite

an   urgent  task  and  I  thought  the  then  Political

Secretary would be a good person. He knows the  workers.

He  may not specialise in seamen, but he certainly knows

the  general problems of workers and he could get useful

ideas  from  seamen as to how the Ordinance  could  best

serve their interests.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately my former Political Secretary thought I

was  setting  a  trap  for him and firmly  declined  the

offer,  after which, of course, nothing could  be  done.

Mind   you,   I   had  an  idea  of  giving   him   some

responsibility - rather tedious, of course, but  it  would

occupy his attention eight hours a day. Once a year, the

Auditor scrutinises the accounts of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



all   Government   departments  and   lists   out   the

misdemeanours  or inaccuracies or malpractices  in  the

accounting  procedures - a very long  list - mostly  over

small things, like lost stamps, stationery not properly

accounted  for, etc. He would then make recommendations

for improvements in these departments. I toyed with the

idea  of  asking my Political Secretary  to  look  into

this,  thereby  contributing to the efficiency  of  the

Government.  But  after he had refused point-blank  the

appointment of Chairman to the Seamen's Registry Board,

I  thought  it  rather pointless to  proceed  with  the

subject.  Sir,  I  can assure you that everything  that

could have been done or could have been thought of  was

done or was thought of, but if the result was so meagre

and  the  effort he put in did not justify the sums  of

money  paid  to  him, then I suggest that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  Backbenchers are the persons to  put  forward

the facts on behalf of their Secretary-General.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister  for  Finance  said  just  now  that  his

Political Secretary and his Party had never seen eye to

eye with each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Prime Minister was asked to explain the

necessity for a Political Secretary, he said  that  the

job  of  a  Political  Secretary  was  to  explain  the

policies  of the Government to the public. In  view  of

what  the Minister for Finance said, how did the  Prime

Minister accept a man who could not see eye to eye with

him  and how, since this person did not agree with  the

policies  of the Government, could he explain  them  to

the  public?  Why was he appointed in the first  place?

And  in the second place, when they discovered that  he

did  not  see  eye  to  eye with the  policies  of  the

Government, why did they not terminate the appointment?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, I had no intention of

good  friends - the Minister for Finance and  the  Member

for Cairnhill -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Since when were we good friends?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But since it is said that Mr Lim Ching

Siong was unwilling to carry out the duties assigned to

him  by  the Minister, I might as well say a few  words

here on the truth of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as Mr Lim Ching Siong was concerned as the

Political Secretary to the Minister for Finance, if  it

so  happened  that  he  was not seen  doing  a  lot  of

Ministry  of Finance work, it was largely  due  to  the

fact  that  he was not assigned duties which  would  be

carried  out  satisfactorily  by  him.  This   is   not

something  that  is  strange  to  the  P.A.P. type  of

thinking.  What they want is to use the services  of  a

man  so as to continue to get the support of the people

whose support they expect to get, but at the same  time

keep him at a safe distance so that he does no harm to

the  political  leadership of the Party.  But  I  think

insofar  as  the Political Secretary was concerned,  he

was  not  afraid of taking up the chairmanship  of  the

Seamen's  Registry  Board or of  taking  up  any  other

assignment for the reason that he was never  afraid  to

hold responsibility. But unfortunately, in the thinking

of  the P.A.P. Ministers, they always make sure that  a

person is given responsibility but that he is not given

the  responsibility to have a say in the policies  that

he  is  supposed  to execute. These are  two  different

things.  If you appoint so and so to carry out policies

in  regard  to seamen, you must give him the  right  to

have  a say in the formulation of those policies.  This

is  a  distinction that I want to make. I can say quite

safely  that  not  only  was this  the  case  with  the

Political  Secretary to the Minister for  Finance,  but

also with the Political Secretaries to the Minister for

Labour  and Law and the Minister for Health. Therefore,

Sir,  I  want to get this understood properly, that  if

Political Secretaries were paid $1,100 a month and they

were  not  doing the work deserving of such a sum,  the

blame should not be put on the Political Secretaries as

such  but  on the Government Frontbenchers  fairly  and

squarely.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

regarding the Political Secretary to the Minister for

Finance, the Minister for Finance brought out two

points. I would like to clarify the second point he

touched on. Regarding the checking of stores in the

various departments, I was directed by the Minister at

that time to discuss it with the Political Secretary.

The Minister was suspicious and I was directed to tell

the Political Secretary to check all the departmental

stores except those of the Police and the Civil

Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if a Minister is so suspicious of

his colleague's work, you can then expect the colleague

to adopt a similar attitude.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I might add a little, Sir. When the

job  of  Chairman  of the Seamen's Registry  Board  was

offered to Mr Lim Ching Siong, there were ulterior and

nefarious  motives behind it. The previous Chairman  of

the  Seamen's Registry Board was Mr G. H. Kiat and  he

was  chased  around. He was almost hammered because  he

could  not  cope with the job and the seamen wanted  to

make  somebody a scapegoat. The Minister thinking  that

this  was a tough job assigned it particularly  to  Mr

Lim Ching Siong hoping thereby that Mr Lim Ching Siong

would  become unpopular. The Minister, of course,  also

hoped  that the seamen would be as rough with  Mr  Lim

Ching Siong as they were with Mr G. H. Kiat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this really takes the cake - all

this  just  on suspicion without any proof  whatsoever.

The  Member  for Thomson said that it was not  fair  to

have  given this assignment to young Master Lim because

he would have been given the responsibility without any

authority to participate in decision making.  Sir,  how

does he know? The man never took on the job. If he  had

been  taken  on  the  job and had  found  that  he  had

inadequate powers, that he was not consulted  and  that

his  views  on  the  policies of  the  Government  were

ignored,  then  I  think there  would  have  been  some

justification for what the Member for Thomson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>



said. But that never took place. The Member for Thomson

was just expressing the suspicions which he felt and no

doubt   the   suspicions  which  my  former   Political

Secretary also felt. But if he thought that he would be

given  a  job  to  do but that he was not  to  be  consulted, that matter could have been raised with me. We

could  have come to an understanding. If I had in  fact

said,  "You are there in the position of a minion.  You

just  take  orders from me and do not tell me  what  to

do,"  then  I  say  he  would have  been  justified  in

refusing the assignment. But that never was the case. I

say  with  respect  that  the Member  for  Thomson  was

talking nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Queenstown said that it was a

tough  job.  I  agree that it was so and  therefore  we

selected  a tough man for a tough job. The Chairman  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis  thought  his  Secretary-General

could  not cope with a tough job. But I can assure  you

that  I have more confidence in the ability of Mr  Lim

to handle this job and I say that he could have done it

quite  satisfactorily. He might suspect that I may  set

booby traps - that is another matter. I did not say  that

he  refused the assignment because he suspected us.  He

refused it because he thought we were going to  do  him

in.  I have just got proof from a colleague of his that

that was the case. So how can we trust this fellow?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what the former Parliamentary Secretary said, I

cannot recall whether I asked him to discuss this  with

the  Political Secretary, but I did discuss the general

proposition with my Parliamentary Secretary and  I  did

say  that there were a few sensitive departments  which

the  Political Secretary could do well to avoid.  There

was  nothing wrong with that. Everybody knows that  Mr

Lim  is  a  great security risk. Why try to  bluff  and

pretend  that it is otherwise? He is not going anywhere

near  the  Police - civil defence is  unimportant  as  it

concerns   ladders,   buckets,   etc. - nor   the    Army

departments.

the Political Study Centre. But it is very curious,

Sir, that, on the one hand, we find the Prime Minister,

the Minister for Culture and other key personnel in the

P.A.P. Cabinet hitting out very strongly at poor

expatriates like Professor Enright, or an innocent

lawyer like Mr Booker. But when it comes to Mr G. G.

Thomson, they seem to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



a  very  soft spot for him. Sir,I venture  to  suggest

that  all that the P.A.P. Ministers want to exhibit - for

the  purposes  of  exhibition - is that  they  are  anti-colonial.   They   utter   very  strong   anti-colonial

sentiments against poor people like Professor  Enright.

I assure you, Sir, that Professor Enright -

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - can stand in the middle of Chinatown and

shout  his  head off commenting on the local  political

situation.  It  does not make one bit of difference  to

the political situation as such. But whereas the holder

of  this  post, the Head of the Political Study Centre,

is a man who is in a position to influence the thinking

of  a  very  important section of our  population - the

civil  service. It seems to me very odd that this  man,

whom the Prime Minister once described as an expatriate

and   who  wrote  the  speeches  of  the  former  Chief

Minister,  is made use of to impart political knowledge

to  the civil service. I do not know if it is true, but

there is a rumour round town that it may be that Mr G.

G. Thomson is in some way connected with the M15, It is

very difficult to prove this, but I only hope that  Mr

G. G. Thomson has not been spending his two years or so

in  the Political Study Centre training cadres for  the

M15.  If that is the case, then I am sorry to say  that

our  civil service will be worse off than it is at  the

moment. It appears that the Government wants to  retain

this man in the post. I hear he will be leaving at  the

end  of  this month - I do not know - but in any case,  the

fact   that   the  P.A.P. not  only  gave   him   this

responsibility but also defended him prove  one  simple

point,   and  that  is  that  basically  the  political

thinking  of Mr G. G. Thomson and that of  the  P.A.P.

Ministers  differ  very little. The  futility  of  such

thinking  is exhibited very clearly in the speeches  of

the P.A.P. Ministers. Sir, if not for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



the  influence of men like Mr G. G. Thomson, I do  not

think  the  Minister for Finance would talk  about  the

first round, the second round, the third round, and the

fourth round. I felt a little disturbed when I read  in

the papers that the Minister misquoted me terribly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, the papers misquoted me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> At that time I was not in the Chamber, Sir.

Perhaps  if the Straits Times misquoted him,  then  the

Minister would say so -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - quite clearly, and instruct the paper to

carry  a correction. But I want to assure the Minister,

Sir,  and to ease his discomfiture, that if we  had  to

knock them out -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think we ought to talk

about  knocking out anybody. We are talking  about  the

post  of Head of the Political Study Centre. I  do  not

think there are any knockouts there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not want to knock out the Minister for

Finance. I cannot knock him out because I am told  that

he  has learnt unarmed combat at public expense. I have

never had the money nor the time -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us carry on with this

Political Study Centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to point out that it is the

reflection  of the G. G. Thomson type of thinking  that

has  spelt the doom of the P.A.P. Government,  Sir.  We

are all agreed that it is necessary to have a Political

Study Centre where civil servants can be orientated  to

Asian  political thought and to the thinking  of  Asian

nationalists.  But  when  you  have  an  expatriate,  a

staunch  and  powerful expatriate who is,  as  I  said,

suspected  to  be an M15 agent, heading  the  Political

Study  Centre, then I can only say, Sir, that I do  not

wish to be a civil servant and attend such a course.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year the

P.A.P.  Government has been accused of teaching  P.A.P.

politics  in  the Political Study Centre. As  far  as  I

know,  they are still doing it. Of course,  it  is  not

such  blatant  lessons that are taught in school  where

you say, "You must do this. You must do that." No civil

servant has been told that you must join the P.A.P.  Of

course  not.  But  just to explain what  I  mean.  This

little   story  is  very  short  and  will   give   the

explanation better than a lot of words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read in a magazine that a little girl came home

from school and asked her mother, "Mummy, why don't  we

go  to Russia?" So the mother said, "Russia! What for?"

And  the  girl said. "The grass there is green.  People

are  happy, and food is plentiful." She was painting  a

very  colourful  picture  of Russia.  Then  the  mother

asked,  "Who  has  been  telling  you  all  this?"  She

replied,  "Teacher."  There  you  are,  Sir,  you   can

instigate  a  child to love Russia, to want  to  go  to

Russia,  to think well of Russia, without telling  her,

"Russia  is  good.  You tell mummy to  go  to  Russia."

Things  like that are supposed to be going  on  in  the

Political Study Centre. So to ease the public mind, may

I  ask the Government to tell us what are their aims in

running  the Political Study Centre? What do they  hope

to  achieve?  What  has been achieved?  What  is  being

taught  there?  Which  groups  of  civil  servants  are

eligible to attend? Is the syllabus today the  same  as

that   when   they  first  started  the   course?   Are

Assemblymen, if they wish, entitled to join the  course

and  sit  with the civil servants - not a special  course

for  us,  Sir,  but to sit with the civil  servants  at

their  course? I shall be obliged if the  Minister  for

Finance could tell us.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Opposition really cannot

have it both ways. One Member says that teachers having

attended the Political Study Centre tell their children

that  the  grass is green in Russia, everyone is  happy

and  why  not go there? If this were the fact,  then  I

expect   the   Barisan  Sosialis  would  be  completely

overjoyed and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



would  not  raise a word against Mr G. G. Thomson.  Far

from  requiring him to leave the post, they  might  even

suggest,  instead of deducting $10, to add  $10  to  the

vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that when the Member for Thomson

was more than hinting that Mr Thomson was an M15 agent,

he  was  steering pretty close to libellous slander,  and

that  if he were to repeat such a statement outside this

Chamber, perhaps he might take his chances. Be  that  as

it may, I would first like to give a few facts about the

Centre,  the  sort  of  details  that  the  Member   for

Mountbatten asked for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First: who goes there? The answer is the civil

servants.  We started the course nearly two  years  ago.

For the first 18 months or so we required all Division I

officers, except those in purely technical jobs such  as

doctors,  engineers, and people who have nothing  to  do

with  policy making, to attend this course.  As  regards

the syllabus, the main outline of it was drawn up by the

Minister for Culture, and the details were filled in  by

the  Director  and  myself,  in  consultation  with  the

Minister.  I  think the Minister for Culture  is  better

qualified  than  I am to describe the  contents  of  the

course. The course itself lasts some two to three weeks.

Civil servants go there every afternoon for a period  of

about  two  to  three  weeks. That  is  for  Division  I

officers. When nearly all of them had gone through  this

course,  we  started  with Division  II  officers,  i.e.

Executive  Officers, certain types of  teachers  and,  I

think,  principals  went there: also police  inspectors,

and so on. For them the Study Centre organised a briefer

course  of about, I think, ten days. I forgot the actual

period,  but  it was about ten days. It  was  a  simpler

course,  although it contained all the elements  of  the

main course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I will leave it to the Minister for Culture

to  give an account of the syllabus and contents of  the

course.  But  perhaps I may say a  few  words  why  this

course  is  necessary and what we  hope  to  achieve  by

establishing it and running it for the civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>



servants. First, Sir, what the course does not  want  to

achieve.  It is not designed to tell the civil  servants

or  to convince them of the P.A.P. point of view. It  is

not  even  set  up to convince the civil  servants  that

socialism  is  a good thing, because the  civil  service

must be neutral and it is not for the Party in power  to

tell  the  civil  service  that  they  must  accept  one

political  philosophy, be it socialism or  Communism  or

liberalism or any other ism.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not our responsibility. No political

leadership  would  be right in propagating  a  political

party  philosophy  to the civil service.  The  Political

Study Centre never did that. This, of course, has caused

some unhappiness among the Barisan Sosialis Members, and

even among others, because they say, well, there is  the

Government  Political  Study  Centre.  They  must   tell

everyone  in the civil service what a socialist  society

is  and  what they have to do to bring it about.  If  we

were  to  do  that,  then I say we  would  fail  in  our

objective. When we come to senior civil servants, we are

not  talking  to duffers. All of them have gone  through

the  discipline of a university or higher education  and

they  are  not going to say, "Yes. You tell me.  I  must

believe   it.  Therefore,  I  believe  it."   They   can

distinguish between an honest attempt to explain to them

the  political  history of the Asian  revolution  and  a

dishonest  attempt  to force on them a  party  political

philosophy.  Therefore, if the proposition is  that  the

Political  Study  Centre should tell the  civil  service

things  that  they  have  never  learnt  by  experience,

because as civil servants they have led a sheltered  and

isolated way of life, then it is necessary to tell  them

the  struggle that goes on outside the civil service -

the  great  revolution  for  national  freedom  that  is

surging through Asia since World War I. That surely  can

be  told  in dispassionate historical terms.  There  are

books about it, books written by persons of all types of

political  persuasion. Then more recently, we  have  our

own experience in Singapore and Malaya. The struggle  of

the Malayan Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



Party since 1945 to achieve political dominance in this

country; the history of the armed insurrection in 1948.

These  facts  again are known from newspaper  articles,

from men on the spot. Here again it is just a matter of

getting  the person who has the training and background

for  political  analysis, a person who has  discipline,

say,  in  certain lines of academic pursuit. More  than

that  I  say the Political Study Centre is not required

to do. It is not the business of the Centre to turn out

great  anti-colonial patriots. That is not the business

of  the  Political  Study Centre.  We  tell  the  civil

servants,  "Look,  there is a revolution  going  on  in

Asia. We are having the effect of the backwash of  this

revolution, Trace the history of this Asian  revolution

from the 19th century onwards." Strange as it may seem,

until  barely  two years ago, the general  run  of  the

English-educated,  both inside and  outside  the  civil

service,  were  quite unaware of these things,  because

their   attitude   was  that  politics   is   something

dangerous; it is better not to dabble or indulge in it -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Would

the  Minister  hurry up a bit because he  seems  to  be

filibustering?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister is

perfectly entitled to say what he is saying. I  do  not

think he has reached the stage of filibustering. He  is

answering   a  simple  question  by  the   Member   for

Mountbatten.  He  is endeavouring  to  answer  it.  Mr

Minister, please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if I may be permitted a few

moments to recollect my thoughts. The English-educated,

until about two years ago, both inside and outside  the

civil service, were unaware of these events. They  knew

that  something  was  taking place.  They  were  rather

disturbed about it. Many were really alarmed. Some  had

views and theories about how it happened and how it was

going to work out. But there was never any occasion for

them to make a serious study of these problems, to read

books,  to  listen to lectures and to hold  discussions

amongst themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



This  was  the  main  purpose of  the  Political  Study

Centre. It was a Centre run by civil servants for civil

servants with the purpose of bringing home to them some

of  the  major political problems of the  day.  But  in

order   to  equip  them  to  understand  the  immediate

problems facing the country, it was necessary  to  give

them  this back-ground of history regarding this whole

business  as  a long historical process  which  is  now

taking  firm shape in the independent nations  in  Asia

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Members want further details of the contents

of  the course. My colleague, the Minister for Culture,

would be only too happy to oblige.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are two issues on this subject. The first is the holder

of  the  post of Mr G. G. Thomson: the second concerns

the  question of the Political Study Centre itself.  On

the  first issue, on Mr Thomson, I think this  subject

has been discussed and fought many times in the Central

Committee of the P.A.P. from August 1959 until now.  We

were glad to hear what the Member for Thomson said just

now,  that Mr Thomson is sailing back to his  homeland

next month. If the Minister can give us a guarantee and

an  assurance, we will not hammer him on that issue. We

know  what  Mr  Thomson is. It  is  contained  in  the

Hansard. It is contained in the minutes of the  Central

Committee. It is contained in the Hong Lim Resolutions.

It  is  contained  in  the Hong  Lim  by-election  mass

meetings.  And so we will not spend much  time  on  the

person of Mr Thomson himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second issue, my view is that during its two

and  a  half  years of existence, the  Political  Study

Centre has served no useful purpose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody asked you to talk.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Because what they were doing is to

get an expatriate to teach our own Assemblymen, our own

civil  servants  about  the  conditions  in  Asia,  the

national and social currents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



which are steering Asia. Mr Speaker, Sir, with all due

respect,  I  am sure an expatriate is not qualified  to

teach  us that. Of course, as far as I know, we have  a

few Asian tutors, both full-time and part-time, who are

helping in the job. But these people teach nothing  but

just  the purely anti-Communist line. Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  this  Political  Study Centre is an  anti-Communist

Political centre and openly poses as one, then it might

serve  the purpose o, the persons who form the  centre.

But as far as I know, this is not the case. As far as I

know, the lectures are just harmless ones. Lectures are

given by Ministers and visiting dignitaries. But during

the  tutorial  discussions, where we  have  both  Asian

tutors  and expatriate tutors, it is nothing  but  just

playing  the anti-Communist line most of the time,  and

at  other  times showing, for instance, the differences

between  the  Prime Minister's political  line  and  my

political line -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Hong Lim is always making wild statements without the slightest evidence. Could we just, for a change, hear from him some evidence, some facts to justify his allegations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the lectures as recorded or those that have been delivered are all harmless. But after the lectures we have, I am told, tea groups, where there is a discussions on the merits and demerits of the Chinese-educated versus the English-educated; on how the ex-Minister for National Development did what he did. Is it not a fact, is it not true, that it is nothing but just playing the anti-Communist line in these political lectures?

we are anti-Communist - logically.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, I have never had occasion to

attend all the lectures in this Political Study Centre,

otak".  We  are  not intellectual enough.  But  I  have

heard,  and he can confirm whether it is true  or  not.

You can deny it, if you want to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member should address

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Minister for Finance, who in

practice,  I think, runs this Centre, can deny  what  I

have  heard. I was told, for instance, in  one  of  the

lectures, Mr de Cruz told a meeting of civil  servants

who  attended  of  his experience of Communists  cells,

what  happened and how awful it was. Another  lecturer,

Mr  Puthucheary, talked about his experience in  gaol,

his experience of sleeping on tables - more or less from

all  his  experiences - and what  would  happen  to  this

country  if the Communists took over. If it is for  the

Minister - I have not attended these meetings - to deny  or

confirm  it.  I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  since  the

last  two  and a half years, from what we know  of  the

Political  Study Centre, it is not worth the  money  we

vote for it and it should be scrapped.

the  assurance from the Minister for Finance  that  the

civil service must be neutral and that we must preserve

the  neutrality  of the civil service. That  being  so,

then  the  Political  Study Centre  must  not  only  be

neutral but appear neutral.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is also very important. We would

like  to  have an assurance from the Finance  Minister,

Sir, whether these things, an example



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



of which I am going to mention here, are being done. We

leaders  of  the  Government and  the  leaders  of  the

Opposition, and invariably the comparisons are so  made

that the leaders of the Opposition appear in a very bad

light. If that is true, then, Sir, I do not think  that

is  neutral.  The  comparisons are  made  naturally  by

lecturers  appointed by themselves. Sir, if the  Centre

is  to  be  neutral and appear to be neutral, then  the

staff must be neutral.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In fact, Sir, the whole duty could

be  shifted  to the University of Malaya.  Then  people

will  believe  that  the aims are  neutral.  The  facts

should  be  given  by lecturers who can  afford  to  be

neutral  and  I  am sure the public then  will  not  be

having  any  adverse views. If, however, the Government

insists  on retaining control of this Study Centre,  it

is  important that their appointees be such  that  they

have  had  no  previous connections with any  political

Parties   whatsoever.  If  they   have   the   academic

qualifications  without  any suspicion  of  having  any

political  bias, then, Sir, an organisation  like  this

will be acceptable and will be above suspicion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the fact is that the Minister for

Finance  holds Mr Thomson close to his heart,  as  has

been  exhibited by his threatening me with a libel suit

on  behalf  of Mr Thomson. However, Sir,  I  shall  be

least concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



if  the  Minister for Finance is going  to  sue  me  on

behalf  of  Mr Thomson, because I think nothing  would

give  me greater pleasure. However, Sir, I want to  ask

the  Minister for Finance whether it is a fact that Mr

G.  G. Thomson is, in fact, leaving at the end of  this

month and, if he is, whether it is the intention of the

Government  to  appoint another head  who  is  also  an

expatriate   and  who  may  have  some  very   sinister

connections?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Chairman, when the Minister

replies.  I  wonder whether he will  reply  to  my  two

questions.  He has not replied to them.  He  has  in  a

vague  way shown what has been achieved, But  could  he

tell   us   actually  how  the  civil   servants,   the

Government,  or  the State have actually  benefited  by

this course?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that I asked and which he has not

answered was: if Assemblymen wish to attend and sit  in

at  the course and listen for their own benefit or  for

their  own  satisfaction,  will  they  be  allowed  to.

especially  if  they come from the other  side  of  the

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

interesting  to note that what was said by  the  Member

for  Hong  Lim last year is being echoed by Members  of

the  Barisan Sosialis. May I point out first  that  the

courses  which  are  being run in the  Political  Study

Centre were sanctioned before they could be given by  a

group  of people who included myself, the Minister  for

Finance  and, in case there should be any  doubt  about

this, also Mr Woodhull and Mr Puthucheary, who by  no

stretch  of  the imagination of the Barisan,  could  be

construed as colonialists or stooges. I can assure  the

Members  of  the  Opposition that the contents  of  the

course  are not directed towards making comparisons  of

any  particular  political Party in  this  Assembly  or

leaders  of  the Assembly. In fact, it  is  one  of  my

duties to go there once a fortnight, or sometimes twice

a  fortnight,  and very often people do  ask  questions

where  they pin-point either a particular leader  or  a

particular  political Party. Because of the  allegation

made right from the start that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



it is a brain-washing centre, we take great care, where

we  can,  to  avoid  making political  capital  at  the

expense of one Party or the other. But very often it is

true that in the course of discussion civil servants do

bring  out certain comparisons. And I am sorry to  say,

Sir,  the  Member for Hong Lim features very  often  in

these  comparisons where the civil servants  regale  us

with  rather  heart-rending stories  of  what  happened

under the regime of the Mayor of the City Council or of

the  previous  Minister for National  Development.  But

even  then sometimes it is difficult to avoid answering

them  because we have to exonerate the Government. Very

often  we do say that we do not want to go out  of  our

way  to discuss the merits of any individual politician

or   any  particular  political  Party.  That  can   be

testified to by going to any of the civil servants.  If

there  had been any specific instance of the Government

making  political capital out of these  courses,  I  am

quite  sure those instances would have been transmitted

to   some  Member  of  the  Opposition.  But  in  these

allegations,  so far nobody has mentioned any  specific

instance. It is quite true that in the course of a long

discussion,  you may occasionally say something  in  an

offguarded  moment. But not as a matter  of  principle.

None  of the courses are designed to put any particular

political  Party  at  a  disadvantage.  Some   of   the

lecturers who go there and give lectures are  not  pro-P.A.P.  Some of them are even suspected of being  anti-P.A.P. There have been foreign correspondents who  have

lectured there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will indicate roughly what the nature of the

courses  is.  It is true the courses have changed  from

time to time. But generally they come broadly into  the

following  categories. First, the  history  of  Malayan

political Parties -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order. Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister for Finance has already replied in greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>



detail. Is it necessary for the Minister for Culture to

repeat what his colleague has said?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not quite certain whether the

Minister for Culture is, in fact, repeating. If  he  is

repeating,  perhaps  he should  not.  He  should  avoid

repeating what the Minister for Finance has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think it was the Member for

Tanglin  or  the Member for Mountbatten who  wanted  to

know  what  exactly are the contents of these  courses.

Sir, I am trying to indicate in more detail, where  the

Minister for Finance has only dealt generally with, the

nature of the courses which are being run there. One is

the  history  of the political Parties, which  includes

the  M.C.P., U.M.N.O., and even the M.D.U.,  which  was

mentioned  by the Member for Queenstown.  It  is  quite

true,   Sir,  that  as  a  non-Communist  party,   some

lecturers do tell things about the M.C.P. which may not

be  to  the liking of certain Members, perhaps to  the

Barisan.  But  that is not a secret.  It  was  never  a

secret  when they were on this side of the House.  They

were non-Communists. We do not believe in Communism. To

that extent, it is necessary for civil servants who are

running the civil service to know the nature of one  of

the  political forces, with which they have to contend,

and  their method of operation. In fact, the Member for

Hong Lim indicated earlier that Mr Gerald de Cruz, who

was  formally  active in the Communist  movement  here,

does give the civil servants a first-hand knowledge  of

how  these people operate and what they do. The  Member

also  mentioned Mr James Puthucheary, who  is  now  an

adviser and a luminary in the Barisan Sosialis and  who

has  also said many things about the Communists and the

Communist  movement. Perhaps, Sir, if at some  time  in

the remote future Chin Peng does come out of the jungle

and decides that he has enough of it, we are quite sure

we  will  invite him to the Political Study  Centre  to

give  a  firsthand  account  of  what  he  thinks   of

Communism. By and large this is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



general nature of the courses. Then we have lectures on

Asia,  the Asian revolution, economic problems, Malayan

nationalism,    Malayan   culture,   and    talks    by

correspondents on current topics:

what is happening in Laos, China and elsewhere. This is

the  broad structure of the courses, and from  time  to

time a specific subject is changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the lecturer is concerned, it is quite

true,  Sir, that we have tried very hard to get a local

man  who can run these courses. The moment we can  find

such  a man, we shall certainly see to it that the post

is   filled.   Mr   Thomson  only  carries   out   our

instructions  as regards the contents  of  the  courses

which are dictated to him by us. He is a technician and

he  arranges the courses. He delivers what  has  to  be

said on our instructions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I will say this, Sir. I was not hiding the

fact  that Mr Woodhull and Mr James Puthucheary  also

gave   lectures   to   the  civil  service.   But   the

dissatisfaction over Mr C. G. Thomson is not  new.  It

has not come about just now. As the Member for Hong Lim

has  pointed out, all of us in the P.A.P. knew who  Mr

Thomson  was. I have told the Prime Minister personally

and  privately what I thought of Mr G. G. Thomson, and

so  have  Mr Puthucheary and Mr Woodhull. Can  I  beg

leave to withdraw now, Sir, unless there is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member can always beg leave to

withdraw, but he has made a speech. Another Member  may

speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

have  said  that the courses at the Centre are  not  to

promote  P.A.P.ism, which is what I intended  to  point

out  when I said, that in Russia the grass is green.  I

do  not  accuse the Government of running a  course  to

promote  Communism, but rather P.A.P.ism. But,  anyway,

since  they  said it was not done, that the  lecturers,

out of their anxiety probably to try and be in the good

books  of the Government, tried to show how the  P.A.P.

is   a   good   Government   compared   with   previous

governments, and how the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister is a better man than the  previous  two

Chief  Ministers,  would  the Government  give  us  the

assurance that they would send out instructions to  the

lecturers that that is not to be done, and that if they

do it, they will face the consequences?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am not aware that lecturers

ever  do  such things. From the subject matter  of  the

talks,  there is no occasion for them ever to say  that

this Government is better than the previous government,

although  this is self-evident to the population.  They

are there to discuss larger problems like what is meant

by  economic  development and how does it  fit  in - that

sort  of  thing. They only incidentally  say  what  the

Government is doing, whether it is succeeding  or  not.

The civil service knows what is going on and, as I say,

nobody  is  going to bluff them. You are  dealing  with

people  who  are  capable of good  judgment.  We  never

underestimate their ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Mountbatten asked whether

Assemblymen could attend the course if they want to  do

so. I would like to think about this. It is, of course,

meant  for civil servants. Personally I see no harm  if

the  Member  for Mountbatten would like to  attend  it.

But, on the other hand, if it is a general principle, I

am not quite sure what the implications are. Perhaps if

she could quietly go there and nobody is the wiser,  it

would not do anybody any harm.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just

like to point out that it has been done before. In  the

previous  course  run for Assemblymen,  civil  servants

were allowed to attend.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 32 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (130) of subhead 1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this particular post of Staff Tutor is held by a

person  who  is  known  to  have  been  a  keen   Party

politician. The last political post he held in a  Party

was  as  the Organising Secretary for the Labour Front,

and he helped the People's Action Party to win the City

Council  elections. Therefore, his appointment  to  his

present  post gives rise to wonderment on the  part  of

the public. Yet the Government wants to follow a course

of  neutrality.  I  think it  would  be  wise  for  the

Government  to appoint people who are known for  having

been neutral in local politics, and they would then  be

clear  of  all these adverse criticisms that are  being

made.  It  is no use the Government saying  that  their

directives  are neutral. Directives can be  neutral  on

paper  but it is the people who carry them out that  is

the  important thing, and if they are not neutral,  the

policy  can appear to be neutral but the actions  belie

the written policy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the point raised by the

Member  for  Tanglin is that the incumbent  helped  the

P.A.P. to victory in the City Council elections.  This

is  the first time I have heard of it, and in fact  the

first  time my colleagues have heard of it. The  Member

for  Hong  Lim is here to confirm or deny whether  this

man  had anything to do with the victory of the  P.A.P.

in the City Council elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I think I should clarify the

position. I think what the Member for Tanglin just  now

meant was that the man was so inefficient in organising

the Labour Front that the P.A.P. won the elections!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, so long as we

are assured that the Government will sincerely follow a

policy  of neutrality in conducting operations  in  the

Political Study Centre, we are with them. I am prepared

to withdraw my amendment as an indication that I really

support the policy of neutrality for the civil service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member withdrawing?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure

about the assurance from the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 32 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mrs Seow Peck Leng.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether I have missed the bus, but I

would like to speak on the salary of the Minister. I

will generalise a bit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of increase in salary under the whole

Head. Since the Ministry of Finance has not done so

well in the past year - you will remember, Sir, that I

pointed to the House that there was only a 37 per cent

performance of the development projects, which was

misinterpreted by Radio Singapore to be a 65 per cent

performance and by the Straits Times to be a 75 per

cent performance - I see no reason why the Minister for

Finance, especially when there is so much unemployment

around, should increase his own salary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The question of the increase of

the Minister's salary has been dealt with. Under this

amendment which is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 32 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1,



<br><br>the hon. Member is entitled to speak generally about

the personal emoluments of the Ministry, and not to

touch on any particular salary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think I will speak under the

$100 Head.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Even under the $100 Head, I am afraid

the Member for Queenstown will not be able to itemise.

He can only speak on the general policy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I bow to your ruling. I have one

particular item on which I want to put a query, and

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>



is  the  Central Complaints Bureau. I see there are  so

many   Inspectors,  Clerical  Officers.   Investigation

Officers, Assistant Supervisors and Supervisors.  I  am

just  wondering whether they are going  to  be  on  the

permanent  or  merely temporary establishment;  and  if

they  are  part of the civil service, whether they  are

supposed to be politically neutral. Probably a  lot  of

people  do not know that the Central Complaints  Bureau

is  a  direct  result  of complaints  from  the  P.A.P.

branches  and  Assemblymen before  the  "break".  As  a

result,  we now see this new Central Complaints  Bureau

coming  up. I would like to get an assurance  from  the

Minister that, if and when these posts are filled, they

will be properly filled, they will not be influenced by

special  political  considerations as  to  whether  the

applicants are P.A.P. members or P.A.P. sympathisers, and

everybody will be given due consideration and  properly

adjudged  not  on their political affiliations  but  on

their work and their capabilities.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see in the

Personal  Emoluments  one post,  Code  I,  which  draws

$2,075, four posts which draw $1,950 each, twelve posts

which  draw  $1,670 each, five posts which draw  $1,520

each, and seven which draw between $1,300 and $1,400. I

wonder  whether  the Minister would be kind  enough  to

tell  me  how  many of these posts are  being  held  by

women.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think two of them are held by

women.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, evidently this

is  a  question  which  needs  some  investigation  and

probably the Minister will be kind enough to give me  a

written answer later on. He does not specify where  the

two  of them come in - at the bottom or at the top of the

ladder.  Anyway, when he gives me the answer, could  he

also state the reasons why so few women were appointed?

Were  they  not academically qualified? Or was  it  the

usual  case of women being eligible in theory but  that

they were just not appointed in practice?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, before the enlightened

policies  of  the  P.A.P. Government  were  implemented

within  the  last two years, there was  not  one  woman

officer   in   the  administrative  service.   Speaking

offhand,  I think there are now at least three - probably

four.  This is the first time we have urged the  Public

Service  Commission to get bright women graduates  from

the   University  of  Malaya  and  put  them  into  the

administrative    service.    This    is     absolutely

revolutionary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the question is directed to the

Ministry  of Finance. The Member for Mountbatten  wants

to  know whether there are any women employees  in  the

Ministry of Finance, and if not, why not. That  is  the

question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are, of course, hundreds of

women  employees. There are two in the top echelons  of

the Assistant Secretary level. Of course, we have a few

more  outside the Ministry of Finance. But  as  I  have

said,  we  are making a start in recruiting women  into

the administrative service.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Generally. I mean the Ministry of

the Central Complaints Bureau?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon. Member seeks an assurance

that  these  people will be properly recruited,  and  I

give that assurance. There is no question about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> From the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> From the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> May I congratulate the Minister

on trying to put more women in? May I also congratulate

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Then that is an attack on the Public

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 32 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 13 is Passages and Miscellaneous Travelling

Expenses. In the 1961 Estimates it was $1.2 million,

and in the 1962 Estimates it is also anticipated that

$1.2 million is going to be spent. I would have

thought, Sir, that with the reduction of expatriate

officers in the Government, the vote for passages

should have been considerably reduced. As for the vote

stands the same as it did last year; is it because

Miscellaneous Expenses are increasing? If so, could the

Minister tell us what is making it so expensive?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, although the

number  of expatriate officers will be less next  year,

it is anticipated that the requirements under this vote

will  be  maintained  in view of the  need  to  recruit

overseas   doctors,   teachers  of  Malay,   engineers,

architects and other technical personnel. The vote will

also  provide passages and transportation  charges  for

personnel  recruited or appointed  under  the  overseas

service aid scheme of the Government. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>



scheme came into operation with effect from April  this

year,  and commitments under this scheme for 1961  will

fall  for  payment  in 1962 because the  terms  of  the

scheme  to be applied to Singapore take time to settle.

Allowance  has  also been made for an increase  in  the

costs  of sea and air passages which were imposed  with

effect  from  1st  July, 1961, and 1st  October,  1960,

respectively.

Ministers  or  Parliamentary Secretaries  or  Political

Secretaries, or Government servants travelling  between

<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Malay teachers from Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I am glad to hear that.

less expenditure in travelling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am a bit puzzled. I got one answer from

the Parliamentary Secretary and on the prompting of his

Minister,  I  got  another  answer.  I  only  ask  this

question because, over the last two days when questions

were  being asked about travelling allowances  and  why

votes  were going up, the answer given was that  it  is

becoming  necessary  because of merger  and  Government

officers have to fly across every now and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>



then,  and  therefore  it  is  necessary  to  have   an

increased vote. So I hope that the first answer is  the

correct  answer, and that is this: these  Miscellaneous

Travelling  Expenses are expenses  in  connection  with

the  recruitment of outside officers coming in or going

out  as a result of that recruitment. But I am now told

that  there  are  several votes  which  the  Government

could  go to for travelling expenses. If that is so,  I

think  the  position  is  not  very  satisfactory,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,If it is possible for officers from  the

Ministry  of  Finance travelling  to  Kuala  Lumpur  on

merger  business  to  charge their travelling  expenses

against  this item or some other Head, and yet a  third

Head,  then  I think the position is unsatisfactory.  I

think  the House should know what particular travelling

expenses  are  being charged to what  particular  vote.

The  ability to pick on the first, second or third vote

and  charge  travelling expenses to any  one  of  these

three votes is an unsatisfactory position.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there are two subheads here

which are relevant. One is subhead 10 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Expenses in connection with -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Inquiries, Commissions and Conferences

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Travelling on Government Duty

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Visits of Advisers, Experts, Consultants, etc.'



<br><br>This  will  be  the  vote  which  will  be  used  when

delegations from Singapore go abroad on, representative

missions, or where we ask the United Nations or Colombo

Plan countries to send experts here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 13 will be used for routine travelling

expenditure. I think that is the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Subhead 13 is going to be used for routine

travelling  expenses of Government  officers.  But  the

Parliamentary  Secretary has said that so  far  as  the

first  part  of  that vote is concerned - passages - it  is

being considerably reduced. Then it appears, Sir,  that

Miscellaneous Travelling Expenses are being  increased.

And  in  view of subhead 10 and various other items  on

various other Heads where travelling expenses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>



are  being increased, it seems to me, Sir, that  it  is

wrong  for  this Assembly to vote monies to  Government

for   travelling  expenses  in  respect  of  Government

servants  who, with their knowledge, can go to  several

votes   under   several  Heads  to  charge   travelling

expenses.  From  the point of view  of  some  check  on

Government travelling expenditure, the position, to  my

mind, Sir, is unsatisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I suggest that this item also be

investigated by the Estimates Committee?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 37 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 26.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vote for "Temporary Staff for Customs

$10,000 for 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>



The  Customs Department is performing an important  and

vital  role in the Government service, particularly  in

countering  smuggling.  In  view  of  the  unemployment

problem, I suggest that these temporary staff  be  made

permanent,  as  I  would  not be  happy  if  they  were

dismissed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, these temporary

Customs   lieutenants  and  temporary  Junior   Customs

lieutenants and temporary deck-hands were recruited  in

1958  to combat large-scale smuggling between Rhio  and

Singapore.  Now, because the Government has  imposed  a

quota  on  the  re-export of dutiable  cigarettes,  the

threat  to  revenue has reduced to a large extent,  and

therefore  these men are being retrenched.  The  Member

requested that these men be made permanent, but as they

lack  the  requisite qualifications, they  have  to  be

retrenched.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in this

way  we  make  the  problem of unemployment  even  more

difficult. For instance, when the Government  want  men

to  meet  a certain contingency they recruit  men;  and

when  the need is over they retrench them. I think  the

Government should give special consideration  to  these

men  who have given service. They should be transferred

to  other departments. But this is just like discarding

someone who is of no further use.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch upon two points.

The  first is the point which I had already dealt  with

in the debate on the Financial Statement by the Finance

Minister. But, unfortunately, he did not have  time  to

reply  to  me. I think perhaps he should  be  given  an

opportunity  to  do so. The first point  is  about  the

repayment  by Government of taxes which have been  paid

under  an  assessment already made and  in  respect  of

which the tax-payer has appealed but has had to pay the

tax even before he could lodge the appeal. The point  I

made  in my previous speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  that

in  those cases the Comptroller and his staff should do

their  utmost  to  see  that when they  have  satisfied

themselves  that there has in fact been an  overpayment

and  the  quantum  of the return of the  tax  has  been

agreed  upon, then the repayment of such sum should  be

made  without  any delay. I have heard complaints,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, not only from one or two, but from  quite

a  few  that  although the quantum of  the  refund  was

agreed  upon, yet the refund has been unduly prolonged.

I  am  also informed that in some cases it has taken  a

year or more to refund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise, Mr Speaker, Sir,

is this. You will recollect the debate we had in this

House when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  of Finance was asking for  additional

powers  for  his  tax  officers.  The  powers   were

resisted  by  the Opposition. Some of us  had  hoped

that, by the increase in powers for the officers  of

the  Income Tax Department, at least the  net  would

have  been cast wider to bring in a group of persons

who  have so far evaded the taxing officers. Sir,  a

number  of  people  are  of  the  opinion  that  the

increased powers are being used to harass the people

who  are  already paying taxes, asking them  to  pay

quicker,  asking  them all sorts of questions.  That

may  be  good  in a way. Sir. But I think  what  the

public  at  large and this House would be interested

to hear from the Finance Minister is this - that as

a  result  of  these  increased  powers,  where  the

taxpayers were X in number, it has now become X plus

Y,  and  these powers have, in fact, brought to  the

public  coffers  greater sums of  money  than  would

otherwise have been brought in.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

raise  another point that was discussed here sometime

ago.  That  is the question of providing  income  tax

relief  for  dependent parents. Sir, I well  remember

being on the Pan-Malayan Liaison Committee to discuss

income  tax  relief.  It  was  pointed  out   by   an

expatriate officer that in Europe, a family consisted

of  only  husband  and wife and  children,  and  that

parents could not be regarded as being members of the

family.  It was pointed out that in view of that  and

the  fact  that  local people often  adopt  too  many

parents,  therefore, they were not prepared to  agree

to personal relief being given. But, Sir, since then,

because  we have the Ordinance operating for quite  a

long  time and income tax revenue has been increasing

each  year, I wonder whether it is not time  for  the

Minister for Finance to give favourable consideration

to  this, in view of the fact that we do not have old

age pension in Singapore - where the parents are really

dependants - and   whether  he  would   not   consider

providing  some personal relief in the case  of  wage

earners who have to support dependent parents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> First, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

repayment of tax which was not properly due. The

Member for Farrer Park raised this subject in the

debate on the Government's financial policy. After

this debate I discussed this matter with the

Comptroller of Inland Revenue. He has assured me that

it is the policy of his Department to make repayments

as expeditiously as possible. But sometimes before

payment of money is actually made, certain

formalities have to be gone through. Further, the

Inland Revenue Department would also require certain

information to arrive at the actual quantum. He

assured me that if there was anybody who felt that he

was unjustly treated in this matter, and if that

individual would write to the Comptroller personally,

he himself would intervene and he would get repayment

made as quickly as possible. I fully agree it is

quite wrong for Government to hang on to money which

is not due to it, and the sooner it is paid back the

better it would be both for the public and for the

Inland Revenue Department itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the wider powers which we obtained from

the  Assembly last year, the Member for  Farrer  Park

would  like  to have an account of how  these  powers

were used and with what results. Briefly, I think  we

can  divide  these special powers into three  groups.

Firstly,  we sought from the Assembly power  for  the

Comptroller of Inland Revenue to ask for payments  of

tax  on assessment raised by him even where there  is

an objection lodged by the taxpayer, the ground being

that  people  do  lodge objections  in  the  hope  of

delaying payment. Under the old law, the taxpayer was

not  obliged to make any payment until the  objection

was  resolved by the Income Tax Board of Review.  The

result  of  granting  this  increased  power  to  the

Comptroller   has   been   most   satisfactory.   The

Comptroller  has  no  occasion  to  use  this   power

extensively, but there has been a marked acceleration

in  the process of raising assessments. Taxpayers are

now quicker



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>



to  give  information because there is nothing or  very

little to gain by delaying assessment. So the effect of

that, I think, has been very beneficial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of powers relates to the collection

of  information by various measures. It  is  still  too

early  to assess how effective this would be, how  much

the extra yield to the revenue would ensue from the use

of this special power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should explain, Mr Speaker. Sir, that

there  is  in the Inland Revenue Department  a  section

called the Investigation Unit. It is a small unit,  but

it  comprises a very skilled investigation staff.  Each

year  they  collect  nearly 10 per cent  of  the  total

revenue  due  from income tax. The present position  is

that  they have found this power useful. I do not think

they  can  be  accused of using this power excessively,

because  we have no public outcry against it. Certainly

the  Member  for Farrer Park, who takes an interest  in

this   matter,   has  not  put  forward  any   specific

complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the requirement that certain

classes of business give receipts, and if they do  not,

they  can  be required to give receipts. This also  has

borne fruit. Two doctors in private practice have been.

successfully  prosecuted for failing to give  receipts,

and  very substantial tax assessments have been  raised

on  them. Action against a third doctor is pending.  I

have  no  doubt the medical profession will  in  future

make their proper share to the State revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has raised the old question of

relief for the aged parents. Quite frankly, I have  not

given  much  thought to this subject.  I  do  not  know

whether  I should, in view of the fact that income  tax

legislation will be a Federal subject. So for the  time

being, I would say I prefer to reserve my position.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to bring up the question of

the  Review  Committee for the review of property  tax.

This is the Committee where only P.A.P. Assemblymen are

asked to sit and the Chairman of that Review Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>



happens to be also the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Finance. You will remember  that  we  had

quite   a   bit  of  row  last  year  about  the   Rent

Conciliation Board having been staffed only  by  P.A.P.

Assemblymen.  Now  we  have the  same  thing  happening

again.  We  are  just wondering if  it  is  a  case  of

conciliation  and sympathy being given only  to  people

who happen to know P.A.P. Assemblymen or people who are

sympathetic  towards the P.A.P. Why  should  only  P.A.P.

Assemblymen be in that Committee?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The reason simply, Sir, is that it

is not a statutory Committee. It has no powers. It just

meets  in a really unofficial advisory status to assist

the  Property  Tax  Department.  There  is  a  lot   of

misunderstanding, especially among occupiers or  owners

of  low  value  property. We do not get much  tax  from

these  small  houses,  attap  houses  and  so  on.  But

nevertheless,  assessment must be raised in  accordance

with  the  law.  Otherwise the whole  thing  becomes  a

standing  invitation to evade tax. There is  a  lot  of

misunderstanding. The tax officials,  of  course,  take

the  stand  that  that is the law and  that  they  must

enforce  it to the hilt. On the other hand, Assemblymen

who are in touch with public opinion realise that while

you  should  collect your fair share  of  tax  due,  it

should  be done in such a way that people, if they  are

not happy, are at least satisfied that they are parting

with  money  due to the Government. The  Committee  has

been  formed  and because it is purely an advisory  and

not  a  statutory Committee, we have decided  that  the

best way to get work done expeditiously is to appoint a

Committee of Government Assemblymen.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to make it an All-Party Committee, then

you can be sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the fracas which

has  threatened to develop in the House but  has  never

quite  succeeded  might well run out of  hand  in  this

little Committee. The Committee, of course, serves all

sections of the community. Whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>



they  are  supporters of one Party or another makes  no

difference.  They are entitled to be received  by  this

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  touch on the property tax that comes under Head 40.

It  is  on the question of unoccupied premises on which

tax  has to be paid. I would like to point out  to  the

Minister for Finance that the extra cost of the tax  on

vacant   newly-built  properties  is   not   borne   by

developers.  If the developers know that they  have  to

pay  the extra cost, they will put up the price of  the

houses and the poor people who have saved up all  their

lives  to buy a home suffers that extra cost. The extra

cost is not borne by the developer. It is always passed

on to the poor buyer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other tax is on properties that are not new,

people  who  actually  rent  out  houses.  People   pay

assessment  and Government charges assessment  for  the

services  that they render, such as roads  and  so  on,

which  enhances  the value of the property.  But,  Sir,

properties do get a higher rent when they are furnished

and  that  extra money is provided by the house  owners

themselves. The Government gets income tax as  well  as

assessment  on  part  of it, because  they  only  allow

deduction of the value of the property divided by  five

years.  You are supposed to get back the money in  five

years,  and property after five years, everybody knows,

is  worth  nothing. While the owner suffers that  loss,

the Government is benefiting by the extra that they get

from  income tax and property tax. What I want to point

out is this. While the house owners receive that extra,

they  pay  Government extra. To a  certain  extent,  it

might be justified. But when they do not receive  that

extra, they do not receive any rents at all, the  extra

is  presumed to exist, although the rents do not exist.

People  have  had to pay assessment on the extra  which

does  not exist at all because the house is unoccupied.

So  not only are they paying for the assessment on  the

rent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>



of  the house, it the rent is, let us say, $100, and by

virtue  of  the place being furnished, apart  from  the

cost  of  the  furniture that is allowed by Government,

Government  charges another $70 extra. So you  have  to

pay 36 per cent on the $70, which does not exist except

hypothetically.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not want to reopen the discussion

on  the  restoration  of the pay cuts;  but  as  I  was

saying, sc, much has been said and, in fact, it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>



not  my  intention  to reopen the discussion.  But  the

point  I  want to make here is that we in  the  Barisan

Sosialis, in fact, do not grudge the Ministers and  the

Parliamentary Secretaries getting the extra money.  But

I  would  like to point out, Sir, that this $2,500  and

$1,500  are  not sums of money coming from  the  P.A.P.

purse.  They are coming from the public purse to  which

every  man  in the street contributes by way of  taxes.

Particularly here, Sir, the Minister for Labour has the

responsibility  to  be neutral in dealing  with  labour

disputes  which  involve  the lives  of  thousands  and

thousands of workers. It is important for the  Minister

himself and the Parliamentary Secretary himself to  set

an   example  of  neutrality,  because  invariably  the

Minister  shows bias against the unions which  are  not

led by P.A.P. henchmen. The staff who are in the civil

service  tend  to follow the footsteps of the  Minister

and the Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, numerous incidents have taken place,

particularly in the last six months or so,  which  show

that the intention .f the Government in operating  the

Ministry   of  Labour  and  Law  is  merely   to   give

recognition, blessing and whatever other assistance can

be  given,  to strengthening trade unions led  by  P.A.P.

henchmen  like  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for Culture. I do not think I have the  time,

nor  will you permit me, to touch on all the incidents.

But briefly, Sir, I would like to illustrate what I say

by  what, in fact, happened in the case of the  dispute

of  the  Shaw Brothers employees. Sir, as everybody  is

aware,  at the height of the dispute, the Minister  for

Labour  denounced the leadership of the union  involved

and  called  the  workers to attend a  meeting  at  the

Victoria Memorial Hall. On the surface of it,  Sir,  it

all  looked  a very fine thing to happen. Here  is  the

Minister, who is receiving $2,500, anxious to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not have these asides.

There is a grievance; let the grievance be against  the

conduct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Minister.  I  do not  think  his  salary  has

anything to do with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just wanted to emphasise the anxiety

shown by the Minister in wanting to settle a legitimate

dispute of more than 100 workers. On the surface of it,

as  I was saying, it all looked very fine. The Minister

wanted  to  settle a dispute of these workers  and  was

over-anxious to intervene. So he asked all the  workers

to  attend  a general meeting at the Victoria  Memorial

Hall. But if we were to look a little deeper, it was  a

very sinister move, made deliberately to undermine  the

collective  bargaining position of the trade  union  of

the  workers involved, and to undermine its rights  and

privileges. Sir, at no time in the past has there  been

an  occasion  where workers involved in a dispute  were

called to attend a conciliation meeting by ignoring the

trade union. In this particular case, there was a trade

union which is registered under the laws of the country

and  which is recognised by the Government as  a  legal

organisation  representing  the  workers  concerned.  A

trade union which enjoyed the support and confidence of

every  worker involved. Yet the Government thought  fit

to disregard the union, call the workers up so as to be

able  to make political capital out of the dispute.  As

we  are  all aware, the workers saw through this.  They

quite definitely stayed away. Even the Minister did not

dare  go  and  face  the  empty hall  in  the  Victoria

Memorial Hall the next day. But this is just one of the

instances,   Sir,   where  the  Government   Ministers,

particularly here the Minister for Labour, are prepared

to  go  to  any  lengths, even to  the  extent  of  co-operating  on  the  quiet with  the  employers,  as  to

undermine the work of trade unions which are not  loyal

to  the  P.A.P. Sir, we have been accused  of  so  many

things.  We  have been told that we are in  control  of

unions  and  we control the workers and so  on  and  so

forth.  But it would appear, Sir, from events that  all

these  allegations are unfounded, and all that  emerges

is  the fact that the Labour Ministry today is, we  are

told, to be biased against the non-P.A.P. unions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before I conclude. I would like to give one more

little example, Sir,I do not have the constitution  of

the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees here. But  if

one  were  to look at the constitution, one would  find

the  Secretary-General of the Union is allowed to  hold

office for five years, and there is a provision to  the

effect  that  the constitution of the Union  cannot  be

amended for three years from 1961. All that it means is

that  for  four years the Secretary-General  cannot  be

removed by the workers. I am not a lawyer, Sir,  but  I

have been told that this is ultra vires the Trade Union

Ordinance.  I  do not know how the Registrar  of  Trade

Unions  was  told  to register this  constitution.  And

there  are numerous other examples, Sir. I do not  want

to  take  away  the time of this House by  pouring  out

instance after instance. The only request I would  like

to  make of the Government is to try and run the Labour

Ministry  as  a government machinery dedicated  to  the

cause  of  settling trade dispute in a neutral  manner.

The  Ministry of Labour is not a P.A.P. outfit, and the

Minister is not paid, as I have said earlier, from  the

P.A.P. purse. This is particularly important. I do  not

blame   the  civil  servants  I  have  had  the   nasty

experience  of  facing up to some of the officials  who

are  civil servants in the Ministry of Labour  and  who

put  forward a very biased line against the  non-P.A.P.

unions.  But  I certainly do not blame them  because  I

know  they have jobs to safeguard, and if they  do  not

play  the P.A.P. line, they will find themselves losing

their  jobs. That is precisely why it is necessary  for

them to set an example. I have no doubt that if they do

set  an example, the civil servants in the Ministry  of

Labour will follow suit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite

appreciate why the Member for Thomson should  make  all

these  unfounded allegations against the  Minister  and

myself and even against the officials in my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Health and Law

will bear me out that, before the parting of ways,  the

Member  for  Thomson and many of his  union  associates

used to complain to me and also to the present Minister

for   Health   and  Law  that  the  officers   in   the

Conciliation Office were not doing their work properly.

Unfortunately,  I do not have a copy of  the  documents

here.  It  was  sometime last year when  the  Singapore

General  Employees  Union  made  unfounded  allegations

against  the officials in the Ministry that  they  were

not doing their work properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in a trade dispute, it is very

difficult for the officers in the Ministry to hold  the

balance. What the unions expect officers there to do is

to speak on their behalf. There is a difference between

the  civil  servants and the Minister and  myself.  The

Minister and I can explain and discuss a matter with an

employer. Sometimes we have to make use of our position

to  force  an  unreasonable  employer  to  come  to  an

agreement with his employees. Some employers are  quite

reluctant  to come to an agreement with their employees

unless they are faced with industrial action. So  under

those  circumstances where we know that  the  employers

are  unreasonable and the workers are  forced  to  take

industrial  action to reach an agreement, we  give  our

advice and sometimes we press the employers to reach an

agreement  with  the  unions. So all  this  while,  the

unions  expect  the officers to adopt  the  same  stand

taken by the Minister and myself. As these officers are

civil  servants, sometimes their advice may  not  carry

any weight and the employers may not respond to it.  So

the  allegation that the officials in the  Ministry  of

Labour are against non-P.A.P. unions in a dispute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



is  unfounded.  But  the point is  that  there  is  no P.A.P. union  or  non-P.A.P. union. There  has  been  a

spilt.  There is the N.T.U.C. and the S.A.T.U.,  which

is under the control of the pro-Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> How do you know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come to

the  allegations made with regard to the Shaw Brothers'

dispute. The Prime Minister in his broadcasts has shown

to  the  people  of  Singapore  how  the  pro-Communist

elements  in  the  unions are trying  to  convince  the

workers that they are really working for them in  order

that  they can control the unions. Therefore, with that

objective  in  mind,  a  case  in  point  is  the  Shaw

Brothers'  dispute. The workers' union submitted  their

demands  to  the management and had direct negotiations

with the management. When they reached a deadlock, they

did  not  refer  the dispute to the Ministry.  In  this

instance, I would say that the union was playing  right

into the hands of the employer. Instead of appealing to

us to help them - as we always try to put any union in a

better position - they tried to show that they were in a

better  position, and they also tried to  convince  the

workers  that  they could get what they wanted  without

resorting  to  the  Ministry of Labour.  So  when  they

reached  a deadlock - just as when they were in  trouble

over  the  political issues, instead of consulting  the

nationalists   in  Malaya  they  went   to   see   Lord

Selkirk - what  did  they do? They  went  to  consult  an

expatriate  lawyer,  Mr Booker, whom  the  Member  for

Thomson defended just now. They had a behind the scenes

talk. But the employers got fed up with the attitude of

the  union  and  with  the way  the  negotiations  were

handled.  They therefore made up their minds  to  close

down. This dispute only concerns those employed in  the

administrative  office. It is very easy  for  the  Shaw

Organisation to transfer their administration office to

Kuala   Lumpur.  When  we  understood  that  the   Shaw

Organisation intended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



to  close down and transfer their administrative office

from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, we had to step in, as

we  had  the  interest of the workers in mind.  We  can

assure the House that we are not going to be so foolish

as  the  previous  Government which,  in  its  foolish

anxiety  to build a union of its own, got into  trouble

because it tried to have people like Mr Jaganathan  to

build  up the T.U.C. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are  not

going  to  fall into that sort of trap. As far  as  the

workers  are  concerned, we treat  them  all  the  same -

whether they are members of S.A.T.U. or of the N.T.U.C.

The P.A.P. Government will look after the interests  of

the  workers, but we are not going to build up S.A.T.U.

That  is  our  policy insofar as the interests  of  the

workers are concerned, and we will always maintain that

policy.  As  I said just now, we were afraid  that  the

hundred workers involved in the Shaw dispute might lose

their   jobs,  and  therefore  the  Minister   himself

convened  a  meeting  between  the  employees  and  the

employers.  We  knew that the union  officials  had  an

ulterior  motive  behind the dispute.  So  before  the

meeting  was  convened, the management  instructed  its

legal adviser, Mr Booker, to have a consultation  with

me.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not like to reveal what  we

discussed,  but  this is what exactly took  place.  The

representatives  of  the  management  said  they  were

always prepared to negotiate with the workers, but they

wanted  me  to assure them that in case of  a  deadlock

again the Government would not refer the dispute to the

Arbitration Court. If the management were sincere  and

genuine in their desire to negotiate - and the union did

approach them behind the scenes - why did they want me to

give  them  an assurance that if there was a  deadlock

the  dispute  should not be referred to the Arbitration

Court?  Anyway,  insofar as that proposed  meeting  was

concerned, the Minister received many telephone calls -that  the employers were very anxious to attend.  Later

on,  after  seeing the Minister, as the representatives

of the management agreed to resume negotiations in the

Ministry of Labour, we therefore arranged a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



meeting  there the following day where the two  parties

met again and concluded an agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point is this, Mr Speaker, Sir. It appears

that the Member for Thomson is accusing the Ministry of

Labour, after the parting of ways, of being biased  and

prejudiced against the so-called non-P.A.P. unions. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that is definitely not the case,  and  I

challenge  the  hon. Member to produce facts  in  cases

where we have done so. For his information - maybe he is

now  too  busy with his Party and with his trade  union

affairs which are being handled by his colleagues - there

are  so  many  cases handled by the Singapore  Business

Houses  Union in which demands are submitted and direct

negotiations  with the management are  asked  for:  and

where   negotiations  have  come  to  a  deadlock   the

management  suggest  that  they  be  referred  to   the

Ministry  of Labour. On many occasions, the  management

have complained to me that the unions refuse to do  so.

In such a case, I have to advise the employers to refer

the  negotiations to the Ministry of  Labour.  On  many

occasions,  the  Commissioner for Labour  has  arranged

meetings  in  order  to  break  the  deadlock  in   the

negotiations.  These are cases which the unions  refuse

to  refer to the Ministry of Labour. So where  then  is

the  truth  in  the allegation that the  Government  is

biased  and prejudiced against the so-called non-P.A.P.

unions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can assure the House that as far

as the Government are concerned, we will carry out our

workers' policy and we do not care whether they  belong

to  this  or  that  union. Where  their  conditions  of

service  need revision and adjustment, we  will  always

support them.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I would have loved to let this

debate  be  a  battle between comrades and ex-comrades,

but  the Parliamentary Secretary has found it necessary

to bring in the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Government did not do anything to corner

the  workers'  market, as the P.A.P. did. The  previous

Government even persuaded the then T.U.C. to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>



admit  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for

Culture  to  be  the Secretary-General of  the  T.U.C.,

although  he  was  known to be a  very  staunch  P.A.P.

supporter. And yet when the P.A.P. came into power  and

the  same staunch P.A.P. supporter continued to be  the

Secretary-General of the T.U.C., what  did  the  P.A.P.

do?  They  cornered  the  whole market.  Every  staunch

P.A.P. supporter was made an Assistant Secretary with a

five-year  term of office. If they want  to  fight,  to

lash  out  and  have it out with their ex-comrades  and

disclose  all guilty secrets, they can do so; but  they

should  not  try to accuse the previous  Government  of

doing  something which they themselves have been  doing

and for which they should be ashamed. The Parliamentary

Secretary  has  said that there are no  P.A.P. unions.

Come,  come, do not make us laugh! We know which unions

are P.A.P. unions and which are the S.A.T.U. unions.

bush. In the first place, I did not blame the staff  of

the  Ministry of Labour. It is, in fact, true that from

time to time we have criticised individual officials of

the  Ministry of Labour. We have done this  ever  since

May  1959,  that is, after the elections,  and  perhaps

some  of this was put down in writing and given to  the

former   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  or   to   his

Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I was making was that if the Minister and

the  Parliamentary Secretary themselves show bias,  you

do  not  expect your civil servants not to  show  bias,

especially when they know that if they do not show bias

they may be faced with a "walking certificate". Sir,  I

have  had  numerous unpleasant occasions  when - and  the

Parliamentary Secretary knows this very well - I had even

to  phone up my political opponent to save me from  the

tortures  of the Ministry of Labour officials.  I  have

had  very  many unpleasant occasions when  puny  little

labour officers came to strike posts and addressed  the

strikers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



on picket rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and then said that

no  union  official should be at picket spots.  I  then

asked him, "What law says that no union official should

be  at picket spots?" And he said, "I have been told by

the  Parliamentary Secretary." Instead of arguing  with

the  poor  civil servant, I phoned up on  a  number  of

occasions  the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary

themselves.  I have no doubt there are  a  few  labour

officers  and  high-ranking  officials  in  the  Labour

Ministry who go out of their way to try and please  the

Minister  and  the Parliamentary Secretary  by  showing

over-bias  against non-P.A.P. unions. I  want  to  make

this  quite  clear, Sir. I certainly do not blame  them

because I know this is being done because they want  to

keep  their jobs so that they can get their pay at  the

end of the month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, on the Shaw Brothers dispute. I do not

want  to  spend  much  time on  it.  The  Parliamentary

Secretary   was   saying  that  I  was   defending   an

expatriate. He knows well I would be the last person to

defend  an  expatriate.  For his  information,  Sir,  I

understand Mr Booker is a Singapore citizen. I am  not

defending  him. I know him casually and met him  across

the  negotiating table. And I have no, doubt  that  my

defending him will be more embarrassing to him than  to

me.  Therefore, it was not my intention to defend  him.

He  was appointed by the Shaw Brothers Organisation  to

negotiate  on  behalf of the management, and  naturally

the   union's  representatives  had  to  meet  him   to

negotiate. There was nothing strange or sinister  about

it.  What,  in  fact, happened during the  dispute  and

negotiations  clearly  showed  the  attitude   of   the

Minister  for  Labour and his Parliamentary  Secretary.

Negotiations  on wage claims were carried  on  for  six

months.  Although they were protracted,  there  was  no

deadlock, no ill-feeling, and the talks were held in  a

quite friendly atmosphere. Then one fine morning,  Sir,

the  Shaw Brothers just closed the premises and  locked

out  the  workers. I do not know The reason. I am  told

that Mr Run Run



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



Shaw and the Minister for Finance are good friends.  It

was  a shock to the workers. Sir, one fine morning they

went  to  work  and found notices on the board  to  the

effect  that  it was a lockout. And then  negotiations,

and  negotiations. [interruption] Yes, there was a sit-down  strike. I am not pulling any bluff. There  was  a

sit-down strike, but nevertheless talks were held in  a

friendly atmosphere. After this lockout, the union  and

the  management  got  together.  There  was  a  lot  of

persuasion  on  the  part  of  the  union  before   the

management agreed to continue the talks. In the  course

of  the talks, the union was informed by the management

that  they were told not to settle the dispute  outside

the  Labour Ministry. This is the point - why  must  the

Ministry  of Labour advise the employer not  to  settle

the  dispute  outside  the Labour Office?  Because  the

union  knew  this  and  understood  the  situation  the

employer was in, in the final stages it agreed to go to

the Labour Ministry: The most interesting part here  is

this:  right through the negotiations, as I said, there

was  a  friendly atmosphere and even after the deadlock

the  negotiations  were continued  and  concluded.  But

because of the insistence of the Labour Ministry,  this

is  what  they were told - after coming to an agreement

outside the Ministry of Labour - that both parties had to

go  to  the Labour Ministry for a formal agreement  and

say,  "Yes,  I  agree  to this."  That  was  the  case.

[interruption] He wants proof, Sir. I do not think  you

will  allow me to quote hundreds of instances,  but  if

the  Parliamentary  Secretary wants,  I  can  give  him

sufficient proof to show how the Ministry of Labour  is

being  used as a P.A.P. outfit to make political  capital

out  of legitimate trade disputes of the workers. I  do

not  think, Sir, this is the place for me to quote  all

that.  But  in  passing,  I  might  as  well  say  that

everybody  knows  the Singapore Manual  and  Mercantile

Workers'  Union has Government blessing to  the  extent

where  they go to the employer and say, "I  want  to  -organise  the  workers into my union,  the  Manual  and

Mercantile  Workers' Union. Will you  please  circulate

this letter on our behalf?" And the employer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



co-operates  with  the Manual and  Mercantile  Workers'

Union  in helping to organise their union. In the first

place,  no employer likes to organise the workers  into

any  union, be it a P.A.P. union. But the fact that  in

Singapore today the employers, at least some employers,

are  prepared  to  assist  the  Manual  and  Mercantile

Workers'   Union  to  organise  workers  is   a   clear

indication of the extent of the blessing the Manual and

Mercantile  Workers'  Union  is  receiving   from   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also said that we object to going to the Labour Ministry when the employers want to go to the Labour Ministry. That is a fact. The employers want to go to the Labour Ministry because the employers have been told, "You don't settle with the union outside, because I cannot make political capital. So everytime you face a set of claims from the union,

you  refer to the Labour Ministry." The employers  say,

"I  want to refer this to the Labour Ministry." And  we

say, "Why should you, because there is no deadlock.  If

there  is a deadlock and if we want conciliation,  then

we are quite prepared to go to the Labour Ministry. But

right  now  there  is no deadlock and  we  continue  to

negotiate." That is the point I am making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have a situation where the Government, having

lost  the support of the workers, is trying to  make  a

comeback  by using a few unionists and some adventurous

employers.  In  the  process, they show  complete  bias

against the majority of the unions in Singapore,  which

are  not P.A.P. unions. That is precisely why I ask the

Government, particularly the Minister for  Labour  and

his  Parliamentary Secretary, to make sure that  in  so

far as handling trade disputes is concerned, try to be

neutral.  If  they  want to compete  with  us  for  the

support  of the workers in settling trade disputes,  we

are  quite  prepared to accept them in the trade  union

field.  There  are a few outfits, like the  Manual  and

Mercantile  Workers' Union, the Amalgamated  Union  of

Public Employees - a few, not more than five or six.  But

if they want, they can have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



a  few more. We are quite prepared to compete with them

in  the trade union field. But we do not want the State

machinery to be used to make political capital  out  of

the legitimate trade disputes of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson

knows as much as I do that the Minister for Labour  and

his  Parliamentary Secretary are fair-minded gentlemen.

It is completely untrue to say that they are in any way

biased  against  what he chooses to  describe  as  non-P.A.P. unions. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson

knows this very well. He participated in the debate  on

the  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance.  He  knows  that

Ordinance was brought into force with effect from  15th

September,   1960.   Under  that   Ordinance   certain

procedures  are laid down with regard to  negotiations,

the  way in which employers and unions get together  to

reach  a  collective agreement. There is a  requirement

that  either  side could serve notice on the  other  so

that  they  could  get  together and  begin  collective

bargaining. For some reason or other, Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  certain group of unions have never been prepared  to

invoke  the provisions of that Ordinance after it  came

into  force. I have spoken to them and I have told them

that  this  law  has been brought into force  and  have

asked  them to serve their notices under the provisions

of  that  Ordinance.  But they  still  choose  to  meet

managements without recourse to the provisions of  this

Ordinance.   They   have  tried  to  reach   collective

agreements  in  that way, the whole  purpose  being  to

sidetrack the Industrial Relations Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has referred

to  the  case of the Shaw Brothers. That is a  case  in

point.  The union served their notice on the management

but  did  not  invoke the procedures of the  Industrial

Relations  Ordinance. The management  considered  their

claims  to  be unreasonable, locked them out and  said.

"We  close  shop." In all other cases where this  Union

asked  for negotiations with the managements and  there

was a breakdown in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



the  negotiations, it just went on  strike.  It  would

never  use the machinery of conciliation that was  open

to it under the provisions of this Ordinance. Well, the

case  in  reverse was the Shaw Brothers case.  In  that

case,  they  were  locked out by  the  management.  The

management said, "Well, to hell with all this. We close

down."  What was the Minister to do? Here  was  a  case

where  the  union and the employer had sidetracked  the

Ordinance. The men would suffer if they continued to be

locked  out. So what was the Minister to do? He  tried

to  arrange a meeting where everybody would be present,

including  the union officials and the management.  And

that meeting was boycotted by the union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Industrial Relations Ordinance

is  a  good Ordinance if it is used properly. Just  now

the  House heard what the Member for Thomson  said.  He

said  they were quite happy to go and negotiate in  the

presence  of Mr Booker. The Member knows the Ordinance

prohibits  practising  lawyers  from  participating  in

negotiations. This is laid down in black and  white  in

the Ordinance. But they preferred to negotiate with Mr

Booker,  who acted on behalf of the management,  rather

than go to the Labour Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not think it is laid down in the

provisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance that a

practising  lawyer is prohibited from participating  in

negotiations.  A  practising lawyer is prohibited  from

presenting a case in the Arbitration Court.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they have chosen to

interpret the Ordinance that way. I agree, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that it is not laid down -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Point of elucidation if the Minister would

give way.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister has not

completed his sentence anyway.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a defect in the

law.  We  believed the unions would play fair  by  that

Ordinance - that  they would comply with  the  procedures

laid  down  in  it. We have found that they  have  done

everything  they  could  to  side-track  it.  It   will

therefore  be  necessary for us to say, by  way  of  an

amendment to the Ordinance, that all negotiations  will

have  to  be  carried out under the provisions  of  the

Ordinance.  Since the Booker affair. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

the  Bar  Committee has sought a declaration  from  the

High  Court  as to the interpretation of the Ordinance.

The  Government have agreed to make the position  quite

clear  by  introducing  an amending  Bill  which  would

specifically  state  that all conciliation  proceedings

and negotiations would have to be within the provisions

of  the Ordinance, and not outside it, so that we could

prohibit the side-tracking of its provisions.



<br><br>6.30 p.m



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson also said

just  now that he was surprised that the A.U.P.E. could

have been registered, and that the Constitution of this

Union  itself  provides  for  the  appointment   of   a

Secretary-General for five years. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

have  known  the Member for Thomson for  quite  a  long

time.  I  have never heard him once mention to me  that

all this was ultra vires the Trade Union Ordinance. The

first  time  I  heard about it was this afternoon.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, he has expressed surprise  how  A.U.P.E.

could  have been registered. This union, as  far  as  I

know,  is an amalgamation of existing unions. A  number

of   Government   unions  in  the  Postal   Department,

Woodbridge  Hospital  and some  other  departments  got

together and amalgamated themselves, including  in  the

amalgamation  the  City  Council  Services  Union.  Mr

Speaker.  Sir,  there was never any  reference  to  the

Minister' about this amalgamation. There is power under

the  Trade Union Ordinance for the Registrar to approve

such  an  amalgamation. As far  as  the  Government  is

concerned,  and as far as I am personally concerned,  I

never knew that the A.U.P.E. was registered until after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



it  had been registered. The Registrar had full power  to

deal  with  that  situation himself. So I am  really  very

surprised   that  the  Member  for  Thomson  should   have

expressed surprise that this union had been registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is most unfair that the

Member  for  Thomson should have tried to suggest  to  the

House  that  the Minister for Labour and his Parliamentary

Secretary have been unfair in their dealings with  certain

unions. I have known them personally for a very long  time

now,  and I can assure the House that both these men, whom

I  know so well, are certainly not in any way unfavourably

disposed towards any group of unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to say only a few words. In the first

place,  Sir, as far as the Industrial Relations  Ordinance

goes, to  the best of my knowledge, there is no provision

which  prohibits a lawyer from negotiating either for  the

union  or  for the employer. The prohibition  is  only  in

presenting a case in the Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister says that I never said anything

of  A.U.P.E. before. I am quite sure  it  would  be  very

embarrassing  to  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the

Minister  for  Culture if I were to  say  everything  that

happened in the private conversations between himself, Mr

Woodhull  and  myself  in so far as  the  organisation  of

A.U.P.E. is concerned. It is not my intention to take more

time of this House in discussing this, but I assure  the

Minister, Sir, that if the Parliamentary Secretary  wants,

I am quite prepared to say all these things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Just one more point, Mr Speaker, Sir. The

House   knows  that  the  Bar  Committee  have  sought   a

declaration  from the High Court on the interpretation  of

the  sections  of the Industrial Relations Ordinance  with

which  we  have been dealing. Mr Speaker, Sir, they  have

made  it  quite  clear that they accept the position  that

practising lawyers should not in any way be concerned with

the  actual handling of negotiations or appear as  counsel

before the Industrial Arbitration Court. All that the  Bar

Committee is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



seeking is a declaration that practising lawyers have  the

right to draw up agreements for their clients-who might be

unions  of  employees  or who might be  employers-and  the

right to advise them, without meddling in negotiations and

appearing before the Arbitration Court.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, just on a point of

elucidation. The Minister mentioned that he did  not  know

anything about the registration of A.U.P.E. May I ask  him

whether he was referring to the first registration or  the

second  registration of A.U.P.E.? Would he also  enlighten

us  why  A.U.P.E. was dissolved - I think it was  September

1959 - and why on the same day it was re-registered again?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that the

Member  for  Thomson has been speaking quite a  lot  about

A.U.P.E.  I  think  he  must  be  answered.  He  made   an

allegation  that  if the conversations  that,  took  place

privately between the Member for Thomson, Mr Woodhull and

myself  were revealed, it might be embarrassing to us.  Of

course,  Sir, if the conversations that took place between

the Member for Thomson, Mr Woodhull, Mr Lim Ching Siong,

Mr  Devan  Nair  and myself were revealed,  it  would  be

embarrassing also to those who are in the Barisan Sosialis

at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the question raised by the Member for

Mountbatten   could  be  answered  by  me.   It   was   an

amalgamation of two unions - the Singapore Union of Post and

Telegraph  Workers and the P. & T. Uniformed Staff  Union,

which were in existence in 1946 and 1947 respectively. One

of these unions had strikes three times in that period. If

you will remember, Sir, the present Prime Minister was the

legal adviser of the P. & T. Uniformed Staff Union in 1951

during the strike. He also represented the Singapore Union

of  P.  & T. Workers before an arbitration case in  1953.

These unions in September 1959 amalgamated and formed what

was  called  A.U.P.E. Negotiations took place between  the

new   organisation  and  six  other  unions   on   further

amalgamation. The law requires that every time an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>



amalgamation is effected a new registration should  take

place.  That is why the first A.U.P.E. had  to  be  re-registered  again  under a new number.  Eight  unions -which  were  legally constituted and registered - by  a

secret  ballot  of  their  members  and  following   the

provisions   of   the   Trade   Union   Ordinance,   had

amalgamated  and  created this union.  If  anything  had

been  illegal and unconstitutional, then I  suggest  the

Registrar  of  Trade Unions should be questioned,  maybe

by the Member for Thomson or anybody else.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, may I reply to a few

comments made by the Member for Thomson? If I understand

him  correctly, if he is trying to accuse the  Ministry,

particularly  the  Minister, myself  and  the  officials

there, of enforcing the Trade Disputes Ordinance, then I

will   have  this  to  say.  Since  he  himself   is   a

responsible officer in the union, he should advise  his

members to observe peaceful picketing. Whenever there is

a dispute resulting in industrial action, we always have

a  lot of complaints from the employer that the striking

employees are not observing peaceful picketing. What  we

have now done, in fact, is to try to give an opportunity

to  the  union  responsible to advise their  members  to

observe  peaceful picketing. If the Member  for  Thomson

does  not  want the Labour Ministry to remind  them  and

advise  them how to conduct peaceful picketing,  then  I

suggest  we abolish, the procedure. But he will have  to

see   that   the  members  are  observing  the  peaceful

picketing rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Shaw Brothers trade dispute, the

Minister  for Health and Law has explained this.  It  is

not   as   the   Member  for  Thomson   puts   it - direct

negotiations.  Before  the  negotiations  ended   in   a

deadlock,  the union had already instructed its  members

to  go slow. That was the thing that made the management

fed  up  with the whole situation. They thought  it  was

impossible   for   them  to  tolerate   any   more   the

irresponsible attitude of the union. That  is  why  they

made  up  their minds to close down. That is where  they

made  the  mistake and we had to step in, otherwise  the

workers would lose their jobs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The Member was under the

impression that what the Ministry wants is that he  must

refer  all  trade  disputes,  all  negotiations  to  the

Ministry.  That is not the case, Sir. What we have  said

is  that  there are conciliatory facilities. As  far  as

possible,  the union and the management can have  direct

negotiations. But in case they reach a deadlock at  that

stage,  they  should seek the assistance of  the  Labour

Conciliation Office. Otherwise, before they do that,  if

they take industrial action -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can the Parliamentary Secretary either

confirm  or deny that employers have been told to  refer

disputes to the Ministry of Labour?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yes. We have advised the employers

to  do that. Why? It is because during this period,  the

Singapore Business Houses Employees Union especially had

direct negotiations. As soon as they reached a deadlock,

they  did  not refer the dispute to the Labour Ministry.

They  just  called  for  industrial  action.  Then   the

employer  had  to  come  to the Ministry  and  seek  our

advice.  We always advised the management that in  order

to  avoid  that sort of situation, they should come  and

inform us in advance and ask the Labour Ministry to take

over  the negotiations. That is what we have asked  them

to  do.  But we have never compelled an employer not  to

conduct direct negotiations with the union. We say, "Yes

by  all means, have your direct negotiations. But before

you  reach  a  deadlock and seek industrial action,  the

dispute  should  be  referred to  the  Commissioner  for

Labour  to  see whether he would be able to assist  both

parties." That is what we have advised the employer  and

the  union to do. It is not what the Member for  Thomson

has alleged, that is we are forcing the employer not  to

conduct  direct  negotiations but to  bring  all  direct

negotiations to the Labour Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point. Mr Speaker, is about the question of a

lawyer representing the management. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



know  what  office the Member for Thomson  occupies  in

S.A.T.U.   So  many  non-English  speaking  unions   in

S.A.T.U. are   objecting  to   lawyers   representing

employers  in  negotiations or in just a  normal  trade

dispute. I have had occasions when they came personally

and  appealed to me to advise the employers not to make

use  of  the  lawyers. If the Member for Thomson  wants

it,  I  am  prepared to allow the lawyers  to  conduct

negotiations on behalf of their employer.  We  have  no

objection  to that, Sir,In fact, the Commissioner  for

Labour will be too happy. Otherwise, everytime a lawyer

comes on behalf of the employer we have difficulty.  On

certain   occasions  the  unions  have  boycotted   the

negotiations.  They  do  not want  to  meet  the  legal

representatives  of the management. It  is  up  to  the

Member  to  make  up'  his mind.  We  are  prepared  to

accommodate him on this point.

by  the  Opposition bench. In fact, two days  ago  when

they  argued  with  me about my having  a  post  for  a

Political  Secretary  in my Ministry,  the  Member  for

Thomson did acknowledge that in certain Ministries like

the  Ministry  of Labour there was a genuine  necessity

for  a  liaison officer who can explain to the  workers

the  policies  concerning the Ministry of  Labour.  You

must also understand that the Ministry of Labour is  in

charge  of  social  welfare  and  the  amount  of  work

involved in social welfare is quite considerable. So  I

would  say  that the Ministry of Labour does require  a

Political  Secretary  who can assist  the  Minister  in

explaining his policies to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year there was a lot of heated debate over

this post. The then Minister for Labour and Law at that

to  do  this job, and after having found the man to  do

the job, the post would then be created. But he did say

in  this  Assembly that he would see to it that  before

the  post  was filled the appointment would go  to  the

P.S.C.   So   I  now  ask  the  Minister  whether   the

appointment to this post has gone to the

as  the  man  who was first found by the  Minister  for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate that has preceded this item has been

of  particular interest to me particularly, and I  want

to speak about this item. You will remember, Mr

Speaker, Sir, when the Hon, the Minister for Labour and

Law, as he then was,

moved  this Bill in the Assembly sometime, I think,  in

February 1960, he did

make  the  statement  that this was  something  new  in

Singapore and he did not

claim  that  it was a perfect piece of legislation.  He

said  he  would  watch  its operation  and  review  the

position   after   he   had   watched   its   operation

sufficiently. He did also tell the House that there was

provision in the Ordinance for a report to be put in by

the President of the Court to

the  Assembly - a statutory obligation - which would enable

the House to assess

the quality of the work and the work as it affected the

people of Singapore. Unfortunately,  no  such report has  been  filed  by  the

President  of  the  Court, and  it  is  therefore  not

possible  to have his point of view on the matter.  But

naturally

some  of  us  who  have been interested  in  industrial

arbifration  have  been looking forward  anxiously  and

eagerly to seeing how the Court was functioning and

what  effect  it  has had on the life  of  Singapore,

particularly on the relation-ships   between   employers  and  employees   and   the

confidence that both these groups

have in the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I feel that our Courts of Law have established a

reputation in this country for their fair-mindedness and their sense

of justice; so much so  that anybody  wanting to fight anybody,

even  the  poor  man wanting to fight the

Government, says, "Put it to the Court.

Let  the  Court decide. I will be satisfied with  the

decision of the court." This

mental  attitude sfaows the confidence and the  faith

the  people have in our courts of justice, which  is  a

good thing. The

position I had hoped the Industrial Arbitration Court

would reach soon was that

it would be similarly viewed as our courts of justice

are      viewed.      Mr     Speaker,      Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



regret to say that the impact of the Arbitration  Court

upon  the public, both upon the employers and the large

sections  of  workers, has not been in the direction  I

had  hoped it would be. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, it is not

the   fault  of  the  Court  nor  the  fault   of   any

individuals.  But  I am venturing  to  suggest  to  the

Minister that it is the inherent weaknesses within  the

Ordinance itself that have created the situation  which

has  resulted  in  a  loss of confidence  both  by  the

employing public and the employees in the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put the thing in its proper perspective, I

wish  to  refer  to certain salient provisions  in  the

Conciliation and Arbitration Act, an Australian Act, by

which our Ordinance was inspired. The Conciliation  and

Arbitration  Act  of Australia, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  has

been amended up to 1959, and the position to date, as I

understand  it,  is  this. Under the  Conciliation  and

Arbitration Act, two institutions are set  up.  One  is

the Commonwealth Industrial Court, which is a judicial

court under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which

has  the  exact status of a Federal Court in Australia.

The  second  organisation under  the  Conciliation  and

Arbitration  Act  is the Commonwealth Conciliation  and

Arbitration Commission, which is not a judicial body in

the  sense  that the Commonwealth Industrial Court  is.

The function of the Commonwealth Industrial Court is to

deal with judicial matters under the Act. Mark you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  judicial matters  under  the  Act.  The

function   of   the   Commonwealth   Conciliation   and

Arbitration  Commission is to handle the  functions  of

conciliation  and  arbitration. So  the  Act  envisages

three   items-judicial  matters  under  the  Act,   and

functions  of  conciliation  and  arbitration.  Between

these  two bodies the whole of the industrial  disputes

is  determined.  The Commonwealth Industrial  Court  is

composed of a Chief Judge and not more than two Judges.

The  composition  of the Commonwealth Conciliation  and

Arbitration  Commission, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  composed

of  (a)  a  President,  (b) not less  than  two  Deputy

Presidents,  (c) a senior commissioner,  (d)  not  less

than   five   commissioners  and  (e)   a   number   of

conciliators. The difficulty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>



I   think,  we  have  reached  in  Singapore  is-and  I

seriously  suggest  it - that if we do  not  amend  this

Ordinance of ours, we will run into difficulties  which

will  bring  into  disfavour all our  Industrial  Court

proceedings. And that would be tragic. The  difficulty

in  Singapore,  as  I see it, is this.  The  Industrial

Arbitration   Court,  as  we  know  it,  performs   two

functions:  the judicial functions under the  Act,  the

function,  not  of  conciliation, but  of  arbitration.

Conciliation is vested with the Commissioner for Labour

and   his   conciliation  officers.  Conciliation   and

conciliation officers come under the direct control  of

the  Minister.  The  Minister is a political  creature.

Therefore,  as soon as you introduce the  Minister  and

his   Government   officials  into   the   conciliation

business, the matter tends to become political, whether

you  like it or not. So long as the Member for  Thomson

was  on  that side, it was not political. But  when  he

gets   to   this  side,  it  most  definitely   becomes

political. This is what we told the Government  before.

So  long as you have all the trade unions with you, you

can  give  the  matter a semblance  of  a  trade  union

dispute.  But  once you have two forces  in  the  trade

union field, equally balanced, striving for trade union

support  in  the trade union field, then  it  certainly

must become political.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter where it is definitely giving the

semblance  of  having  become  political  is  this.  In

Australia  either  party to an industrial  dispute  may

refer  a  matter  to either of these two  institutions.

Either  party to the dispute, or the court  itself,  or

the  commission  itself,  could  seize  itself  of   an

industrial dispute. So you see, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

position  in Australia is that the Act takes the  whole

field  of industrial disputes out of the hands of  the

Government.  As  soon as there is a possibility  of  an

industrial  dispute, the Commonwealth Conciliation  and

Arbitration Commission can seize itself of the  dispute

and  adjudicate  upon it. Either the  employer  or  the

employee  can  request the Conciliation  Commission  to

seize  itself  of  the matter and the  Commission  must

seize itself of it. Now, what is the position here?  It

is  this: If the employer wants to send it on  his  own

volition he cannot do it. If the employee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>



wants  to  sent  it  on his own volition,  against  the

wishes  of the employer, he cannot do it. Both must  go

to the Minister. But if there was no -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Both must go to the court.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. Both must go jointly. That is the

point. If one of them disagreed and did not want to go,

then  the Court could not be seized of it. Where  there

was disagreement between the employer and the employee,

both of them would have to go to the Minister, and  the

Minister  held  them both by the neck. It  is  so,  Mr

Speaker, Sir. I am sorry to say it is so. Then  if  the

Minister refused to move, nothing could be done.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Thomson says that if it is a

matter concerning a Government-sponsored union,  up  it

goes   to   the  Industrial  Arbitration   Court.   The

suggestion is that the only disputes that have gone  up

before   this  Court  are  disputes  in  which  P.A.P.-sponsored   unions   or  P.A.P.-favoured   unions   are

involved. That is the accusation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not necessarily.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It could be, even if the Member for Thomson

has  not  said it yet. He will say it one  day - most  as

suredly,  he  will - because the system lends  itself  to

such  an accusation. There are matters connected purely

with  the  law:  I do not know whether  they  now  come

within  the  ambit of the Commissioner  for  Labour  or

whether  they  come within the ambit of the  Industrial

Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Industrial Court

covers questions relating to the dismissal or injury of

an   employee   on   account  of   industrial   action;

interpretation  of  awards  made  by  the  Commonwealth

Conciliation  and  Arbitration  Commission;   questions

concerning    eligibility   of   membership    of    an

organisation; disputes between an organisation and  its

members;   power  to  hold  inquiries   into   disputed

elections; matters relating to the cancellation of an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>



organisation.  It  is rather an important  question -

matters   relating   to   the   cancellation   of    an

organisation.  Now  on  this  particular   issue,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, this matter is entirely within the  power

of the Minister in Singapore. The exercise of that power

has  resulted in one strike and it could have  resulted

in  another strike, but the Government was wise  enough

to step back a bit, and that was settled. Now what I am

suggesting  to the Minister is this. Let  us  put  this

Industrial  Arbitration Ordinance on a proper  footing.

Let us not tinker with it. Let us not say, "let us give

the Court half of the powers, let the Minister maintain

the  other  half of the powers," and so give industrial

arbitration a political flavour. Let us not do it.  Let

us take it outside the ambit of the Minister's control.

I entirely agree with the Government that there is need

for  such an Ordinance in Singapore, but let us  create

it  in such a way that it will not be possible for  any

section of the public to accuse the Government of using

it  for  its own political ends. If anybody is accusing

the Government of so doing it is because the scheme  of

things  under  the Industrial Arbitration Ordinance  is

such that the Government are open to such accusations.

All  I  am asking the Government to do now is  for  the

Minister to reconsider the whole position, as  he  said

he would when he moved the Second Reading of this Bill;

and   I  tm  suggesting  to  him  that  we  follow  the

Australian system more closely. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  let

us  not  throw  the Australian scheme  overboard.  This

scheme has been arrived at in Australia after years  of

experience.  It  now works there and  I  take  it  that

disputes  in the industrial field whether in Singapore,

Australia or in Timbuctoo take the same economic  turn.

It  is not a question of white, black or yellow in this

matter.  It is a question of economics and it tends  to

go  in  one  particular  direction.  So  let  us  avail

ourselves  of  the  Australian experience  and  try  to

formulate  legislation which will take away the  entire

field  of  conciliation and put it in the  hands  of  a

commission; and under the procedures laid down  in  the

Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it is possible for an

appeal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



to  be  moved  from  the decision of  one  Conciliation

Commissioner to a full Court of Appeal under the Board.

There may be a slight delay, I agree, but this tends to

create  confidence. The important thing  in  all  these

matters is confidence. If people have confidence  in  a

thing, they will take to it. Once they lose confidence,

then the whole position is lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I beg of the Minister to review the whole matter

in  the  light of what our Court has done. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I wanted to speak more on this, but unfortunately

time  is pressing and I want to give the Minister  some

time to reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has referred to what has

happened in Australia. I have here, Sir, the Free Press

of   Saturday  with  a  report  of  the  views  of  the

Australian  Labour Disputes Commissioner, Mr  Potters,

and I think his suggestions are very pertinent. He says

that  in Australia the Arbitration Court settled  about

90  per cent of the Labour disputes and that the  Court

should  be  composed  of independent  people  with  no

connection  with any political Party. Sir, I  think  we

need  to benefit from the experience of people in other

countries and we need it badly at this time. I  suggest

that  the  Government should not be too self-complacent

about  it and that it would take advantage of what  has

happened elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the present Industrial Arbitration

Court  has  not  got the capacity to  deal  with  cases

quickly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



There is a queue of six already and when I spoke to one

trade  union  leader  about  settling  his  dispute  by

referring it to the Court, he said, "Well, there are so

many cases waiting. If I were to refer the case to  the

Court,  I would have to wait for ages." I suggest  that

there should be another Court established.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have gone over all

this  ground before. I cannot agree with the submission

of the Member for Farrer Park that because conciliation

proceedings  take  place  in  the  Ministry,  there  is

therefore  essentially a political bias.  That  is  not

true.  When  a  dispute reaches the Arbitration  Court,

whether by a reference from the Minister or by a joint

reference  by  both parties, the Court  still  has  the

power to remit the case for further conciliation if  it

finds   that  there  is  still  room  for,   say,   the

continuation of negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained this in the Second

Reading  debate on the Industrial Relations  Bill.  The

function  of the Court, as we see it, is not  really  a

judicial process. It is more a legislative process.  In

conciliation  proceedings,  the  Ministry  offers   its

services   to   both   sides.  When  negotiations   are

deadlocked,  it tries to get both sides  to  reach  an

agreement.  When it fails, then the matter is  remitted

to  the  Arbitration Court and the Court then tries  to

get the parties together to reach an agreement. Now  if

the  Court  cannot get the parties to agree,  then  the

only alternative is for the Court to make the agreement

for the parties. That is not a judicial process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know there are certain groups of

unions  which do not like this Court any more  than  do

certain   employers.  Certain  employers   dislike   it

immensely,  because it has given decisions  which  they

dislike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the practice in the Australian

Court,  as I know it, is quite unlike the procedure  in

our  Court.  There  is  no system  of  Registration  of

collective  agreements  in  the  Australian   practice.

Collective  agreements are not required by  law  to  be

certified and registered by the Court.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, a greater majority

of  agreements  are  entered  into  freely  between  the

parties,  and it is these agreements which are certified

and registered. The disputes are a very small proportion

of  the  number of agreements registered.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  before  we  can make any review of the  Industrial

Relations Ordinance, I am awaiting the report  from  the

President  under section 83 of the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the need for a second Court is concerned,

there  is now a backlog developing and when we  proceed

to  amend  this  Ordinance, we  shall  provide  for  the

appointment of a Deputy President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like an explanation from the

Minister concerned regarding the Seamen's Registry Board - "Temporary Staff" and "Fees for Chairman  and  Author

$2,900".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the attention

of  the  Minister concerned to the fact that  people  in

Government -  whether  they be  temporary  or  permanent -

should not be biased. I find the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  of the Seamen's Registry Board  is  a  biased

person.  It  is  my opinion that he is too  communal  in

outlook. If the authorities concerned would like further

clarification, they could certainly enquire further into

the  matter. As the vote is paid out of the  pockets  of

the public, such an attitude on the part of this officer

is uncalled for. There is a great feeling of unhappiness

about the conduct of this officer towards Malay as  well

as  Chinese seamen. Sir, I do not like to dwell at great

length on this matter. I would like to see justice  done

in the Seamen's Registry Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know why $2,900 is to be paid for an auditor.

Is  there  not  already an auditor? What is  the  proper

reason for this? Is compensation paid from this vote  or

is  it  paid  from any other vote? I would like  further

clarification  on  this.  I  would  suggest   that   the

assistance  given to people who do not go to sea  should

be  increased because, at the moment, I feel that it  is

far short of what should he given to these people.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the Catering

Department,  I do not know whether it is the  policy  of

the  Board or whether it is the officer responsible that

the  opportunity for training is not given to seamen  or

to   people   who   are  keen,  but  to  new   entrants,

particularly  to Chinese only. Why should  this  be  So?

This is a matter of grave concern to me. There have been

complaints  made to me and I feel it my  duty  to  bring

them to the attention of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 46 he reduced

by $10 in respect of item (11) of subhead 9."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over item (4) of subhead 9.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to

the  staff in the Seamen's Registry Board, they are  not

Government  servants  but  employees  of  the   Seamen's

Registry  Board. Though their employment  is  temporary,

they  will  be  employed as long  as  the  Board  is  in

existence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the accusation that the Secretary of the Board

is  biased,  I have so far not received any  complaints

against him. However, all the staff have to work  under

the Board which is composed of representatives from the

union, the employer and the Government. I am sure  that

if  the Board receives any complaint of dissatisfaction

with these persons in the discharge of their duties, it

will  look  into  it. And if it is found  to  be  true,

naturally steps will be taken to meet the complaint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the "Fees for Chairman and

Additor" - item (4) of subhead 9 - Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

position is this. Previously the Chairman of the  Board

was  Mr  G. H. Kiat and he was paid a fee of $500  per

month.  On 15th October, 1959, the Government appointed

Captain Pavitt to be Chairman of the Board. He is also

the Master Attendant. He was appointed as Chairman in a

personal capacity, and not as a Government servant.  So

Capt.  Pavitt was performing his duties over and  above

his   functions  as  Master  Attendant  and  ex-officio

Chairman of other Government statutory boards for which

he  receives no fees, and it was decided that he should

be  paid  a  fee  of $200 a month as  Chairman  of  the

Seamen's Registry Board. This accounts for the $2,400 a

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Auditor, he is a Government

auditor.  The  auditor's  fee  is  $500,  and   it   is

understood now that the Government auditor has  reduced

his fee to $250. That is why there is a decrease in the

Estimates for this item for next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the recruitment of

seamen for the Catering Department, it is not true that

the   Board  is  discriminatory  against  Malay  seamen

working  in the Catering Department. The main point  is

that  in the Catering Department the employees have  to

handle  pork.  This  problem was therefore  brought  up

officially  by  the  Seamen's  Registry  Board  to  the

Muslims  Advisory  Board. The  Muslims  Advisory  Board

strongly  advised the Seamen's Registry  Board  not  to

encourage or induce Malay and Muslim employees to  work

in  the  Catering Department where they have to  handle

pork.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the selection of candidates for

training as stewards, the point is this, Sir.  Most  of

the people who have been seamen and have experience are

not very keen to register themselves for training. From

that point of view, we have to invite applications from

people who have never been to sea to be trained and  to

be employed in the Catering Department.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, one

question  has  not  yet  been  answered.  Probably  the

Parliamentary Secretary has forgotten it.  This  is  in

regard  to the new entrants. If I am not mistaken,  the

new  recruits  numbers less than a  thousand  Singapore

citizens. Which category of citizens is that? Why is it

that this is not open to all citizens of Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, so far we only

have  training  for stewards. As far  as  procedure  is

concerned,   whenever  any  person  is   required   for

training,   an   advertisement  is  inserted   in   the

newspapers.  A  Committee comprising the  employer  and

Government   representatives   will   look   into   the

applications,  interview  the  candidates,  and  select

suitable  candidates for training. These  recruits  are

trained only for employment in the Catering Department.

Therefore,  if the Member for Kampong Kembangan  is  of

the  opinion  that the Committee is prejudiced  against

Malay candidates, then the obvious reason is that  they

cannot be recruited into this sort of employment  where

they have to handle pork.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> Sir, perhaps the Parliamentary

Secretary  did  not quite understand me.  I  am  asking

about the Catering Department. What I want to know  is:

why  should vacancies for seamen be given only  to  the

Chinese and not to the Malays?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from my knowledge of the

Seamen's  Registry Board, the Board itself is  composed

of Government representatives, seamen's representatives

and  employers' representatives, and there  is  a  fair

representation   on   the   Board.   I   understand   a

representative of the Malay Seamen's Union  is  also  a

member of that Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Not a member of that Board? Well, anyway,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in the preparation of lists  of  new

entrants into the sea service, the Board looks  through

the  number of seamen that are on the register and  the

number  of those who have actually got jobs. The number

of  new  entrants is regulated in accordance  with  the

employment  position at any particular time.  If  there

are  more  jobs  in the sea service, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

more names will be put in the new entry lists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe for one moment

that  there is any such thing as discrimination of race

on the part of the Government in the preparation of the

lists  of new entrants into the sea service. It is  all

adjusted  in  accordance  with  the  opportunities  for

employment  at any particular time. If there  are  more

opportunities  for  employment, more registered  seamen

are  employed, and then only does the Board add to  the

list  of  new  entrants. But if, say,  there  are  more

seamen  out  of  jobs,  then  that  list  stays  at   a

standstill.  That is how it is operated.  It  is  never

operated on the basis of race.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> Can I make my explanation in

English.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> I do not mean to say that I do not

agree  with  the statement of the Minister for  Health.

But here is clarification or proof of what I have said.

I can assure the Minister that a member of the Seamen's

Registry  Board  who  was  recently  appointed  by  the

Minister  intends to join our union,  and  he  told  me

everything. I can send this man to see the Minister  at

any time so that the Minister could understand what  is

happening in the Seamen's Registry Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to know

from the Minister whether he intends appointing a

member of our union to the Seamen's Registry Board in

the interests of all the seamen of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it could well

be,  as  the  Minister for Health has said,  that  new

names  are  entered in the register  according  to  the

demands put in by shipowners. In the last eight  months

or so we have tried to step up the demand for seamen on

international routes, on which I think very  few  Malay

seamen  are employed. Malay seamen are mostly  employed

in  home trade ships and local trade ships and  not  on

international  routes. That is why in  the  last  eight

months  there has been a greater expansion. But if,  in

fact,  there  is  a suspicion or any possibility  that

Malay seamen are being kept out of the registry, I  say

it  is a very serious matter and I shall certainly look

into and resolve it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> What about the other question that I

put to the Minister - whether a member of our union will

be appointed to the Seamen's Registry Board?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister could give his

answer later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Ordinance itself does not give

representation  o, unions, but  there  are  seafarers'

representatives on the Board. It is usual  to  ask  the

unions  concerned  to  make nominations  and  for'  the

Minister to pick the names from the nominations made.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> Sir, I would like to remind the

Minister  for Health and Law that he recently appointed

from  our  union  a  member who  represents  the  Asian

Seamen's  Club. So why not do it, this  time?  For  our

common interests.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This probably can be settled outside

the Assembly Chamber, in the C.P.A. Room perhaps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are just two points upon

which  I  wish to touch. The Government has  now  taken

over  the  functions of the City Council. By virtue  of

that,  they  should now be maintaining the Jalan  Besar

Stadium  and the Farrer Park running track. I have  not

been  to  the Jalan Besar Stadium recently. But  I  was

there  some three months ago. The condition of some  of

the stands at the Jalan Besar Stadium is deplorable.  I

was wondering whether any particular Ministry is really

interested  in the amenities this stadium provides.  It

used to provide, Mr Speaker, Sir, fairly large sums of

money by way of revenue to the City Council. I dare say

that  similar  sums are being obtained from  the  Jalan

Besar  Stadium which now go into the Consolidated Fund.

I do ask the Minister in charge of Parks and Recreation

not  to  forget the Jalan Besar Stadium because  it  is

about  the  only  decent football  ground  we  have  in

Singapore. Not only are our State matches played there,

but  international visiting teams also, when they  play

matches  in  Singapore, do play those  matches  at  the

stadium.  Therefore, it is not only  from  the  amenity

point  of  view of Singapore that it is important  that

the stadium should be kept properly appointed, but also

from   the   prestige  point  of  view,   so   far   as

international touring teams are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is the Farrer Park running

track. The land there was acquired by the City Council

from the Trust and laid out at some expense, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>



order  that  it  might provide amenities  for  athletes

which were not available to them. As far as I am aware,

Sir, when I was in the City Council, the track was well

maintained  and  there  were  no  complaints  from  the

athletes. I now understand the tracks are so hard  that

no  amount of spikes, however sharp they may  be,  will

enter  the ground. I myself have not been there, but  I

have  been  told of this by the athletes  who  use  the

tracks. I have no reason to doubt their statement  that

it  is impossible for them to train there. Some of  our

athletes  are  now in the S.E.A.P. Games competing  and

trying  to  bring  Singapore on  the  sporting  map.  I

understand   Government  has  also   contributed   some

$60,000, for which, I am told, the athletes are  really

grateful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> $16,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> $16,000 - I beg your pardon. I knew the

Government was generous, but I did not realise  it  was

that  generous. But the point I am trying to make, Sir,

is  that all this money is ill spent if facilities  for

training for our athletes are not available. The Farrer

Park  running track was perhaps the only one which  was

available. I do not think we should let the  track  run

down.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there is one

point here I would like to stress. We would like to ask

the  Government to consider amending the Parks  by-laws

and  regulations governing the use of parks.  My  Party

applied for permission to use Hong Lim and Towner Parks

for political rallies. Although the police did not give

us any trouble over our applications, the. Park by-laws

and  regulations though were quite obstructive, and  we

were  not able to hold these mass rallies. In  view  of

the   Government's   contention  and   assurance   that

democracy should be given full play, and in view of the

fact  that Government want to allow us full freedom  of

speech  and discussion, I would urge them to look  into

these old by-laws and consider amending them.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon is not

here. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> First, the Jalan Besar Stadium. I

have not been there for years. But like the Member  for

Farrer Park, I do get reports, and the reports have not

been  too  favourable. Bits of roof are  falling  down.

Generally,  the standard of comfort there is  not  what

one  would  expect of a modern city like Singapore.  Of

course, something has to be done about it. The question

is what has got to be done about it? When the Four-Year

Development Plan was first conceived, various proposals

were  made.  The  Jalan  Besar  Stadium  was  discussed

because   it   was   inadequate  to  provide   sporting

facilities that a modern city needs. Unfortunately,  at

that time, the alternative put forward for inclusion in

the plan was the building of a really grandiose stadium

somewhere  around Bukit Batok. This was a  tremendously

expensive  scheme and was rejected from  the  Four-Year

Development Plan because it was too expensive  and  too

far  away, and we thought that perhaps some renovations

to  the  Jalan Besar Stadium would meet the point.  But

since then, of course, we have had to pay attention  to

more   urgent   matters.  This  aspect  of   developing

amenities for the city was neglected. I think the  time

has  come, and we are grateful to the Member for Farrer

Park  for  bringing up this point to  us.  I  think  we

should  have a second think about this matter. What  is

the  best way of doing it? I am not quite sure. We have

to  get opinions from experts and evaluate alternatives

before we come to a decision. I think we have to decide

very  soon.  After all, our neighbouring countries  are

pressing on. Kuala Lumpur has the Merdeka Stadium,  and

is  pressing on with another one. Djarkata will have  a

$100 million covered stadium. Although one regrets that

money  has  to  be  spent on these things - it  does  not

provide future employment prospects - I think there is  a

case for a review of the whole position. If indeed,  it

seems  that the track at Farrer Park has gone down,  if

it  has  deteriorated through neglect and not  through,

the  drought, then I think the matter is quite  urgent.

Apart from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



that,  I am afraid I am not in a position to give  more

concrete assurances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as for the point raised by the Member for Nee

Soon,  I  am glad to hear that he acknowledges that  we

are leaning backwards to be democratic. We have allowed

them,  within  the  rules of the  game,  all  the  mass

meetings they need, or the mass meetings that they have

applied  for.  But  when it comes  to  playgrounds  and

children's parks, we have to balance interests.  If  we

allow  a  mass meeting to be held in these playgrounds,

it  does mean, Mr Speaker, Sir, depriving children and

parents  of  the use of the parks for that evening.  Of

course,  the Barisan Sosialis may say that the  message

they  want to put across to the people of Singapore  is

so  urgent  and  so  important that  it  outweighs  any

temporary inconvenience which we have to impose on  the

children and parents. But I say that that is a  trivial

issue.  Government,  of course, does  not  accept  that

point  of view. Therefore, in our opinion, the  by-laws

of  the  City  Council governing the use of  parks  and

children's playgrounds should stand.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the explanation

of  the Minister for Finance does not answer our point.

For instance, let us come to Hong Lim Green. It was the

place  in  which, if I remember correctly,  the  P.A.P.

fired   its   first  salvo  against  the   old   S.P.A.

Government.  Not so very long ago, we  had  a  big  by-election in Hong Lim, and I do remember the Member  for

Hong Lim managed to get a huge crowd to that place  for

his mass rallies. The Government also held two or three

mass  rallies there and found that they were  not  very

well  attended.  It might very well  be  that,  because

Government feels that it might not be able to fill  the

place  should it hold a mass rally there and  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis might very well fill the place  over-brimmingly, it thinks there is no need  to  revise  or

amend the regulations. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think if  we

had  a  mass rally, the children as well as the parents

would  have  as much fun as, nay, much more  fun  than,

they  would  usually have, because of the exposures  of

the Government and all its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>



nefarious  activities.  I  would  seriously   urge   the

Government to reconsider amending these regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point about the Jalan Besar Stadium is this.

Since  the  Minister  has given an  assurance  that  the

Government   is   looking  into  the  possibilities   of

repairing  the stadium - I hesitate to suggest, Sir,  that

it  is  really  serious about sports and  recreation  in

Singapore  - it  is not the Jalan Besar Stadium  that  it

should  rebuild or repair, but it should  build  a  new

stadium  in a much bigger place with a bigger  stand.  A

very  good  suggestion is to convert the present  Farrer

Park  into  a brand-new stadium. When I was a member  on

the  Singapore Amateur Sports Council, I suggested  that

it  would  be  best  to build a stadium  with  aid  from

Government, say, on a dollar to dollar basis,  and  with

contributions from the public. The Sports  Council  did

get  going on this project. Actually we visited the site

once   or   twice,  but  somehow,  after  I   left   the

Government, my name was automatically left out  of  the

Sports Council, and that was the last we heard about the

stadium.  Should  the  Minister for  Finance  feel  like

reviving  the  whole  idea, I  do  not  mind  giving  my

services  for  sports  and for recreation  and  for  the

people  of  Singapore. Perhaps the Minister for  Finance

will think about that one.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I will think about that one

and  a  lot of others! But coming back to this  meeting.

First,  during the Hong Lim by-election, mass  meetings

were,  of course, held from 7 o'clock onwards, when  the

people  have had their dinner and the children  were  no

longer  playing on the fields or had left  off  playing.

Outside  the  election  period  or  by-election  period,

public  meetings can only be held during  the  hours  of 5.00  p.m. to 7.00 p.m. Of course,

if mass meetings  are

held  there, children could be deprived of  the  use  of

these  facilities. However, Sir, I am reassured to  hear

from  the  Member for Nee Soon that the Barisan Sosialis

mass  meetings  would  provide an  uproarious  time  for

children and their parents. Of course, it would, because

the utter absurdity of their propositions cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



fail  but  draw laughter all round. While I can  commend

this  light-hearted approach to politics as an  argument

in  favour of allowing parks to be used during the  time

children  want  to use them, because the children  would

enjoy  the mass meetings and laugh louder than  if  they

were  playing in sand pits, I do not think that  is  the

purpose  for which the Barisan Socialis hold their  mass

meetings. They have a more serious purpose, and if  they

provoked  laughter and merriment, I suggest to you,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is not because they intended to do so.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is typical of

the  P.A.P. to shift the issue when they get caught.  It

is  no  laughing matter, Sir,It is nothing trivial.  If

the people come to our mass rallies, and enjoy coming to

our  mass  rallies - as they did  only  yesterday - it  is

because  we  could explain the issues to the  people  in

simple  common language; it is because we can expose  to

the  people  the  nefarious  activities  of  the  P.A.P.

Ministers  in  the  Government. If they  feel  there  is

something to laugh at - well, some people like to laugh at

tragedy, and if the people want to laugh at the  tragedy

of  the  P.A.P. Government, I do not see why they should

be stopped from laughing. After all, they can either cry

or  laugh; and under the P.A.P. Government they  can  do

either one of those things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, if the argument is that if the meetings

are  held  from  5 p.m. to 7 p.m. it would  deprive  the

children  of  the facilities offered by the  playground,

might I advise the Minister to look into the possibility

of  lifting  this  ban of not having  meetings  after  7

o'clock? In the Federation of Malaya, mass meetings  are

allowed  at  night.  I  see no  reason,  Sir,  why  mass

meetings  should not be allowed at night  here.  If  the

Minister's argument holds good, that if the meetings are

held at night the children will not be deprived of their

playing  time between 5 and 7 p.m., I would  commend  to

him  the suggestion to amend the police regulations  and

allow mass meetings to be held after 7 o'clock so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>



we can kill two birds with one stone. Recreation parks

can  be  used by children between 5 and 7 p.m., and  by

adults after 7 p.m. I think that is a strong point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I find the Minister's proposition a

very silly one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Which one? Farrer Park or - ?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I am sure you will remember that in

1955  or  1956, the Prime Minister gave a very  lengthy

speech  in this House criticizing the former Government

for denying police permits to hold rallies after 7 p.m.

I  think the Prime Minister did say, in criticizing the

previous Government, that it only believed in democracy

before  7  p.m. I have no doubt that all this  talk  of

rules  and regulations is just to put forward  excuses.

We  are told that we cannot hold political meetings  in

the parks because some rule in some rule book says they

can  only be held during election time. We are told you

cannot  have  rallies after 7 p.m. because  again  some

rule  in  some rule book says so. Let us get the  thing

straight. Either we believe in democracy or we  do  not

believe  in  democracy. [Laughter] There is nothing  to

laugh  at. We have been accused of being people who  do

not  believe in democracy and who are working to  break

the democratic system. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And we tell the Government in very plain and

simple  language  if you believe in  democracy,  remove

these rules. You hold meetings in parks, car parks, any

playing field, in the streets, anywhere, from 7 o'clock

in  the morning to 12 o'clock at night. We do the same.

Let  us  both go and meet the people. Let us  not  have

artificial rules and regulations which seek to restrict

the democratic rights of the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I might remind hon. Members on

the  Opposition benches that they are, in fact,  eating

into their own time, because we might go straight on to

social welfare if they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



will try not to egg the Government to egg them on. Dr

Goh, very briefly?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Certainly, Sir. Just a couple of

words.  The  Member  for Thomson says  my  remarks  are

silly, but I was just developing a theme. As  if  it

can  be a silly thing put forward by the Member for Nee

Soon,  which  was, that he thinks his Barisan  Sosialis

must  think  it is glorious fun for kids.  I  say, of

course, if that is so, then we must think seriously -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is repetition, Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now as regards the lifting of the

time-table, the Member for Thomson says if  you  cannot

hold  mass  meetings before 7 p.m., it is undemocratic;

after  7  p.m., it is democratic. Sir, we  have  always

suspected  and  we have said that the Barisan  Sosialis

have  always been night birds. Why do they want to have

meetings, after midnight? There you are, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.  But  to say that democracy depends on  just  what

time  to  hold mass meetings, to me there  is  no  more

ludicruous proposition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The truth is that the P.A.P.

nowadays  dare  not  meet the people.  They  have  been

saying that we did not hold any more rallies after the first  two. The real reason is simply that we were  not

given the opportunity to hold rallies. We asked for  an

opportunity to hold a rally in Hong Lim -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is opening out the issue. Does the

Member for Farrer Park wish to take a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,456,330 for Head 47 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 48 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48, he reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Social Welfare Department is very

strenuous.  The  Director of  Social  Welfare  now  has

responsibilities for three kinds of works, in  addition

to work in relation to Social Welfare, he has to be the

Acting  Administrative Officer  of  the  City  Council,

where  his duties are also heavy. At the same time,  he

is  also  the  Secretary and Treasurer of the  People's

Association. He has to shoulder three kinds of  duties.

During  the present strike by the staff' of the  People

Association, the Secretary made a statement  which  was

full  of  political colour, it may be due to  the  fact

that he has many duties to shoulder. That is why he did

not keep his status as a civil servant by making such a

political statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Member

for Pasir Panjang wants to do is to accuse the Director

of  Social Welfare of being biased against  those  ex-employees of the People's Association who went to a so-called  strike.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  true  the

Director  of  Social Welfare holds three  appointments,

but   as  far  as  the  appointment  of  Secretary  and

Treasurer of the People's Association is concerned,  he

is  appointed  because, under the People's  Association

Ordinance,  he  is  to be appointed  as  Secretary  and

Treasurer  of the Association. We quite appreciate  the

Member  for  Pasir Panjang's anxiety over this  officer

being  over-worked.  But  as far  as  this  officer  is

concerned,  he has been carrying out his work  properly

and has not made any complaint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation that he has been

politically biased, the position is this, Mr  Speaker,

Sir. He is the Secretary and Treasurer of the People's

Association   and  is  merely  an  employee   of   this

Association.  So  whatever statement he  makes  in  the

Press  is  not his own. It is merely the  view  of  the

Board.  He  just carries out instructions.  So  in  any

organisation whatever statements are to be issued would

normally be issued through the Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just wondering under whose

Ministry the People's Association comes. I am not quite

certain. Is it under Social Welfare?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yes. May I explain, Sir? All the

financial   provisions  are  made  under   the   Labour

Ministry,  but  as  far  as  the  management   of   the

Association is concerned, it is managed by the Board of

Management.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point I was trying to get at is

whether  or not this is the proper Head under which  to

discuss  the  People's Association as such.  I  do  not

think it is. It should have come under the Labour Head,

as far as I understand it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Did I understand from the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for Labour  that  all  the

emoluments  in  so far as the People's  Association  is

concerned  come under the head of Labour and not  under

Social Welfare?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> The Social Welfare Department is

also part of the Labour Ministry. Therefore, since  the

People's  Association comes under  the  Social  Welfare

Department, personal emoluments are provided under  the

Social Welfare Department. The management of the  staff

and  the administration of the People's Association  is

by the managerial board.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Parliamentary Secretary point

out   where   the  emoluments  are  for  the   People's

Association?  Is  it  under Head  48  or  Head  47,  or

whichever Head it is? We must get this correct.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect to

your ruling, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not ruled yet.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Your suggestion, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I want to know first where are

the   personal  emoluments  of  the  employees  of  the

People's Association?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I might be able to explain on

behalf   of   the  Parliamentary  Secretary.   We   are

discussing the People's Association under this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



Head, because in the People's Association Ordinance the

Secretary Treasurer of the People's Association is  the

Director  of Social Welfare and it is from  this  Head

that he draws his salary. He is not a paid employee  of

the  People's Association. I feel, therefore,  this  is

the  correct  place to discuss the People's Association

in respect of its Secretary Treasurer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> and <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Everybody is in such a hurry. I want to

get the solution to this question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will give you the solution, Sir.

The  Minister for Home Affairs has just pointed it out.

It is on page 421.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is under Social Welfare.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Under subhead 4.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see. Then it is the correct Head in

any case. Mr Wee was replying, was he not?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> You have asked me to clarify under

which  Head this subject matter would be. I  think  the

Deputy Prime Minister has pointed it out to you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation. I have already refuted

it.  As  far  as  the Secretary and  Treasurer  of  the

People's  Association  is  concerned,  he  is  only  an

employee of the Board. So he carries out the policy  of

the Board.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The answer is, this is the proper Head

under which the' People's Association can be discussed.

And I think it is the moment of interruption.
