<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge, Sir, that the Housing and

Development  Board is the largest statutory  body  in

the  Republic.  It has an annual budget approximating

$1,000 million. It is also common knowledge that  the

HDB is ruler of more than half the population. As its

building  statistics  go up,  which  is,  of  course,

commendable,  it  becomes  more  and  more  powerful,

"ruling" more and more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



people with each passing day. It is expected that  by

1980,  some 75% of the population will be  living  in

high-rise  flats, for it is an inexorable truth  that

high-rise  living will be a way of life for  most  of

us,  whether  we  like  it or  not.  Apart  from  the

effective  leadership,  our political  stability  and

economic  progress, the  HDB's  successful   housing

programme  has in many ways reflected the  Republic's

multifarious achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must point out that as a consequence of

all  this  success  - a consequence  that  is  rather

disconcerting there appears to be a deterioration  of

administrative  efficiency and effectiveness  in  the

HDB.   This  is  especially  true  in  planning   the

provision  of  recreational  facilities  in   housing

estates   in   New  Towns.  I  say  this   with   all

seriousness. It is a growing sore point which  should

be  checked. A fully developed New Town can  engender

and stimulate the growth of a crop of urban problems.

In   years   to  come,  these  problems  can   assume

insurmountable  proportions  unless  there   is   the

administrative skill, efficiency and effectiveness to

stem the tide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be true that the Estate Area Office and the

HDB  Headquarters are monitoring the  situation.  But

from what I have personally experienced over the past

three months at Bedok New Town, there is a whole host

of  shortcomings. I do not mean to say that I am  not

getting   the  full  cooperation  of  the   officials

concerned.  Far  from  it. My relationship  with  the

Estate Area Officer and his officials is, at the best

of  terms. They are even present at my monthly  meet-the-people  sessions or forums  where  they  have  to

answer  some of the queries made by the residents  on

matters pertaining to HDB policies. My complaints are

more in the area of decision-making and prompt action

in  attending to problems or requests made either  by

the  residents or through me. All important  matters,

Sir,  have  to  be  referred to the  Headquarters  in

Maxwell   Road.   Strange  as  it   may   seem,   but

nevertheless true, matters and problems pertaining to

Bedok New Town have to be referred to the Area Office

in  Marine Parade. Why, Sir? Because there is no Area

Office in Bedok New Town. This is not so bad. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



another  New Town that I know, the residents have  to

travel  quite  a long distance to pay their  rentals,

etc.  However,  I am glad to hear that  the  plan  to

construct the new Area Office in Bedok New  Town  has

been  finalised and construction will start very soon

and  it  is  expected to be completed by  early  next

year.   My   point  is:  why  is  the  planning   and

construction   of   the   Area   Office   not    done

simultaneously  with the moving in  of  residents  to

avoid  unnecessary inconvenience and grumblings  from

them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, for almost two years now, the

children  and the youths in Neighbourhood I of  Bedok

New   Town   have   no  playground  or   recreational

facilities.  They  are thus forced  to  play  in  car

parks,  in  the estate's by-roads, void  decks,  open

spaces  between blocks, and at the concrete concourse

at  the  market and hawker food centre  which  causes

annoyance  to  the  residents.  Yet  there  are  five

hectares  of  open  space which is  earmarked  for  a

miniature  park  and recreational facilities.  It  is

being  planted  with trees and one section  has  been

fenced  in  with barbed wires. The barbed wires  have

been  removed recently after the residents  had  made

complaints  through  me and direct  to  the  officers

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the rationale behind all this? I know why

the  HDB did this. They do not want the children  and

the  youngsters to play in it. Could  you  imagine  a

population  of  16,000 more than half  of  whom  are

young  people,  without a single place  for  them  to

play? I have made some suggestions to the Area Office

as  to  how the problem of lack of playing facilities

could  be  temporarily solved.  I  suggested  to  the

officials  concerned to remove some of the  trees  to

somewhere else so that the children could play  there

temporarily  until the open space was developed.  But

they  had  no authority to act as such matters  could

only be decided by the top officials at Maxwell Road.

However,  I  am  happy to inform the House  that  the

Minister of State has recently announced in his reply

to   an   Oral  Question  that  the  development   of

recreational facilities for Neighbourhood I would  be

carried  out  soon  and that it  is  expected  to  be

completed by early next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Development Board is naturally

primarily  concerned with achieving  targets  to  cut

down  the  waiting  period for  applicants.  This  is

accepted.  But  in  the anxiety to  meet  targets  of

building flats, a lot of things tend to be overlooked

in  some areas. In the case of Neighbourhood I  where

the  population  is  now  concentrated,  the  general

complaints  that  I  receive from residents  are  the

conspicuous  absence or lack of playing  grounds  and

recreational  facilities, whereas  the  residents  of

Marine  Parade who moved in at the same time  as  the

Bedok  New Town residents are enjoying all  Sorts  of

facilities and amenities which are provided not  only

by  the Housing and Development Board but also by the

Singapore Sports Council and the Parks and Recreation

Department of the Ministry of National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to avoid such situations which could easily

lead to misinterpretations and grouses by disgruntled

residents,   would   the   Minister   for    National

Development and Communications consider proposing  to

the  HDB  to delegate more powers to the Area  Estate

Officers  who,  in  fact,  come  directly  under  the

Estates  Department, which is within the Estates  and

Land  Division  of  the HDB, so that  they  can  make

decisions  that  are urgent and obvious  without  the

time-consuming   necessity   of   having   to   refer

everything to Headquarters at Maxwell Road.  If  this

is done, Sir, it will cut down a lot of the customary

red-tape,  bureaucractic  muddle  and  much  of   the

official arrogance that is sometimes experienced.  It

will lead to greater efficiency in the management  of

the housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new towns like Bedok New Town, which may not be

very large in terms of size, are nevertheless densely

populated  when  the  flats are fully  occupied,  and

therefore concern the lives and livelihood of  people

from  all  walks of life. A fully developed New  Town

could house as many as a quarter of a million or more

people  in the Republic, and that is no mean  figure,

considering the Republic's total population  of  just

over two million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to make this special

request  to  the Minister in regard to planning  and

development    of   recreational    facilities    in

Neighbourhood II of Bedok New Town. It might  be  an

administrative oversight or bad planning on the part

of   HDB   that   in  the  case  of   residents   of

Neighbourhood  I  who had to wait almost  two  years

before   they   could  get  their  playgrounds   and

recreational facilities -

neighbouring  countries. We have been  obtaining  our

beef  requirements  mainly  from  Australia  and  New

Zealand  at  very  high cost to  the  consumers.  The

recent agreement signed with Thailand to proceed with

the  joint  project on cattle raising for  export  to

Singapore  is indeed a welcome move. May  I  ask  the

Minister  whether this project includes the provision

of veterinary services and abattoir facilities to our

partners  in Southern Thailand? Furthermore,  whether

there  are any plans to start a similar project  with

other   ASEAN  countries,  for  instance,  Indonesia?

Finally,  whether such a project will help to  reduce

the cost of such beef in Singapore?



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, members of the

public  are  so  confused as to which  department  is

actually  doing  the  day-to-day  work  relating   to

planning. The Development Control Division broke  off

from  the Planning Department in 1974 and came  under

the wing of the Building Control Division of the PWD.

Members  of  the public who need advice  in  planning

matters  have  close  contact  with  the  Development

Control  Division rather than the Planning Department

which  only  deals  with the long term  Master  Plan.

Since   the  Development  Control  Division   is   an

important department in Singapore, dealing  with  the

construction of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



buildings in the private sector, change of use,  etc.

its  status should be upgraded as a Department on its

own directly under the Ministry. Not enough publicity

has  been  given to the public as to which department

deals  with  Government projects or  those  from  the

statutory  boards  and  which department  deals  with

applications from the private sector. I have had many

queries  from  the  public on the confused  state  of

affairs. Even some professional people do not seem to

know  that part of the Planning Department's work  is

done  by the Development Control Division, where many

Town  Planners  are employed. Since  the  Development

Control  Division is a very important department,  it

should be part and parcel of the Planning Department.

It  is senseless and illogical to split the two. They

should  be  merged  in  the interest  of  expediency,

efficiency,  prestige and, last but not least,  there

will be less confusion among members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in 1966 the Development Control Division

was  taken  out  of the Planning Department  and  put

under the Chief Building Surveyor's Department.  That

caused  utter confusion. In 1970, it was returned  to

the  Planning  Department. In 1974,  the  Development

Control Division was taken out again and this time it

was  put  under the Public Works Department.  Why  is

there all this confusion? Would not the staff be also

puzzled? It is about time things were put right  once

and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Control Division's officers and

planners are doing a good job by providing the day-to-day  service  to the public on planning problems  and

advice. This is the feedback which I got from members

of  the  public who often approached me  on  planning

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago the former Chief Planner resigned

from  the service and migrated to another country  to

take  up  a  post  there. Why is the  post  of  Chief

Planner still vacant? Are there no suitably qualified

local town planners with experience to fill the post?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is being done to upgrade the long service staff

in  this  department who have reached the maximum  of

their salary scale? If something is not done to boost

their  morale and provide incentives, the experienced

and  dedicated ones may resign and go away  to  other

countries, like the former Chief Planner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, touching on urbanisation, I wonder what is the

policy  of the Building Control Division in  granting

permits for different lots of land. I have received a

number of complaints that many adjacent lots of  land

have  been granted permits with different conditions.

For instance, the first lot of land is given a permit

to  put  up  an  eight-storey building,  whereas  the

adjacent lot is not even permitted to put up  a  six-storey  building.  There seems to  be  some  sort  of

discrimination  here.  May  I  know   what   is   the

guideline?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have also received complaints from some

people  that the Building Control Division  does  not

permit  some  homes to hold group prayers,  and  they

give  a  lot of trouble to the occupants. Why  cannot

they  allow  the  people to carry on  their  prayers?

After  all,  they  are  not causing  any  problem  to

anyone. Could the Minister clarify this point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, on the 21st

March,  1975, in this House under your able guidance,

I  brought up the matter in regard to the deletion of

certain  clauses  from the Sand and Granite  Quarries

Regulations,  1971,  when the  Ministry  of  National

Development  took  over  the  enforcement  of   these

Regulations from the Ministry of Labour and  replaced

the  1971  Regulations with the 1974  Regulations.  I

wanted  to  know  why  this was done  as  it  clearly

disadvantaged  the  workers'  health   due   to   the

lessening  of  the  dust  control  measures  and  the

reduction  of  medical checks. Free  silica,  a  dust

pollutant,   emitted  from  granite  quarries,   when

inhaled,  can  cause a pulmonary disease,  silicosis,

which  is a dreadful disease indeed; it is incurable,

rendering  the ones inflicted a painful  and  useless

life resembling the living dead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to my queries on the deletion, the Hon.

Minister for Law and National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



Development said [Hansard, Vol. 34, 21st March, 1975. col. 785]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for Potong Pasir referred to

the deletion of two important clauses in the Sand and

Granite Quarries Regulations of 1974. There seems  to

be  substance in what he says. I was not aware of the

deletion of these two clauses. Perhaps there is  good

reason, but there does not appear to be. But  I  will

look  into  these regulations and reinsert these  two

clauses if that should be done.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on 24th November, 1976, the Member for Toa

Payoh  queried the deletion of certain  clauses  from

the   1971  Regulations  when  the  1974  Regulations

replaced  them. The Minister for National Development

and Communications in reply stated [Hansard, Vol. 35,

24th November, 1976, cols. 1071 and 1072]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, these Regulations were deleted because in

drafting  the  1974 Regulations, the Attorney-General

had advised that it would be undesirable to duplicate

provisions  which  already  existed  in  some   other

legislation. The deleted Regulations are  covered  by

the Factories Act. 1973.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the only regulations contained in the

Factories Act deleted were Regulations 20, 21, 22 and

23 which I accept, and these were not the regulations

that  came  under query by the Member for Toa  Payoh.

Regulations  11, 12, 13. 16, 17, 18 and  19  are  the

ones  that  must be included in the 1974 Regulations.

These  are  the ones pertaining to dust  control  and

health  measures  that, without  which,  could  cause

health problems not only for the workers but also the

people  living  around  the quarries,  many  of  them

squatters  with no knowledge of the dangers.  Due  to

the absence of these clauses dust levels from the HDB

quarry  in  Mandai, for instance, continue to  remain

high.  It  is about time the Ministry took action  to

restore the Regulations to an effective state.  I  am

sure  the  assistance  of the  Ministry  of  Labour's

Industrial Health Department can be sought,  for  are

they not Government experts on industrial health?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I would like to say mainly concerns the

Housing  and  Developing Board. I  reserve  this  for

amendment (6)*.  (See Col. 1476.)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Sir, I am glad that

when  the Member for Bedok mentioned that the Housing

Board will be ruling quite a large proportion of  the

population of Singapore, he mentioned "ruling" within

inverted  commas. Let me assure him that the  Housing

and  Development  Board does not  seek  to  rule  the

people  of Singapore but seek to house the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit puzzled by his remarks. He said that

there  was no delegation of authority to the officers

to  make  small  decisions  and  yet  he  found  them

helpful, co-operative and prompt in taking action. If

there  had been no delegation of authority, the staff

would be unable to take prompt action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that we know that the Housing

Board  is expanding and will soon be managing a  very

large  proportion  of  dwellings  in  Singapore.   In

keeping   with   modern  management   methods,   only

important  policy  matters are  decided  in  the  HDB

headquarters  and, wherever possible, administrative

and  routine  procedures are delegated to  the  local

officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the planning of new towns. It would be

ideal  if  we  can at the same time provide  all  the

facilities  of  a  town as well  as  housing.  Marine

Parade  has  been  quoted as  an  example  where  the

residents  are  able  to enjoy living  in  very  good

quality  flats  and  at the same time  have  all  the

facilities  available. It is  the  same  with  Bedok.

Wherever possible, Sir, we would like to provide  all

the facilities at the same time but perhaps there may

be  some technical reasons for being unable to do so.

Our  first  priority, of course, is  to  provide  the

housing,  and  here  I  think  the  Member  is  quite

satisfied  that an assurance has been  given  to  him

that   the  recreational  facilities  he  seeks   for

Neighbourhood I will be completed very soon and  work

is going on in Neighbourhood II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning for a new town, there are certain basic

principles. The town shall be self-contained. As  far

as  possible,  it should have a town  centre,  sports

facilities, playing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



fields,  parking areas. When the plan is being  drawn

up  the  Housing  Board would normally  consult  with

other  Government  agencies, such  as  the  PWD, the

Sports  Council and even the bus company so that  all

the  necessary amenities could be provided. Also from

time to time we get feedbacks from residents, and MPs

too,  about  shortages of certain requirements  or  a

lack  of  facilities in some of the towns. Where  the

suggestions  are useful they are adopted.  Therefore,

suggestions from MPs are always welcome when  we  are

planning   a  new  town.  I  think  that  should   be

sufficient answer or clarification for the Member for

Bedok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister recently visited Thailand and

concluded  an agreement with the Thai Government.  In

that  agreement, there  is provision  for  a  cattle

project  in  a  joint venture between  the  Marketing

Organisation  for  Farmers  of  Thailand  (MOF)   and

Singapore's  Primary  Industries  Enterprises  (PIE).

This   joint   venture  will  enable  our  veterinary

surgeons  to participate in the management of  cattle

rearing  in  Thailand for export  and  it  will  also

enable  our veterinary surgeons to examine the cattle

before export to Singapore to ensure that they do not

suffer from any disease. So this project will give us

an  additional  supply  of cattle.  Whether  it  will

really  help to lower the price of beef or  not  will

depend upon a lot of factors.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one would expect that with more avenues of

supply,  prices are likely to fall. But  here,  as  I

have said, it depends upon a lot of other things, for

instance,  transport  cost and  feed  cost.  But  our

purpose  here  is, of course, to try to  find  a  new

source  of  supply  to Singapore.  If  we  have  more

supplies  available, prices would naturally fall.  In

addition,  the  MOF and the PIE have  also  formed  a

joint   company,  the  Sing  Thai  Grains   (Private)

Limited,   to   promote   the   marketing   of   Thai

agricultural  produce in Singapore. Of course,  where

suitable joint ventures with other countries in  this

region  are proposed, they will be welcome.  We  will

join  with  other ASEAN countries in promoting  joint

ventures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has a very good insight into

what  is going on in the Planning Department  in  the

Ministry of National Development. But to put  matters

straight,   let  me  first  say  that  the   Planning

Department  is concerned with long-term  and  medium-term  planning. It is concerned with the Master Plan.

In  other words, the Planning Department is concerned

with  the use of land in Singapore, subdividing  them

into zones for certain specific uses. The Development

Control  Division  is  the enforcing  department.  In

other  words,  it  sees to it that where  a  building

construction  is being undertaken, it should  conform

to  the  Master Plan or to the plan drawn up  by  the

Planning  Department. These are the different  roles.

The  Planning  Department will deal with applications

for construction from statutory bodies and Government

departments, whereas the Development Control Division

will deal with applications for construction from the

private sector and from the citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little surprised that the Member should

mention that there is confusion among members of  the

public  as  to  the roles these two  departments  are

playing.  This arrangement was set up in  1972,  that

is,  four  years ago, and I do not expect members  of

the   public,  especially  the  architects  who   are

professionals in their own right to be confused  over

this division of labour. He has said that the BCD  is

performing a very important role because it  enforces

planning control, In a small island like Singapore it

is  imperative that there should be careful  use  and

allocation   of   land,  otherwise   we   will   have

residential areas side by side with factories and the

whole  place will be polluted. The BCD is playing  an

important role and, as such, he has suggested that it

should be upgraded to a department. At the same time,

he  has  suggested that it should be a  part  of  the

Planning  Department.  I think  there  is  a  bit  of

confusion. But no matter what it is, I think what  he

is  trying  to stress is the importance  of  planning

control in Singapore. I fully agree with that because

it   should  be  the  only  authority  to   see   how

construction should be undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a bit worried about opportunities for

promotion in the department itself. Like most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



Government departments, there are ample opportunities

for  good  officers to be promoted. We  have  a  very

unbiased  and a very wise body consisting of  private

members  who  sit  on  a promotion  board  for  civil

servants,  namely, the Public Service Commission.  As

hon.  Members know, there is a new Government  policy

whereby  good officers are promoted in spite  of  the

fact  that  there are no posts. They are promoted  on

their  own  merit  without having  to  wait  for  the

creation  of a post. Therefore, there are  very  good

opportunities for promotion for very good officers in

the   Planning  Department  as  well  as   in   other

Government departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the specific case of the Chief Planner.

The Chief Planner was dismissed from service in 1973.

As  a  result of that, a division took place  between

the  Planning  Division and the  Development  Control

Division.  At  one time there were  quite  a  lot  of

irregularities  and  laxity in enforcing  development

control. That was one of the reasons why probably the

Chief  Planner was dismissed. Then the Deputy Planner

left  us for greener fields abroad. At the moment  we

have  an  acting Chief Planner, and when he  will  be

promoted will depend upon a promotion exercise by the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mentioned about inconsistency in allowing

development   between  adjacent  parcels   of   land.

Normally  it  is  unlikely that there  will  be  much

difference  between development allowed  on  adjacent

pieces  of land. But, of course, there must  be  some

difference.  The adjacent pieces of land  may  be  of

different  shape or they may be of irregular  shapes.

They  may  be smaller or bigger. But on the whole  it

depends  on  the zoning. If they are in an industrial

zone  and  the  pieces  of land  are  side  by  side,

planning  for industrial use is allowed and the  plot

ratio  would almost be the same. I am unable to  tell

him why or where the difference is in the example  he

quoted, unless he gives me more specific details.  If

he  really wants to know why it is so, perhaps he can

get the information by sending in a Question for Oral

Answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he wants to know why the Building Control

Division gives notice to a congregation of people who

say prayers in the morning in a residential area.  As

I  have said, in a small island like Singapore  where

there  is hardly any elbow room, we have to  be  very

careful  about  the  usage of land.  I  do  not  know

whether  the  Member would like  to  have  a  Chinese

wayang  playing every morning next to his  house.  He

shook his head. He does not like it. Similarly,  when

a  congregation  of people meet every  morning  in  a

residential area, they are bound to create some  sort

of nuisance. Therefore, probably complaints have been

received from neighbours, and that is the reason  why

notice has been given to them to stop meeting in  the

morning  for  prayers in a residential area.  We  are

very careful about illegal use.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification. The house owner is praying inside  his

house.  What is the objection of the Building Control

Division?  The people are praying inside  the  house.

What   is  the  objection  of  the  Building  Control

Division  and  why must they stop it? There  is  also

discrimination  because  nobody  disturbs  the  other

houses  where praying is also being conducted.  There

are so many other places where there is praying. They

are  not disturbed. This is the only place where they

come  and disturb. What is the reason for that?  That

is  discrimination, is it not? There  must  be  equal

treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Victimisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Victimisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not single

any person or any group of persons to victimise them.

I  do not know the case. For all I know, it may be in

a  very  quiet residential area. If the  house  owner

concerned  has  got permission for use  as  a  prayer

house, the Building Control Division will not disturb

him. However, I am speaking "in the dark". He has not

given  me the address. Unless he gives me the details

of the house concerned, I am unable at this moment to

tell him whether or not permission has been given for

its  use as a prayer house or whether it is in a zone

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



places   of   worship.  But  if  he   wants   further

clarification,  then let him send in a  Question  for

Oral Answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Members will appreciate that it is not

possible for me or even for my colleague, the  Senior

Minister of State, or for any Minister, to be able to

give   in   detail  specific  replies   to   specific

questions. We are only able to tell Members generally

the  kind of policy that we pursue. But when  Members

bring up specific instances, it is beyond us to  give

a  detailed reply there and then. Perhaps some of the

queries which have been raised during this debate  by

hon. Members from time to time could best be answered

through  written Questions for Oral Answer.  This  is

one  of  them.  However, if the Member will  give  me

further details, I might be able to satisfy him as to

why notice was given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has again raised the

question of the missing clauses. We have taken up his

suggestion  and  we  are  in  consultation  with  the

experts in the Labour Ministry. We hope to solve  the

problem  soon by including the necessary  clauses  in

the new regulations.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before

withdrawing  my  amendment,  I  would  just  like  to

complete my sentence just now when you cut me off, so

that the sentence would not be left hanging - "I hope

a  similar situation will not happen to residents  in

Neighbourhood II and other Neighbourhoods in the  New

Town."  Since  the Minister has given a  satisfactory

reply  and  an  assurance that this  thing  will  not

happen, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

Ng Kah Ting and Teo Chong Tee).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the last few years I have

spoken   about   the  favourite  hobby   of   certain

departments, that is the digging of roads. Even today

we still find many roads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



being  dug, filled up, re-dug, filled up, and re-dug,

so  much  so that some roads seem to be in  perpetual

disrepair.  Is the co-ordinating body really  working

to  make  sure  that  all necessary  excavations  and

repairs  are  done at the same time? It also  appears

that  when the roads are levelled up, the workmanship

and  materials  seem to be poor. Very often  we  find

that the gravel come loose particularly after a heavy

rain.  Therefore, the material and workmanship should

be  properly checked by the authorities.  Whether  or

not they check them, God knows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that many traffic circuses at road junctions,

like  the ones at Tanglin, MacRitchie, etc, are being

converted     into    traffic    light     controlled

intersections. Why were these circuses constructed in

the first place? Do these conversions help in any way

to alleviate traffic jams?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take MacRitchie circus as an example. The

removal  of  the  circus has not solved  the  traffic

jams; worse still, it has become a dangerous accident-prone   area.  Lately,  many  people  were  seriously

injured or killed at that place because of accidents.

When  there  was a circus, there were  no  accidents.

Since  removal of the circus, many accidents occurred

resulting  in death. Something must be done  to  make

sure  that  there  is  proper  planning  before   any

modification is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at Keppel Road which is in my constituency,

there  is  a railway line which runs across the  road

near  the Cold Storage Building. This is an accident-prone  area  as many serious accidents have  occurred

there.  If  one takes a look at the fence  along  the

railway ground which is beside the road, he will  see

that   it   has  been  damaged  because  of   traffic

accidents. Another area which seriously needs  to  be

looked  into  is  the bend along  Kampong  Bahru  and

Kampong  Lama  Road.  This bend  is  so  narrow  that

vehicles  going up to the Singapore General  Hospital

are  literally running on the five-foot way meant for

pedestrians. This five-foot way is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



generally used by school children living in the area.

Many  serious accidents have occurred in  that  area,

the  most  recent one involved an MID  vehicle  which

rammed into the shop-houses. I think hon. Members may

remember this accident. I wonder whether any measures

are  being  taken  to  modify  these  areas  so  that

accidents  can be minimised. If this is not  done,  I

would  request  the  authorities to  look  into  this

immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that most of our pedestrian overhead

bridges  are not properly utilised. It is a waste  of

money. Pedestrians find it inconvenient to use  these

bridges.  A typical example is the one near  Clifford

Pier. Who is using this bridge? Nobody is using it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I use it!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On the other hand, underground

passes seem to be better utilised. This is evident by

the  number  of people using the underpass  near  the

Esplanade  and  also  the underpass  at  the  Merdeka

Bridge leading to the National Stadium. I suggest  we

should consider having more underpasses than overhead

bridges.  It  is  a waste of money. Nobody  uses  the

overhead bridges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I use them.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, touching on the question of

overhead  bridges, I wonder whether a  simple  bridge

can  be  erected  across  the  railway  grounds  from

Spottiswoode  Park  to Keppel Road,  because  at  the

moment  there are many illegal gaps along the  fences

of  the  railway grounds and people make use  of  the

railway  grounds  as a short-cut. I personally  think

the  construction of this bridge would  certainly  be

welcome by residents who are mainly Port and hospital

workers living around Spottiswoode Park, Asia Garden.

hospital quarters, Everton Park, etc. It is not in my

constituency.   It   is  in  the   Prime   Minister's

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certain sections of the railway track have

become popular short-cuts for many office and factory

workers. This has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



going  on  for  a  very  long time.  However,  it  is

dangerous  to  use the railway track as  a  shortcut.

Sometime  ago, a young factory girl was  on  her  way

home  from Delta Road to Kampong Bahru after  a  late

shift  duty.  She was taking a short-cut  across  the

railway  track when her foot was caught  between  the

railway line. She could not get her foot out in  time

before the night train from Kuala Lumpur ran over her

and killed her.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent accidents, why not construct a pedestrian

path  running parallel to the railway tracks? To  say

that  it  is  illegal  to go through  the  holes  cut

through  the railway fence is tantamount to taking  a

negative attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that I have mentioned this, I hope the

authorities would take steps to ban the use of  these

paths which have been in existence for so many years.

The  solution would be to construct pedestrian  paths

beside the railway lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a wise move on the part of the PWD to

build  concrete footbridges across drains and  canals

to  facilitate  pedestrian  movement.  Unfortunately,

very  few  of  these crossings have  railings  During

inclement  weather these footbridges become  slippery

and  when  there are floods, there is a great  danger

that  pedestrians might fall into the flooded  drains

and canals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last year there was a case of a young girl

who  was  washed away after falling from the slippery

path into the flooded drain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the authorities would take steps to

construct  railings  along  all  footbridges   across

drains and canals.

Chong Tee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

two  points  to  make  in respect  of  this  subhead.

Firstly, I am inclined to agree with the hon.  Member

for Anson in regard to road digging in Singapore. The

Government's  efforts  to reduce  traffic  congestion

will  not  go  very far if the PWD keeps  digging  up

roads from time to time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



Although  there is improvement, there is  still  room

for  further improvement, as it is still causing much

inconvenience to motorists. No sooner has a road been

properly  resurfaced before it is broken up again  by

the  PWD,  the TAS or even the PUB. This  shows  that

there   is   no   proper  coordination  among   these

departments  concerned. The  cost  of  this  lack  of

coordination  can  be  measured  by  the  amount   of

precious   time   lost  due  to  traffic   congestion

resulting from constant road-digging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I was given to understand that most PWD

area contractors are reluctant to give quotations for

small  jobs  and,  if  they do,  the  quotations  are

usually  high.  They usually pass the  jobs  to  sub-contractors. In order to prevent abuses  by  licensed

contractors, the PWD should not allow these  licensed

contractors to monopolise all Government minor works.

Should the Government not look into the licensing  of

small-time contractors and make tendering  for  minor

works  more  competitive? This will  save  a  lot  of

public funds and get improved services.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Changi said that

licensed  contractors submitted high  quotations  for

small  jobs  and  suggested that perhaps  minor  work

projects should be awarded to smaller firms. The fact

of  the matter is that minor work projects are  being

awarded  to small firms under the present contracting

system.  To give the Member some figures, the  Roads

Branch, for example, has been awarding an average  of

570  contracts per year for the past three  years  to

small firms for minor works and this is valued up  to

$7,500 each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the query of both the Members for Anson

and Changi on the constant digging and re-digging  of

roads  and  the  need to maintain proper  roads,  the

reason for this constant digging is obviously due  to

the  stepping  up  of works in the public  sector  in

recent  years. Obviously, with this increase  in  the

public sector development there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



corresponding  increase in the need  to  lay  utility

services,  and  a  considerable proportion  of  these

utilities  are on public roads. One of the  rules  of

the    Coordinating   Committee    responsible    for

coordinating all these utility services is to  ensure

that  traffic  flow is maintained and  that  adequate

safety  precautions are also taken. However, if  more

than  one utility department proposes to lay services

in  any one single road, the Committee will obviously

have  to  ensure that only one service be laid  at  a

time.  Otherwise  the whole road  would  have  to  be

closed   to  traffic.  These  successive  laying   of

services is, therefore, unavoidable. It would not  be

possible, for example, for the PUB and the TAS to  do

the services together. So depending on the nature  of

the  project, whether it is the laying of  cables  or

water  mains,  they have to take turns.  I  can  only

assure   both  hon.  Members  that  the  Coordinating

Committee is trying its level best to coordinate  its

activities  and periodically we have  come  out  with

statements   to   explain  and  apologise   for   the

inconvenience caused to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the quality of maintenance of these roads,

perhaps  I  can  merely say that this is  also  being

properly  supervised  as best as  we  can  under  the

conditions  of  digging  and  the  need   to   re-dig

periodically. Normally, when a road is  open  to  the

public,  only  the first base or what  you  call  the

asphalt  base  is laid. During this period  when  the

first  base or the asphalt base is laid, the road  is

open  to  the  public and surface irregularities  are

sometimes  noted and have to be rectified because  it

need  to  be  settled. Laying of  this  asphalt  base

requires  something like six to 12 months  before  it

could  be  properly settled. During this period  when

the  road  is open to traffic we need to periodically

re-lay  the  surface.  When it  is  properly  settled

according  to  specifications, it  is  reasonable  to

expect  that the quality of that surface  would  last

from six to 10 years. Whether or not it lasts six  to

10 years depends on the intensity of use of the road.

That  means it depends on whether it is used by heavy

commercial  vehicles or light vehicles, and  it  also

depends on the extent and frequency of usage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assure both hon. Members, I can say that the

Public  Works Department has set what is called  high

standards for the quality of materials to be used and

the  workmanship in road construction, and tests  are

periodically  being carried out to  ensure  that  the

contractors  comply  with  these  specifications.  In

fact, as a deterrent, contractors who do not come  up

with   the   right  specifications   or   show   poor

workmanship  will  be debarred from tendering  future

contracts. This is being carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the seven other questions posed by the

Member for Anson. He has questioned the need to  have

a  traffic  circus and then the need subsequently  to

demolish    the    circus    because    of    traffic

considerations. He also queried on the accident-prone

situation  after  the conversion  of  the  MacRitchie

Circus.  Perhaps I can summarise and say that traffic

circuses were built in the early days when the volume

of  traffic was extremely low. But traffic conditions

change  over a period of time, as we see now and  the

conversion  of  MacRitchie Circus  to  ensure  proper

traffic  flow  is  absolutely necessary.  The  latest

example  is the removal of the beautiful fountain  at

Tanglin  Circus.  It  had to be  sacrificed  so  that

traffic  flow  in the two directions of Tanglin  Road

and Grange Road could be more effective.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has questioned that by converting the

MacRitchie  Circus  back  into  traffic  lights,  the

traffic  situation  has  not improved.  I  think  the

answer  is  obvious. Because of this conversion  more

traffic   flows   in   the   direction   of   Thomson

Road/Braddell   Way,  perhaps  to   avoid   the   ALS

restriction  in  the morning. We  have  done  surveys

which  show  that the traffic flow has  increased  at

this converted traffic lights in MacRitchie area. The

reason for the higher accident-prone state may be due

to  speeding  by motorists along Lornie  Road  or  to

speeding near the junction of the traffic lights.  In

order  to  minimise this, the PWD has  put  up  signs

along approach roads to Lornie Road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



warning  motorists to slow down. We are also  looking

into the possibility of reversing the traffic flow at

the   entrance  and  exit  of  MacRitchie  Reservoir.

because  the  entrance to MacRitchie  Reservoir  goes

directly out to the traffic light junction.  This  is

being examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question posed by the Member for Anson was

whether  steps could be taken to modify Keppel  Road.

This is again due to the accident-prone area. At  the

moment,  no  plans  have, been made  to  reduce  this

situation  because of the railway-level  crossing  at

Keppel Road, but the Ministry will look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which he has mentioned is near the bend

at Kampong Bahru Road and Kampong Lama Road. There is

also no proposal to widen the road because both sides

of  the road are heavily encumbered. However, we will

try and improve the bend at this particular junction,

and  perhaps  we will also incorporate  some  warning

signs, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member questioned the usefulness of overhead

bridges and quoted Clifford Pier as an example. I beg

to  differ  from  him.  I think  the  air-conditioned

overhead bridge at Clifford Pier is heavily utilised.

The  reason  for better use of the underpass  at  the

National  Stadium  is mainly due  to  soccer  nights.

Except  for  those  nights, I  think  it  is  totally

unused.  He  has  suggested  the  need  to  build  an

underpass.  The  obvious reason is that,  all  things

being  equal, the cost of an underpass is  much  more

expensive  than  an  overhead  bridge.  Cost  is   an

important factor in influencing the decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then brought up the question of having a

bridge  erected  across Spottiswoode Park  to  Keppel

Road.  He  also  suggested that to prevent  accidents

along  railway  tracks  simple  pedestrian  paths  be

constructed to run parallel with railway tracks.  The

answer  is  very  straightforward.  These  properties

belong  to  the Malaysian Railway Authority,  and  it

will  be  difficult to expect them to agree  to  have

these  pedestrian bridges constructed across  railway

tracks. The same answer applies to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



his earlier question - usage is minimal, and moreover

we  are actually dealing with a foreign authority  in

this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested that there should be

proper  railings along all foot bridges across drains

and  canals. The answer is that the PWD does  provide

railings  along all bridges across large  drains  and

canals, and the railings are omitted only along those

footway  slabs that are narrow. However, the Ministry

will  continue  to look into the need for  safeguards

against  dangerous  conditions  at  all  drains   and

railings  will be provided if the conditions  warrant

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the matter of the underpass

that I have not told the House is my own opinion.  It

is  up to the House to agree or not to agree. Anyway,

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BDA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

Ahmad Haleem, Lee Yiok Seng and Ng Kah Ting)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some officers in the Building Control

Division  who adopt repressive measures and a  biased

attitude  in  carrying  out their  duties.  This  has

occurred  in  Geylang  Serai  constituency.  Let   me

illustrate to this House a case in point, hoping that

it   will   merit  the  attention  of  the   Minister

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constituent of mine started a small electrical

shop   for  the  repair  of  refrigerators.  He  duly

registered  his  business in  1970  and  possessed  a

business  licence. He took up residence at his  place

of business in 1960 and his business was flourishing.

Previously  he  had  never  received  any  complaints

either  from  the  landlord or from officers  of  the

Building  Control Division. However,  after  mid-1976

officers from the Building Control Division called at

his   shop  and  handed  him  some  forms   for   his

completion.  There was a space in the form  requiring

the  signature  of  the landlord.  But  the  landlord

refused  to  pen  his  signature.  Just  because  the

landlord refused to put his signature, the small shop

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



question  was  considered  illegal  as  it  had   not

obtained  the  prior  approval  of  the  landlord  to

corroborate  it.  But all these years  the  shop  had

never been considered unauthorised or illegal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was action initiated as a result of an instigation

received   by   officers  of  the  Building   Control

Division?   As   far   as  I  know,   there   was   a

misunderstanding between the landlord  and  the  shop

proprietor.  If the officers of the Building  Control

Division   had   taken  action  because   they   were

pressurised by one party, and if the incident I  have

narrated is true, there is indeed cause for shame  on

the  part  of  the Government. This  line  of  action

should  not have been initiated by civil servants  in

the first place. Government officials are expected to

render  assistance as best as they can  to  the  poor

people', who  are often exploited and  oppressed  by

haughty  and  arrogant  landlords.  This  is  not  an

uncommon feature in our country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, the Member for

Geylang   Serai   has   mentioned   an   unauthorised

electrical  shop,  but  there  are  also  many  other

unauthorised businesses, like motor garages,  as  far

as  the Building Control Division is concerned. These

businesses have been run for more than five years and

they  do meet the needs of the residents in the area.

But  now the Building Control Division officials come

along  and  say, "Your business is unauthorised.  You

have  to move out." Usually these officials are  very

sympathetic and allow them an extension of  time  and

also  tell  them to find alternative sites.  But  for

most  businesses, especially the motor garages  which

carry  out their business in an open ground near  the

homes of the owners, it is very difficult for them to

find  an alternative site because they cannot  get  a

site  authorised to carry out the business of a motor

workshop as all motor workshops are now under control

and  they  have to be resited at specific places  and

these have to be tendered for. At the same time  they

cannot get the place because the tender is high.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these businesses, like the motor garages do

meet  the  needs of the residents there, but  because

they  cannot pay the cost, they cannot carry on  with

the business. May I suggest that perhaps the Building

Control   Division,   in   conjunction   with   other

departments, look into this matter  to  see  whether

they  could  allow the business, if it  has  been  in

existence  for more than five years, on compassionate

grounds, to be relocated at another site temporarily,

if not permanently, until such time that it can get a

proper place to carry out their business, because the

owners are usually unable to get a site of their own.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Song (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

in  the  rural areas many of the dwelling houses  are

made  of  wood,  zinc,  or attap.  These  are  called

temporary structures because the materials used which

are mainly of wood, zinc or attap, will corrode after

a  period  of time and will need repairs. But  before

any  repair work can be done, the occupant has to get

permission  from the Building Control  Division,  and

any  offence of unauthorised repair work, will render

the structure liable to be demolished. Therefore,  an

application  for  permission is very  important,  and

must be made according to the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the procedure laid down by this Division is

very   cumbersome  and  the  requirements  are   very

stringent.  The  applicant  must  fill  in   a   very

complicated  application form and  he  must  get  the

authorised  signature of the landlord. He  must  also

have  a  sketch map showing the locality,  a  drawing

plan  of the structure indicating the nature  of  the

repairs   and   other  things  besides.   All   these

conditions are very difficult to comply with and  are

highly inconvenient to these residents. Sometimes for

personal  reasons the landlord would not  consent  to

give  his  signature, and therefore  the  application

cannot be sent to the authority for approval. In  the

meantime,  the  dwelling  houses  have  fallen   into

disrepair; like it or not, they must be repaired.  It

is very urgent and necessary for them to repair these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



houses.  Therefore,  without the  permission  of  the

Building  Control Division, many of them  are  forced

willy-nilly to carry out the repairs themselves, thus

breaching the relevant laws. And the Government  also

does  not hesitate to demolish these structures,  and

consequently  these  unfortunate people  suffer  even

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that these unpleasant things have occurred

mainly because of the stringent procedures laid  down

by the Building Control Division. If these procedures

can  be simplified so as to enable the people to make

an application more easily, I believe such unpleasant

things  would not have occurred. Therefore,  I  would

like  the  Minister  to  consider  whether  he  could

simplify   the   procedures   for   processing   such

applications,  or alternatively to agree  that  where

the  repair  of these temporary structures  does  not

exceed 50% of the structure, then no application need

be required.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, the hon. Member for

Bukit  Panjang has succinctly criticised the Building

Control  Division  about  its  strict  procedure  for

application for repairs to buildings. In the past, on

numerous  occasions,  Members have  appealed  to  the

Minister  concerned for easier means to  enable  such

applicants to obtain the required permit to carry out

minor repairs to their existing buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the Budget last year I made out a

case for a more simplified form of procedure so as to

speed  up the processing of applications, which would

enable the applicants to carry out repairs earlier. I

have  to  mention that to-date nothing much has  been

done to simplify applications for repairs. Therefore,

I  have  to reiterate my point with a recent example.

On the eve of the Lunar New Year a zinc roofed hut in

Florence  Road in my constituency was  damaged  by  a

falling  coconut tree. I got a call from one  of  the

occupants  and  advised  her to  make  the  necessary

report not only to the police station but also to the

authorities  concerned. I believe that all  this  was

done;  but  up  to  last Sunday when  I  visited  the

family, I was told



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



that  approval for repairs has still not been  given.

The impression I got was that it would take about one

or  two weeks more. Sir, just imagine a coconut  tree

falling  on  to  a building and resting  on  it;  and

fortunately  the  occupants escaped injury;  and  yet

they  have  to live in that house in this  state  for

more  than a month now. I would expect the Department

concerned  to  be  not  only  sympathetic   in   this

particular  case  but  also  to  help  expedite   the

occupant's application for repairs so that work could

be carried out soonest possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask: Why must she wait for so long? We have

made pleas in this House to consider this point.  Not

everybody  knows  where  the  Ministry  of   National

Development  is.     Say, from Punggol they  have  to

come down all the way to Maxwell Road. They must know

which floor the relevant department is, and there are

21  floors in that building. Which department  to  go

to,  who to see, where to inquire, and how to get the

application  done? The Member for Bukit  Panjang  has

made  out one case, and with four Members listed down

to speak on this topic, I believe the Senior Minister

of  State  for National Development should look  into

the  matter  of  drawing up a  more  simplified  form

whereby  applications for minor repairs  to  existing

buildings can be approved much sooner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I must inform this House that

sometimes it may well be that the building inspectors

have  been  too  enthusiastic in carrying  out  their

duties  and  for  minor  infringements  against   the

building  bye-laws or failure to comply with  certain

regulations, for  example, an  application  for  the

construction  of  a lean-to shed  just  to  hang  out

clothes  has  been  turned down despite  requests  to

reconsider  the  retention of  such  structures.  The

reply simply reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This matter has been duly considered and that it

does not comply with the building requirements. Thus.

it  is  regretted that the request cannot be  acceded

to.'



<br><br>This   kind  of  reply  is  very  general.  We   must

understand the plight of these people. In  the  rural

areas, as Members have pointed out,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



such  buildings are of a temporary nature. They  hold

temporary  permits of $12 each.  So  why  do  we  not

consider  this  factor and allow  retention  of  such

structures  as well? At the same time,  the  Building

Control Division's officials concerned should not  be

over-enthusiastic but be more flexible  in  enforcing

the building requirements.

support  of  the  two hon. Members  who  have  spoken

before me. There is no exaggeration of the fact  that

to try to get approval for even very minor repairs to

these  so-called temporary structures  in  the  rural

areas  can be a very frustrating experience. In fact,

in  many  cases two departments are involved  because

most  of the land in the rural areas are State  land.

In  order  to get approval from the Building  Control

Division one has first to obtain the approval of  the

Land Office. So he goes to the Land Office. The delay

here  will  be several weeks, if not several  months.

Then  the  matter is in turn referred to the Building

Control Division who again delays for several  weeks,

if not several months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I can quote one particular case. I am not

making  up  the story. My constituent, having  waited

for  months, got rather impatient. He came to see  me

and  brought to my attention the fact that the  delay

has  gone on for far too long. So I gave him a letter

addressed  to  the  Department  concerned.  When   he

presented  my  letter  there,  he  was  told  by  the

officer, "Well, you saw your MP. I am going  to  make

matters  worse for you." Sure enough, he has  had  to

wait longer than someone who has applied much later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Write to the press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I do not know about writing to the

press.  Sir, the time has definitely come for  us  to

look  at  it positively. Year after year, Members  of

rural constituencies have been bringing to this House

the  same old problem about the delay on the part  of

the   Building  Control  Division  and   the   rather

inflexible attitude of its officers who go  round  to

see  whether there is a breach of Building  rules.  I

did  mention the other day in this House that someone

who was using his kitchen to do a bit of business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



of  frying kropok just as a sideline was not  allowed

to  do  so on the ground that the house is a dwelling

house  and  is not allowed to be used for  industrial

purpose.  I  cannot  imagine by any  stretch  of  the

imagination  that frying kropok can be considered  as

using the place for industrial purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is high time that we looked at the

problem  positively.  Sir,  I  must  thank  you   for

allowing  me  the time to speak because  I  have  not

filed an amendment on this subhead.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments

expressed  by the various rural MPs. I can  say  here

that  I do not condone total inflexible attitudes  on

the part of the Building Control Division. In fact, I

would take exception if the hon. Member's letter  was

used  as a ground to further delay any action. I  can

assure  the House that I would take strong action  if

that is so. If there are incidents of that nature  or

indications  of unfair tactics being  used  by  civil

servants,  in  particular the  Ministry  of  National

Development, to frustrate the good efforts of MPs,  I

would   appreciate  if  Members  could   send   their

complaints  direct to me, and I assure  them  that  I

will   personally   and  directly   deal   with   the

responsible officers. [Applause.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me perhaps come straight to the query by the

hon.  Member  for Geylang Serai. He has  pleaded  for

sympathetic  consideration from the Building  Control

Division on the case of an unauthorised usage.  First

of  all, he should understand that registration of  a

business  does not mean that a permit to  operate  is

being  given. You can register a company or  whatever

you  like, but the place of operation still  requires

an  official permit. He insinuated that the  Building

Control Division is being used by one party to  press

the  other  party  for action to  be  taken.  Let  me

categorically  state here that the Government  cannot

and  does not encourage the unlawful use of  land  or

premises  or the unauthorised erection or  occupation

of  buildings, whether they are on State land  or  on

private  land.  It  is  the present  policy, and  my

Minister  has earlier explained the need  for  proper

building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



controls  to  ensure  proper usage  of  land  in  the

respective zones. If it is necessary to ensure proper

control  of building development in the whole  island

of  Singapore,  then  I think it  is  necessary  that

applications for planning permission must be properly

processed,  and one of the requirements is  that  the

owner of that property must give his consent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated that in the case of this

particular  complainant,  the  requirements  of  that

particular  property  may  not  coincide   with   the

interest of the owner, depending on the case, or vice

versa.  This is actually an issue between  the  owner

and the tenant, and I think the BCD is in no position

to intervene. I would suggest to the hon. Member that

perhaps  he  can offer his good services to  the  two

parties concerned by trying to persuade the owner  to

agree to a modification in the application for change

of use, and the Ministry will definitely consider the

application according to its own merits. If,  on  the

other  hand, the hon. Member would rather prefer  the

Ministry to explain the situation, we would  be  very

happy to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Telok Blangah has voiced the

need to allow motor garages to operate in areas where

they  are needed by the residents. I presume he means

areas  in  residential zones. He also asked  that  if

they have been in existence for five years and above,

proper  official priority of resettlement  should  be

given.  The  answer is obviously no.  Here  again,  a

motor  garage  or workshop that serves  a  particular

need  in  a  particular residential zone must  comply

with  the  necessary  Building requirements.  And  he

himself  has  said  that there is need  for  control.

There are proper workshops in HDB estates and perhaps

even  at  some  alternative areas in JTC  where  such

business activities can be carried out.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he does not mean the business of servicing

and  lubrication  of  cars,  because  this  is  being

carried  out  in petrol stations all over  Singapore,

even  in  the  Central area. We have  already  got  a

problem  of  resettling authorised  premises  in  the

Central area - that is, the clearance of all types  of

related



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



motor  business, not only of motor garages. We cannot

cope  with  the problem of resettlement. Yet  he  has

suggested  that  we load ourselves with  illegal  and

unauthorised usage of land. It is difficult to expect

the Government to consider at this juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the plea of the rural MPs, in particular

the  Members  for  Bukit Panjang, Punggol  and  Jalan

Kayu.  I  am  in sympathy with them.  But  I  beg  to

disagree when the Member for Punggol said that we are

not  doing  anything. I cannot remember exactly,  but

maybe  partly because of him or some other MPs; after

the  Budget session in March 1976, the Ministry  went

ahead  to modify the application procedure -  correct

me  if I am wrong. In fact, I would be happy to  take

up   this   matter  again  if  whatever  I   say   is

contradictory  to  what  he thinks  it  is.  I  stand

corrected.  According to the BCD's information  given

to  me,  minor repairs and alterations which  do  not

involve reconstruction or the addition of floor areas

do   not  require  planning  permission  or  building

permit.  In  fact;  a  person can  apply  for  a  "No

objection" letter. A "No objection" letter means just

a  letter  to proceed with the work. It is a  letter,

not  a  permit, from the BCD to carry out  any  minor

repairs   and  alterations.  In  this  respect,   the

landowner's  consent  is also not  required.  On  the

other  hand,  if  the  repairs  and  alterations  are

extensive and involve rebuilding and additional floor

areas, then planning permission, building permit  and

the landowner's consent will be required. That is the

procedure from the information given to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of simplifying procedure. The

procedure   in  applying  for  extension  and   minor

repairs,  as I have said, has already been simplified

since the middle of 1976. As an example, in the past,

an  applicant has to submit two separate applications

for  the same extension and minor repairs: one to the

Development  Control Division for  planning  approval

and the other to the Building Control Division for  a

building   permit.   But  now  one   application   is

sufficient.   I   have   also  information   on   the

simplification  of procedures, if  hon.  Members  are

interested. In the past, generally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



speaking,  something like 11 copies of five different

types  of  forms  were required to be submitted.  But

now,  the applicant only needs to fill one form,  and

only  four copies are necessary. The reason  for  the

need to have sketch plans is that it is difficult for

the  Building Control Division itself to know exactly

which  particular  plot in the  rural  area  that  is

referred to. It could be a stituation where the  site

concerned  is  Government land  and  therefore  comes

under the Ministry of Law. So it is necessary for the

applicant  to tell us exactly where the  location  is

when  applying  for repairs or minor extensions.  The

BCD,  being  in the Ministry of National Development.

therefore, requests an indication of where  the  site

is.  But if, on the other hand, where there is a need

to  coordinate, perhaps I can suggest to the  BCD  to

look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Bukit Panjang has suggested that

if the repair area is less than 50% of the structure,

then  no  permit should be required. I  have  already

indicated  that,  from what BCD has  told  me,  minor

repairs  and  alterations  do  not  require  planning

permission  or building permit. But I can pursue  the

matter  further if he could tell me roughly  what  he

has in mind so that I can refer his suggestion to the

Building Control Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point made by the Member for Punggol was about

the unnecessary delays in granting approvals. He gave

an  example of an application to repair a  zinc  roof

which was made during the Chinese New Year season and

that  up till now no permit has been given. I  cannot

give any excuse on the part of the BCD. But if it  is

a straight-forward and simple application for repairs

and if the damage is not extensive, I think it should

not take a month or so. But, s'.s he has said, if  it

requires  another two weeks for approval, I would  be

happy  to  look  into it if he wants  to  pursue  the

matter further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the comments that the officers are

unnecessarily  over-enthusiastic and  critical, here

again, I think one must appreciate that it depends on

the degree of enthusiasm. I share the sentiments made

by the three rural MPs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



who  have  spoken, that if it is for  minor  repairs,

such  as  changing one plank in a wall, and they  are

making  a  big  fuss  about it,  then  by  all  means

complain.  They can complain to the highest authority

if  they  choose to do so. But, on the other hand,  I

cannot  believe that all members of the staff in  the

Building  Control Division are of that nature.  There

could  be  one  or two members of the staff  who  are

unnecessarily  uncooperative.  Here  again,  if   the

Member feels that there is unnecessary impediment  on

the  part of the officer, let us know and perhaps  we

can give him some good advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore sum up by saying that as far as

the simplification of procedures for minor repairs is

concerned,  it is being done. If it could be  further

simplified,  we would be happy to look  into  it.  If

hon.  Members have good suggestions on how to further

simplify   the  procedure,  we  will  welcome   their

suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Senior Minister

of  State  has  gone to great length to explain  that

there  have  been some modifications to simplify  the

applications  for  repairs.  Whilst  the  application

format  might  have  been  simplified,  it  does  not

necessarily  mean  that  delays  do  not   occur.   I

mentioned  this case in particular to  establish  the

point about the delay in approving such applications.

All  I am saying is that the Ministry or the Division

concerned should look into the question of expediting

such  applications,  that  is  to  say,  they  should

expeditiously approve these applications.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that the

BCD,  in  particular should expedite the application.

If  it  is  a  situation as in the case that  we  are

talking about, that is, a minor repair, then I  agree

that there should not be an unnecessary delay. But if

the  repairs are of an extensive nature, then I think

the minimum requirements of a planning permission and

building permit must be complied with. And, as I have

said,  that depends on how many parties are involved.

However, if the delay is on the part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



of  other Government departments or Ministries,  then

it  is incorrect for me to suggest that the delay  is

due  to  this party or that party. But as far as  the

BCD  is concerned, if it pleases the hon. Member,  we

can,  of course, send them a reminder to suggest that

the  applications  should be expeditiously  processed

but  with the proviso that there is always a  minimum

period  required. I can tell the BCD to see how  best

they  can  further  improve on  what  I  think  is  a

reasonable period of processing. I have indicated  to

Members  just  now a period of one  month.  But  here

again  it is not too worthwhile to debate on what  is

the  minimum period. We can say that in the few cases

of  unnecessary delay, I agree that action should  be

taken to look into them,



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one

further clarification. With your indulgence, Sir,  we

have  to  debate  a little more to  get  the  correct

picture.  Just now the Senior Minister of  State  has

stated that if repairs do not amount to more than 50%

of  the  building  and  if it  is  a  straightforward

application, the Building Control Division would have

no objection. So the onus or the responsibility falls

on  either  the  applicant or the landowner.  But  my

question  is this. If the applicant can get  approval

to carry out the necessary repairs in the normal way,

then  all  these requirements are within the Building

by-laws. The problem is when the repairs have  to  be

carried  out  urgently, then what  has  the  Building

Control Division got to say?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in case of

urgency, in  particular where an  MP  comes  out  in

support  of a particular application as was suggested

in  the  case of the damaged zinc roof, I  personally

see  no difficulty really. For example, if the damage

is  directly  to the roof of a bedroom and  it  needs

immediate  repair  within  a  few  days,  I  see   no

difficulty  in convincing, perhaps not the  clerk  at

the counter, but the head of the Division, that it is

necessary  that  immediate approval  for  repairs  be

given. If approval or permit is necessary, and if the

owner's  signature  is required,  and  so  on,  these

requirements  could be processed at a later  date.  I

have already given an assurance that even if that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



situation   cannot  achieve  approval  for  immediate

urgent  repairs, I would be very happy to  intervene,

if necessary.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

Ahmad Haleern , Lee Yiok Seng and Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has become an island too

dependent on other countries for imports of food  and

many other products. In certain aspects we should try

to   be  self-sufficient  and,  if  possible,  be  an

exporter. Many pig farmers have been resettled or put

out  of  business for various reasons, the  commonest

being  environmental pollution. We have some  islands

which  are ideal for poultry and pig-rearing. Why  is

there no effort made to develop these islands?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago I suggested growing vegetables on the

roof  tops  of HDB flats, I was laughed  at  and,  in

fact,  one newspaper even ran a cartoon about  it.  I

feel the time has come to rejuvenate some thinking in

this  field. We are already getting a reduced  supply

of  fish and vegetables. The other sources for  these

supplies are unreliable.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydroponics has been developed in Singapore to such

an  extent that it is feasible to grow vegetables  on

the  roof tops of high-rise buildings. This is not  a

new  idea.  In  India, it has been carried  out  very

successfully.  They grow vegetables,  like  brinjals,

tomatoes and even some kind of padi on rooftops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is being done to control the illegal

slaughtering of pigs? It is common to find some  pork

sellers  mixing the meat in the markets in Singapore.

There  is  also  cheating going on  in  the  sale  of

mutton.  Frozen mutton is mixed with fresh mutton  in

the markets and sold at higher prices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I regret to say that in the last few years, the

image of the Primary Production Department in the

eyes of the farmers and fishermen has changed

fundamentally. Although the PPD has been giving

technical aid in respect of agriculture to the

farmers, they do not seem to give any assistance to

solve the major and immediate problems of bona fide

farmers and fishermen. The result is that there are

complaints and dissatisfaction all round. I would

like to ask whether the PPD has taken any steps to

render help when the price of agricultural produce

was low. And has the PPD helped the farmers to export

their excess produce abroad? What has the PPD done in

respect of the promotion of deep-sea fishing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards farmers affected by resettlement,

the  PPD's dealings with these people give  cause  to

doubt   the   sincerity  of  the  PPD  in   promoting

agriculture. The frivolous manner that  the  PPD  has

adopted in judging whether or not a person is a  bona

fide  farmer or not a farmer has been the root  cause

of  a lot of dissatisfaction and complaint. Bona fide

farmers  have  been  adjudged  non-farmers  and  vice

versa. Usually in the rural areas many families still

retain   their  good  Eastern  traditions  by  having

several  generations living together under one  roof,

and  it  is  common  to see the father  and  the  son

tilling  the same plot of land, even though  the  son

has  his  own  family. When the PPD  comes  round  to

assess  and  to recommend subsequently the allocation

of land, they usually recommend a piece of land, even

though  a very small one, only to the father, leaving

the son out. Is this the way to encourage agriculture

or to discourage it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rural people have also been troubled by the

development  of  catchment areas and  reservoirs.  Of

course, the idea is that we should be self-sufficient

in the supply of water, and nobody can argue with it.

But   the   Government,  particularly   the   Primary

Production  Department, should try its best  to  help

reduce  the inconvenience and the loss to the  people

affected to the minimum by





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



giving  them whatever assistance they need to  resume

production  as soon as possible. Bigger  pig  farmers

have  been resettled in Punggol pig farms. They  have

to  start  from scratch in very difficult situations.

Small  pig farmers have also been asked to stop their

pig  farming  operations, or else they will  have  to

move  out.  Can  I ask whether the PPD  has  assisted

these pig farmers to change to chicken rearing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time when the PPD gave extensive

publicity to the development of Sembawang  as  a  pig

farming area, and they even invited farm operators to

come  forward.  But now we do not hear anything  more

about it. I would like to ask the Minister whether he

can inform this House as to how much public funds has

been  spent on the development of Sembawang as a  pig

farming  area? Why has the plan failed? What  is  the

use of the land now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PPD is now planning to develop Punggol as a

new  pig farming area. This must succeed, and  should

not be allowed to fail. Otherwise we shall fall short

of  the  supply of pork. The first problem I hear  is

that  there is an absence of metalled roads  and  the

drainage system is also very poor. There is  also  an

insufficient  supply of electricity and water.  These

matters must be given first priority by the PPD.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Report of the Auditor-General for 1975-76 we learn that the PPD is not efficient in handling

accounting  matters. There have been  short  receipts

and wrong accounting procedures. A junior officer was

put in charge of large amounts of money from the sale

of  agricultural produce. Not only this, the  PPD  is

also  a very stubborn department. The Auditor-General

had  in  his Reports for 1973-74 and 1974-75  pointed

out  the  shortcomings of the PPD and had recommended

certain  improvement  to its accounting  system.  Yet

from the 1975-76 Auditor-General's Report, it appears

that   the  Department  is  still  having  the   same

problems,  and  has  disregarded the  advice  of  the

Auditor-General. Is this intransigent  attitude  good

for our country?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to raise the

problem of the Jurong Abattoir. Recently I received a

lot  of  complaints chiefly on the management of  the

Abattoir.  They  have  spent  large  sums  of   money

furnishing   the   office  into  one   of   grandiose

splendour.  They have also spent a lot  of  money  to

engage  beautiful female staff. But they do not  want

to  spend  any money to improve the machinery  or  to

improve  the  working conditions of the  workers,  so

much  so that now and then, the machines are  out  of

order,  or  there  is constant shortage  of  butchers

causing   a  delay  in  the  slaughtering  of   pigs,

sometimes  to as late as 6 am, or 7 am, so  that  the

meat  could not reach the market in time,  causing  a

lot  of unnecessary losses. I do not know whether the

Minister  concerned has supervised the  work  of  the

Jurong Abattoir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to

the  Member  for  Jurong for his  concern  about  the

development  of pig farms in Punggol and Jalan  Kayu.

Of  course,  I too would like to see the pig  farming

industry become a success so that Singapore would  be

self-sufficient in pork. Sir, it is very  encouraging

to hear him say this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also criticised the Primary

Production  Department officials for their  haste  in

moving  and  relocating  the  pig  farmers  into  the

designated farming areas, thereby creating a  lot  of

difficulties for the farmers. As I have said  before,

all  these  pig farmers who have been relocated  were

merely given pieces of land to develop. In the debate

on  the  President's  Address, I  referred  to  these

farmers as pioneers opening up the western frontiers.

Sir,  this  remark is due to the fact that when  such

lands  were  allocated,  there  were  not  sufficient

facilities and services. This is true. Roads are  not

properly  made up. Drains are not properly lined  and

not  of  the  right size. Even the Primary Production

Department  officials,  instead  of  rendering  every

possible assistance to the pig farmers in Punggol  to

set  up  their farms on a proper scale, often intrude

into the farming activities of the farmers by way  of

telling  them  how  and where to  site  certain  farm

structures or the general layout of the farms,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



and  also at the same time telling these farmers that

they should not rear less than, say, 600 pigs on  one

acre of land. If they are given one acre of land, and

their  families  too have to live on  that  piece  of

land, how much space is left for the farm structures,

unless it is a flatted farm? In this respect, Sir,  I

would  like  to ask the Hon. Minister or  his  Senior

Minister  of  State  to  look into  the  question  of

offering  every  possible  assistance  as   well   as

encouragement to these pig farmers with regard to the

viability of pig farming industry in the long term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to come back to one small point

again  concerning repairs to farm structures. Several

poultry  farmers have been allowed to  stay  on  this

land. They have made applications for repairs to  the

sheds  for  the layers, but these applications  again

take  time  to be processed. Sometimes it takes  more

than  a  month because these structures are of  wood,

wiremesh,  zinc,  etc. The poultry  farmers  have  to

replace  these layer sheds every one or two years.  I

think  the  Senior  Minister of State  is  very  well

versed  about the breeding of layers, the  productive

period  of  layers,  and the  time  for  them  to  be

slaughtered  or  replaced. In  the  meantime,  it  is

somewhat  difficult  to  get  new  layers.  In   this

respect,  Sir, I would like the Hon. Senior  Minister

of  State  to  assure this House that every  possible

assistance will be given to the farmers, be they  pig

farmers or poultry farmers, that when they apply  for

repairs  to  their  farm structures  or  erection  of

certain  farm structures, their applications will  be

expeditiously approved.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of fluctuation of prices of farm

products,  it  is  sad  to  note  that  the   Primary

Production Department's efforts have been by  way  of

words and not deeds. When the price of pigs and  eggs

fell, there was no proper dialogue or correspondence

between the farmers and the department concerned.  In

this   respect,  I  would  like  to  see   a   closer

relationship  between the officials  of  the  Primary

Production Department and the pig and poultry farmers

not  only  in the matter of farm structures but  also

the pricing of their farm products.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

the  response  to the Primary Production Department's

announcement  that  farmers should  get  licences  to

carry out agricultural activities, has been good. But

I  have  received  complaints  from  orchid  growers.

Orchid  growing has not been given any  encouragement

by  the  PPD. As a result orchid growers  are  rather

hesitant   in  the  further  development   of   their

agriculture for the following reasons: firstly, after

paying  for  a  farmer's  licence  fee,  the  Primary

Production  Department does not give the  farmers  or

orchid   growers  any  substantial  assistance.   For

example,  the Department does not provide the  orchid

growers   with   Chinese   publications   on   orchid

cultivation,  growing  of new hybrids,  etc, because

most  of  the  publications are in English.  We  must

realise that most of these flower growers are Chinese

educated. This should be taken into account.  In  the

PPD publications there are too few articles on orchid

growing while there is too little encouragement given

to  the farmers and orchid growers on developing  the

orchid industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the views on compensation for the

resettled   farmers  held  by   the   PPD   and   the

Resettlement  office are different and contradictory.

According  to  officials  of the  Primary  Production

Department, compensation is given for wooden supports

for potted plants and sun shades for the orchids. But

the  resettlement officers say that such items do not

qualify  for  compensation  because  they  are   only

supports for the pots which are removable. There  are

two   conflicting  views  from  the   two   different

departments  on  the  same  subject.  Thus  there  is

misunderstanding   among   the   people    resettled,

resulting in dissatisfaction with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when measuring the land area of the

flowering   plants,   the   resettlement   assessment

officers do not take into account the paths along the

rows  of flower beds. As a result one acre of  orchid

plants   can   only  come  to  half   an   acre   for

compensation.  This  criterion  is  too   harsh   and

unreasonable. The compensation payable is inadequate,

even for removal expenses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all these complaints, we can come to the

following conclusions. Firstly, we should develop the

orchid  industry because it is a well  known  foreign

exchange  earner. The volume of export of orchids  in

recent years has been growing, and it is earning  for

us  every  year  quite  a  sizeable  sum  of  foreign

exchange.  It  is  a  definite  contribution  to  our

economy.  It  is my hope that the Primary  Production

Department  will  give greater encouragement  to  the

orchid growing industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where flower growers have to be resettled

the  rate of compensation should be increased because

removal  of flowering plants involve great losses  by

way of damage. Moreover, on resettlement these flower

growers  have  to start all over again,  thus  facing

financial difficulties and uncertain livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if resettled flower growers are to be given

land  elsewhere,  it is my hope that  the  Department

concerned will give a big piece of land to  house  or

to  resettle all or most of the growers together, as

in  the  case of the resettlement of pig  farmers  in

Punggol.  In  this way it could be developed  into  a

tourist resort to attract foreign visitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, where alternative land is not given or not

available, the Department concerned should  help  the

flower  growers to get hawker licences so  that  they

may  have  a  new means of livelihood to replace  the

livelihood  of orchid growing which they  have  lost.

For  these resettled flower growers, we should  relax

certain conditions, e.g, restriction to persons  over

40  years  of  age,  to bring it  in  line  with  the

thinking of the Senior Minister of State.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the

Members   for  Punggol  and  Jurong.  I   share   the

sentiments which they have expressed on the  work  of

the   Primary  Production  Department.  But  in   all

fairness  I  would say that technically  the  Primary

Production Department has over the years done  a  lot

of  good  work in research and introducing a  special

breed of pigs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



poultry  to  Singapore. To that extent, I think  they

have succeeded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, it is not so much a question of whether

the  Primary Production Department has done  this  or

that  or  has  not done this or that. It  is  more  a

question  of  whether  we, the Singapore  Government.

think  we  ought  to have a comprehensive  policy  on

Agriculture, bearing in mind the very limited size of

Singapore;  whether  we  believe  Agriculture  has  a

future in Singapore. Personally I am inclined  to  be

optimistic about it. I think it has a future. We only

have  to  look back to the last 10 or 15 years.  Time

and   again   we  have  heard  in  this  House   that

agriculture is a thing of the past, and  that  it  is

going  to die. We might just as well let it die.  But

it  has not died. Not only has it not died, but it is

doing even better. If anybody cares to make a survey,

he  will be surprised to find out that the number  of

people engaged in agriculture today is probably  much

smaller in number, and yet we are self-sufficient  in

pork,   chicken  and  eggs,  in  spite  of  a  bigger

population.  What does this mean? It means  that  the

productivity rate of our farmers has gone up, despite

the  lack of encouragement. Very rightly so,  as  the

Members for Punggol and Jurong have pointed out, when

the  Department resettles these farmers not  only  do

they  not  help  them sufficiently but  are  in  fact

giving them a standard lower than what they have been

used  to. Take, for instance, those farmers in Jurong

and  Chua Chu Kang. They all have metalled roads  and

street lightings, water and electricity supplies. But

if  we go and look at the so-called farmways in Jalan

Kayu and Punggol, which have been cleared and waiting

for the farmers in Kranji to move in, we will see the

difference. They are just mud tracks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> So was Jurong at the beginning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> At the beginning, fair enough.

Because  in  those  days they did not  have  metalled

roads.  They did not have water and electricity.  But

now   that   we  have  given  them  metalled   roads,

electricity  and  water, are we  suggesting  that  we

deprive them of that standard of living? I would have

thought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



that  the  policy of this Government is to make  sure

that  we go on giving qualitative improvement in  the

standard of living of our people and not down-grading

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, therefore, rather surprised the other day to

find  that one of the farmers, who had taken a  piece

of land in this so-called farmway and who had applied

to  have  a few Of these electric poles removed  from

the  centre of the land, was asked to pay  a  removal

fee  of  more than $2,000. This fee of $2,000 is  now

being  referred  to the URSC. I do not  know  whether

URSC is going to pay for it. Who is going to pay  for

it?  I  do  not  know. There is a lot of buck-passing

going on. I am not exaggerating, Sir. This is a  very

serious problem. We resettle an entire community from

one  corner  of Singapore to another. They sacrifice.

They  have to put in a lot of hard work. They do  not

mind.  The  very least we can do is not to make  life

too  difficult for them. The least we can  do  is  to

make  sure  that they are given the same standard  of

living, if not a better standard.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I would like to deal with the

resettlement  problem last because  the  Ministry  is

under heavy fire. I would rather deal with the Member

for Anson first by saying that what is good for India

is not necessarily good for Singapore. He has brought

up  a  number of points. The first point was about  a

cartoon  on the growing of vegetables on the rooftops

of  HDB flats. The Primary Production Department  has

studied his good suggestion previously on the growing

of   brinjals  on  rooftops  of  HDB  flats  and  the

proposition  has  been found to be uneconomical.  HDB

flats  are  not designed to carry loads.  So  if  the

Member's suggestion is to be carried out, perhaps the

structure  of these buildings has to be modified  and

this  means  higher costs. Moreover,  to  accommodate

farming  activities on top of a residential block  of

flats somehow is incompatible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also queried why no efforts have been made to

develop  agriculture  or  poultry  industry  in   the

outlying islands of Singapore. The PPD has considered

the usage of the outlying islands for rearing of both

pigs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



poultry,  but  to introduce the basic  infrastructure

for  pig and poultry rearing large sums of money will

be required. Here again, economic factors dissuade us

from developing the outlying islands into pig farming

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also questioned whether Singapore could

not  only be self-sufficient in food but also  be  an

exporter of food. I can merely reiterate what we have

mentioned  here  before.  We are  self-sufficient  in

pigs,  poultry and eggs. As for exports, he has heard

the  complaints  from some of the  rural  Members  of

Parliament  -  that  there are now  and  then  excess

supplies  of  eggs and meat. But as a policy  matter,

self-sufficiency  in the particular  areas  of  pigs,

poultry and eggs will be maintained.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his observation on illegal slaughtering of

pigs,  the  Primary  Production  Department  has   an

enforcement  unit.  In fact, it has  intensified  its

raids  on  illegal  slaughtering  of  pigs.  Just  to

convince  him,  342  checks  on  market  stalls  were

carried out, and 81 raids were conducted on suspected

areas  of illegal slaughtering. As a result of  this,

6 1/2  tons of illegal pork were seized, 40 prosecutions

were  carried out, and a total sum of $21,000 in fine

was imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his observation on cheating on the sale of

mutton, frozen mutton is sold in the market at  about

$1.90 per pound against fresh mutton which is sold at

about  $2.40 per pound. The hon. Member did  complain

of  the  high price of mutton two years ago. At  that

time fresh mutton was sold at $2.70 per pound. If the

butcher  is cheating the housewife by charging  fresh

mutton price for frozen mutton, perhaps he can report

the matter to CASE for their investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take the comments made by the hon. Member

for Sembawang. I somehow feel that he has a fantastic

interest  in orchid growing. In fact, he has appealed

very strongly to ensure that the orchid industry does

not  go  down.  I  have  during  the  debate  on  the

Presidential  Address answered some queries  made  by

some rural MPs, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



particular, the Member for Nee Soon. I did  say  that

the  Primary  Production Department was looking  into

alternative sites to help resettle some of the orchid

growers. I could also perhaps state here that  if  he

is  referring to orchid growers who are at the moment

cultivating orchids within forest reserves, then that

is  not legal and, in fact, no licence has ever  been

given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his comments that the Primary Production

Department  has done insufficiently  as  far  as  the

publication  is concerned, that there  is  inadequate

compensation   and   that  there   are   too   strict

regulations involving assessment, perhaps he does not

know   that   the  assessment  of  the   Resettlement

Department  is  referred  to the  Primary  Production

Department  for approval. In other words,  PPD  being

the authority where farming activities are concerned,

will  say  which  item, whether it is  the  pot,  the

flower  or whatever it is, should be compensated.  If

PPD  gives  that assurance, in most  cases  it  is  a

formality for the Resettlement Department to approve.

I cannot see the logic of a non-technical department,

such  as the Resettlement Department, telling PPD  or

disagreeing   totally  with  PPD  on  the   technical

assessment.  I am not in a position to argue  whether

the  pot  is  for  the  growing  of  orchids  or  for

something else, but I am talking generally  that  the

PPD  does  the assessment. And if the PPD  gives  its

approval,  the Resettlement Department, in all  cases

that I know of, automatically approves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also made a number of suggestions which I do

not  think  he is serious about, for example,  giving

hawker  licences to orchid growers  who  have  to  be

resettled.  The  reason is very  simple.  During  the

Budget  debate on the Ministry of the Environment  we

have  indicated that sympathetic consideration  would

be  given  to real hardship cases, and so on  and  so

forth. So if these are legal orchid growers, and they

come under the resettlement guidelines, then the same

consideration will be given to them as that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



for  the  resettlement  of  pig  farmers  or  poultry

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has brought up a number of

points. He has criticised the PPD for having done  so

little  to  help,  in  particular,  the  farming  and

fishing  communities. Of course, he is still  unhappy

over  the question of bona fide farmers, and  implies

that the PPD is most unfair in its assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding resettlement by the Jurong Town

Corporation, here again the PPD assists the  HDB  and

JTC   in   assessing  farming  activities.   I   have

previously indicated that it is not done by  just  an

officer  of  the  PPD. There is a panel  which  meets

regularly  to  assess cases. There  are  criteria  to

comply  with.  Just to give Members an indication,  I

have  here the figures which show that for the period

1971  to 1976 this panel has actually assessed  2,025

cases.  If  he  is,  in  fact, complaining  of   the

processing  of these cases to decide whether  or  not

they  are  bona  fide farmers, then I have  indicated

just  now that they meet regularly. They meet  weekly

or fortnightly depending on the urgency of the cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am purposely leaving the other questions on the

PPD  activities last, and answer some  of  his  other

queries  first,  for  example, the  Auditor-General's

report  on  improper control of finances at  the  PPD

under  the  Ministry of National Development.  I  can

merely  reiterate here that the Department has  noted

the  observation of the Auditor-General and, in fact,

improvements are being made to correct the weaknesses

of  the  accounting system. The Ministry has informed

the  PPD  to constantly review the accounting system.

He wanted some idea on how many officers are involved

in monetary matters. Actually it involves 86 officers

from   the  public  counter  up  to  the  authorising

officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question on why we resettle farmers from

Sembawang  and Kranji areas to Punggol,  I  think  an

explanation  has  been  given before,  that  is,  the

priority  for  the supply of water is more  important

than  the rearing of pigs. That explanation has  been

given   before  and,  in  fact,  to  show  that   the

Government is serious in its intention to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



resettle  those affected in the catchment areas,  the

Sembawang Pig Farm which was a project of the PPD was

aborted  completely  because of this  new  policy  to

conserve  water. As a result, no money was  spent  at

all to proceed with this pig farm project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these suggestions that the Primary Production

Department  has done very little to help the  farmers

are  to me unfair. I would say that the PPD, like all

other  departments, has to follow Government  policy.

It  is  not  the fault of the PPD to resettle  people

from  one area, be it in Jurong or Chua Chu Kang,  to

Punggol. The blame should not be entirely levelled at

the PPD, which only follows Government policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the complaint from the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  that in the resettlement from particular

areas  to  Punggol  where  there  is  at  the  moment

inadequate  or improper infrastructure,  is  a  valid

observation.  But I have already indicated  that,  as

far as the new Punggol pig farming area is concerned,

it will be the pig farming area in Singapore and that

infrastructure like drainage, water, electricity  and

so on, are being provided, but this has to be done on

a  phase-to-phase basis. I have the figures here  and

if  Members are interested, Phase I has already  been

completed  and all the infrastructural amenities  are

there. As I said, I can quote the necessary amount of

money  spent  to lay the necessary infrastructure  as

far as electricity, roads and so on are concerned. In

other  words,  I am saying that ultimately  when  the

whole area is developed, the Punggol pig farming area

will  be as good, if not better, than the areas where

they  have come from, but it takes sometime  for  the

infrastructure to be laid down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the query of difficulties to obtain a permit

to  even  repair or erect poultry or pig sites,  here

again   the   difficulties  involve   a   number   of

departments. For example, the application form has to

go  to the Land Office which is under the Ministry of

Law.  If  it  involves  pollution,  it  goes  to  the

Ministry  of  the  Environment and then,  of  course,

building  comes under the Building Control  Division.

If the difficulty in getting a permit is due to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



inability  on the part of the PPD, then I  think  the

PPD  will try its best to expedite matters. But  here

again the difficulty is not just the PPD, It involves

three  big  Ministries. For the Ministry of  National

Development, while I can say that the PPD can help to

send  the  applications on behalf of the  farmers  to

BCD,  the  farmers may still have to  wait  for  land

clearance  by the Ministry of Law and clearance  from

the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> But this is a non-catchment area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I would say that if there is

difficulty   in  terms  of  coordinating   with   the

different Ministries, the PPD can have a go at it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to another allegation that the PPD has done

nothing about fluctuations of produce prices, such as

eggs,  poultry,  and  pigs.  The  PPD  monitors   the

situation  constantly. PPD knows when the  prices  of

pigs and eggs go up or down, and it liaises with  the

Livestock  Association most of the  time.  But,  like

everyone  else,  when  the  price  of  pigs  goes  up

steeply,  every  farmer is happy. But  when  it  goes

down,  then  every farmer appeals to the PPD  or  the

Government  to do something. Here again,  the  market

forces  take  care  of this. In going  into  pig  and

poultry  rearing, one of the basic requirements  that

any  farmer  or  anybody who goes into  the  business

should  know  that when you over-produce  you  get  a

situation   of   excess,  and   this   excess   comes

periodically. In fact, if the farmer is of  any  good

calibre,  he  will  know that  after  several  years,

normally there is a cycle of three to four years,  he

will  have  a  situation of this nature,  an  excess.

Therefore,  if  he is a good businessman,  he  should

keep something for a rainy day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the Government should not interfere

with  market  forces, unless  the  situation  really

demands  it,  because the market forces  will  always

balance it. So the PPD is aware of all the situations

as  far as price movements are concerned. In fact, it

even  has to monitor the prices of raw materials used

in making feeds for feeding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



chickens  and pigs. So it is unfair to say  that  the

PPD  is  not coming out to help. The PPD is aware  of

the  situation but, as it should be, it leaves it  to

market forces to take care of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has brought up the question

of  the  PPD  officers  being unsympathetic  and  not

wanting to help. Here again. I would say that  I  beg

to  differ.  I think the PPD officers have  tried  to

help  but  certain  things  which  are  beyond  their

control  have  been levelled at them and  criticised.

For   example,  resettlement  benefits.  Resettlement

benefits are arrived at Ministry level. In fact,  the

enhanced  rate of compensation paid by Government  to

all  resettlement cases, be it farmers,  residential,

commercial,  shop-houses and so on, is decided  by  a

committee.  The Ministry of National Development  has

to  convince the Ministry of Finance who then  agrees

on  the  rates  of compensation to be  paid  to  each

farmer.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, the last review of compensation rates

was made in April 1975. If there is justification for

a re-assessment, the Ministry of National Development

could suggest it. But once the schedule of rates  has

been  agreed, then the PPD, like any other department

for example, the Resettlement Department, JTC and the

HDB,  has  to  comply with the rates. If  the  Member

complains that there is inadequate compensation, then

it  is  a different issue from the status of  a  bona

fide  farmer.  Arguing that he is  not  a  bona  fide

farmer  is  a different issue, and I have  given  the

reasons.  They must comply with certain requirements.

If  one  is a bona fide farmer, it means that  he  is

totally  dependent  on farming for  a  livelihood.  I

think  it is difficult for us to decide on this issue

as  we  are  laymen. But there is a panel of  experts

which   has   the  expertise  to  determine   farming

activities. I think it is most unfair to  look  at  a

farming family where the son is just helping out  now

and  then  and  then  conclude  that  he  is  totally

dependent  on farming for a livelihood. I think  that

is too simple to be true. But I stand corrected. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



think  some  rural MPs have appealed on their  behalf

and until their positions have been reassessed by the

panel of experts and if it is true that they are bona

fide  farmers,  then the bona fide  status  could  be

given to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the question on the need for a comprehensive

agricultural  policy  by  the  Ministry  of  National

Development.  This was brought up by the  Member  for

Jalan  Kayu.  The  Ministry of  National  Development

believes that agriculture has a part to play. But  it

is  obviously  a limited part. It can only  play  its

part  in terms of the overall development because  of

other  priorities. The PPD is the instrument  of  the

Ministry of National Development to ensure that there

is self-sufficiency in pork, meat, and eggs. The very

fact   that  the  Punggol  farming  area   has   been

designated  as  an  area for  pig  farming  and  that

poultry  farming  is allowed to be  carried  on  must

indicate that agriculture has a part to play.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a few rural MPs

seem  to  be  carried away by the  assertion  of  the

Member for Jalan Kayu that the agricultural policy is

contrary  to  the  general policy for  the  whole  of

Singapore,  that is, the policy of the Government  to

upgrade  and  improve the standard of living  of  the

people of Singapore. He said that we are, in fact, by

resettling  the farmers, lowering their  standard  of

living.  If Members were to listen carefully  to  the

Member  for Jalan Kayu, they will find from  his  own

words  that, far from lowering the standard of living

of the farmers, the standard of living of the farmers

during  the  last ten years has, largely through  the

assistance  of  the PPD, improved because  they  have

increased  their productivity. Now, having  increased

their  productivity, they must be better off.  So  do

not be carried away by just one assertion. They ought

to listen carefully.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State

has not replied to my query on the Jurong Abattoir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary

Production  Department has no jurisdiction  over  the

management  of  the  Jurong  Abattoir.  Actually  the

management of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



the  Jurong  Abattoir is under a  Government  company

called the Primary Industries Enterprise (Pte) Ltd. I

was   on  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Primary

Industries  Enterprise until  last  year.  I  do  not

believe  his  allegation that the management  employs

beautiful  girls  on their staff at  the  expense  of

efficiency  and  at  the  expense  of  the  necessary

skilled  workmanship. The fact of the matter is  that

the  abattoir  operates  six  nights  a  week.  If  I

remember  correctly, all the six nights are on  shift

work. Because of constant usage there is insufficient

time for the proper maintenance of machinery. But the

management  knows  that during certain  periods,  for

example, during the Chinese New Year season the usage

is  greater than usual. Time was set purposely  aside

to  strip  all the machinery, to repair it  and  make

sure  that  it is in tip-top condition for continuous

use, in particular during the festive seasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem of inadequate labourers. The

abattoir,  in  particular the  slaughtering  section,

operates from 11.00 p.m. at night to 5.00 a.m. in the

morning. This is to ensure the availability of fresh,

warm meat for consumers in the early morning. This is

a practice peculiar to Singapore. In other countries,

the supply of fresh warm meat has been taken over  by

frozen  meat. Because of the nature of the work  from 11.00  p.m. to  5.00 a.m. the difficulty  of  getting

labourers to do the work of slaughtering is great.  I

have  been told that, on the other hand, the  company

is trying its best to improve the staffing situation.

There  is  a  plan to renovate the whole building  as

well as the machinery to ensure that efficiency could

be maintained at all times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am certain that the kampong folks

in the rural areas are not against the implementation

of  rural  development projects of the Government  if

such  projects benefit them. The development projects

carried  out by the Government in Geylang  Serai  are

progressing smoothly because every Singapore  citizen

so  affected  has  been rehoused in  HDB  flats, and

similarly  displaced  shopkeepers  are  offered   HDB

shops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of mosques and suraus which are

also affected by these development projects; like the

ones  at  Jalan Alsagoff, Jalan Mydin,  Lorong  Engku

Aman and a Madrasah (that is, a religious school)  at

Jalan Pasir. A source of regret to me is that to-date

the  Government  has  not as yet offered  alternative

sites  so  that these religious structures  could  be

rebuilt.  And possibly many more mosques  and  suraus

will be affected by these development projects in due

course of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the relevant Ministry will consider

allocating a sufficiently large piece of land for the

erection  of a composite mosque building  in  Geylang

Serai area to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



incorporate  the mosques and suraus as  well  as  the

Madrasah  affected by the development  projects.  The

proposed  mosque  will  benefit  the  entire   Muslim

community, particularly those living in Geyland Serai

and residents in the surrounding areas.

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for  Geylang Serai has suggested that there is a need

to  reserve  sites  to  replace  suraus  and  mosques

affected  by development projects. In the process  of

urban  renewal, as people move out from old areas  to

be  developed, temples, mosques or churches will have

to  give  way  to  new development. The  Government's

policy,  however, is to reserve adequate  sites  for

religious  buildings  in the  new  towns  into  which

people  are  moving.  In the limited  land  space  of

Singapore  it is, of course, not possible to  replace

all  religious buildings on a one-to-one basis.  But,

depending on the size of the congregation in each  of

these   housing  estates,  adequate  space  will   be

reserved  for religious buildings. In line with  this

policy  one new mosque will be built in each HDB  new

town  where the Muslim population is 20,000 or  more,

The  relevant religious authorities have been advised

of this new policy.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, new mosques are under construction in

Queenstown, Toa Payoh and Jurong. In addition,  three

new mosques are being planned in Chai Chee, Woodlands

and Ang Mo Kio over the next two or three years. When

these  mosques  are completed, the  Muslim  community

will be able to conduct their religious activities in

well-designed  buildings and in better  environmental

conditions. The new mosques will be bigger  and  will

serve  not only the Muslim residents in the new towns

but  also Muslims in the surrounding areas. Hence the

Muslim residents in Geylang Serai Constituency will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



be  adequately  served  by  the  mosque  planned  for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, I , spoke about the outstanding

achievements of the Housing and Development Board. At

the same time, I proposed that the HDB should set  up

a  special duties unit to deal with special  problems

raised  by  MPs from time to time. But it was  turned

down  by the Senior Minister of State. Sir, I do  not

want  to repeat what I had said. But I would like  to

emphasise   one  point  here,  and   that   is,   the

administrative efficiency of the HDB  seems  to  have

slackened, perhaps due to the rapid expansion and the

increasing numbers of flats which have been built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Constituency of Henderson is a HDB estate. On the

one  hand,  we  can see the oldest type  of  one-room

flats  and, on the other, we can see the latest newly

designed four-room flats. The area of my Constituency

is very small but there are three HDB Area Offices to

handle  the Board's day-to-day affairs in the estate.

I  have  received a lot of complaints  from  time  to

time. One complaint I want to cite here is the hawker

problem.  Sir, we can see and many MPs who  have  HDB

flats  in  their  Constituencies know  that  the  HDB

officials  have  to  issue summonses  to  the  unruly

hawkers  so  that  the rules and regulations  can  be

maintained  and  strengthened. I am  quite  convinced

that  their  actions are legal and they  deserve  our

support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Yes. I am talking about the

administrative  efficiency of the HDB.  Sir,  let  me

explain. From time to time, we can see officials from

two  departments issuing summonses to hawkers  -  one

from  the HDB Maxwell Road office and the other  from

the  HDB Area Office. I quote two examples. These two

examples  occurred very recently. In the first  case,

one  early  morning at about 8 o'clock, HDB officials

from the Maxwell Road office came down to issue about

20 summonses to hawkers. The second incident occurred

only last week. Officials from the Area Office issued

summons  on  one hawker. The summons was  undated.  I

have  got a photostat copy here. The summons required

the  hawker within three days to do this  and  to  do

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see here that the HDB

officials from two departments are issuing summons to

hawkers  from  time to time. There must be  something

wrong. Hon. Members and Ministers might be interested

to  know that in my Constituency, there are not  only

hawker  centres under the HDB but also hawker centres

under  the jurisdiction of the Hawkers Department  of

the  Ministry of the Environment and the Jurong  Town

Corporation.  But I find that the HDB  hawker  centre

has given me the most trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not Justice Pao and neither do I want to see

the  Minister's  axe fall on the officials  mentioned

just  now.  I  do  hope that while  the  Minister  is

dealing  with  these  officials  with  leniency,  the

working  efficiency  of  the HDB  must  be  improved.

Otherwise the life of more than half of the country's

population will be affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among other things, the problems of the aged

and the young living in the HDB flats and the problem

of  families with only one breadwinner striving  hard

to support their dependants, are always worthy of our

concern and attention. Wherever possible, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



hope  that  the  Minister would spare no  efforts  in

attempting  to improve the living conditions  of  our

people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I indicate again that this

particular  subhead  is  on  "Contributions  to   the

Housing and Development Board".



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  glad to learn  from  a  recent

announcement  that  the  Housing  Board  intends   to

improve the one-room flats. This is good news to  the

people  of Singapore, particularly the one-room  flat

dwellers.  This  is  a  correct decision  because  it

promotes the hygiene and health of the people. So  we

express  our  full support for the HDB's decision  on

this  matter. But since the Housing Board intends  to

improve  the  living environment  of  flat  dwellers,

their  attention should not be confined to  the  one-room  flats.  They should also pay attention  to  the

problems of the existing old housing estates, because

such problems do affect the health and the hygiene of

the people living in old housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there have been numerous lift

breakdowns  in  the old housing estates.  This  is  a

serious  problem, because usually in every  block  of

flats  in  the old housing estates there is only  one

lift  available. If the lift breaks  down,  then  the

residents  have  to climb all the  way  up  to  their

flats.  This causes great inconvenience, particularly

to  children and old people who find it difficult  to

climb  up  the  steps. Worse still, whenever  a  lift

breaks  down,  very  often people  are  known  to  be

trapped  inside.  Not  to  mention  other  instances,

during  my  door-to-door visits, I had the experience

of   being  trapped  in  a  lift.  Because  of  these

breakdowns, very often I have to climb all the way up

to  visit my constituents in the flats. This goes  to

show  how serious this problem of lift breakdown  is.

As  a result, during my meet-the-people sessions  and

during  my  house-to-house visits, I receive  various

complaints  from  the  public,  many  of  which   are

complaints of lift breakdowns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have on their behalf taken up this matter of lift

breakdowns with the Area Office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



concerned, but the reaction from the various officers

has  been  very disappointing. They seem to hold  the

view  that old lifts must break down just  as  it  is

only  natural for old people to fall sick.  So  these

officers  do not take a very positive or enthusiastic

interest  in  the repair of old lifts. I  think  this

attitude is very questionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Housing Board has increased the

conservancy   charges  for  maintenance   and   other

services.  The Housing Board only knows how  to  make

the flat dwellers pay more by way of such charges but

does  not  seem  to take a serious  interest  in  the

repairs  and  the  maintenance  of  lifts  and  other

facilities  in old housing estates. This  is  a  very

exasperating situation to the residents. I  hope  the

Housing Board will take a serious view of the  matter

and  positively look into the problem of lifts of old

flats going out of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, we support the Housing Board in

trying to improve the one-room flats because it  will

go  a  step further to enhance the health and hygiene

of  the  people. This reminds me of the  problems  of

health and hygiene in the old housing estates. If  we

visit  such old housing estates, we will notice  that

the  state of hygiene and cleanliness is not all that

satisfactory. There is a vast difference between  the

state  of health and hygiene in the old and  the  new

housing  estates. The Housing Board may  conveniently

put  the  blame  entirely on  the  residents  of  old

housing estates saying these people do not take  much

trouble in looking after their own hygiene. In  fact,

it  is the Housing Board itself that should bear  the

greatest  responsibility for it.  The  HDB  officials

think  that since these housing estates are  old,  so

they  must  be dirtier and so it is not necessary  to

take so much trouble to clean up the place. Of course

this  is  a  wrong  attitude.  There  should  not  be

different  standards of care for  different  estates.

The HDB should hold the view that because the estates

are  old,  they  need more attention  in  respect  of

cleaning services. This is the only, correct attitude

to   take  in  order  to  improve  the  hygiene   and

cleanliness of old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



housing  estates. So I hope the authorities concerned

will look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from these two matters, the

Housing  Board  is not providing enough  recreational

facilities  for old housing estates. In the  case  of

new  housing  estates, the HDB  has  planned  for  a

complete   range  of  facilities  like  supermarkets,

swimming pools, children's playgrounds, etc.  But  in

the  case  of  old housing estates, the HDB  holds  a

different  attitude altogether. What I am  trying  to

say  is not to ask the Housing Board to provide  the.

same facilities to old housing estates as in the case

of  new housing estates, as we all know that this  is

impossible.   But   the  HDB  must  nonetheless   pay

attention to the recreational needs of people in  the

old  housing estates, particularly when  there  is  a

higher  population density in the old housing estates

and  therefore  the need for recreational  facilities

for old people and children is greater.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their needs are quite urgent. But unfortunately we

do  not see any adequate provision of such facilities

for  old  people  and  children in  the  old  housing

estates.  This also reflects the nonchalant  attitude

of the HDB towards old housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is my hope that the Housing and Development

Board authority will change its attitude towards  the

old  housing  estates by building and providing  more

recreational  facilities  for  the  old  people   and

children  in the old housing estates. As  the  saying

goes, when it is snowing a gift of coal will be  more

appreciated  by the needy than a gift of  flowers  to

the affluent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, the way in which the HDB

compulsorily acquire flats on serious breaches of the

Housing and Development Board (Amendment) Act has, in

practice,  caused hardship and anguish to the  people

concerned. A few cases would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



illustrate these difficulties. An unmarried woman,  a

Singapore  citizen, qualifies for a HDB flat  and  is

given  one.  She  lives in it with  her  parents  and

sisters, all of whom are permanent residents but with

Malaysian citizenship. In due time the owner  of  the

flat  married and moved into the matrimonial home  of

her husband. Because the husband owned the house, the

woman was asked by the HDB to surrender her flat. She

is  now  unable  to perform her filial  duty  to  her

parents who must now vacate the flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instance is of a father who qualifies for

a HDB flat but purchased it in the name of his eldest

son. The father provided the entire purchase price of

the flat. In due time the eldest son married and seek

to  transfer the flat back to the father, so that he,

the  son, could apply for his own flat. The HDB could

not do it under current policy. There are other cases

where owners have gone on to acquire other commercial

properties and to improve themselves. Such owners are

also required to surrender the flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the HDB has arbitrarily fixed the

value  of  such commercial properties without  giving

any  thought  to the hardship caused to  the  owners.

There are many other instances to show how inflexible

applications   of   policies   have    resulted    in

dispossessed  families. The Urban  Renewal  Authority

and other authorities are encouraging the development

of  private  shopping and commercial complexes.  Such

complexes are usually sold by the developers. A buyer

need  not  necessarily pay cash for the  purchase  of

these  shopping  and commercial complexes.  They  can

obtain loans through mortgages for such purchases  or

enter into partnerships. The argument may be that  if

an  owner  of  a  HDB flat can afford to  purchase  a

commercial property, he should be able to purchase  a

private flat or a house. Soon such an argument became

far-fetched.  There appears to be some  contradiction

in  granting exemption to certain cases. For example,

if  a person owns a shophouse where he carries on his

business and where it is not possible for him to live

in  it, he may be granted exemption. There should  be

no  distinction in granting exemption if a commercial

property



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



without living quarters is used by the owner for  the

conduct of his own business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise, Sir, is the need

for  the  Housing and Development Board  to  help  to

improve the livelihood of tenants of one-room  flats.

In  Toa Payoh, for instance, there are several blocks

of  one-room  flats whose occupants have been  living

there  for  more  than 10 years.  Many  of  them  are

earning  a  subsistence wage. Due to various  reasons

they  are unable to afford to purchase a larger  flat

under  the  home  ownership  scheme.  Many  of  these

residents   have   applied  for  hawker   stalls   to

supplement  the family income. Such applications  are

rejected by the Housing Board on the grounds that one

or  other members of the family are already employed.

I  would like to quote an excerpt of a speech by  the

Hon.  Minister for Labour at the opening of the Sixth

International Metal Workers Federation,  Asian  Youth

and Women Symposium:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We also want mothers to continue to work, partly to

solve  the  problem of labour shortage and partly  to

supplement the family income`



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By helping to supplement the family income it will

help  to  improve the standard of living of  families

living  in one-room flats. Any additional income  can

provide better food as well as better health  to  the

lower  income  group.  For the better  educated,  for

those with some vocational experience, it may be easy

for  them  to  obtain other forms of employment.  But

there are housewives who, for compelling reasons, are

unable  to work away from their homes, leaving  their

young  children unattended at home. As there  are  so

many  vacant hawker stalls in Toa Payoh itself  which

are not taken up, there should be some flexibility in

allotting these stalls to the people that I have just

mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to raise is on application

for   transfer   of   hawker  stalls.   The   Hawkers

Coordinating and Licensing Committee has decided that

applications  for  transfer  cannot  be   considered.

Obviously,  this  Committee does not  understand  the

plight  of  hawkers  at all. For  example, a  hawker

living in a one-room flat in Toa Payoh has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



purchased  a  three-room flat in Ang Mo  Kio  or  any

other  estate farther away. He has to travel  a  long

distance  to  his stall in Toa Payoh, notwithstanding

the fact that he has to bring along the paraphernalia

of  his trade. Another example is poor business. Most

hawkers are dependent on their trade as a sole  means

of  earning  a livelihood. Of course, to the  Housing

Board  the easiest solution is to give up the  stall.

But  one must consider: what about the livelihood  of

the family? May I suggest that some consideration  be

given  to  applicants  for  transfers  in  cases   of

hardship.  They  need  to be  assisted  in  times  of

difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I draw the attention of the House to

some  difficulties faced by purchasers and owners  of

Housing  and  Development  Board  flats.  The   first

difficulty is on the resale of flats. When  an  owner

wishes  to  purchase a larger flat, he has to  resell

his  existing flat at cost to a buyer selected by the

Housing and Development Board. The present system  is

for the Housing Board to send out letters of offer to

applicants  on  the  waiting list.  This  can  go  on

indefinitely, if no suitable buyer is found.  I  have

come  across  two cases where one owner has  to  wait

five  months and another slightly more than one  year

before  their  old  flats  are  sold  to  the  buyers

selected  by  the Housing Board. In  such  cases  the

vendor  has  to pay instalments for two  flats  while

waiting  for  a  buyer. May I  suggest  that  a  more

expeditious  system  be  introduced  to  reduce   the

waiting  period, such as keeping a separate  register

for  applicants who wish to opt for the  purchase  of

resold flats or repossessed flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to raise is on sworn

declarations. At present all applicants  for  Housing

and  Development Board flats have to obtain  a  sworn

declaration  from  the Supreme Court  or  a  firm  of

Advocates  and  Solicitors.  This  has  caused   some

inconvenience  to the applicants. I  understand  that

the Housing Board is looking into the possibility  of

arranging  for  some of their officers to  administer

such declaration at the time when an application  for

the purchase of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



a  flat is made. May I know when this system will  be

introduced?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. Will the

Member  for  Toa  Payoh clarify whether  he  meant  a

transfer of a hawker's licence to another hawker,  or

a  transfer  of the hawker from one stall to  another

stall?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, from stall to stall.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, first of all, I

would   like  to  express  my  agreement   with   the

expression  of sympathy, almost sorrow, expressed  in

this  House  for  those people living  in  the  older

estates,  especially in the one-room flats. I  merely

rise to seek some information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask for information regarding the

programme,  the Housing Board has in  mind,  for  the

improvement of one-room flats, especially those flats

described  as  "emergency" flats. What has  been  the

rationale  for making a selection of those particular

areas  where  it  has been publicised  that  the  HDB

intends  to  begin  improvement work?  What  are  the

criteria  that  have been used to make selection  for

priority  to  be given to certain types of  emergency

flats  in  certain  areas?  Can  the  House  also  be

informed  whether there is any programme to work  out

the  timing  when attention will be  given  to  other

areas  with  one-room flats, after those  with  first

priority have been attended to?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I agree with what has already

been  said  by  the previous hon. Members  about  the

Housing  and  Development Board but with over  80,000

applicants on the waiting list I still feel that they

have, in fact, done a good job. Apart from the points

that have been brought up, there are still many other

minor  matters  which  are  not  being  looked   into

properly.  Let me cite a few examples. On one  of  my

visits  to a block of flats in Telok Blangah, I  came

across  iron  rods sticking out from  staircases.  In

fact, there were five iron rods sticking out in  that

building  alone. I feel that such things  should  not

happen at all, though it is of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



minor   nature.  But  during  an  inspection   before

acceptance,  all  these  minor  faults  should   have

already been taken care of. There is no need for  the

local  Member of Parliament to go round  and  make  a

report to the Area Office for necessary action to  be

taken.  All  these are minor matters that should  not

arise  and  should have been seen to  and  done  with

before the residents move in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my constituents came to see me and asked

about  playgrounds, etc. I usually tell  them  to  be

patient.  I tell them that it is all in the plan  and

it  is coming up. I always say, "Move in first.  Once

the estate is ready, the playground will be there for

you." One observant constituent said, "Look, you just

go  and  take  a ride to Telok Blangah  Town  centre.

There  are three point-blocks there. Nobody has moved

in  yet but there is a playground ready for use.  Why

is  the playground provided in an estate where  there

are  no residents? Yet in our estate where there  are

residents,  no  playground  is  given?"  It  is  very

difficult for me to explain when they point out  such

matters  to  me.  The Housing and  Development  Board

should  look  into such matters. They should  provide

facilities  for  existing  residents  and   not   for

residents who have not moved in yet.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from what I have said, I think the HDB is

doing a good job. I would say that if they could look

into these small minor matters, it will not spoil the

generally good work that they are doing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in order to

enable  our citizens to own their houses, the Housing

and  Development Board has built flats and sold  them

at  cheap prices to Singapore citizens. Moreover,  to

encourage it, eligible citizens are allowed under the

home  ownership scheme of the Board to  make  use  of

their CPF contributions to purchase them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Senior Minister of State for

National  Development in a reply to my  Question  for

Oral  Answer  in this House the other  day,  he  said

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As at 31st December, 1976, a total of 110,591 units

of flats have been sold under the "Home Ownership"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



scheme. Of this, 7,685 units were purchased outright,

while 63,148 units [or 57%] were purchased through the

owners'  CPF contribution either outright  or  on  an

instalment basis.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still about 60,000 applicants on the

waiting  list.  According to  the  situation  at  the

moment,  an  applicant will have to  wait  for  three

years or more before he can be allotted a flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the current policy of the Board an

applicant who wishes to purchase a flat must pay  20%

of  the  price as a down payment. To fulfill  such  a

condition  is a problem to people like taxi  drivers,

casual  workers,  lorry  drivers  and  most  hawkers,

because they do not have enough savings and they also

do   not  pay  CPF  contributions.  So  it  is  quite

difficult  to make the 20% down payment. This  deters

them  from  applying for the purchase  of  flats.  In

order   to   carry  out  the  home-ownership   scheme

thoroughly.   I  suggest  the  HDB  should   consider

reducing  the down payment from 20% to 10%  in  order

that  these  people who do not pay CPF  contributions

can  also  enjoy  the  benefits  of  the  scheme.  Or

alternatively, the HDB could consider to  allow  them

to  pay  10% first when they apply for flats  and  on

allocation, they should pay up the remaining 10%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that civil servants who want to

buy HDB flats do not have to make a down payment, and

those  who  are affected by Government's  development

plan  or renewal scheme are given the same treatment.

Even  those who are renting the HDB flats  which  are

later  offered for sale do not have to  make  a  down

payment  when they want to purchase the  flats  which

they are residing. Since the authority can afford  to

look  after the interests of these people  by  giving

them  such  consessionary treatment, why  cannot  the

Board  also make things easier for those who  do  not

pay CPF contributions to purchase flats?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to criticise the HDB for its

tender  system  of  allocating  shop  premises.  This

matter  has  been raised in this House  a  number  of

times,  and  every  time it  was  hushed  up  by  the

Minister  who  said  that there was  no  better  way.

According to the present system, the shop premises to

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



rented out are put on tender and they are rented  out

to  those who make the highest bid, without regard to

whether  the rentals tendered are so exorbitant  that

the  tenderers  may  not be able  to  maintain  their

businesses  thus  incurring arrears or  even  closing

down their businesses eventually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my constituency, there has been such a case

as  stated.  My  constitutency is a  housing  estate.

There  are  no  factories,  big  offices  or  tourist

resorts. A coffeeshop was leased out by tender  at  a

monthly  rental  of  $5,300  to  a  woman.  So   this

shopkeeper  had to sublet as many parts of  the  shop

premises  as possible in order to relieve  her  heavy

financial  burden. The result is that there  were  so

many  hawker stalls in the shop premises  that  there

was  not enough space for tables and chairs. So these

were  placed along the corridors, both the front  and

rear. The shop was opened from early morning right up

to   2.00   or   3.00  a.m.  The  residents   in   the

neighbourhood were disturbed by noise from the  shop.

So  they lodged complaints to the authorities and the

HDB had to forbid the shopkeeper to use the corridors

and to limit the hours of business to 12.00 midnight,

thus  severely affecting the business of  this  shop.

Consequently,  the  shopkeeper  has  owed  more  than

$30,000 in rental to the HDB. I learn that the HDB is

now taking legal action to repossess the shop, as she

is  not  able to pay arrears amounting to  more  than

$30,000.  The HDB had accepted the highest  bid  from

her,  and  so allotted the shop to her. As a  result,

she now owes the HDB more than $30,000 in rentals.  I

am not speaking in defence of this shopkeeper because

she had not estimated properly before she made such a

tender.  As  a  result, she now  has  incurred  great

losses in the business. I say she has nobody else  to

blame but herself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this matter here because I want to

make  this  as an illustration to show my  contention

that  there  are  shortcomings in  the  HDB's  tender

system  for  shop  premises. I hope  the  authorities

concerned  will  take  steps to  review  this  tender

system as early as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee:</b> Sir, every year the Government is

spending large sums of money on national development.

The Housing and Development Board is undertaking most

of  the housing development. Today, when one takes  a

ride   around  Singapore,  one  can  see  HDB   flats

mushrooming  all  over Singapore. The  HDB  not  only

builds  low-cost flats for the people but also hawker

centres,   markets   and  shops   for   hawkers   and

shopkeepers.  Most  of the development  projects  are

well-planned and this has brought satisfaction to the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this cannot be said for the project at

Changi  Village  which falls within my  constituency.

More  than  a year ago the RDB completed  the  Changi

Village  Market and Food Centre which has a total  of

166 stalls, some of which are still vacant today. The

HDB  also built 92 units of three-room flats  and  46

shops  besides  the Changi Village  Market  and  Food

Centre.   I   understand  that  further   development

projects by the HDB in this area were shelved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till today, the market is poorly patronised as

the  expected growth in population in Changi  Village

does  not  come  about as a consequence.  Demand  for

their  goods  is very lacking. Business at  the  food

centre is only slightly better than the market, as it

is  usually  frequented  by picnickers  and  the  SBS

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the rent for the hawker stalls is low when

compared  with  the rent for stalls in other  markets

and  food  centres,  these  hawkers  still  find   it

difficult  to keep their heads above the  water.  The

shopkeepers are also in a dilemma. Although they  are

granted  concessional rental rising from  $277,  they

are  also  finding  it, difficult to  meet  as  their

present business is solely dependent on the residents

who occupy only a handful of the three-room flats  in

the  vicinity. In fact, the demand for their services

from these residents is very poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, Sir, all these are the results of

poor  planning and bad foresight for my  constituency

by  the  Housing  and  Development  Board.  This  has

brought about unnecessary losses not only to most  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



hawkers in the Changi Village Market and Food  Centre

but  also  to  the  shopkeepers as well  since  their

business started sometime in early 1976. Undoubtedly,

this  has caused discontent among these people  whose

business has been adversely affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shopkeepers have jointly appealed to me to

persuade  the  HDB  to  allow them  to  maintain  the

present  monthly  rental and defer  the  annual  rent

increase  of  10%  until such time  when  either  the

Singapore Tourist Promotion Board decides to organise

tours for tourists through the travel agents to visit

Changi  Village  or  when  the  Changi  International

Airport  becomes  operational in mid-1980,  whichever

comes  about first. By which time, it is  hoped  that

the  demand for their services will greatly  improve.

As for the hawkers who have requested for a change of

stalls to other markets and food centres, I hope that

the  HDB's  Area  Office will kindly  consider  their

request  in  view  of  poor business  in  the  Changi

Village Market and Food Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon.

Minister  what  immediate  steps  will  be  taken  to

improve  the  situation that I have just highlighted,

should  the  appeal  and requests by  these  affected

people be unacceptable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

raise a point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Thank you, Sir, for your

permission.  (In  Mandarin) I  rise  to  support  the

Member  for  Tiong Bahru in his suggestion  that  the

present  tender  system of allocating  shop  premises

should be reviewed. I remember last year at this time

I also raised this matter here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, the HDB estate is very small and

there  are  only about 200 units of flats. Yet  there

are  about  a few scores of shophouses. The  tendered

rentals  paid  by coffeeshops ranged from  $2,000  to

$3,000 p.m. not $5,000, but after two to three months

they  closed shop. Many of the other shops also  have

to  close down one after the other because they could

not pay the high rentals. Ta'boleh tahan - they could

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



bear  it  any more. I would like to know  whether  in

deciding to build any shop premises the HDB has  made

a detailed survey of the surrounding areas to see how

big  the population is and how many shop premises are

already there.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, Jalan Kayu. On both sides of the

street  there  are about at least 200 shophouses.  In

the  past, these 200 shops catered for the  needs  of

the  British  forces in the Seletar base.  Therefore,

the  place developed into a township. But during 1968

and  1969, with the withdrawal of the British forces,

their business was badly affected. Some of them moved

to  other places and some others changed their lines.

After  two or three years, they have adapted  to  the

new  situation and their business is picking up.  But

the Housing and Development Board started to build  a

shopping  centre with more shop premises  at  Seletar

Hills  around Jalan Kayu. As a result, the businesses

of  the  shops both at the shopping centre and  along

the two sides of Jalan Kayu are again badly affected.

This  is  most incomprehensible! I believe  you  will

agree  with me when I say that the Housing  Board  is

motivated  by the urge to make money when they  carry

out its projects of building shop premises. There  is

no   consideration   for  the   livelihood   of   the

shopkeepers and others. Where there are so many  shop

premises, yet the HDB would build more shop premises,

"It  is  up to you whether you want to bid for $5,000

or  $6,000 a month for rental. Whether or not you  go

bankrupt that is your business." This is not right. I

understand that in Ang Mo Kio the tendered rental has

gone  up  to as high as $6,000 a month for one  shop

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this question merits consideration

because  this  will  eventually  affect  the   living

standard  of  all of us, the people. The  businessmen

are  not  fools  and they will pass on the  increased

burden  to  the consumers. The price for a  plate  of

kway  teow will be increased from $1 to $2, and  when

business  is  good it can be sold  at  $4.  You  see?

Consequently, all these extra costs will be passed on

to the consumers. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



fleece  comes from the sheep. We are like sheep;  our

wool  is  fleeced by other people. How much  fleecing

can we tolerate by other people? Sir, I thank you for

giving me this opportunity to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir,I believe the policy of the

HDB is to require owners of flats to pay out of their

own pockets for repairs of major defects like cracks,

for  instance, that occur in their flats a year after

the handing over of the flats by the HDB to the owner

occupier. Sir,I fail to see why the onus of  repairs

should  be  on the owner-occupier if the defects  are

due  to poor construction or arise from poor building

materials used. This policy has to be changed and the

HDB  owner-occupiers should not be made  to  pay  the

price  of  poor  workmanship or substandard  building

materials.  In  fact, the HDB can  get  rid  of  this

problem  or  can at least minimise it by establishing

greater vigilance over their building contractors.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me

start  with  the last speaker, the Member for  Potong

Pasir.  Whether  or not the major defect  is  due  to

structure  or  poor workmanship,  and  if  it  occurs

within  a  certain guarantee period it  will  be  the

responsibility  of  the HDB to  rectify;  but  if  it

exceeds  that  period then I think it is  the  owner-occupier's responsibility. This is applicable to both

private  and  public  sectors. As  to  the  need  for

greater vigilance on the part of the HDB, I think  we

have gone through that many times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is still poor.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> If it is still poor, HDB is trying

its  best to make sure that it is not so poor. I have

stated  previously  what the HDB has  done.  To  save

time,  I  am  prepared to send to the hon.  Member  a

statement to show what the HDB has done because  this

matter has been debated over the last few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next query was from the Member for Changi

regarding the hardship of the shopkeepers and  market

stall-holders at Changi Village. In the first  place,

Changi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



Village  was  never  intended to be  developed  as  a

public  housing project. What the HDB  has  done  was

merely to resettle the temporary shophouses at Changi

Village  when business was good during the boom  when

the British military forces were around. What the HDB

did  was  merely to provide them with better housing,

hoping that business would be still better. I am sure

the  HDB itself did not know that the British  forces

were  pulling out so soon. In fact, during the period

of  resettlement  some of the shopkeepers  which  the

Member   referred   to   were   offered   alternative

accommodation at Chai Chee New Town but  they  turned

it  down. They had made a wrong choice. So I think it

is  unfair to complain. To put the blame on  the  HDB

for  bad planning because their business today is bad

is  unreasonable.  I  can only  sympathise  with  the

Member  and  hope  that the Tourist  Promotion  Board

would  encourage tour groups to go to Changi  Village

so  that  the  businessmen there will  have  less  to

complain  about. To be fair to the HDB, the  Ministry

is  monitoring  the situation, and  I  have  given  a

satisfactory  reply  to the hon.  Member  during  the

debate on the Presidential Address when he brought up

the  question  of the Changi Village shophouses,  the

vacancies, rentals and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My good friend, the Member for Jalan Kayu, supports

strongly  the Member for Tiong Bahru, as far  as  the

tender system is concerned. First of all, let me  say

that when the HDB plans a housing estate it does know

approximately the number of shophouses in relation to

the  number  of residential units that  it  wants  to

build.   Of   course,  consideration  is   given   to

resettlement  cases. In other words, if  there  is  a

heavy resettlement programme in the vicinity of Jalan

Kayu or perhaps in Yio Chu Kang, the HDB will try its

best to provide a reasonable amount of facilities for

resettlement cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, there were only two

resettlement cases. Only two shops were resettled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me explain. During the

planning stage when the HDB is considering facilities

for resettlement cases,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



the  HDB  is  in  no position to know  whether  those

facilities  will  be  taken up  by  the  resettlement

cases.  In  fact,  this is one  of  the  problems  of

resettlement. That is why resettlement cannot proceed

as  fast as it should. Once the shophouses are ready,

the  HDB offers them to the resettlement cases  as  a

first  priority.  It is only after  the  resettlement

cases  have turned down the offer, as in the case  of

Changi  Village,  that the HDB  offers  them  to  the

public. Once it is open to the public, it is  on  the

open tender system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the HDB does give some thought to

the proportion between shophouse requirements and the

number of housing units built. Here again, it is just

accidental  that the Jalan Kayu shops at Seletar  Air

Base or in the Housing Board estates do not have  too

good  a  business. This is unfortunate. I think  that

during the planning stage the HDB did not foresee the

British  withdrawal. It is also a fact that it  could

not  foresee what a particular shopping complex  will

turn out to be in, say, two, three or five years from

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the tender system. The HDB is undertaking

public  housing  which is highly  subsidised  by  the

Government.  It is true that the HDB derives  certain

revenue  from the tender system, which  is  used,  in

turn,  to  help reduce the subsidy that the HDB  gets

from the Government. Whilst I am sympathetic with the

Member  that  this  tender system is  not  ideal  and

perhaps even incomplete, from the record of the HDB's

rental of shops, the majority of the shops are  doing

reasonably well. I cannot give the exact figure,  but

I know it because I also happen to be the Chairman of

the Shop Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter the complaint that the rental is as high

as  $4,000 and $5,000 or even $5,300 p.m., we have an

actual  case of $7,300 rental in an estate  which  is

not  a tourist attraction. But somehow because of its

locality  it  is  doing reasonably well  and  it  has

survived  the last two years or so. But  it  is  true

that in certain areas the rental tendered could be on

the  high side. I think the rental should be left  to

market forces. In other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



words,  if  a particular businessman or a  particular

shopowner chooses to tender at a certain price,  then

it  is difficult for the HDB to say, "Well, you  have

tendered  it too high." Each businessman must  decide

what  he  thinks is a reasonable rental and  he  must

also  know what are the chances of his survival. From

my  experience, I would say that whenever we received

tenders  for  coffee  shops,  for  example, what  is

surprising about a tender of $5,500 is that there are

a  number  of other tenders at around $5,000.  So  if

there  is  only  one tender of $5,500  against  other

tenders  at about $3,000, then I do concede there  is

something  wrong  with that tender  as  far  as  that

particular  locality is concerned. But  if  all  five

tenders  for  a particular shop are at  the  rate  of

approximately between $5,000 and $5,500, then as  far

as  the Shop Committee of the HDB is concerned, it is

a  reasonable tender. It reflects the rental rate for

that particular area. But to satisfy Members here, if

this  tender  system  can be improved,  as  has  been

suggested  by other MPs, the HDB will look  into  it.

But  in the meantime I think we should carry on  with

this system. To be fair to the HDB, there are cases - I do not know whether or not it is in Jalan Kayu, but

definitely in other areas - where payment of  50%  of

the  rental  makes  life extremely  difficult  for  a

particular resettlement case, a concession which  the

HDB  or the Shop Committee has allowed, instead of  a

10% increment every year over the next five years. So

the  Shop  Committee has allowed the rental  in  that

particular  resettlement case to  remain  at  50%.  I

would  say that if there is any particular case which

requires  urgent attention and the tenant  is  really

finding it difficult to maintain his livelihood,  the

Shop  Committee has the discretion to recommend,  for

resettled  cases a stagnating rent, at  a  particular

rate for a particular period of time.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue with the request of the Member for Tiong

Bahru, he  has suggested that the 20%  down  payment

should  be  reduced  to 10% or  adjusted  to  10%  on

application  and 10% on allocation. I regret  to  say

that, as in the purchase of houses in both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



the  public and private sectors, one has to make  the

down payment on application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am sympathetic with the cases of those who

are  not contributors to the CPF such as taxi drivers

and  hawkers  who may not be able to  make  the  down

payment.  I regret to say that in the case of  public

housing  where  Government subsidy is  already  high,

sometimes  the  20% down payment does  not  even  pay

towards  the  land cost which is apportioned  over  a

period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also true that the HDB derives a certain

amount  of  interest  because,  as  the  Member   has

correctly  pointed out, it takes maybe two  or  three

years  before an applicant gets a balloted  flat.  So

the  HDB  does  derive  interest  from  the  time  of

application  up to the balloting date. In  fact,  the

interest  derived merely helps to reduce the  subsidy

the  HDB  gets from Government. I regret to say  that

the  HDB  or  the  Ministry is  not  agreeable  to  a

reduction of the 20% down payment nor would it  agree

to  payment at the balloting date instead of  at  the

time of application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah, as he himself has

pointed  out, has brought up very  minor  points.  I

think  those minor points could be easily settled  by

the  HDB  Area Office. I would like to thank him  for

his comment that the HDB is doing a good job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the Member for Katong. As usual, he has

put very difficult questions for the HDB to reply. He

wants to know the criteria used for the selection  of

a  programme to improve the one-room emergency flats.

I  regret to tell him that honestly the priority  is,

first stage is merely to improve the lighting in  the

emergency  flats. I have indicated to the Member  for

Tiong  Bahru during Question time last week that  the

first  stage is to provide better lighting along  the

corridors  and  then to improve on other  facilities,

such  as  staircases, or simply turn on,  the  lights

during  the day. The next stage would, therefore,  be

the conversion of these units into larger units. But,

here  again,  it  depends on  whether  the  residents

living in a particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



block  of  one-room emergency flats  can  afford  the

better  one-room improved flats, which means a higher

rental. Can they afford to move to a larger flat?  If

they cannot, then it would take some time before  any

renovation can be carried out on any particular block

of flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> No programme?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> My answer to the Member for Katong

is  that  there is a general programme  depending  on

situation and circumstances. In fact, the Member  may

have  noted  that during Question time last  week,  I

said that it would take a number of years before  all

the emergency flats could be renovated and converted.

For  the Member for Katong's constituency, I  do  not

know  how  high or how low the priority  is.  But  it

would take a number of years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> That is just what I wanted to know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me next answer the hon.

Member for Henderson who has suggested that there  is

a  need  for a special unit in the HDB. If I remember

correctly, last year when I answered this question, I

said  that  there was no necessity to have a  special

unit  because  the Ministry of Home Affairs  at  that

time  was  looking  into  the  setting  up  of  Block

committees.  I  was told that the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs  has  proceeded with the formation  of  Block

committees consisting of uniformed groups such as the

VCs  and the police who have been given priority  for

HDB  flats. So actually there is no need for the  HDB

to look into this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained about the inefficiency of

the  administration, and quoted the example  of  both

the  HDB  headquarters and the  Area  Office  issuing

summonses on hawkers. Well, I do concede here that if

this  is so, then it shows a lack of co-operation  on

the  part of the Area Office and HQ. In fact,  if  he

can  give  me  particulars  of  the  incident,  I  am

prepared to investigate. Arising from this,  I  could

inform the Area Offices and the Estates Management in

HQ to ensure that such things are not repeated again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Aljunied has brought up a

number  of  points. He complained about  the  regular

breakdown  of  lifts.  He also said  that  inadequate

attention   was   given   to  the   maintenance   and

cleanliness of the old housing estates. He complained

that  there is a lack of adequate facilities for  old

people  and  children  in the  old  estates.  And  he

compared the old estates with the new housing estates

and  said that there are better facilities in the new

housing estates and are better maintained. Let me say

that  there  is  no distinction in  the  standard  of

maintenance  between the old and new estates  because

the  residents  are  paying more  or  less  the  same

conservancy fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I tried to argue out with statistics to

show  that there was no let-up in the cleanliness  of

the  old  estates  and, in fact, gave  results  of  a

survey  which showed that the cleanliness of the  old

estates  had improved. This is borne out by a  survey

conducted  and  reported  by  the  Straits  Times  in

January  1977.  I  think  the  improvement   of   the

cleanliness  of the old estates must be  due  to  the

growing  civic awareness of the residents `themselves

and, I think to claim credit, to the better awareness

of maintenance by the HDB authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also aware that there is a 24-hour

essential maintenance unit which has been set  up  to

attend  to urgent matters. The same is true  for  the

breakdown  of lifts. I am in sympathy with  him  over

the  incident when he was caught in a lift  breakdown

during  one  of his tours. But I think  that  is  not

peculiar to his estate. I myself was caught in a lift

breakdown when I was touring the new HDB area  in  my

constituency.  This is not to give  any  excuse  but,

being an old estate, there must be lifts in the  many

blocks that the Member has in his constituency  which

need  to  be repaired or even replaced by new  lifts.

And  it  could  be just a coincidence that  when  the

Member  got  into  one of these old lifts,  it  broke

down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Not deliberate!



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I am implying that it was not

deliberately  done. Here again, the lift  maintenance

unit is supposed to do regular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



servicing  and  I  would say that  if  there  is  any

serious,  abnormal  and frequent breakdowns,  then  I

would be happy to look into it myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards facilities, it is true that the older

estates  are  not provided with the same  facilities,

such as children's playgrounds, when compared to  the

new  estates.  I  think the Member is agreeable  that

there  is a limitation in what the HDB can do because

the  old estates have already been built and it would

be  difficult to introduce certain facilities even if

the  HDB wants to. For example, if there is no  space

for a children's playground, it is just impossible to

build.  What  the HDB can do is to try and  keep  the

appearance  of the old estate as best as  it  can  by

giving  it  a  whitewash  every  now  and  then   and

maintaining   its  cleanliness  by   more   efficient

supervision over the contractors doing the servicing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, a plan. These old estates have

been  built  since the 1960s and I  think  it  is  a

matter of time - I do not know when, five years  from

now  maybe  -  when  there must be  some  fundamental

change.  The  old blocks may have to be knocked  down

and  replaced with newer blocks or even knocked  down

merely  to provide certain facilities. That  I  think

will take time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Toa Payoh has brought up a

number  of  points. First of all, let me  handle  the

most  difficult ones. He asked me whether I am  aware

that  the  HDB  is  looking into the  possibility  of

getting somebody to handle the sworn declarations.  I

do  not know. But I think if the HDB has told him so,

then it must be so because they do not take the words

of the MP in vain. Anyway, it is quite easy to make a

sworn  declaration. It could be made in most  offices

of Commissioner of Oaths, and I personally do not see

the  difficulty  in getting a sworn  statement  made.

Anyway, I would convey his suggestion to the HDB  and

if  the HDB has told him so, I tend to agree that  it

will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has suggested a better system for the

resale  of  flats, and has complained  that  in  some

cases  the owner of a particular resale flat  has  to

wait something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



like five or six months. I share his sentiments.  But

then  the difficulty that the HDB is facing is  this.

Those who sell their flats within five years will get

the  same  price that they have purchased. But  those

who have owned the flats for more than five years can

sell  at  whatever  price  they  can  fetch  provided

somebody is prepared to buy over. Here again, the HDB

is  faced with the problem of first-come-first-served

and  is  faced with the problem of fairness.  Let  me

give  an example. Let us say in Toa Payoh there is  a

heavy  demand for flats and there is a long queue  of

people  wanting to purchase HDB flats. Mr X wants  to

sell.  Let us say there are 1,000 people waiting  to

buy  a  three-room  flat or a five-room  flat  in  ba

Payoh.  An  owner  of such a flat wants  to  sell  to

Applicant No. 1,000 on the queue because that  person

happens  to  be  his friend or his relative  or  just

happens  to be someone interested to purchase because

he has the money and can pay a lump sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I clarify? I am not

referring to those owners who have completed the five-year  qualification and can sell their flats  to  any

buyer  of  their choice. I am referring to those  who

are  buying larger flats where they must resell their

flat to the Board at cost, otherwise they will not be

eligible to purchase a larger flat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, if the Member is strictly

talking on that point, I concede and I think that  it

should  be  improved. I personally feel that  if  the

Member is referring strictly to those cases with  the

five-year qualification, I personally feel  that  the

case should be looked into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Good show!



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> The Member also suggested that the

HDB  should be more sympathetic towards those  living

in one-room flats by giving them stalls in HDB hawker

centres.  I  think the question of hawker stalls  has

been  debated quite heatedly during the Head  on  the

Ministry  of the Environment. Members are aware  that

the issuing of hawker licences is under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



Licensing  and  Coordinating  Committee,  under   the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister  for

the  Environment,  and  that  the  HDB  provides  the

stalls.  I suppose if the Member feels strongly,  the

HDB  can  make  recommendations to  the  Coordinating

Committee.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But last week, I have already answered the Member

for  Thomson  on this point. There are  a  number  of

stalls  available in his constituency, but  then  the

Coordinating Committee has over 11,000 street hawkers

to resettle. Therefore, I regret to say that this has

to  go through the Coordinating Committee, but if the

Member feels strongly about these hardship cases this

could  be  referred to me for attention. I have  here

figures to show that in financial hardship cases  the

Licensing  Committee has allocated through the  Board

something  like 100 families, and more than  half  of

these 100 cases are from one-room flat tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the request for transfer of hawker stalls from

one  particular place to another, the same answer  is

applicable to the Member for Changi. When business is

not  too  well, they blame the HDB, but  when  it  is

good, they say "Well. I did the right choice." But if

there  is really a strong case such as the family  is

now living in Thomson but because he had been given a

stall  in  Toa  Payoh in the past  and  now  wants  a

transfer  back  to  Thomson,  I  think  that   is   a

reasonable  case for consideration. I see  no  reason

why  the Licensing Coordinating Committee should  not

give sympathetic consideration. I would say that each

case  should  be  treated on its own merit.  In  this

particular  case  which the Member has  mentioned  (I

happen   to   be  the  Chairman  of  the   Allocation

Committee), I would be prepared to look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more important question brought forward by the

Member for ba Payoh is his illustration of two  cases

of  unreasonableness and unsympathetic  consideration

by the HDB -   throwing out deserved cases of ownership. I  must

say  that the HDB operates on the line of policy. Not

only has the Member for Toa Payoh, but at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



Presidential  debates the Member for  Kuo  Chuan  had

also  brought  up  four  cases.  In  fact, the  four

examples  he  gave look reasonable on paper.  I  have

managed  to get a satisfactory explanation  from  the

HDB  as to why they could not concede. In one of  the

two  cases, the one with permanent residence, appears

reasonable to me, and I think that can be considered.

But  in  the  second  case where  the  son  wants  to

transfer  the name to the father so that  he  himself

can  buy  another  HDB flat, I  would  say  that  his

application has been thoroughly thought  out  by  the

HDB.  The reason given by the HDB is to prevent  this

man  from taking advantage of having another HDB unit

because  he  is on the list of original householders.

So  if  he  wants to buy another HDB  unit,  he  goes

through  the normal routine of registration with  his

spouse  or whoever he wants, and he goes through  the

pace.  He  should  not  be given  priority.  HDB  has

thought  of all these possibilities. Where discretion

and sympathy could be exercised, it has been done.  I

can  tell  the  Member that there are many  instances

where the Housing and Development Board has ruled  in

favour  of  cases that are not strictly according  to

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his statement that the HDB is unreasonable in

the purchase of a shophouse by placing a limit on the

ownership  of commercial property and that the  limit

set is arbitrary as no thought has been given, let me

assure him that the Allocation Committee, in which  I

am  also the Chairman, has gone through this question

thoroughly.  The  limit  that  we  set  is  that   an

applicant should not own a commercial property with a

market  value of $250,000 or more. That means  if  he

can  afford to own property worth one-quarter million

dollars, it is hard to convince us that he needs  to

rent  subsidised housing or that he needs to purchase

subsidised  housing of, say, $15,000 or $20,000.  If

he  can afford to buy a $250,000 commercial property,

it  is  more  appropriate for him  to  purchase  HUDC

housing,  which  is about $60,000.  As  far  as  this

particular  ceiling is concerned, plenty  of  thought

has been put into it, and it is a reasonable ceiling.

How  can one borrow $250,000 if one has no collateral

to support the loan? I can merely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



say that HDB has put in plenty of thought into it and

the  ceiling of a quarter million dollars is  a  very

reasonable limit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, in regard to my contribution

to  the debate on this subject, I would like to  know

whether  the Senior Minister of State would  consider

lengthening the period of the responsibility  of  the

HDB  in  regard to major defects arising  because  of

poor workmanship or substandard materials?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, as I have indicated, there is

a  standard period. According to my architects, it is

six months. In some cases, depending on the nature of

the  particular  complaint, it  is  one  year.  I  do

concede  that  if  it is a structural  defect,  which

means  a basic defect right from the word "go", then

on  moving  in  the  defect is found  to  be  due  to

structurally  unsound construction, it is  fair  that

the HDB will have to look at it and perhaps re-do the

whole thing at no extra cost. So a lot depends on the

type of complaint that one is making.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, when I say ``minor'' just now,

I do not mean unimportant. Had HDB been found to have

major faults, I think some of us would not be sitting

in this House today. Like a marriage, it is the minor

faults  in a relationship that in the long run breaks

up  a marriage. It is the same thing here. It is  the

minor  matters  that will bring up  big  problems  in

future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I have already explained that

because it is so minor it could be easily handled  by

the Area Office. There is no need for me to intervene

at  this  juncture. If the unhappiness in a  marriage

could  be resolved at a very low level why go to  the

Bishop  when it could be very easily handled  by  the

priest!



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Sir, in the last few days I have been

very  impressed by the Senior Minister of  State  for

his very direct replies. In the same breath of saying

"no",  he  added, "but if there are problems  I  will

definitely look into them." I felt this a  very  good

strategy.  Perhaps  I am one of the  few  Members  of

Parliament who have that rare privilege of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



being  spared the mundane problems found in HDB flats

as  I  do  not  have any Housing Board  flats  in  my

constituency. Nonetheless, I would like  to  raise  a

problem which concerns the social aspect of HDB life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Senior Minister of

State  whether  the  HDB has a conscious  policy  of

undertaking  a  continuous  indepth  study  on   the

sociological  problems in HDB estates,  and  whether

the  results  from such studies have  been  used  as

guidelines  in  the  day-to-day  administration  and

management of the HDB estates to ensure that, in the

long  run, there will be a more meaningful community

life  in  housing estates. I consider this important

because  just a few years ago a friend from overseas

made  a rather indiscreet remark to me, saying  that "there  are many pigeon coops in Singapore." He  was

referring to our housing estates. To some extent -

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, on a point of order. I am just

enquiring  whether it is in order for the Member  to

bring  up  a  fresh subject not connected  with  the

present debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> But this is on the Housing and

Development Board. Encik Mansor.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> I think it is important

because  all the time we have been talking about  the

physical  aspects of housing estates.  It  is  agreed

that we need to have better and cleaner rooms, better

maintenance  and better hawker centres. It  is  true.

This  is  necessary. But at the same time it is  also

important  for  HDB  to have a  conscious  policy  of

finding   out  whether  there  are  any  sociological

principles  which  can be incorporated  as  part  and

parcel  of  the HDB administration. For example,  the

Marine  Parade  community  hall  represents  a   very

important facility which will allow for a dynamic and

integrated  community  life.  There  is  also  a  new

development in Bedok Housing Estate where the HDB has

allowed  the construction of' partitions at the  void

decks,  which is not seen in other estates. I  raised

this  question with friends in Ang Mo Kio,  and  they

told me that HDB will never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



approve  the construction of such partitions  in  the

void decks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> I am saying that some

friends in Ang Mo Kio say this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir,I would like to

clarify  this  point. In fact, my  kindergartens  are

utilising the void decks provided by the Housing  and

Development  Board. We have two blocks  of  buildings

with such partitions.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, perhaps the

information given by the friend of mine is  wrong  as

the Member for Ang Mo Kio has clarified this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why listen to your friend?



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to

speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> I am trying to stress the

point  that besides the physical amenities,  the  HDB

should also consider developing a principle which has

sociological importance and this should be  part  and

parcel of the HDB administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, may I be permitted to say a few

words  on  what the Member for Kampong Kembangan  has

just now pointed out?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Ng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> He said that an overseas friend of

his  has  indiscreetly described  our  Housing  Board

flats as pigeon coops. Whatever description that  has

been ascribed to our Housing Board flats. I think our

people  living in the Housing Board flats  are  happy

and  contented. So whatever foreigners might  say  or

describe  our  Housing Board flats, I  would  not  be

disturbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of partitioning of void decks,

unfortunately he says he has no Housing Board  flats

in  his  constituency -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That point has already been clarified, Mr Ng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> My point is that he must not listen

to  his friends. He must have it verified either from

his  MP  colleagues or the proper authority, that  is

the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, I must thank my

senior  colleague,  the Member for  Punggol.  He  has

given  me tremendous help by giving good advice.  But

may  I  just  clarify?  I deliberately  described  my

friend's remarks as indiscreet when he said that  our

housing estates look like "pigeon coops."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Why bother!



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> No. I am just saying that

my  overseas friend has wrongly described our housing

estates  as  pigeon coops. I am proud of the  housing

estates  in  Singapore. I just want to  clarify  that

point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, perhaps I can answer the

Member for Kampong Kembangan. The answer is yes.  The

HDB  has  a  research unit. The  HDB  has  done  many

sociological  surveys and, in fact, the  results  are

being implemented on a day-to-day basis, and the very

fact  that he sees the difference between old estates

and  the new ones such as Marine Parade, and that  he

himself  has noticed the flexibility of  the  HDB  in

improving on the newer estates, must indicate to  him

that  the  HDB  is  fully aware of  the  problem.  To

satisfy  him, we actually have a consultant professor

from  Hawaii who is helping us to do this survey  now

and then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Sir, I have touched on only one

point, i.e, the hawkers problem, while  many  other

Members  have touched on various problems.  But  from

the  reply given by the Senior Minister of State,  we

know  that  the HDB faces many problems and  we  also

know  that the Chief Executive Officer of the HDB  is

now  the  Chairman of JTC. One deputy Chief Executive

Officer has just been appointed to run the show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is actually to ask the Senior Minister

of  State to give an assurance to the House that  the

HDB would find ways to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



strengthen  its organisation. So far as  I  can  see,

many problems need deeper discussion. If views can be

obtained   from  grass-roots  level, for   instance.

representatives of CCC or the hawkers' association or

other organisations, maybe the HDB will have to  make

radical  changes to cope with the important needs  in

future. We used to hear the Senior Minister of  State

replying,  "Well, we will look into  it."  Then  what

happens  next year? This same problem will be brought

up  again and he will give the same reply, "Well,  we

will  look  into it." I do not think that is  a  good

reply  as  such. I hope the Senior Minister of  State

will give us a positive answer on this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, each passing year must find

different  problems. In fact, I have  not  failed  in

that  when I did say last year that I would look into

a  problem,  I  think those MPs who  had  brought  up

problems  to me then can testify that these  problems

have been looked into. But one must bear in mind that

the  HDB  is  a  big organisation, and like  any  big

organisation, it has problems. I for one do  not  say

that  the HDB has no problems at all. As far  as  the

Ministry  is  concerned, the HDB is a  big  statutory

board under the Ministry of National Development.  It

suffices for me to say that the Ministry is paying  a

lot   of  attention  in  trying  to  strengthen   the

administration  of  the HDB.  In  fact,  by  personal

example, since I have taken the trouble to chair both

the  Allocation Committee and the Shops Committee  as

far  as  tender is concerned, must clearly reflect  a

sincere  attempt  by  the  Ministry  to  try  and  do

something    to    improve   and    strengthen    its

administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I wish you success.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I can only assure the House that

whatever efforts that we have put in will come up  to

your  high  expectation but. I  think  like  any  big

organisation, problems are bound to arise. I can only

say that when they do arise, we will try our best  to

solve them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Sir, I beg to withdraw my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (b) of subhead AAA 3020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Preservation of Monuments Board was

set  up  in  1971,  it has done commendable  work  in

relation to the objects of the Board in view  of  the

constraints, especially financial constraints,  which

it faced. The Board has gazetted and placed under its

protection  more  than  a dozen  buildings  including

places  of  worship, the Telok Ayer  Market  and  the

Thong  Chai Medical Institution building.  The  Board

has  viewed  the possibilities of placing  under  its

protection  other monuments including government  and

civic  buildings,  buildings  of  public  resort  and

residential buildings. All these will serve to remind

us  of  our  cultural roots and of how our  forebears

lived  and  worked  and  worshipped  and  contributed

towards what Singapore is today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a number of points that I would

like to raise about the work of the Board. First, the

objects  of  the  Board  as stated  in  the  relevant

legislation  seem  to focus the Board's  interest  on

buildings  and this has come to be reflected  by  the

prominent position of architects on the Board. It  is

good  that  there should be architects  and  planners

because  in the process of renewal of the  city  such

people  are important in helping the preservation  of

the  old  amidst the re-building of the  new.  But  I

think the Board needs at least one person with a very

strong  historical orientation: a historian,  because

how we have come together is history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, because of the orientation of the Board to

monuments, i.e, buildings, and perhaps because of the

absence  of a person on the Board strongly  committed

to  history, the Board has yet to turn its  attention

to   important  locations  and  events,  places   and

happenings  not  related  to  buildings,  places  and

happenings  that  should  be commemorated  for  their

historical value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One illustration that comes to mind is that this

year  is  the centenary of the planting of the  first

rubber tree in Singapore. The site is known. I  think

it is very close to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



University of Singapore. And I think it is worthwhile

memorialising the location as rubber has had so  much

historical  and economic connotations for  Singapore,

recalling  to mind people who have been brought  from

India  to  work in the plantations in the region  and

the   assiduous  industry  of  the  Chinese  workers,

including  women workers and entrepreneurs  who  have

contributed to the development of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that because of financial

limitations   the  Board  has  not   brought   itself

adequately  to the general notice of the  people.  In

other  words, it has not been able  to  give  enough

attention to the third of the four objectives set out

by  its  legislation, namely,  to  stimulate  public

interest  and support. Institutions like the  Science

Centre, the National Library and the National  Museum

have  an adequate capacity for public relations  with

schools  and  other institutions. It  is  not  enough

merely to have a list of buildings and monuments  and

to  spend money to preserve these places. Thought has

to be given to bringing such places constantly to the

mind  of the people especially our young people in  a

way  that can repeatedly suggest to them how they are

identified with one another and with Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Katong

has  brought  up two valid points. He suggested  that

something should be done to preserve the site in view

of  the  centenary of rubber planting. I am  glad  to

report  that  the  Ministry has  given  in  principle

approval to the interested party and that a site will

be set aside to preserve its historical value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his observation that there is a need for a

historian on the Preservation of Monuments  Board,  I

think  his  suggestion could be looked into.  At  the

next  round of appointments, this could be taken into

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as to his observation that insufficient

efforts  have  been made to publicise  and  stimulate

interest  on  the  need  to  preserve  buildings   or

locations of historical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



interest, I can merely say that the Board is aware of

this  need to stimulate public interest and, in fact,

members  of the Board have given talks to the  public

and  participated  in Radio and TV  programmes.  They

have also given talks to selected bodies, such as the

Tourist  Promotion Board, the Housing and Development

Board  as  well as the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

But  if  this does not come up to the expectation  of

the  Member,  would he please bear in mind  that  the

Board is an extremely small one and that it has  only

a  secretary and one or two clerical staff.  Most  of

the  members  on  the  Board are volunteers.  So  one

should not expect too much from members of the Board.

But  I  would convey his observation and comments  to

the Board accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am very gratified that the

Senior Minister of State will convey my sentiments to

the  Board. I think the matter is of great importance

that  more  and  more  people  are  brought  to   the

realisation, as I have said, of their past. And it is

not  just  a  question of a small  number  of  people

working  on  the  Board. If it is necessary, greater

support has to be given to the Board so that when the

Minister of State conveys my sentiments to the  Board

I hope he conveys a lot more money also to the Board.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, as far as money is concerned.

he  is  aware  that that comes under the Ministry  of

Finance.  To  satisfy  him  that  I  am  sincere   in

conveying his sentiments to the Monuments Board, I am

actually  having  lunch  with  the  Chairman  of  the

Preservation  of  Monuments  Board  as  well  as  the

Chairman  of the Tourist Promotion Board  to  discuss

what  can  be  done to improve or to  stimulate  this

interest  on  the  need to preserve  some  historical

sites or buildings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I take the point, Sir. And I also take

the  point of his reference to the Singapore  Tourist

Promotion Board. This is the whole point. It  is  not

to the tourists that we want to give an impression of

what  Singapore is. It is our people that we want  to

give the impression to, of what Singapore is and  how

they are related to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister does not wish to reply, I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, do you wish to reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 3020*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $68 million appropriated for the

development and construction of more housing units as

well as to provide better and more adequate amenities

for  our  people  is a very large sum  of  money.  No

doubt,  the  HDB has attained many fine  achievements

over the past ten-odd years. At present, over 50%  of

our   population  are  living  in  HDB  flats.   Such

achievements are indeed praiseworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there are still shortcomings in the

administration of the HDB. I would like to raise  the

following  points  and complaints with  the  Minister

concerned.  Firstly,  as regards  application  for  a

change of flats, the HDB officers are carrying out  a

contradictory  policy.  Take,  for  example,  in   my

constituency,  a  couple with two children,  who  are

living in a one-room unit. They now want to change to

a two-room unit because their children have grown up.

But their application has been rejected on the ground

that  there  are  too few members  in  their  family.

However,  on  the  other  hand,  our  Government   is

encouraging small families to apply for bigger  flats

with more rooms. Is this not a contradictory measure?

I  think so, because a married couple is eligible  to

apply  for  a 5-room flat. Such instance  shows  that

some  of the civil servants do not have a clear  idea

about  Government  policy. Such an erroneous  way  of

doing things should be put right immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the increasingly higher bids for HDB shop

units have resulted in soaring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



commodity prices. In some estates, for instance,  the

bid  for  a  grocery  shop unit was  over  $2,000, a

textile  retail shop unit over $3,000, and  a  coffee

cum eating house shop unit over $7,000. If things  go

on  like this, I am afraid that there will be another

round  of  inflation. Be it grocery or coffee  eating

house shop, higher bids mean increased cost for  them

and they will certainly pass the Increased cost on to

the  consumers by raising the selling prices of their

goods.  The end result is an increased burden on  the

consumers. I would like, therefore, to suggest  again

to  the Minister concerned that in the allocation  of

shop  units, the HDB should fix the rentals for  them

and  should there be more than one applicant for  the

same  unit, allocation should be decided by  ballot.

This  is not only a fair and sensible method but also

a  way to maintain rentals at reasonable levels. With

reasonable rentals, the goods in these shops  can  be

sold  at  lower  prices and the general  public  will

benefit  immensely;  so will the  livelihood  of  our

people  and the economic development of the  country.

In  this way, Singapore will be spared the anguish of

another  inflation. I think this  suggestion  is  not

something  new.  It  is  a  system  which  is   being

practised in our country. The allocation of HDB flats

and hawker stalls is all carried out by ballot to the

satisfaction  of  all. As far as I know, shops  with

high  rentals cannot survive for long. Many  of  them

have  closed  down because they were operating  at  a

loss,  Many of them are in arrears of large  sums  of

rentals. As a result, the HDB has to resort to  legal

action to recover the payments. This state of affairs

shows  clearly  the undesirable consequences  of  the

system of unrestricted bidding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem concerns the many HDB flats in

certain  areas  which have not been  taken  up  after

allotment and have been left vacant for a long  time.

There  are many such vacant flats in my constituency,

for  instance. Marsiling (a part of the Woodlands New

Town), and  I  believe the same  is  true  of  other

housing   estates.  Why?  We  have   almost   100,000

applicants on the waiting lists for HDB flats and, at

the same time, the HDB



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



has  so  many  flats unoccupied.  Is  this  not  very

strange?  This also represents a loss of  revenue  to

the  Government. There is one more problem I wish  to

bring up about my constituency, Marsiling. I wish  to

know how many units of flats and shop-houses will  be

built  in  the  constituency under  the  HDB  housing

programme  for  this year, and whether any  provision

has   been   made  in  future  programmes   for   the

construction  of a library and community  centres  in

the  constituency, as these are two essential  social

amenities  in such a big New Town which,  when  fully

developed,  will be even bigger than the present  Toa

Payoh satellite town.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong Leong Boon is not here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member  has  always complained that the HDB  has  not

helped  to alleviate the plight of the large families

living  in  one- or two-room flats. However,  in  the

past, overcrowding was accepted as one of the reasons

for  transfer  to a larger flat. But I  think  he  is

aware  of  the  new  policy where the  HDB  will  now

register  all applications for transfer provided  the

two-year  period of qualification has  been  complied

with,  and  this is not restricted by the  number  of

persons in the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second query is on the balloting of HDB shops. I

have  spent a lot of time just now explaining to hon.

Members the rationale behind the tendering system  of

HDB  shops. It merely suffices me to mention  to  him

now   that  the  system  has  proved  to  be  working

satisfactorily and that there is no necessity at this

stage  to change this system. But to satisfy  him  we

can  monitor  the situation and, if at a  much  later

stage a better system is required, we will look  into

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regarding his question of how many dwelling

units  and  shop  houses will be constructed  at  the

Woodlands New Town, the answer is that 5,231 dwelling

units  and  65  shops  will  be  constructed  at  the

Woodlands New Town. Another 153 dwelling units and 59

shops  are  under construction. Ultimately  Woodlands

New



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



Town  will  have a projected total number  of  55,000

dwelling  units. Sites have been kept aside  for  the

building  of  a  library and a  community  centre  in

Woodlands New Town.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sir, a supplementary question. I

would like to know whether the Minister concerned  is

aware  that when a tender received is too low  for  a

shophouse, the HDB authority has always reserved  its

right  to call for a re-tender in order to get higher

bids.  Is  this done intentionally to cater  for  the

higher bidders?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I have indicated just now

that  it  is based on the tender system.  But  as  he

knows, one of the requirements is that for each  call

of tenders there is a minimum rental. In other words,

before  anyone can tender for a particular  shop  the

HDB  tells him that there is a minimum rental of say.

$500. He must be a bad businessman who expects to get

a  shop  by  tendering at $450, when  the  stipulated

minimum  is $500 rental. So where there is no demand,

or when there is only one tender below the stipulated

minimum  of $500, then it is up to the Shop Committee

to  decide whether to re-tender it or to let  it  go.

But chances are that there will be a second tender to

see whether we could attract a higher tender price.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> So the intention is to get a

higher  bidder! Sir, although the Senior Minister  of

State  concerned  has  not given  me  a  satisfactory

answer  on this matter, I still beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this late hour I shall ask only one simple

question.  What  is  the  National  Economic  Service

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, the Member for Marine Parade wants  to

know  what is the National Economic Service  Training

Scheme  all  about.  The  National  Economic  Service

Training  Scheme  is  designed primarily  to  provide

apprenticeships  and  artisan  training   to   school

leavers  between the ages of 14 and  18.  The  Scheme

started in April 1 975 and is operated jointly by the

Public  Works Department and the Industrial  Training

Board. Under the Scheme school leavers are given  two

years'  training  in the various construction  trades

and  are  taught  various skills. For  instance, bar

bending, carpentry, masonry and painting, are some of

the construction trades which are being learnt by the

trainees.  Moreover,  trainees  are  also  given  the

opportunity  to learn different skills on  electrical

workshop   practice, mechanical  workshop  practice,

traffic   survey,   land   surveying,   road   works,

horticulture and landscaping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme is divided into two categories. The first

category   allows  the  trainees  to  do   on-the-job

training with contractors who undertake Public  Works

Department   projects  at  various  worksites.   This

practical  training is limited to four  days  a  week

during  the first year. The trainees spend the  other

one and a half days in the week at Punggol Vocational

Institute for theoretical training. During the second

year, the trainees spend five and a half days a  week

with the contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other category allows the trainees to spend full-time learning various skills in PWD branches.

Trainees  receive  an allowance  of  $100  per  month

during the first year and

$130  per  month  during the second year.  Since  the

Scheme  started  in 1975, three batches  of  trainees

have  been recruited. The total intake for the  three

batches  is  207. So far, 25 of them have  terminated

their  training. Another batch of about  90  trainees

will be selected for training in April 1977.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this provision is for the 10th Council Meeting

of  the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Centre.

This Council has held nine meetings, and this is  for

the  10th meeting. I would like the Minister to  tell

us  since  the  Council  has held  so  many  meetings

whether any concrete results have been achieved?  Has

our  Government concluded any fishing agreements with

other  Southeast Asian countries? Although  Singapore

is  an  island  State, our yield in  fishing  is  not

sufficient.  According  to  statistics,   our   yield

amounts  to  only  about  one-quarter  of  our  total

consumption.  In other words, 75% of our  consumption

of  fish  have to be imported from abroad. Therefore,

the  Primary  Production Department had indicated  at

one time that it would go all out to develop deep-sea

fishing so as to enable our fishermen or merchants to

invest or to participate in offshore fishing in order

to  increase our yields in fishing. However. I regret

to  say  that,  according to  the  Auditor-General's

Report  for 1975-76, the Fishery Training  Centre  at

Changi set up jointly by the Singapore Government and

the United Nations Development Programme in 1969, had

closed down on the 21st June, 1976, after a lapse of a

few  years.  Out  of  99 trainees,  only  eight  took

employment on board fishing vessels. The others  took

up other jobs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether our

Government's attitude towards deep-sea fishing is  to

continue to develop this industry or whether it  will

discontinue its policy on deep-sea fishing.  I  would

like  the  Minister  to explain  to  this  House  the

questions that I have raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you

for  giving me the opportunity to say a few words  on

this   subject.   I  would  like  the   Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for National Development to

enlighten  this House as to the purpose of this  10th

Council  Meeting  of  the Southeast  Asian  Fisheries

Development  Centre  and also  what  benefits  do  we

derive  as  a  result of attending this 10th  Council

Meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I had in this House suggested that

perhaps we can look towards the ASEAN region  with  a

view   to  establishing  bilateral  or  multi-lateral

cooperation with regard to fishing in ASEAN waters. I

would  be  grateful, Sir, if the Senior  Minister  of

State  could  enlighten this House as to whether  any

approach has been made in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, the Southeast Asian

Fisheries  Development Centre (SEAFDC) is a  regional

organisation established in December 1967  under  the

auspices  of the Ministerial Conference for  Economic

Development   of   Southeast  Asia.   The   agreement

establishing the Centre was signed by the Governments

of  Japan,  Malaysia, the Philippines,  Thailand  and

Singapore  which are member countries of SEAFDC,  The

Centre's    objective   is   to   promote   fisheries

development   in   Southeast  Asia   through   mutual

cooperation among the member governments and  through

collaboration  with international  organisations  and

other governments. To meet this objective, the Centre

has   established  three  departments, namely,   the

Fisheries   Training  Department  in  Thailand,   the

Aquaculture  Department in the  Philippines  and  the

Marine Fisheries Research Department which is located

at   Changi  in  Singapore.  A  major  research   and

development programme, improved harvest,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



technology   of   fish  and  fishery   products   was

undertaken   by   the   Marine   Fisheries   Research

Department  with  the  cooperation  of  the  Japanese

government. This programme is of immediate benefit to

us  as we are largely dependent on imported fish  for

consumption.  Singapore  also  participates  in   the

activities  of the other two departments  located  in

the  Philippines  and  Thailand through  exchange  of

research data and training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong wants to know why the Fishery

Training Centre at Changi was closed down. The answer

is  quite simple. It is because in Singapore we still

do  not  have the deep-sea fishing industry.  So  the

trainees   after   graduation   could   hardly   find

employment  in  the fishing vessels.  Of  course, we

encourage  deep-sea  fishing.  This  is  Government's

policy. But the initiative must come from the private

sector.   We   will  give  every  encouragement   and

assistance  if the private sector is prepared  to  go

into deep-sea fishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Punggol asked whether it is

possible to have a joint venture on deep-sea  fishing

between the ASEAN countries. As Members are aware, we

have  several economic cooperation ventures with  the

ASEAN  countries underway and perhaps the  Government

would  explore  the  possibility of  having  deep-sea

fishing  ventures with the other ASEAN  countries  in

the near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.

Just  now  the  Parliamentary Secretary replied  that

very  few  of the graduands from the Fishery Training

Centre  could find employment in the deep-sea fishing

industry.  For  the  information  of  the  House, at

Kangkar  in  my Constituency, there is  one  type  of

fishing  industry  going  on  there.  That  is  otter

trawling which involves fishing activities around the

area  of Horsburgh Lighthouse. We have got about  100

such boats and I do not see that job opportunities in

this respect can be found wanting.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, in an oral answer. I have

already  given  the reasons for the  closure  of  the

Fishery  Training Centre. In fact, there was  also  a

question  on otter trawling submitted by  the  Member

for  Punggol.  The  answer  is  simple.  The  Fishery

Training Centre was closed down, as explained  by  my

Parliamentary  Secretary,  because   there   was   no

response  from people or from the younger  generation

who wish to take up fishing as a career, In fact,  if

I  remember  correctly. I quoted statistics  to  show

that  out of so many graduates only four or seven  (I

cannot  remember  the  exact number)  finally  got  a

fishing  job. That is a very simple answer. Moreover.

the officers of the Primary Production Department are

finding  it difficult to interest people to  take  up

this  particular  course. I think it  is  because  of

economic factors that the Centre was closed.
