<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology (a) what is the  number

of  road  accidents involving school buses ferrying  kindergarten

children  to and from home from 1997 to 1999; and (b) whether  he

will, in the interest of safeguarding road safety of kindergarten

children travelling between home and school by buses, (i)  compel

all vehicles carrying out this responsibility to be equipped with

children's  seats and safety belts, (ii) make sure  there  is  at

least  one  attendant in the bus attending to  the  children  and

(iii) formulate guidelines on age limits of these bus attendants.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

according to statistics by the Traffic Police (TP), between  1997

and  1999, no kindergarten child travelling in a school  bus  has

suffered  any  fatal or serious injuries.  TP's  statistics  show

that  there  was  an average of six accidents per year  involving

school  buses,  which  resulted in  fatal  and  serious  injuries

affecting  other motorists and pedestrians.  Of the total  number

of  accidents in the three years, only about 0.1% involved school

buses that resulted in fatal and serious injuries.  None of these

accidents  which  resulted  in  such  injuries  involved   school

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing guidelines under the Road Traffic (Public Service

Vehicles)  Rules require school bus owners to provide  attendants

of  at  least  16  years  of age when school  buses  carry  small

children  enrolled  in child care centres or  kindergartens.  The

same  requirement applies when school buses carry  more  than  30

older school children.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the requirement for school buses to have a bus

attendant, the authorities also impose a speed limit of  50  km/h

for such buses.  The drivers will hence have to comply with these

requirements  as well as other traffic rules to ensure  the  road

safety  of  the  children.  Compelling all  school  buses  to  be

installed  with seat belts will have cost implications  for  both

the  bus owners and the parents.  The LTA and Traffic Police will

continue  to  monitor  the  situation and  consider  implementing

additional safety measures, if necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  prevention  is better than cure.  I heard the  Minister  of

State  say about cost effectiveness.  Could he elaborate what  we

can  do  more to balance this issue of cost implications and  the

issue of protection of children as young as 31/2 years old?  What

could we do more?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most important

is the safety record.  And because of the safety measures that we

implemented, that is, the speed limit of the buses and  also  the

requirement of having the bus attendants, the safety  record  has

shown that we do not have a safety problem.  But I do agree  with

the Member that we can try to do more if we can, and therefore we

can  step  up, for instance, the training of the attendants.   We

can  consider,  subject  to the discussion  with  bus  operators,

whether   they   can   perhaps  implement   more   cost-effective

protection, maybe padding and so on.  But what is most  important

is  that  we do not think that we have a safety problem  at  this

moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, does the Ministry

think  that because the accident rate is only 0.1%, he says  that

there  is no safety problem?  But I think in such accident  cases

involving  school  children,  you should  look  at  the  absolute

numbers rather than the figures.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Potong Pasir did not hear what I said.  The 0.1% we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



talking about is the statistics involving the school buses.   But

as far as the children are concerned, there is no serious injury.

So  that  is the point.  If you want to have no accident at  all,

then let us not drive on the road.

<div align="center"><b>LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF COMPUTER USERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology whether, in  the  light

of  incidents  such  as  the  surreptitious  scanning  of  users'

computers   by  an  Internet  service  provider  or  by   others,

legislation  protecting  the privacy of computer  users  will  be

enacted,  which will in turn also serve to encourage the  greater

use of the Internet for e-commerce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our assessment is

that  it is not necessary at this point in time to enact separate

legislation to protect the privacy of computer users.  We have in

place  legislation,  such as the Official Secrets  Act,  Computer

Misuse  Act  and  Banking Act, to protect the confidentiality  of

data  held  by  the  Government, statutory boards  and  financial

institutions.  In the private sector, several professions such as

the medical and legal fields already have strict codes of conduct

in place to ensure proper handling of data.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the scanning incident, as mentioned by Prof.

Chin, IDA issued a set of guidelines on the conduct of preventive

security  scanning by the Internet Access Service Providers.   It

will  assure Internet subscribers that security scanning  by  the

IASPs  will  be guided by a code of ethical practices to  respect

users' privacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving ahead, we are developing a model set of self-regulation code of practices on the protection of personal

information  for  reference by the industry.  We  will  encourage

industry  associations  and  various  business  and  professional

bodies  to  adapt  the code for application in  their  respective

sectors.  This is to strike

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



a   right   balance  between  consumer  protection  and  business

efficacy,  and  not lead to excessive business  compliance  costs

which will ultimately be paid for by the consumers.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Two supplementary

questions,  Sir.  Can the Minister of State confirm  that  credit

card  companies actually are not caught by any of the  pieces  of

legislation  he  had  mentioned?   Credit  card  companies,   for

example,  are  not caught by the Official Secrets Act.   What  is

there to stop credit card companies, for example, processing data

of  users  of  credit cards and selling them to  other  companies

doing business?  And the second question is: Is it the Ministry's

view  that the code of practices would be sufficient to  regulate

the whole industry?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, basically, in my reply, I

mentioned  that there are codes of conduct in the  industry.   In

the  survey conducted at the end of last year, we asked  Internet

users, who were not transacting on the Net, what were the reasons

for  not  going on e-commerce.  In fact, only 6.7% of them  cited

privacy as a concern, meaning that for the majority of the  users

who  are  not transacting on the Net, the main reason  is  either

they  do not find the things they need on the Net, or they prefer

not to shop on the Net for whatever reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, over time, we believe that for Internet

users,  two  concerns will become more important in  the  future.

Firstly, the protection of safety of children using the Net  and,

secondly,  privacy.   So the question is:  What  do  we  do  with

privacy?   I  understand the Member's point that in the  case  of

credit card companies, for example, right now there is nothing to

stop  them  under the law from doing that.  But the  question  is

whether enacting a legislation is the way to go.  At this moment,

countries adopt three approaches.  Some countries decide  not  to

do  anything.  Other countries enact new legislation.  The  third

type goes for industry self-regulation.  In view of the fast pace

of  change of the Internet world, we believe that at this moment,

industry self-regulation is still the best way to go.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



Because,  on  the one hand, we make sure that the  industry  will

respect  the  privacy of the users and yet at the same  time,  we

allow  the  industry enough room for them to  innovate.   I  hope

these address the concerns of the Member.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING VIOLATIONS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology (a) how many  cases  to

date have been processed since the de-criminalizing of Electronic

Road  Pricing (ERP) violations, and whether these cases  exceeded

the number of cases for a similar period when ERP violations were

treated  as  offences; and (b) whether the amount  collected  for

fees and administrative charges exceeded the amount collected for

a similar period when ERP violations were treated as offences.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rationale for introducing an

administrative  surcharge of $10 was because ERP  violations  are

usually  due to forgetfulness or carelessness, and not  a  wilful

disregard for the rules.  Therefore, on 1st June 1999,  the  Land

Transport Authority introduced a new procedure to deal  with  ERP

violations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative surcharge is levied to recover the

administrative costs of processing an ERP violation.  Instead  of

a  composition  fine of $30 (which was introduced in  May  1998),

motorists  who  commit  ERP offences  are  requested  to  pay  an

administrative surcharge of $10 plus the ERP charges  within  two

weeks  of  the  violations.  If they fail to do  so,  they  would

receive  a Notice of Traffic Offence to compound the offence  for

$70  payable  within 28 days.  Upon expiry of  this  Notice,  the

matter will be referred to the Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two months preceding the introduction of the

administrative surcharge (i.e. April and May 1999),  the  average

number of violations per month for no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



CashCards  and  CashCards  with insufficient  balance  was  about

16,000.  The same average after the introduction of the surcharge

showed an increase to about 17,300 per month.  The average amount

of  fines  collected during the corresponding periods  was  about

$533,000 per month before the introduction of the surcharge,  and

$288,000 per month after that.  This is a reduction of about  45%

in the amount of fines collected.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> May I ask the Parliamentary

Secretary  whether the introduction of the administrative  charge

has  meant  less work or more work for the Ministry in  terms  of

appeals, for example?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, if we look at the number

of violations, they have increased over the same period.  But the

Member  has raised a very good point.  What we have seen is  that

the  number  of appeals received has declined.  For example,  for

the  period prior to the introduction of the surcharge, which  is

April  and  May,  the number of appeals was 6,479,  and  for  the

period  after  the introduction of the surcharge, the  number  of

appeals went down to 3,324.  Hence, the surcharge has worked.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> May I ask the Parliamentary

Secretary  again, given the satisfactory nature of this exercise,

would  the  Ministry consider other types of offences  that  fall

within this type of category, for example, eating in MRT stations

be regulated in the same manner?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, the offences mentioned by

the  Member are totally different from ERP violations.  But  rest

assured  that the Ministry is constantly reviewing  some  of  the

procedures  to ensure that there is an efficient and optimal  use

of our land transport system.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Land  Transport  Authority  (LTA)  reviews  the  Electronic  Road

Pricing (ERP) rates every quarter to ensure that there is optimal

traffic  flow  and  efficient use of the road  network.   Traffic

speeds  on  various  stretches of busy  roads  are  monitored  at

regular  intervals throughout the day, and adjustments  are  then

made to the ERP rates to maintain travel speeds within the ranges

of  45  to  65 kph for expressways and 20 to 30 kph for  arterial

roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before making any changes to ERP rates, LTA takes into

consideration the impact of any changes on a network-wide  basis.

ERP rate changes, if any, are implemented in January, April, July

and October each year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERP was introduced in April 1998. After nearly two years of

operation,  it is indeed timely for LTA to review and refine  the

system  of  rates review.  LTA will be studying how to factor  in

traffic  volume  projections when determining  rate  changes  for

those  periods of the year which experience seasonal  changes  in

traffic volumes, such as the school holidays.  This will increase

the effectiveness of our ERP mechanism.

<div align="center"><b>(Balloting)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development

if he will give an appraisal of the recent public response to the

balloting  of  Housing  and Development  Board  flats  in  mature

estates and if there are more future plans for such an exercise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, HDB launched an exercise to sell unselected  flats

in  mature  estates and Executive flats in non-mature estates  on

15th  October  1999.   1,170 units of 4-room  flats,  5-room  and

Executive flats in the mature estates, as well as 1,500 units  of

Executive flats in the non-mature estates were offered for sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flats in the mature estates were previously set aside

for  special schemes, such as the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment

Scheme (SERS) and Relocation Programmes.  As these flats were  no

longer  needed  for  the various schemes, they  were  offered  to

eligible public applicants.  Executive flats in non-mature

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



estates which were not taken up by applicants on the waiting list

were also offered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Response to the offer has been very good. At the close of

application  on 4th November 1999, HDB received more than  13,000

applications,  about  five  times the number  of  flats  offered.

Applications for flats in the mature estates were about 10  times

higher  than  the number of flats offered.  As for the  Executive

flats in the non-mature estates, applications received were about

1.5 times the number of flats offered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducted a computer ballot and informed all the

applicants of their queue positions.  To help first-timers set up

their  homes early, they were accorded priority in the balloting.

About  70% of the applicants shortlisted were first-timers.   The

selection  exercise for the first batch of shortlisted applicants

commenced  on  7th  January this year and was  completed  on  3rd

February.  The take-up for the flats has been encouraging.  About

60%  of  the  2,670 flats offered were selected.   The  remaining

flats  will be offered to the other applicants according to their

balloted queue positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will consider conducting similar balloting exercises

from time to time.  In the last few years, it has embarked on the

SERS  programme  to redevelop the older public  housing  estates.

Through this programme, HDB has been able to make better  use  of

scarce land and build more flats in the mature estates.  When HDB

has  accumulated a sufficient number of surplus  flats  from  the

programme,  it  will  consider offering them to  eligible  public

applicants.   As  for Executive Flats in the non-mature  estates,

HDB will monitor the take-up rate during the subsequent selection

exercises and offer the remaining unselected Executive  flats  in

phases to the public over the next few years.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, first, in view of the

overwhelming  response  for younger people  to  move  into  older

estates,  would  the  Minister  consider  stepping  up  the  SERS

programme in the older estates?  Second, what other proposals has

his Ministry got to revitalise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



older estates, like mine and other Parliamentary colleagues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, this is exactly what the Ministry is

embarking upon, to try and revitalise and bring back some of  the

vibrancy in some of the older estates.  This has got benefits not

just  to  the new applicants who are interested to come to  these

estates, particularly those in the city areas, but also those who

are  currently  living  there, the shopkeepers  as  well  as  the

residents.  So we are now looking at the exercise on a systematic

basis  to  try  and identify more areas for the  SERS  programme.

However, we have to bear in mind that there is a certain limit to

the  number  that  we can do every year, not  least  because  the

capacity  of  the ability to absorb such new flats will  also  be

limited.  We have to look for replacement sites for a start.   We

have  got  to make sure that replacement sites are sufficient  to

take care of the residents who will be relocated and, thereafter,

we  can start the programme.  While we want to move as fast as we

can,  there  is  a certain limit to how fast we can  move.   But,

nevertheless, I would like to assure the Member that this is  one

of the priority areas that the Ministry is looking at.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> The old estates cannot wait to have their

vibrancy  increased.  I am thinking whether the very old  estates

in the city area can be revitalised quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I said, one of the most effective

ways  of revitalising the estate is the SERS programme.   But  of

course  that  is  not  the  only way to achieve  that  objective.

Currently,  there are already SERS flats in the area  which  have

been  earmarked for relocation of  lessees from other  locations.

As and when there are surplus flats available in these particular

locations,  we  will  look  into  opening  up  these  flats   for

allocation  to  new applications.  And generally, as  the  Member

himself  has  said,  these  flats  are  very  popular  with   new

applicants,  especially  the younger applicants.   So  with  this

particular  programme, we will be able to go  quite  a  long  way

towards the revitalisation programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I also would like to mention to the

Member  that  there  are also other schemes  that  are  currently

available  to  these people to encourage them to  move  into  the

mature  estates,  including  those  involving  the  Member.   For

example, the CPF grant scheme actually encourages and facilitates

the  movement of younger applicants into this particular  estate.

With the CPF grant, if you consider the fact that applicants  who

wish  to  move  nearer to their parents can apply and  receive  a

grant  of  $40,000, I think that is a considerable sum  of  money

which  will help facilitate the movement of these people  to  the

older estates.  So one of the ways that the Member can help is to

publicise such schemes to his constituents or the children of his

constituents  and  encourage them  to  come  back  to  the  older

estates.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Can I ask the Minister whether the $40,000 grant

that has been given could be reviewed to make it more attractive?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> At the moment, the sense is that the grant

is sufficiently attractive.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if

he  will give an update on the incidence of traffic accidents  in

1999 involving the use of handphones and portable music headsets,

and whether further measures, such as stiffer penalties or public

education, will be necessary.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, prior to 1999,

handphone drivers were dealt with under the inconsiderate driving

provisions  of  the  law.  A first offender was  usually  offered

composition  which  attracted a fine of  $170  and  nine  demerit

points.   A  subsequent offender was charged in  court  and  upon

first  conviction, the offender could be fined up  to  $1,000  or

jailed  up  to six months or both.  The penalty for a  second  or

subsequent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



conviction was a fine of up to $2,000, or a jail term  of  up  to

one  year,  or  both.    From  March 1999,  Traffic  Police  made

handphone   driving   a  specific  offence  and   increased   the

composition fine to $200 and the demerit points to 12 points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no record of any accident involving the use of

handphones in 1999.  The incidence of handphone driving has  also

decreased in 1999.  This can be attributed to stronger deterrence

arising  from  the legislative amendments, effective  enforcement

and  public  education.   The  number  of  summonses  issued   to

motorists  caught  handphone driving  decreased  by  33%  or  600

summonses from 1,800 in 1998 to 1,200 in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police will continue with its three-prong approach

of tough laws, effective enforcement and public education to keep

the  problem  of handphone driving under control.   There  is  no

need  for  further measures, such as stiffer penalties,  at  this

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, police rarely comes across motorists who drive whilst

using portable music headsets.  However, police will not hesitate

to take the necessary action should it become a problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, if I understand

correctly,  the  Minister of State has said  that  there  are  no

accidents  involving handphone use, but there  are  new  laws  in

place.   May  I  ask  the  Minister of State,  if  there  are  no

accidents, why do we have to have these new laws?  Does this seem

strange as compared to the safety factor of young children, which

we  have just discussed?  In that case, we are also assured  that

there  is no safety problem because there is no accident, but  we

do not want to legislate on that.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Of course, the tougher laws have

deterred  people from using handphones.  But no accident relating

to  handphone  driving  does not mean handphone  driving  is  not

dangerous.  When  you  use a handphone, it results  in  dangerous

behaviour on the road.  So a person using a handphone,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



for  example, can be charged for inconsiderate driving.  In fact,

unlike  other  countries, like Japan, where the  rates  are  very

high,  I think we nipped the problem in the bud.  From a high  of

3,200  summonses  in 1996, it has come down to 1,200  last  year.

Our  approach is a good approach - public education,  tough  laws

and effective enforcement.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Can I ask the Minister

whether  there  were  any accidents involving  pedestrians  using

portable music sets?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I do not have the record for that.

This  is  not  a question relating to a music set while  driving.

But  from  recollection, I do not think that has  been  a  direct

cause  of any accident, although we all say that when you  drive,

you  should  not use the music set because it can be distracting.

Likewise,  the  argument can be used that if you walk  along  the

road  using a music set, it can also cause some problems  because

you  will not be listening to cars and other traffic around  you.

So I think whoever does that must be very careful.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

current  approach to sexuality education recognises the  role  of

the  home and the wider community in reinforcing sound moral  and

social values and behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of sexuality education in schools is to provide

knowledge  about human sexuality and the consequences  of  sexual

activity  so  that students are able to make informed  decisions.

Students   are   taught  to  build  responsible   and   rewarding

relationships.   Sexuality  education  also  seeks  to  inculcate

values  and  attitudes of sexuality, in line  with  our  national

value of the family as a basic unit of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the delivery of sexuality education, MOE adopts a cross-curricular approach. Various aspects of the topic are covered

according to the maturity of the pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the primary schools, sexuality is taught in Health

Education and the objective is to prepare the pupils for  puberty

and  this continues at the secondary level in Science and  Civics

and Moral Education (CME).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some aspects of sexuality education are also covered in the

Pastoral   Care   programme   where  skills   on   inter-personal

relationships  are taught so that pupils develop  a  respect  for

themselves and others as sexual beings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the lower secondary levels, Sexual Reproduction in Human

Beings is taught in the Science syllabus. The personal and social

consequences of sexually transmitted diseases, abortion and  pre-martial sex are also discussed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible behaviour and moral values are further

reinforced  and  developed in CME.  In the main theme  of  family

relationships, concepts such as responsible dating, marriage as a

lifelong commitment, mutual responsibility in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



marriage, and responsible parenthood are discussed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong suggested that we should involve advisory groups and

non-governmental  organisations and  so  on.   This  is  in  fact

happening  already.   The  schools  tap  resource  speakers  from

external  agencies such as the Ministry of Health's Institute  of

Health, the Singapore Planned Parenthood Association, Family Life

Society   and  Family  Service  Centres  and  Voluntary   Welfare

Organisations  to conduct relevant talks, courses, workshops  and

seminars relating to sex education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our on-going policy reviews, MOE is presently

reviewing   the  effectiveness  of  the  teaching  of   sexuality

education in schools, with a view to adopting a more holistic and

structured approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must say that beyond what the school can do, parents

and  the homes must play an important role as sexuality education

cannot  be divorced from the values and societal norms which  the

<div align="center"><b>(Update on progress)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if  he will provide an update on the progress  of  the

committee  which was formed to study whether compulsory education

should  be  introduced and whether the madrasahs  which  will  be

affected  by  compulsory  education  will  be  involved  in  this

process.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Committee on Compulsory Education  chaired  by

the  Senior Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline  Wong,  has

been  formed,  and met for the first time in early  January  this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conducting the study, the Committee will seek the views

of the different communities and this includes representatives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



from  the  madrasahs  who  are one of many  groups  who  have  an

interest in the subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee expects to complete its work in 6 to 8 months'

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, this is

a  very  sensitive  and  emotive issue  amongst  members  of  the

Malay/Muslim  community and certainly not just  for  the  persons

involved  directly with madrasahs alone. How would other  members

of  the community and those outside the Malay/Muslim community be

involved  in this process because education is for every  one  of

us.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I completely agree

with  Mr  Zulkifli that this subject is one which  involves  more

than just people who run the madrasahs but involves the community

at  large, and Dr Wong has invited many of these people to attend

the  sessions  to provide their feedback and her Committee  would

welcome  feedback as well, and they would be prepared to  receive

it directly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, there has been very diverse

and   even   conflicting   response   from   different   madrasah

administrators, for example, a section of the community.  How can

these  be grouped together to get some consensus, at least  among

the  community, before the Committee can consider what  steps  to

take?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> The Committee would take into the

account the feedback of all the various parties before coming  to

a  decision on how to proceed with compulsory education.  But  it

is  up to the members whether they want to get together to arrive

at a consensus or not.  It may not be possible for them to arrive

at a complete consensus.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister, at

the  moment,  whether  there are any plans   -   I  suppose  that

madrasahs  will remain -  to integrate madrasahs as part  of  the

national education system?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> The Prime Minister has said on a number

of occasions, and so have I, that madrasahs are an important part

of  Singapore  as  a  whole.   It is  important  that  there  are

madrasahs  to provide the opportunity for members of  the  Muslim

community to train their religious leaders for the future.  But I

think  it is premature for me to make a comment on whether it  is

appropriate   for  what  is  basically  a  religious  educational

institution  to  be  incorporated  into  the  national  education

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  his  Ministry  will consider increasing  the  number  of

periods for Physical Education in primary and secondary schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Mohamad Maidin B P M) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir,

there  are  currently many demands on our formal curriculum  time

and  there is a need to prioritise and strike a balance.  At  the

moment, on a weekly basis, curriculum time allocated to PE at the

different levels is as follows:

<pre>

     Primary  1  -  4     :    3 periods (30 minutes per  period) per week

     Primary  5  -  6     :    2 periods (30 minutes per  period) per week

     Secondary  1  -  5   :    2 periods (35 minutes per  period) per week

     Pre-University 1 - 3 :    3 periods (40 minutes  per  period) per week

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present allocation, in the view of MOE, is sufficient

for  schools to achieve the curricular objectives of PE, and that

is  to  develop the physical, intellectual, social and  emotional

aspects  of  the  pupils  through  physical  activity.   However,

schools  are  given  the  autonomy to  make  adjustments  to  the

curriculum time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



according  to  the  needs  of  their  pupils  and  the  resources

available.   Indeed, some secondary schools  have  done  so.  For

example,  Commonwealth Secondary now has 4  PE  periods  for  all

their Normal (Technical) classes from Secondary 1 to 4 and  3  PE

periods for the lower secondary Express/Normal (Academic).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other examples are :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whitley Secondary which now has 3 PE periods for the

upper  secondary  Normal (Technical) classes and lower  secondary

Express and Normal (Academic) classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Pierce Secondary has 3 PE periods for the lower

secondary Express and Normal (Academic) classes and 4 PE  periods

for the Secondary 1 Normal (Technical) classes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for National

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, the Biosafety Protocol, or Cartegena Protocol

on  biosafety,  addresses  the  environmental  concern  over  the

potential  negative  impact  of  genetically  modified  organisms

(GMOs)  on biological diversity; and the Protocol prescribes  the

procedures  for  the  safe transfer, handling  and  use  of  such

organisms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protocol was only concluded on 28th January last month

in  Montreal  after  many  years of  negotiations.   We  will  be

studying  the  Protocol  in detail in  relation  to  its  aim  of

invited,  including the experts from the National  University  of

Singapore.  The  Protocol deals with very technical  issues  like

LMOs,  GMOs, things like that, which are over most of our  heads,

and if the public needs to be involved, we will certainly involve

the public. But these are very, very technical issues.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL SKILLS RECOGNITION SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if he

will  state what progress the National Skills Recognition  System

has made.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, the

National Skills Recognition System (NSRS) is a key recommendation

of  the  Manpower  21  report.  The system  provides  a  national

framework  for  the definition, acquisition and certification  of

job  skills competencies for our workforce.  It will be industry-driven,  accessible to workers through an open entry and  modular

approach,  and provide for training and acquisition of skills  at

different  levels  to  establish  skills  progression   for   the

workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing clear skills standards will potentially benefit

many  workers who are holding skilled or semi-skilled jobs,  such

as  clerical,  sales and service personnel, production  operators

and  even  cleaners.  Currently, most of these jobs do  not  have

clear  competency  standards.   Implementing  a  national  skills

recognition system for the workforce is an enormous task.   Apart

from  the  large numbers involved, we need to cater to  different

industries  and  within  industries, different  occupations.   To

succeed, a concerted effort involving all key Government agencies

and industry bodies is needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the system is being piloted in 3 industries - hotel, marine and cleaning. The pilot phase aims to test the

robustness  of  the system and fine-tune it for the comprehensive

launch to all industries.  To date, 19 skills standards have been

developed for the pilot industries.  For the hotel industry,  for

example,  the  standards include servicing guestrooms,  providing

western-style   food  and  beverage  services,   handling   guest

arrivals, processing room reservations and so on.  The assessment

centres and training programmes for the pilot industries  are  in

the  process  of  being established.   Our aim is  to  train  and

certify 3,000 workers in these three pilot industries.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



hope  to  extend the National Skills Recognition System to  other

industries by the second quarter of this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, what are the other

industries which the Ministry has in mind  that their skills  can

be certified in the next 1-2 years?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, our intention, eventually, is to

cover all the industries, but we want to do it in stages.   As  I

have  said  in  my  main answer, the National Skills  Recognition

System  will only work if it is a collaborative and joint effort.

It  cannot  work  just  purely as a Government  initiative.   The

industries themselves have to come together and agree  that  they

want  to  have  formal standards for skill competencies  for  all

their  workers in the various occupations.  We are in  discussion

with the various industry groups and, as and when they are ready,

they  will  be  brought on board to implement a  national  skills

recognition system for their particular industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil

that   Act  be  varied  by  deleting  the  figures  "$1,568,000",

the  figures "$1,757,700", "$104,300", "$2,177,200", "$1,000,130"

and "$56,400" respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that a provision of $1,865,600 be supported

for  Class I expenditure.  This is  $193,200 more than  the  FY99

provision.   The higher provision is to cater for the restoration

of  the  wage cut on the Privy Purse and a higher cost of hosting

official functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Class II expenditure (Salaries of Personal

Staff)  is  expected to increase from $2,137,900  to  $2,177,200,

mainly to meet the restoration of the cut in the salaries of  the

supporting staff from January 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision of $1,000,130 is required for Class III

expenditure (Expenses of Household).  This represents an increase

of  $47,630 over the FY99 provision.  The increased provision  is

mainly  to meet the higher maintenance cost of the Istana grounds

and utilities charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Class IV expenditure (Special Services), a budget of

$56,400  is  provided  for  the renewal  of  the  Certificate  of

Entitlement  of the First Lady's official car.  The provision  is

$184,800 lower than the FY99 provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to vary the provisions in the

Schedule  to  the  Civil List and Pension Act  (Chapter  44),  as

indicated in the Motion before the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>I  REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN 1999</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 began on a sombre note, our economy having just

contracted  by  1.6% in the second half of 1998.  With  a  highly

uncertain  outlook,  we braced ourselves  for  a  difficult  year

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out, 1999 was a year of remarkable economic

turnaround.  After a modest 0.8% growth in the first quarter, the

economy  rebounded strongly for 3 consecutive quarters, recording

a  high of 7.1% growth in the last quarter.  For the whole  year,

we  enjoyed a respectable 5.4% growth.  The Asian economic crisis

is largely behind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's V-shaped recovery benefited first from the

strong  upturn  in  global electronics.   In  particular,  global

semiconductor  sales rebounded by a robust  17%  in  1999,  after

having  contracted  8.4%  a year ago.   This  surge  in  external

electronics demand provided a fillip to our manufacturing sector,

and contributed to its stellar 14% growth last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second boost to our recovery came from the concurrent

turnaround in the regional economies.  Buoyed too by the  rebound

in  global electronics demand and stabilised regional currencies,

most  Asian  economies returned to positive growth by the  second

quarter  of  1999.   This boosted intra-Asian trade  and  further

fuelled Singapore's growth, as intra-regional trade accounted for

about  half  of our total trade.  Region-dependent services  like

tourism also benefited from the 14% surge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



in visitor arrivals last year from our key Asian markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One critical factor which enabled Singapore to seize the

opportunities  presented by the rising external  demand  was  our

improvement  in  cost  competitiveness.  In  particular,  the  10

percentage point cut in employers' CPF contribution rate and  the

wage  restraint  last year made a significant  difference.   They

helped  to lower the unit labour cost of the economy by  10%  and

the  unit  business cost of our manufacturing sector by 12%  last

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the strong external demand, domestic demand

gradually recovered, helped by 2 main factors.  First, job losses

moderated. Last year, the total number of retrenched workers fell

to 14,600, about half that in 1998.  In fact, many companies have

begun  to  rehire  by  third quarter 1999  as  employment  levels

increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, asset prices recovered strongly. The stock market,

in  particular, saw strong rallies.  The Straits Times Index  set

11  record  highs  last year and ended 1999 78% higher  than  the

start  of the year.  The property market also firmed, with prices

climbing by 28%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, increased job security and the wealth effect

in  the  asset  markets renewed consumer confidence  and  boosted

private  consumption  spending by  6.2%  last  year.   Against  a

healthier backdrop of aggregate demand, the Consumer Price  Index

rose marginally by 0.4%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the economy has largely turned around, not every

sector  has  recovered.   The  construction  sector  remained  in

recession;  it contracted a severe 12% last year, compared  to  a

growth of 4.4% in 1998.  Due to the oversupply in residential and

office  properties, contracts awarded had continued  to  decline.

Dragged down by weak commercial lending and poor regional  demand

for  funds, growth in the financial services sector was flat last

year.  Growth in the business services sector was also feeble, at

only 0.1% due to poor real estate earnings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b>OUTLOOK FOR 2000</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But overall, the prospects for this year are bright. We can

expect  the  pockets of weaknesses in the economy to  improve  as

growth  momentum  picks  up.  We can  be  confident  because  the

external environment looks favourable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the strength of the global electronics demand remains

firm.  According to industry forecasts, world-wide semiconductors

and  PC  sales  are expected to grow by 20% and 15%  respectively

over the next 2 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the recovery of the Asian economies is likely to be

sustainable.  Regional monetary and fiscal policies are  expected

to  remain accommodative, which will fuel growth ahead.  So  far,

recovery has been concentrated mainly on exports and consumption,

which will continue to strengthen on the back of healthy external

demand  and better job prospects. In addition, investment  demand

has  also  shown  glimpses of improvement after  having  remained

negative   for  most  regional  economies  last  year.   Already,

capacity   utilisation,  capital  imports  and   foreign   direct

investment applications have picked up across Asia, although  the

pace differs across economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a benign external environment, our Composite Leading

Index  (CLI), which leads economic growth by about 9 months,  has

been  rising  over  the last 6 quarters.  Trade prospects  remain

very  positive  as non-oil retained imports, a leading  indicator

for  future exports, continues its double-digit growth.  Consumer

sentiments  have also turned visibly upbeat. Retail sales  growth

is  up,  as consumers increase their spending in anticipation  of

better pay increases and a partial restoration in employers'  CPF

contribution rate this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this favourable outlook for 2000 is conditional on

a  soft landing in the United States and a sustained recovery  in

Japan  and Europe.  In particular, the risk of a sharp correction

in Wall Street triggering a reverse wealth effect and causing a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



marked   slowdown  of  the  US  economy,  cannot  be  discounted.

Macroeconomic imbalances in the US economy, such as the  widening

current  account deficit, the falling personal savings rate,  and

the  rising  corporate leverage, are not sustainable  at  current

rates and will need to be corrected at some point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, while recovery is slowly taking shape, its economy

is   not  yet  out  of  the  woods.   Recovery  continues  to  be

underpinned  by  fiscal  stimulus  as  consumption  and   private

investments  are  likely to remain fragile  due  to  the  ongoing

corporate restructuring process.  The pace of recovery is further

complicated by the prospect of a rising Yen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the region, the main concern is whether the crisis-hit countries can sustain investor confidence by making progress

in  financial  and  corporate restructuring.   In  addition,  the

political  stability  of  Indonesia remains  a  key  uncertainty.

Flash  points  have again erupted in various parts of  Indonesia:

communal  clashes in Maluku, Lombok, Ambon, and even Bintan,  and

secessionist movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there are more reasons to be optimistic, than

to  be  pessimistic  about our growth prospects  for  2000.   The

Ministry  of Trade and Industry (MTI) is maintaining its forecast

of  4.5  to  6.5%  for this year.  The lower  end  of  the  range

reflects  the  potential risks in the external environment.   But

the upside for the economy appears bright.



<br><br><i>Competing In The New Millennium</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Asian economic crisis was brief, it has left a

trail  of destruction in its wake, and brought great hardship  to

many  regional  economies.  The cost  has  been  exacting.   Some

governments  were  toppled.   Great  fortunes  were  lost.   Many

companies  went  under; millions of livelihoods  were  destroyed.

Several regional countries have had to take on large public debts

to restart their economies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Singapore has weathered the regional crisis

well  and  emerged largely unscathed.  There were  no  widespread

unemployment  and  bankruptcy, social dislocations  or  political

upheavals.  Strong economic fundamentals underpinned by years  of

consistent and rational policies have ensured this.  For example,

due  to  the  prudent  supervision of  our  banks  and  financial

institutions,  our financial system was never in  distress.   Our

banking  sector's non-performing loans constituted less than  10%

of  total loans at its peak, compared to 80% in Indonesia, 48% in

Thailand  and  15%  in Malaysia.  Because  we  did  not  have  to

recapitalise  our  banks, our fiscal health has remained  intact.

We  have  avoided  the sharp rise in public  debts  seen  in  the

regional economies  -  to as much as 100% of GDP in the  case  of

Indonesia   -   and  the ensuing heavy debt servicing  burden  in

future years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have successfully ridden out the Asia economic storm with

the  economy  remaining in shipshape.  Our  strong  recovery  has

enabled us to start the new millennium on a firm footing, and  we

have  every  reason to look ahead with optimism  and  confidence.

However, this does not mean we can afford to slacken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitiveness will remain the prime economic challenge for

Singapore  in  the  new  millennium.  In fact,  competition  will

become  increasingly  intense  as  more  countries  join  in  the

economic race.  More importantly, globalisation and the onslaught

of  technological advancement will quicken the competition  tempo

further. It used to take several months for a new product in  one

market to reach another part of the globe.  Today, virtually  any

good  and  service can be bought and sold anywhere in  the  world

with the click of a mouse.  The Internet has dramatically reduced

the geographical barriers to economic competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twin forces of IT and globalisation have prompted a wave

of  alliances,  mergers  and acquisitions  around  the  world  as

companies consolidate to gain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



market   share  and  critical  mass  in  preparation  of  tougher

competition  ahead.  Last year, the value of  mergers  in  Europe

surged  50% to US$1.2 trillion, while that in the US has remained

high at US$1.6 trillion for the last 2 years.  These mergers  cut

across  a spectrum of industries, from traditional ones like  oil

and  automobile, to New Economy ones like info-communications and

banking.   In  recent months, we have witnessed  mega-mergers  of

giant  corporations  such  as  Mobil  and  Exxon,  Vodafone   and

Mannesman,  and  AOL and Time Warner.  The new  AOL  Time  Warner

conglomerate, for instance, has a market capitalisation of  about

US$360 billion, almost 4 times Singapore's GDP.  Not only are the

deals  getting  bigger, the tie-ups are also increasingly  cross-border,  as globalisation of the market place gathers pace.   For

instance,  spurred  partly by the Euro, 60% of  Europe's  mergers

last  year crossed national boundaries.  [Estimate by JP  Morgan.

Business Week 24 Jan 2000].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale and quality of competition have thus risen to a

whole new dimension.  In this new competitive landscape, it is no

longer viable for economies and businesses to think and act  only

on a national basis.  We need to adopt a global mindset, innovate

and advance with global trends, or risk being rendered redundant.

Unless  we  are among the world's best, we will be  relegated  to

playing a peripheral role in the global economy.  To thrive,  our

businesses  need to adopt a global outlook, and boldly  seek  out

new  markets and alliances for expansion.  Already we are  seeing

signs  of this happening. SIA has recently acquired 49% of Virgin

Airways,  DBS  is  expanding its regional  presence  through  its

stakes  in  Thai  Danu Bank and Hong Kong's Kwong  On  Bank,  and

SingTel  is  engaging in merger talks with Cable & Wireless  Hong

Kong  Telecom.  To  be  successful  in  global  competition,  our

companies  will also need to draw in top talent - not  only  from

Singapore, but from the world.  Only then can we over time  build

up a stable of our own world class transnational companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In post-crisis Asia, one economy that will bring profound

changes to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



competitive  equation  is  China.  Even without  WTO  membership,

China  has been attracting more foreign direct investments  (FDI)

than the rest of Asia combined.  With its impending WTO accession

and the ongoing reforms of its state-owned enterprises, China can

be  expected to become even more competitive both as an  exporter

as  well as FDI destinations.  [Goldman Sachs estimated that  FDI

into China would rise to US$100 billion a year over the next five

years  as  a  result of its WTO entry.  Wu, Fred WTO  Membership:

What This Means for  China, Goldman Sachs, Apr 99.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, China's exports are no longer confined to low

value-added  or  labour-intensive products.   Increasingly,  they

will  move  towards  more  sophisticated and  higher  value-added

products in direct competition with the NIEs.  China has  already

made  impressive inroads in the electronics industry.   In  1996,

China's share of the US and Japan electronics market was only  6%

and  7%  respectively.  These shares have now increased to around

10%,  comparable  to that of Taiwan and South Korea,  and  higher

than most of the ASEAN countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But China's rise is not all negative for the other Asian

economies.  Global trade is never a zero-sum game.  China's  rise

offers  tremendous opportunities for all.  For example, with  the

liberalisation  of  China's tariff regime,  ASEAN  economies  can

function more effectively as production bases and export gateways

to   China's  markets.   The  key  challenge  for  the   regional

countries,  including Singapore, is to devise ways to  complement

investments and growth in China, to ride on the rise of China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, China will not be the only source of

competitive  threat  to  Asian economies.   Outside  Asia,  Latin

America  and Eastern Europe have similarly geared up for the  new

competitive challenges.  Argentina, for example, has seen a four-fold  increase  in  its GDP in the last decade  as  a  result  of

economic  reforms.  The transitional economies in Eastern  Europe

are  estimated  to  triple in size in the next  decade,  if  they

continue with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



privatisation,  enterprise restructuring and other  institutional

reforms.  [Estimates by the European Bank for Reconstruction  and

Development.   'Eastern Europe - Transitional  Economies'  Output

May Triple, July 1999, Reuters.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the developed economies are not resting on

their  laurels.   They  too are strengthening  their  competitive

lead.  Japan is embarking on fundamental reforms to its  economic

structure and banking sector.  The US is in the throes of its New

Economy powered by innovations and technological start-ups.   The

EU countries are reforming their tax systems and trying to inject

more dynamism and flexibility into their economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be a grave mistake to think that it is

business as usual in the post-Asian-crisis world economy.   Rapid

technological   change   and   globalisation   are   intensifying

competition and posing new challenges for our economy.  To thrive

in  the  new millennium, we need to sharpen our competitive  edge

further, stay nimble, and constantly reinvent ourselves.



<br><br><i>Implementing Long-term Economic Strategies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet these competitive challenges, the Committee on

Singapore's  Competitiveness (CSC) has mapped out a comprehensive

set of long term economic strategies.  These strategies have been

adopted  by  the  Government  as  the  blueprint  for  developing

Singapore  into  an advanced and globally competitive  knowledge-based  economy  within this decade.  The Government  is  actively

pursuing  these strategies, which address both the  hardware  and

software aspects of our competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hardware, Singapore already has a competitive edge. We

have   invested  heavily  in  many  key  economic  and   business

infrastructure and international surveys have consistently ranked

us  highly on infrastructure, citing our world-class sea and  air

ports, modern telecommunications facilities, and advanced IT

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



infrastructure.   Private  sector  investments  have  also   been

strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some observers and analysts have commented that Singapore

has  over-invested and become inefficient in our use of  capital.

MTI has studied this in detail and has found that this is untrue.

Except  for the period in mid-80s, our investment rates  are  not

disproportionately high compared to the regional  countries.   In

addition, trends in our Incremental Capital Output Ratio  (ICOR),

a  measure of the additional unit of capital required to  produce

each  additional unit of output, also show that we have not  been

using  capital inefficiently.  MTI will be releasing  details  of

its findings in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical infrastructure, however, can be easily replicated.

In  fact, latecomers can often leapfrog ahead using state-of-the-art  technology.  The challenge is for Singapore to differentiate

ourselves  by  finding  creative  ways  to  add  value   to   our

infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Island project is one such example. Amalgamated

from  7  offshore islands, Jurong Island aims to become a  world-class  integrated  chemical hub, the first of  its  kind  in  the

region.  Through clustering and the sharing of common facilities,

it  will generate significant synergistic linkages across a  wide

spectrum of petrochemical industries.  For example, the provision

of  centralised logistics and common corridors for material flows

will  significantly reduce feedstock transportation and  handling

cost.   With  the recent launch of the JurongIsland.com  internet

portal, companies on the island can now be easily linked up  with

one  another on the island, and with Government agencies  on  the

mainland.  When the masterplan to dot-com Jurong Island is  fully

completed,  companies on Jurong Island will be  able  to  conduct

business electronically and reduce product cycle time and  costs.

Jurong Island will truly be an intelligent island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the software aspect of our competitiveness, the quality

of our people will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



key.  The New Economy is about exploiting knowledge as the source

of  competitive advantage.  As a small country, every Singaporean

matters.   The  key is for everyone to consciously improve  their

skills and look for new ways to do the job better.  The more well

trained and educated our workforce, the better our chances are in

achieving this goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, about 65% of our yearly cohort of students enter

universities and polytechnics - a First World standard.  However,

if we look at the total stock of our workforce, less than half of

Singaporeans  above  the  age of 40  have  secondary  and  higher

education.  We need to level up this group of workers,  numbering

some  834,000  or  42  % of our workforce, through  training  and

retraining  to  help  them cope with  the  new  economy.   A  key

priority  of the Government will therefore be manpower  training.

The  Ministry  of  Manpower will press  ahead  with  its  various

initiatives under the Manpower 21 programme to upgrade the  skill

level of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, training our indigenous workforce alone will not be

enough.   Even  with  a  highly  educated  workforce,  our  small

population  size  would limit the talent pool in  Singapore.   We

will  need  to  augment  both the quantity  and  quality  of  our

workforce  by  actively  attracting  foreign  talent.    In   the

knowledge  age, top talents make a big difference and  contribute

disproportionately to the economy.  With a larger pool of talent,

we  can  enlarge  our economic pie, create more  jobs  and  bring

higher wages for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important software aspect of competitiveness is the

ability  of  the  economy to leverage on science, technology  and

innovation  to keep pace with the global economy.  The Government

will   continue   to  build  up  our  research  and   development

capabilities.   At  the  same time, we will  create  a  conducive

environment  to  grow and develop a strong pool of  entrepreneurs

who   can  combine  technology  and  business  acumen  under  the

Technopreneurship 21 programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Manufacturing and Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key development strategy is to make manufacturing and

services  the  twin pillars of our economy.  We  already  have  a

strong manufacturing sector, which has been the key locomotive of

growth.  EDB's Industry 21 Blueprint aims to further enhance  our

manufacturing  capabilities, and diversify among and  within  our

existing key manufacturing clusters of electronics, chemicals and

engineering.    This  will  maximise  growth   opportunities   by

leveraging  on all possible linkages and complementarities  among

the clusters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the EDB is continuously looking into the

development  of  new,  high  growth  emerging  industries.   Life

sciences  is one such example.  Analysts have predicted that  the

21st  century will belong to biotechnology.  With our established

cluster  of  leading companies in pharmaceuticals,  biotechnology

and  agri-biotechnology, coupled with our world-class  healthcare

facilities  and  institutions, Singapore is  well  positioned  to

become a major player in the life sciences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our manufacturing sector is globally competitive, the

same  cannot be said of our services sector.  One reason is  that

we  have  been slow in opening up our services sector to  foreign

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The productivity of our services sector has been

significantly  weaker than manufacturing.  The gap  has  actually

widened  over  the years. Between 1985-1992, the  average  annual

productivity  growth in the services sector  was  0.4  percentage

point  below manufacturing.  In 1992-1999, this gap has increased

to 4.7 percentage points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new economy, services will play an increasingly

important  role.  Goods will increasingly have a  higher  service

content,  as  more  goods are bundled with services  to  form  an

integrated product package.  In any case, the line between  goods

and  services is blurring.  The logistics industry, for instance,

has evolved from just providing transportation and warehousing to

delivering value-added services in supply chain management.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, technology will render more services

tradable.  The Internet is accelerating this trend.  Even  highly

personalised services like education and healthcare  can  now  be

offered  over the Internet to people located thousands  of  miles

away.  Natural monopolies in certain service industries will also

become  increasingly  threatened.   For  example,  mobile   phone

service  providers  can  now  effectively  challenge  fixed  line

operators  in  the telecommunications field.  The implication  is

that  the  services sector in every country will increasingly  be

subjected  to  global  rather  than domestic,  or  even  regional

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIA, PSA and Changi Airport are fine examples of our service

companies which are globally competitive.  They competed globally

from  day  one  and  showed that we can  be  world-class.   Their

success  gives  us  confidence that the way  forward  is  not  to

confine our services sectors to mere domestic market or to shield

them  from  foreign competition.  The way forward is  to  subject

them to global competition, as we have done for manufacturing for

years.



<br><br><i>Deregulation of the Services Sector</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has led the way in opening up the financial services

sector.   Financial markets are now more globalised due to  lower

transaction    barriers   across   economies    and    world-wide

deregulation.   Rapid advancements in financial and informational

technology are creating new and sophisticated financial products.

The demarcations between financial products are blurring, and the

Internet  has  opened up new service delivery possibilities.   To

retain  our  role  as a key financial centre in  Asia,  Singapore

needs  to  attract and develop new growth activities and  players

into  the  market.   MAS  has therefore  embarked  on  regulatory

reforms  in banking, fund management, debt and equity markets  so

as to promote a more flexible and conducive environment for these

financial activities to thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, the IDA brought forward the introduction of

full market competition in the telecommunications sector by 2

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



years,  starting from 1 April 2000.  Direct and indirect  foreign

equity limits for all public telecommunications services licences

were  also lifted.  The decision to accelerate the liberalisation

schedule was not an easy one, in view of our earlier commitments.

But  it  was a necessary and right decision.  With the rapid  and

dramatic  changes in the telecommunications industry  world-wide,

the  original  liberalisation schedule  would  have  stunted  the

growth  of  our telecommunications sector and severely undermined

our  competitiveness.  It would have also  set  us  back  in  our

endeavour  to  develop  a strong and vibrant  info-communications

industry, which depends on globally competitive telecommunication

rates  and services.  By opening up the telecommunications sector

sooner,  we stand a better chance of attracting the major players

and realising our aim to be an info-communications hub.



<br><br><i>Deregulation of the Power Industry</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is another critical sector where we need to be

globally  competitive. It is a key component of  business  costs.

We  started to deregulate the sector in 1995 when we corporatised

the  electricity and gas operations of the Public Utilities Board

(PUB)  to  form  Singapore Power Ltd. Since then, we  have  taken

systematic steps to prepare for further deregulation.  Within the

next  2  years, we plan to open up the contestable parts  of  the

electricity  sector fully and also introduce competition  in  the

natural gas industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our deregulation efforts, we hope to ensure long-term efficiency in our power industry and achieve more

competitive   electricity  tariffs   for   our   businesses   and

households.  Liberalisation also brings many other  benefits  for

all  consumers, including better service quality, greater product

innovation and more choice of suppliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can achieve a systematic deregulation process in our

services sector, it can bring substantial spin-offs for the  rest

of the economy. It will further enhance the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



global  competitiveness of our manufacturing  sector.   Harnessed

properly,  the forces of deregulation can strengthen  Singapore's

competitiveness in the new economy.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore enters the new millennium on a cheerful note. The

global  economic  environment  is favourable.   Our  capacity  to

compete  globally  is  strong.  We should  return  to  pre-crisis

growth soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, sustained growth in the long term cannot be taken

for granted and will not come effortlessly.  The economic contest

has  become  more  intense with globalisation  and  as  countries

worldwide  enhance their competitiveness.  The Singapore  economy

will  need to be responsive to these global developments and stay

relevant and competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from improving our physical infrastructure, and

continuing  to  upgrade our people, there is a  need  to  further

deregulate  our  services  sector.   Many  of  our  services  are

performing  below  their potential. The problem  is  insufficient

industry competition.  Singapore as an economy cannot hope to  be

globally  competitive, if our services sector  is  a  laggard  at

home.   The  Government will step up its deregulation efforts  to

bring our services sector and the economy to new heights.



<div align="center"><b>II  THE FY2000 BUDGET</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to the Budget for Fiscal

Year 2000.



<div align="center"><b>FY99 BUDGET OUTTURN</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I highlight the salient features of this year's

expenditure  budget,  I would first like to  recap  on  the  FY99

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FY99 Budget was worked out based on the circumstances as

at end 1998 and beginning 1999.  Then, we were in the midst of  a

recession  and were expecting negative growth for the year  as  a

whole.  With operating revenue estimated at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



$24.1  billion  and a planned expenditure of $29.2  billion,  the

outcome  would  be  a budget deficit of $5.1 billion.   Operating

revenue had been estimated on the basis of falling revenue  while

expenditure was planned on greatly increased Government spending,

particularly  in  development spending,  to  help  stimulate  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, events turned out quite differently as the

economy  rebounded strongly after the first quarter of  1999  and

growth  in 1999 turned out to be a respectable 5.4%.  The  strong

rebound  is  expected to raise operating revenue  by  about  $4.8

billion.   The  increase has come mainly from  stronger  COE  and

income tax collections.  On the other hand, total expenditure  is

expected  to be some $3.4 billion less, mainly because  of  lower

development  spending.  This was because strong  competition  for

projects  forced bid prices down, and because some lower priority

projects were rescheduled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined impact of higher revenue collection and lower

expenditure is that instead of a large budget deficit of some  $5

billion, a surplus of $3.2 billion is expected in FY99.   With  a

budget surplus now expected, the Government will within FY99 make

a  $100  million contribution to Medifund, to bring  Government's

total contribution in the Fund to $700 million.  In addition, the

Government  will  also make a $200 million  contribution  to  the

ElderCare Fund approved by Parliament on 22nd February 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While transfers to Medifund and the ElderCare Fund are ways

to  share the surplus, they benefit Singaporeans indirectly.  The

Government appreciates that workers had accepted the CPF and wage

cuts as part of the package to deal with the recession.  However,

the  CPF cut can only be restored gradually so as not to increase

business costs abruptly, thereby stalling economic recovery.   As

an additional gesture, the Government will make a special CPF top-up  of  $250  to  the Ordinary Account of every  Singaporean  CPF

member aged 21 years and above on 31 December 1999, who had  made

at least one CPF contribution within the period 1 January 1998 to

<br><br>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 1999.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



More than 1.5 million Singaporeans are expected to benefit.   The

top-up  will be credited in March 2000.  Details will be released

separately  by  the CPF Board.  This top-up will amount  to  $385

million.



<div align="center"><b>PROJECTED FY2000 FISCAL POSITION</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating revenue for FY2000 is estimated at $31.4 billion,

an  increase  of  8.6% over FY99.  As a percentage  of  GDP,  the

increase is from 18.8% in FY99 to 19.0% in FY2000.  The  rise  in

revenue  collection  is mainly due to the  good  economic  growth

forecast  for  2000.  With total FY2000 expenditure  budgeted  at

$29.0  billion, a budget surplus of $2.5 billion or 1.5% of  GDP,

is  projected.  However, the surplus will not be achieved at  the

expense  of  cutting back on essential spending.  In fact,  total

expenditure in FY2000 is expected to rise by more than 12%,  with

a substantial increase of 21% in development spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are thus back in the happy position of being able to add

to  our reserves, whilst continuing to invest in and upgrade  our

economic  infrastructure  and human resource  capabilities.   The

economic crisis has however amply demonstrated the importance  of

living  within  our  means  and the  need  to  accumulate  budget

surpluses in good years so as to have the resources to deal  with

economic downturns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the salient features of the FY2000

expenditure budget.



<div align="center"><b>FY2000 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Government expenditure for FY2000 is estimated at

$29.0  billion or 17.5% of GDP, a rise of 12.5% over  expenditure

in  FY99.  Development expenditure is projected to grow 21.1%  to

reach  $12.9 billion.  Operating expenditure, on the other  hand,

is  estimated  to increase by 6.4% to $16.1 billion,  a  rate  of

increase  that  is lower than the nominal GDP growth  rate.   The

lower  rate of increase of operating expenditure, as compared  to

that   for   development  expenditure,  underlines   Government's

commitment  to  keep recurrent cost increases within  sustainable

limits.  Operating and development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



expenditure account for 9.7% and 7.8% of GDP respectively.



<br><br><i>Operating Expenditure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure in FY2000 is estimated at $16.1

billion or 9.7% of GDP, an increase of $969 million or 6.4%  over

FY99.    92% of operating expenditure is for ministries'  running

costs  while the remaining 8% is for transfer payments to members

of the public and outside organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total running costs are projected to increase by 6.9% to

$14.8  billion  because of higher manpower  costs,  increases  in

other  operating expenditure, and larger grants to the  statutory

boards.   Expenditure on Transfers is estimated at $1.3  billion,

the  main  items being subventions to the restructured  hospitals

and town councils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower expenses are estimated at $3.3 billion, an increase

of  $323 million or 10.8%.  The increase is due to restoration of

the  salary cut imposed service-wide in 1999, partial restoration

in  employers'  rate  of  CPF  contributions  and  normal  salary

increments.   In addition, there is also a net increase  of  some

2,400  posts,  mainly  in  MOE  to cater  for  increased  student

intakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other operating expenditure is expected to increase by 4.1%

to $8.8 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants-in-aid to statutory boards will increase by 12.1% to

$2.7   billion,  mainly  because  of  larger  grants  to   higher

educational institutions and aided schools to cater to  increased

student intakes and restoration of salary cuts.



<br><br><i>Development Expenditure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development expenditure is projected at $12.9 billion or

7.8%  of  GDP,  an  increase of $2.2 billion.   This  includes  a

provision  of  $979  million for new priority projects  that  may

materialise  in the course of FY2000.  Of this, $200  million  is

held centrally by MOF while the remaining $779 million is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



allocated out to ministries based on their projected needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest share of capital grants to statutory boards

(excluding public housing subsidy) goes to the LTA for  extension

of the MRT system, construction of the North East Line, the Bukit

Panjang  and  Sengkang  LRT  systems and  road  construction  and

improvement  programmes.  Other main recipients  are  educational

institutions and aided schools for upgrading programmes  and  the

National   Science   &  Technology  Board   for   financing   and

administering R&D projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital expenditure for Public Housing is projected at $2.2

billion  or 1.3% of GDP.  The bulk of the subsidy is for the  HDB

Upgrading  Programmes, development of infrastructure  within  HDB

New Towns and financing of HDB's bottom-line deficit.



<div align="center"><b>EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES</b></div>

<br><br><i>Social & Community Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, as in the past years, the largest share of

Government's  expenditure budget goes to the Social  &  Community

Services sector.  It accounts for 39.6% of total expenditure.  In

absolute  terms, the sector's allocation of $11.5 billion  is  an

increase   of  $856  million  over  FY99.   Education,  Community

Development  &  Sports,  and  Health  will  all  get  substantial

increases in their budget allocations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on educating our young continues to take up the

lion's share within the Social & Community Services sector,  with

$6.0 billion or 52% going to MOE.  This represents an increase of

$881  million or 17% compared to FY99.  Within MOE,  the  General

Education  Programme  undertaken by the  Government,  Government-aided,  special  education and independent schools  accounts  for

$3.1  billion or 53% of its total budget.  The three universities

take  up $1.2 billion or 19% while the four polytechnics and  the

Institute  of Technical Education (ITE) account for $585  million

(or  10%) and $167 million (or 3%) respectively.  The balance  of

$915 million is for the remaining programmes of MOE.  In terms

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



of   development  expenditure,  the  bulk  of  the  $2.0  billion

allocated will be used to build new schools, rebuild and  improve

existing schools, as well as to expand the teaching facilities in

the tertiary institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Housing takes up the next largest slice of $2.3

billion  of  the  budget  allocated to  the  Social  &  Community

Services  sector.  Funds for Public Housing will be used  to  pay

the  subsidy  for HDB's bottom-line financing, the Selective  En-Bloc  Redevelopment Scheme, as well as the various HDB  upgrading

programmes.   MOH (with $1.2 billion), ENV (with  $972  million),

MCDS  (with $610 million), and MITA (with $379 million) round  up

the  budget  for this sector.  MCDS and MOH will get  substantial

increases  of  38% and 10% respectively in their FY2000  budgets.

Within  MCDS,  the Elderly Development Programme  will  have  its

allocation  increased  by 55% to $12.3 million.   Expenditure  on

this   programme  will  increase  further  when   more   of   the

recommendations put forward by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on

the Ageing Population are implemented.



<br><br><i>Security & Defence</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second largest sector is Security & Defence, which takes

up  $9.6 billion or 33% of total Government expenditure.  Of  the

$9.6  billion,  $7.4 billion will go to MINDEF  to  fund  defence

programmes.  The remaining $2.2 billion will be for MHA and Civil

Defence  programmes.  MINDEF's budget will make up 4.5%  of  GDP,

well within the ceiling of 6% of GDP set for MINDEF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $2.2 billion allocated to MHA (including Civil

Defence),  $1.0  billion or 47% will be for the Police  Programme

while  $351 million or 16% will go to Civil Defence.  Development

expenditure  will  be  mainly  for the  MHA  Complex,  Cantonment

Complex, Civil Defence Shelters Programme, redevelopment  of  the

Gurkha  Cantonment,  SCDF  HQ Complex  and  Neighbourhood  Police

Centres.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Economic & Infrastructural Development</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic & Infrastructural Development forms the third

largest sector, taking up $5.9 billion or 20% of total Government

expenditure.   Within the sector, MCIT has the largest  share  of

$2.2  billion,  followed  by  MTI  with  $1.9  billion.   MND  is

allocated $584 million, but this excludes Public Housing which is

funded separately.  MOM will receive $171 million.  The remaining

$978 million allocated to this sector is used to fund all the R&D

programmes undertaken by ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic development will continue to take a three-prong

approach: investment in infrastructure, creation of new  economic

activities   to  achieve  sustainable  growth  and  comprehensive

development  of our workforce to meet the challenges of  economic

restructuring.   Infrastructure  investment  is  achieved  mainly

through  projects  undertaken by MCIT, MTI and  MND.   MCIT  will

spend  $1.2 billion to make rail-based improvements to  the  land

transportation system and a further $260 million  to  make  road-based  improvements.   MTI  will spend $780  million  to  develop

projects  on  Jurong  Island  and  a  further  $380  million  for

reclamation  at Changi East, Sentosa Cove, Southern  Islands  and

infrastructure works at Kaki Bukit and Tuas View.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB and TDB together will undertake the task of creating new

economic  activities.   EDB is allocated $309  million  for  this

purpose  while  TDB  will  receive  $38  million.   MOM  will  be

responsible for the development of our workforce and is allocated

a  sum of $171 million.  This represents a 68% increase from  the

FY99 allocation.



<br><br><i>General Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Services sector, comprising MFA, organs of

state,  and  the  central ministries, continues to  take  up  the

smallest  share of the total Government expenditure at  7%.   Our

intention is to keep the central administration lean, and let the

operational ministries have the bulk of the resources.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL REFORM  -  RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the economic crisis has passed and our economy is

now  back on track, the budgetary positions in the years to  come

are  expected  to remain tight.  There are two main  reasons  for

this.   First, as the Singapore economy matures, economic  growth

will  slow  down and revenue growth will also moderate.   Second,

with  increasing  globalisation and the  lowering  of  investment

barriers,  competition for high value-added  economic  activities

will become keener.  This means that as we lower our tax rates to

keep  our tax system competitive, there will be downward pressure

on revenue.  The combined impact of these developments is that we

can expect operating revenue growth to slow down over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with rising affluence, the public will

demand  more  and  better services.  However,  as  the  budgetary

outlook  is expected to be tight, ministries can only meet  these

increasingly  sophisticated expectations through  more  effective

use  of existing resources rather than through the employment  of

more resources.  In other words, officers in the ministries would

have to be managers rather than just staff officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the budgeting angle, the system in the past has been

one  based  on giving more resources on the promise of  increased

output.   However, this has the tendency to get MOF  involved  in

the  micro-management of the ministries.  The budgeting  paradigm

has  since  been shifted to one of encouraging the ministries  to

get  the  most  out  of  their allotted resources.   Within  that

budgeting  framework,  ministries  are  assured  of  a   built-in

increase  for  their base budget which is dependent  on  the  GDP

growth  rate.   Any increase in budgetary provision  beyond  that

would  have to be justified on the basis of the priority of their

programmes against others.  In tandem with this, ministries  have

also  been  moved to looking at the desired outcomes  that  their

programmes are intended to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



achieve rather than just looking at the outputs generated by  the

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This in essence is the next phase of financial reform which

MOF  has undertaken to ensure that the Government makes the  best

use  of its resources.  It will require ministries to look at the

total  cost of providing services rather than just the cash  cost

alone.   To  achieve  this, the concept  of  resource  accounting

within  ministries will be introduced.  Over the next  couple  of

years, other resource management concepts and practices will also

be introduced in stages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we continue to innovate and improve on

the  way we manage our resources.  We have no choice.  To  remain

competitive, we must keep Government expenditure as a  percentage

of  the GDP low.  Yet, there are more and more that we have to do

in  order  to  cater for the economic and social  aspirations  of

Singaporeans.    We   can  meet  these  seemingly   contradictory

requirements only if we continuously innovate and improve on  the

management of our resources.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to

the proposed tax changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recovered from the Asian financial crisis relatively

unscathed   and   much   earlier  than  expected.    The   timely

implementation  of the cost cutting package played  an  important

part  in  helping the economy rebound quickly.  We expect  growth

for  the economy as a whole to remain strong this year.  However,

not  all  sectors  are  fully out of  the  woods.   For  example,

construction

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



and  business services are still under-performing.  In  addition,

the  manufacturing and electronics sectors which led the recovery

face  strong competitive pressures.  To ensure that the  momentum

of  economic  recovery  is sustained, I will  be  announcing  the

extension  of  some tax measures introduced in  the  cost-cutting

package, partially or in full, to help contain cost pressures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longer term, we face structural problems posed by an ageing

population.  The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on the  Ageing

Population made comprehensive recommendations and these are being

studied.  Although many of the problems raised have  longer  term

implications, we should start to address some of the less complex

issues.   I  will therefore be announcing several tax changes  to

encourage  Singaporeans to plan prudently for their  needs  after

retirement  and  also  to encourage greater family  cohesiveness.

There  will  also be incentives to enhance our competitive  edge,

encourage  the growth of knowledge intensive and high value-added

activities and measures to foster entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first touch on tax changes for individuals and the

family.



<br><br><b>TAX CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND THE FAMILY</b>

<br><br><i>Supplementary Retirement Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the areas studied by the IMC on the Ageing Population

is  financial  security.  The IMC has recommended that  financial

security  should comprise a "basic needs Central  Provident  Fund

model",  and a "complementary private sector system" to encourage

Singaporeans  to  supplement their CPF  savings  by  contributing

voluntarily  to private funds.  The Government agrees  with  this

recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will introduce a Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS),

which  allows  Singaporeans to contribute  voluntarily  over  and

above  their CPF savings.  Contributions to SRS will be  accorded

tax  deductions  at  the  time of contribution,  with  tax  being

payable only when the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



savings  are  withdrawn.   Participants  will  have  considerable

flexibility in investing their savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary SRS contributions can only be made by

employees,  subject to a percentage cap based  on  their  salary.

Employers  shall not contribute.  SRS will not be  an  additional

cost to business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention is to allow foreigners who are

working  in  Singapore to also participate if the scheme  can  be

useful for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the SRS is a complex scheme, details of the scheme will

take  time  to work out.  Views from the private sector  will  be

sought on the implementation aspects.  We expect to implement the

scheme by next year.



<br><br><i>Income Tax Relief for Dependants</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the IMC has raised public awareness on care of

the  elderly.  We believe that the elderly are best cared for  by

their children in the familial surroundings of their own homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is a tax relief of $4,500 for the

maintenance  of each aged parent if the taxpayer is staying  with

the  aged  parent or a lesser amount of relief at $3,500  if  the

taxpayer  is  not  staying with his parent.  To  provide  greater

recognition to those who stay with their parents, the relief  for

them  will  be raised by $500 to $5,000.  For those who  maintain

their  aged  parents but do not stay with them, the  relief  will

remain at $3,500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change will take effect from the Year of Assessment

2000.  Revenue loss to Government will be about $5 million.



<br><br><i>Tax Treatment for CPF Savings Beyond the Minimum Sum</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the Minimum Sum Scheme, the Minimum Sum may

be  left with CPF Board, deposited with an approved bank or  used

to purchase an annuity.  CPF savings in excess of the Minimum Sum

can be withdrawn at age 55.  To encourage more prudent financial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



planning  with  CPF  savings,  the  current  tax  exemption   for

annuities  bought  with  the Minimum  Sum  will  be  extended  to

annuities  bought with CPF savings beyond the Minimum  Sum.   The

tax  treatment  will  similarly be accorded  to  interest  income

arising  from the deposits of CPF savings beyond the Minimum  Sum

deposited with approved banks.  Several conditions, such as those

of  the  Minimum Sum Scheme will apply.  Details will be released

by CPF Board in due course.



<br><br><i>Extension of Tax Relief for CPF Top-Up to Grandparents</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from providing for their own financial security,

individuals currently enjoy a tax relief for cash top-ups to  the

Minimum Sum Account of their parents.  At present, a taxpayer who

tops  up  in cash to his own or his parents' retirement  accounts

will  be  allowed  a tax relief on the amount topped  up,  up  to

$6,000  a  year.   To  promote inter-generational  ties  and  the

concept  of  extended  families, I have decided  to  extend  this

relief to cover top-ups in cash for grandparents with effect from

Year  of Assessment 2001.  Details will be released by CPF  Board

in due course.



<br><br><i>Personal Tax Rebate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government gave a one-off 10% tax rebate to

help  mitigate the impact of the recession.  As economic recovery

is  well underway this year, the 10% rebate will not be extended.

Instead,  a  one-off, across-the-board rebate of 5% on individual

income   tax  for  Year  of  Assessment  2000  will  be  granted.

Estimated revenue loss to Government is $200 million.



<br><br><i>Rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy and Rental Charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the GST-related changes made to personal income

tax, currently about 65% of individuals no longer pay income  tax

and  will not benefit from income tax rebates.  To assist  people

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



this  group,  Government will grant rebates on  HDB  Service  and

Conservancy (S&C) charges and rents to citizens staying in owner-occupied  HDB  flats and rented flats.  The rebates  will  be  as

follows:



<br><br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>One-Room Flats</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months' net rent and two months' net S&C charges.

The  rental  and  S&C rebates will be made on 1st  June  and  1st

December this year.

<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Two-Room Flats</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's net rent and two months' net S&C charges.

The  rental  rebate  will be made on 1st December,  and  the  S&C

rebates on 1st June and 1st December this year.

<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Three-Room Flats</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and a half months' net S&C charges. The S&C rebate

will be made on 1st June and 1st December this year.

<br><br>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Four-Room Flats</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three quarter month's net S&C charges. The S&C rebate

will be made on 1st December this year.

<br><br>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Five-Room Flats</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a month's net S&C charges, to be made on 1st

December this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rebates is $25 million. The

rebates will be given after deducting GST offset rebates and  S&C

grants associated with utilities rebates.



<br><br><i>GST-Related Offsets and Rebates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I announced that in view of the difficult

economic conditions, the GST offset package, consisting of rental

and  S&C rebates for 1 to 3-room HDB households would be extended

for  two years until March 2001.  I am happy to confirm that  the

GST  offset  package will continue to be given  this  year.   The

rental and S&C rebates are as follows:

<br><br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rental Rebates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: a rental rebate of $12 per month

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: a rental rebate of $8 per month

<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rebates for S&C Charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: $8 per month

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: $7 per month

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 3-room flats: $4 per month

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rebates is $19 million.



<br><br><i>Offset Package for Utilities Rate Revision</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1997, the Government announced the revision of water

tariffs and water conservation tax to a uniform flat rate for all

users.   The increases were to be phased over 4 years,  with  the

last  increase  scheduled for 1st July 2000.  The water  tariffs,

including  conservation tax, will increase by between 14.3  cents

and 23.3 cents per cubic metre for domestic consumers.   The non-domestic  water  rate will remain unchanged at  $1.52  per  cubic

metre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offset higher sewerage costs, the waterborne fee will be

raised  as  scheduled  by 5 cents per cubic  metre  for  domestic

consumers and 9 cents per cubic metre for non-domestic consumers,

also with effect from 1st July 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to help lower-income households

cope  with  the water tariff increases and I am happy to  confirm

that  the offset package announced in last year's Budget will  be

continued this year.  The utilities rebates are $200 for 1 to  3-room  HDB flats and $100 for 4-room HDB flats.  The rebates  will

be  credited  against the utilities bills of eligible  households

for  the month of September.  Households which are unable to  use

up  the rebate within the month can carry over the balance of the

rebate  until it is fully used up.  This will cost the Government

about $81 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants for S&C charges to HDB lessees and tenants, ranging

from  $36  to  $66 a year will also continue to  be  given.   The

grants  will start from July this year and will be $3  per  month

for  1-room flats, $4 per month for 2-room flats, $5.50 per month

for 3-room flats and $4 per month

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



for  4-room flats.  They will be credited directly into  the  S&C

accounts of eligible lessees or tenants with their Town Councils.

This will cost the Government $29 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to tax changes for companies and

businesses in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align="center"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES</b></div>

<br><br><i>Corporate Income Tax</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, a 10% corporate tax rebate was given to assist

companies  affected by the economic downturn.  This  rebate  will

not  be  extended  for  a  second year because  the  economy  has

rebounded  strongly. Our corporate tax rate was last  reduced  to

26%  in  1997  and remains generally competitive at  this  level.

However,  in  recent  years, many developed countries  have  been

lowering  corporate taxes to stimulate investments  and  if  this

trend  continues,  our tax competitiveness will  be  eroded  over

time.   I have therefore decided to take a cautious next step  by

reducing the corporate tax rate by 0.5% to 25.5% with effect from

Year of Assessment 2001.  Maintaining a competitive tax regime is

a  cornerstone of our fiscal strategy and the tax cuts  over  the

years  have  contributed  greatly towards  our  economic  growth.

Revenue loss arising from the reduction in corporate tax rate  is

estimated at $140 million annually.



<br><br><i>Extension  of  Property Tax Rebate on Commercial  and  Industrial Properties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, against a background of economic recession, a 55%

property tax rebate for commercial and industrial properties  was

granted for two years, starting 1st July 1998.  Although the real

estate sector has shown recovery in the past year, rental markets

remain  weak.  I have therefore decided to extend the rebate  for

another year, up to June 2001, but at a lower rate of 25%.   This

will  also  help  to ease cost pressures on companies  generally.

Revenue forgone is estimated at $250 million.  HDB, JTC and other

Government  agencies  owning properties will  pass  most  of  the

rebate to their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



tenants.  I would also urge private landlords to do likewise, and

pass on at least half of the rebate to their tenants.



<br><br><i>Further Stamp Duty Relief for Corporate Restructuring and Merger</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 15 of the Stamp Duties Act provides stamp

duty  relief for corporate restructuring and merger.  As  section

15  is  a relieving section, qualifying conditions have been  set

for the concession.  In recent years, we have seen an increase in

the number of companies involved in restructuring or merger to re-align  their businesses, so as to improve on cost-efficiency  and

better  deliver  products or services to customers.   With  these

developments  in  mind, I have therefore decided  to  expand  the

scope  of  stamp duty exemption to a wider spectrum of  corporate

restructurings  and  mergers.   In  addition  to   the   existing

exemptions,  relief  will be granted to the  transfer  of  assets

between  associated companies, the restructuring  and  merger  of

listed  companies, and companies which intend to list or  further

list their shares after the exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, if the transfer involves less than 90% of the

company's  shares, or if the consideration is made in  cash,  the

exercise  would  not qualify for the relief.  I have  decided  to

lift  these  two  conditions for the transfer of  assets  between

associated  companies,  defined as one  owning  75%  or  more  of

another  company, or a third company owning at least 75% of  both

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, publicly-listed companies and companies which

intend to list their shares after the restructuring or merger are

not  able to meet the condition of a 2-year moratorium on changes

in  beneficial ownership of the shares.  I have decided  to  lift

the  2-year moratorium on the consideration shares held by public

shareholders,  and  also allow companies to float  a  portion  of

their  issued  share capital up to the minimum listing  threshold

required by the SGX for its mainboard listing.  This threshold is

currently 25%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will take effect shortly when details are

announced by IRAS.



<div align="center"><b>TAX CHANGES TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION, CREATIVITY AND ENTERPRISE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Income Tax Concession for Royalty Payments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, authors, composers and inventors can avail

themselves of a tax incentive which exempts from tax 90% of gross

royalties received.  To further encourage the development of  the

arts  and  innovation in Singapore, I have decided to  liberalise

the current scheme.  The changes are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Concession for Authors and Composers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the concession is only applicable to income

received  by  authors and composers from publishers in  Singapore

for  the  assignment of or for the right to use the copyright  in

any  literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.   With  effect

from  Year  of  Assessment 2001, royalty payments received  by  a

composer or an author from recording, film or drama companies  in

Singapore will also qualify for this incentive.



<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Concession for Inventors and Innovators</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentive for inventors and innovators is presently

applicable  only  to  income derived by a  Singapore  citizen  or

permanent resident for the assignment of or for the rights in any

approved   inventions  or  innovations  that  are  manufacturing-related.   This incentive will be extended to cover any  approved

inventions  or  innovations  from the non-manufacturing  sectors.

The scheme will also be extended to foreigners, provided that the

creations  of  the  inventions or innovations  are  substantially

carried out in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for the incentive, the inventions or innovations

must be protectable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



The Economic Development Board will administer the incentive.  It

will  be  granted for a period of 5 years from Year of Assessment

2001.

<br><br><i>Estate Duty Exemption Rules for Residential Properties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, estate duty exemption is given on a two-tiered

basis:  for  residential  properties in Singapore,  exemption  is

given  up  to  $9  million, and generally for all other  dutiable

assets, $600,000.  However, for residential properties to qualify

for  the $9 million exemption, they must not be used for any form

of business activity.  To encourage entrepreneurs who may want to

work  from  home,  this  rule will be  relaxed.   With  immediate

effect,  a  Singapore  residential  property  used  for  business

activity  will  also  qualify for the estate duty  exemption  for

residential property, as long as the residential character of the

property  is  not  materially  affected.   This  relaxation  will

support  the  Technopreneur Home Office Scheme,  and  also  allow

other   small   businesses  to  be  carried  out  in  residential

properties   without  disqualifying  these   from   estate   duty

exemption.

<br><br><i>Enhanced Tax Treatment for Stock Options</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity ownership is key to the development of the vibrant

technopreneurial  environment in Silicon Valley  and  other  high

tech  nodes.  Talented people, including research scientists  and

engineers, high tech professionals, MBA holders, and even  office

staff,  are nowadays prepared to accept low or even zero salaries

in  return for equity stakes in the companies they work in.  They

hope  that their companies will succeed spectacularly, and  their

equity  stakes  will  increase by tens or hundreds  of  times  in

value.   Their  direct stakes in their firms'  success  motivates

them  to  put their hearts and souls into building up the  firms,

and to slog long hours to outdo their competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these equity stakes are offered to the employees

through  stock option schemes, commonly known as ESOPs  (Employee

Stock Options).  The use of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



ESOPs  is  most pervasive among technopreneurial start-ups.   But

even for mature companies, ESOP schemes have been shown to have a

significant  impact on corporate performance.  The evidence  that

stock  options play a pivotal role in good corporate  performance

is well established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usefulness of stock options lies in their ability to

recruit,  motivate and retain employees.  This is  vital  in  the

businesses of today.  But it will be even more important  in  the

businesses  of  tomorrow, which will place a growing  premium  on

developing  and applying knowledge, and committing  the  energies

and  creative juices of the people working for the company.  They

may still be called employees, but they are actually partners  in

the enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many developed countries have recognised the importance of

employee stock options in helping high-growth companies to retain

and  motivate top talent.  They have made significant changes  to

their  tax  systems to encourage employee stock  options,  or  to

introduce  incentive schemes for stock options.  These  countries

include the UK, Scandinavian countries and even Japan.  Under the

incentive  schemes,  tax treatment for ESOPs is  more  favourable

than cash payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must move in the same direction. We need to act quickly,

to offer potential entrepreneurs that extra incentive to take the

plunge,  and  to  send  a  clear  signal  that  we  are  strongly

encouraging  enterprise  and  wealth  creation.   Attractive  tax

treatment  to  encourage  the use of ESOPs  will  also  help  our

companies  to  compete for global talent, which is highly  mobile

not  only  across companies, but also across national boundaries.

Talent will be attracted to places where opportunities and  post-tax rewards are the greatest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We improved the tax treatment of ESOPs last year, by

allowing  the tax payable to be deferred by up to 5  years,  with

interest  chargeable  for the deferment.  But  this  was  only  a

modest first step.  We need to improve the tax treatment of ESOPs

further, particularly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



for  the  high  tech  start-ups.  As this  may  have  significant

implications  for our tax system, we need a little more  time  to

complete the study.  We will announce an enhanced scheme for high

tech start-ups by the end of May this year.



<div align="center"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR</b></div>

<br><br><i>Abolishment of Stamp Duty on Contract Notes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to fine-tune its tax regime to

promote the development of the financial services sector  and  to

ensure  that  Singapore continues to be a  conducive  centre  for

trading and transacting financial products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The securities markets today are facing a period of intense

technological  change and competition.  Exchanges worldwide  have

been  restructuring themselves in the face of globalising  equity

markets.   Advancement  in technology has not  only  created  new

competition  from  alternative  trading  systems,  it  has   also

facilitated the rapid flow of capital to markets which offer  the

greatest efficiency and lowest trading costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has responded to

these challenges with a series of initiatives.  Liberalisation of

the  fixed  brokerage  commissions system  will  be  accelerated.

Commissions  on  all trades regardless of value  will  be  freely

negotiable  from 1st January 2001, instead of 1st  January  2003.

Stamp  duty on contract notes on share transactions is  now  only

0.05%, and had been suspended until 29th June 2000 as part of our

earlier response to the economic crisis.  To further enhance  the

competitiveness  of our stock exchanges, stamp duty  on  contract

notes  on  share transactions will be abolished with effect  from

30th  June  2000.   The  annual revenue  loss  to  Government  is

estimated  at  $70  million, based on the  average  stock  market

transactions for the past 3 years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Abolition  of  Withholding Taxes on Financial Guaranty  Insurance Contracts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent financial crisis has highlighted the need for

Asia  to  develop  a  deeper  and  more  liquid  bond  market  to

facilitate raising of longer-term funds.  Increasingly, there  is

a   need   for  issuers  of  debt  securities  to  employ  credit

enhancement tools, as investors become more concerned over credit

quality.   This will open up business opportunities in  Asia  for

credit  enhancers,  such  as financial guaranty  insurers,  which

insure the payment of the principal and interest to investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS has amended its regulations to allow multi-line

insurers, reinsurers and branches of foreign insurers,  to  write

financial  guaranty business.  To further promote this  activity,

claim  payments made under financial guaranty insurance  policies

by  approved financial guaranty insurers to non-residents will be

exempt from withholding tax.  This will take effect immediately.



<br><br><i>Extension of Tax Concession for Bond Trading to Swap Trading</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 Budget, I announced a concessionary 10% tax rate

on  income  derived  by financial institutions  from  trading  in

bonds.   For  the  bond market to flourish, it  is  important  to

develop a swap market to provide market players with avenues  for

risk-hedging  and arbitraging.  To encourage the  development  of

the  swap  market here, the concessionary 10% tax  rate  will  be

extended to income derived by financial institutions from trading

in  interest rate and currency swaps.  This concession will  take

effect  from  Year of Assessment 2001 and will apply  until  27th

February  2003, which is also the expiry date of the 5-year  bond

incentives which took effect on 28th February 1998.



<br><br><i>Withholding Tax Exemption on Interest Rate and Currency Swaps</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1989 Budget, I announced the exemption of

withholding tax on interest rate and currency swap payments  made

by  Asian  Currency  Units (ACUs) to non-residents.   To  further

develop our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



swap  market, withholding tax exemption will be extended  to  all

bona  fide  interest  rate and currency  swap  payments  made  by

financial  institutions besides ACUs.  The  exemption  will  take

immediate effect.



<br><br><i>Extension of the Asian Currency Unit (ACU) Scheme to All Offshore Financial Derivatives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, ACUs are taxed at a concessionary rate of 10% on

income   from  transactions  in  certain  specified  derivatives,

including  interest  rate  and currency  swaps  in  non-Singapore

dollars, with offshore counterparties and other ACUs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trading of financial products other than plain vanilla

swaps has expanded considerably.  To further develop this area of

business, the 10% tax rate will be extended to income derived  by

ACUs  from  all  other offshore derivative transactions  in  non-Singapore dollars.  This extension will take effect from Year  of

Assessment 2001 and will apply for 5 years.



<br><br><i>Goods  and Services Tax on Trustee Services Provided to  a  Trust with Non-Resident Settlors and Beneficiaries</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cardinal principle underlying the GST is that it is a tax

on domestic consumption of goods and services.  Under present tax

rules,  the  provision of trustee services by a  trustee  to  the

trust is standard-rated if the trustee representing the trust  is

situated  in  Singapore.  This treatment applies even  where  the

settlors and beneficiaries of a trust are all or mostly foreign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to put Singapore trustees on a more competitive

footing  with  offshore  trustees, I have  decided  to  zero-rate

trustee services in cases where at least 80% of the settlors  and

beneficiaries are non-resident, and at least 80% of the assets of

the  trust were originally contributed by settlors who  are  non-resident.   This measure will also facilitate the development  of

our private banking industry, where trusts are likely to play  an

increasingly substantial role.

<div align="center"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR THE PROPERTY SECTOR</b></div>

<br><br><i>Property Tax Exemption for Land under Development</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax exemption for land under development was

introduced  in the FY98 Budget to address difficulties  faced  by

developers  during the economic crisis.  The property development

market  has  shown signs of recovery since.  Property transaction

volume  and  the  property  price  index  have  seen  a  pick-up.

Government has also decided to resume residential land sales this

year.   Tax  exemption on property tax for land under development

will  therefore be withdrawn with effect from today.  The  change

will  only affect new projects.  Projects which have been granted

tax exemption will continue to enjoy the concession for a maximum

period of 5 years or upon completion, whichever is earlier.



<div align="center"><b>TAX CHANGES ON PERSONAL CONSUMPTION</b></div>

<br><br><i>Duties on Cigarettes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on cigarettes were last revised in February 1998. In

support  of the continuing national effort to discourage smoking,

especially among the young, the excise duty on cigarettes will be

raised  from  $130 to $150 per kilogram.  Details of the  changes

are  in  Annex A.  (Cols. 1123-4).  The changes will take  effect

from  today.   There will be a revenue gain of about $64  million

annually.



<br><br><i>CONCLUSION</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, barring any major external shocks, the

recovery momentum is expected to continue in 2000 and beyond.  We

have  come through the economic crisis well because of our strong

fundamentals  and sound principles of governance.   We  are  well

placed  for  future growth, provided we do not become complacent.

The  economic crisis has also taught us valuable lessons  on  the

post crisis economic environment and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



strategies needed for future growth.  We have to face up  to  the

challenges  of  a globalised economic system and keep  pace  with

changes in technology to remain relevant and useful.  We need  to

accelerate  the pace of economic restructuring.  Our  costs  must

remain competitive.  We must have world-class infrastructure  and

strong  reserves and our workforce must be continually  upgraded.

Most  important of all, we have to work on preserving our  social

cohesion,  without which we will be much weaker as  a  nation  in

weathering a future crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. [Applause.]
