<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of Singapore for the

financial year 1st April 1970, to 31st March  1971,

contained  in  Paper  Cmd.  4  of  1970.  For   the

the  last  column  of  the  Abstract  of  Estimated

in respect of which amendments stand on the Order

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0106 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0106 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2009.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I quote from page 22 of the Memorandum

on the Estimates of

Revenue and Expenditure of Singapore for the

financial year 1st April, 1970, to 31st March, 1971

(Misc. 1 of 1970):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Decrease of $170,000 in O.C.A.R. is mainly due to

a smaller provision being required for Bursaries

and Other Assistance for Students of Higher

Institutions based on past experience and a

reduction in the number of President's Scholarships

in view of the prestigious nature of these

scholarships.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's scholarships for the year

1970-71 are being provided with a sum of $42,000

as against that of $124,370 for the period 1969-70,

that is, a period of 15 months. In other words, no

less than $82,000 has been lopped off. This is a

drastic cut. I well know, Sir, that such

scholarships are few in number and that, in most

cases, the recipients win other awards. Therefore,

three questions come to my mind. First, will the

Prime Minister indicate the number of such holders

who have graduated from their courses of study

since the inception of the President's scholarships

and in which areas they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



now serving? Secondly, whilst I agree that such top

honours  are  not  easy  to gain,  I  am  wondering

whether  this  further  cut  will  not  dampen  the

keenness in competition of the aspirants,  in  view

of a further reduction in the number of awards this

year,  as  was so stated. Sir, no one  doubts  that

this  is a highly covetous award which many of  our

students are aiming to get. Thirdly, Sir, will  the

Prime  Minister indicate the number of awards  made

last year as against the possible number this year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we had occasion to discuss this

same  matter in the 1968 budget session. The Member

for  Punggol knows that the standards required  for

the  President's scholarships have  been  set  very

high.  Awards  are  made to those with  exceptional

academic     performance    and    extra-curricular

activities. The numbers awarded were nine in  1966,

seven  in  1967, six in 1968 and four in 1969.  The

awards for 1970 are being considered at present.  I

cannot   anticipate  how  many  will   finally   be

considered worthy of becoming President's scholars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since 1967 Merit scholarships have been

awarded  to those who have done well, but  did  not

satisfy  the high standards required of President's

scholars. Twelve of these were awarded in 1967,  13

in  1968  and  seven in 1969. Of the 26 President's

scholars  to  date,  eight  have  completed   their

studies.  Two  were taken into the  Administrative

Service, one to the Economic Development Board. The

others are being interviewed for appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, whilst going through the 1967 debate on the

Estimates of Expenditure for 1968, in Vol. 26, from

col. 632 (at the bottom) to col. 636, I notice that

one  point  brought  out was that  the  President's

scholar, in addition to his winning the President's

scholarship,  will go on to win other  scholarships

as  well  and,  as a result, he will  get  what  is

termed  a "scholarship allowance" and not the  full



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



award. My question is this. Will not the full award

of  the  scholarship enhance the  prestige  of  the

recipient rather than just a scholarship allowance?

If that is the case, I think this $42,000 will go a

much longer way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With respect for the Member for Punggol, I

believe  that if scholarship is to be nurtured  and

encouraged,  then too much money to young  students

may  not  necessarily bring about the best results.

Last   year,  of  the  four  who  were  President's

scholars,  three  won other scholarships.  So  they

were  given  a  token  sum of $500  per  annum,  in

addition  to  their  other scholarships.  The  year

before,  in 1968, of the six President's  scholars,

five won other scholarships. So each was given $500

per annum special allowance in recognition of their

status as President's scholars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the scholarships awarded are

adequate   for   scholastic,   social   and   other

legitimate pursuits of our students. Giving them an

unnecessarily  extravagant sum of  money  will  not

improve  the  quality either of their  studies,  or

their later performance in life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In that case, I thank the Prime Minister for his

answer and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, you have one



minute before "guillotine" time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0106 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (1) of  subhead

2010.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I have just one simple

question.  I  wish to seek clarification  from  the

Prime Minister as to what "unallocated awards" are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Unallocated awards provide for unforeseen

training requirements of high priority which  arise

as  a  result of changing circumstances, or  sudden

requirements which cannot be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



met  from  the  regular bilateral  or  multilateral

technical  assistance  schemes.  The  provision  is

utilised mainly for the awards, about 10 to 15  per

year,  for higher studies both in foreign and local

institutions  of  higher learning.  They  meet  the

costs  of  passages, fees and expenses,  and  other

relevant and necessary ad hoc expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 0106 having expired, the

following amendment, standing in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting, was not proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0106 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,855,240 for Head 0106 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0107 -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

underline  the importance of ensuring that  drivers

of  Government vehicles take every care to exercise

their  responsibility on the  road.  I  crave  your

indulgence by referring to a point which I think is

relevant  and  which was made by the  Minister  for

Finance  in  his  Budget statement.  He  said  that

qualitative  improvements have taken place  in  our

society,  that there is more social discipline  and

that parvenu values are giving way to more positive

group   values.   I  agree  generally   with   this

statement.  But  I would like to  state  it  as  my

opinion  that our highways and by-ways may  be  the

last   bastion  of  these  parvenu  values,   where

everybody  thinks  of himself  and  apparently  the

devil  takes the hindmost. I suggest that  we  make

every effort to ensure that Government vehicles set

an  example of social discipline on the road  -  an

example  which I find more honoured in  the  breach

than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



in  the  observance. There can be many ways  and  I

leave  it to the officers concerned to ensure this,

but  I  think that every attempt should be made  to

get  Government  drivers  to  set  an  example   of

discipline on the public roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, traffic conditions are getting

worse  in  Singapore.  This provision  looks  after

damage  to  private vehicles caused  by  Government

vehicles.  As  the  Member  for  Katong   will   be

interested  in  the  figures  for  last  year,  the

Government  paid  a sum of $49,739 as  compensation

for  damage  caused by the 607 Government  vehicles

which   were  involved  in  accidents.  But   these

vehicles  are  knocked,  too,  and  the  Government

recovered  as  compensation for damages  caused  to

Government vehicles a total sum of $23,375.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member can rest assured that circulars are

sent  out  to Government departments to  make  sure

that drivers take care and follow road regulations.

Where  an  accident  occurs  as  a  result  of  the

negligence   of   the  driver   employed   by   the

Government, and if the Attorney-General thinks that

a  prosecution should be brought, it is brought. On

the  other  hand,  the  facts  may  not  warrant  a

prosecution but may warrant disciplinary action  to

be taken against drivers of Government vehicles. In

that  case,  disciplinary action is  taken.  But  I

would  agree  with  the  Member  that  drivers   of

Government  vehicles  should  set  the  example  in

Singapore.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present Government came to power in 1959

and  under  the capable leadership of the  People's

Action  Party, the  administration  is  efficient,

honest  and clean and has won the acclaim of people

from  all over the world. If we compare our country

with the other countries in South-east Asia, we can

say  that  the administration in Singapore  is  the

most efficient. Sir, this good reputation should be

maintained at all costs and it should not be spoilt

by certain officers who are arrogant and proud.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received complaints from my constituents

and  I would like to cite an example. The Citizens'

Consultative Committee in my constituency  wrote  a

letter  to  the Director of the National Museum  on

31st  October,  1969,  stating  that  there  was  a

hornets' nest along Island Club Road and requesting

him  to  clear the nest. There was no  reply.  They

wrote  another letter on 14th November,  1969,  and

still  there  was no reply. On 2nd December,  1969,

they  again  wrote to him. A reply was received  on

5th  December, 1969, informing them that, owing  to

the  shortage of staff, the National Museum was not

able  to  take  any  action in  this  matter.  Sir,

hornets are dangerous insects - Order.

to  wait for two months before we received a  reply

from  the  Director of the National Museum.  If  an

ordinary  citizen  were to write  to  a  Government

department,  you  can imagine  what  would  be  the

result.  I  am  sure  the  authorities  would  just

disregard  or throw the letter into the  wastepaper

basket. Mr Speaker, Sir, this kind of attitude  on

the  part of Government officials is deplorable and

I  hope the Minister can look into this matter  and

take measures to improve the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a new post in the National Museum.

Can the Minister tell us the

duties and functions of the Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



Officer in the Museum? And is it necessary to  have

such a post in the Museum?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Museum is visited very

largely  by  school students and it is,  therefore,

essentially  an  educational  institution.  If  the

Museum  is  to  serve its purpose usefully,  it  is

necessary  indeed that we should have  one  officer

who  will  be able to organise tours on  behalf  of

schools  which  carry  out regular  visits  to  the

Museum. It is because of this reason that the  post

marked "Education Officer" has been created in  the

National  Museum. This has been done on the  advice

of the National Museum Advisory Committee, of which

the  Member  for  Katong is the President.  If  the

Member  for  Thomson wishes further information  on

this aspect, he can ask the Member for Katong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just to inform the House, the Education

Officer  is, as of this moment, seconded  from  the

Ministry  of Education. But it is our intention  at

some future date that this person should be part of

the  establishment of the Museum itself. The Member

for  Thomson may be interested to know that  during

the  period  1st  July to 31st December  last  year

there   were  altogether  55  guided  visits  which

represented 2,080 pupils and 194 teachers  from  27

schools and the Teachers' Training College.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Museum organised eight practical

and   field  courses  for  117  teachers  who  were

teaching  nature science or biology. We  have  also

plans  to  arrange for talks and demonstrations  to

science  clubs  in schools, and it  is  because  of

these  extended and enlarged services of the Museum

that  we  have come to the conclusion that a  full-time  Education Officer in the Museum will be  very

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving such a reduction, it is not my

intention  that we stop making continuous  attempts

to instil into the people the importance of science

and  technology. These two important aspects of the

modern  economic  development of nations  have  been

ignored  for  too long, during the colonial  period

and  the early post-war period. To make up for the

loss  of time, the Government has wisely set  up  a

Science  Council  recently, and in accordance  with

its  policy of promoting the study and practice  of

science and technology, the Ministry of Science and

Technology   was  set  up  in  1968.   Regrettably,

however,  the functions of the Science Council,  as

well  as  those  of  the Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology, remain not quite well known to the  man

in the street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever have been the achievements of the

Ministry of Science and Technology in the past  two

years, there have been some at least that have  not

been well publicised. If the achievements have been

modest,  it  is  quite  understandable  because   a

relatively  small allotment has been made  to  this

Ministry  in  the past budget. The total  allotment

covering  the 15 months was only $390,200, whereas

this  year  it  has been increased a  bit.  It  now

stands at $455,280.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly feel that if the Ministry is to

be  able,  to  quote the Minister for Finance,  "to

provide  for  effective  economic  and  statistical

evaluation  as, well as to determine the  needs  of

industry with greater precision", then the  present

staffing position, as outlined in the Estimates  of

Revenue  and  Expenditure  of  Singapore  for   the

financial  year  1st April, 1970,  to  31st  March,

1971, is far too inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under subhead 3005 for this Ministry, I

observe that $70,000 has been set aside, subject to

Treasury sanction, for the employment of staff  and

$1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



million  under  the Development Estimates  for  the

establishment of the Popular Science Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the setting up of this centre, but

with   $1.7  million  to  start  off  for  personal

emoluments  and  the  development  of  the  Science

Centre,  I  begin to wonder what kind of centre  it

will  turn out to be and how it is going to achieve

its  desired  objective of giving the  citizens  of

Singapore  a  better understanding of  what  modern

science  is  all  about,  although  ultimately  the

building will cost $5.2 million. Sir, we know  that

even  to  set  up a good laboratory in a  secondary

school costs much more than a million dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for Telok

Blangah



for  his very staunch support, and I certainly hope

the Minister for Finance will take heed of what he

has stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain to the House that the

concept of the Science Centre is being revised.  As

Members  will  know,  at the  moment  we  have  the

National  Museum, one part of which houses  stuffed

animals  and  the other part houses Chinese  beads,

coins,  porcelain and similar antiques. We recently

requested, through U.N.D.P., the assistance  of  an

expert,  Miss  Weston,  who  was  attached  to  the

Science Museum in Kensington, to advise us  on  the

setting  up of the Popular Science Centre. She  has

submitted  a report to the Government in which  she

has recommended a Science Centre, not quite similar

to  the one in London but one which will be able to

demonstrate   the   application   of   science   to

technology,  to  be  built in  Singapore.  We  have

recently  been looking into this problem  and  have

come  to  the conclusion that the proposed  Popular

Science  Centre should be more than that. Since  we

are going to spend a substantial sum of money - $5

million  and  perhaps  more -  we  ought  to  find,

firstly, a suitable site, and, secondly, to make up

our  minds  what the Popular Science Centre  should

be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is that the Popular Science

Centre should consist of two divisions. One

division will show the application of science to

technology, and the second division will show

exhibits relating to the life sciences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have another U.N.E.S.C.O. expert,

Mr Gardner, who came to Singapore to advise us on

how to modernise the National Museum. He has come

to the conclusion that the animals we are stuffing

in the National Museum are antiquated and out of

date. Most museums these days devote only a very

small corner of their building to taxonomy. So he

has suggested that perhaps it would be more

instructive if visitors to the Museum could be

shown the origin of life evolution, the relation

between man and his environment, that is the

ecological aspects of living matter, and perhaps

even school children will be able to relate how

biology is integrated with environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be having a discussion over this problem

with the Museum Advisory Committee and the Curator,

and will put up a recommendation to the Minister

for Finance and the Minister for Law and National

Development. I hope that the former will give me

more money and the latter will give me a site so

that we can have a Popular Science Centre.

Admittedly the present location of the National

Museum constricts its development and it is

impossible to put up any other building close by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the National Museum is now located

in an area of land that is, very expensive indeed,

and somehow I feel that it is not justifiable to go

along and make a claim to very expensive land which

can be used for more economical purposes. This,

briefly, then is the thinking of the proposed

Popular Science Centre. I hope that when the time

comes for claims to be made on the Finance Minister

and the Minister for Law and National Development,

I will have the staunch support of the Member for

Telok Blangah.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1001*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our economy has continued to

progress very well in the last year. New factories

are springing up all the time. New investments are

coming in at a constant pace. This has enabled the

various   sectors   in  our  economy   to   become

prosperous. It has also created a large number  of

employment opportunities. The Ministry of Finance,

of  course, has done a great deal of good work. As

a result of the prosperity in our economy, we have

been  able to overcome the adverse factors brought

about  by the impending withdrawal of the  British

forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, some people had certain worries and

reservations.  These have proved to be  unfounded.

The  reason why we are enjoying our prosperity now

is on account of two factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government has looked after all

aspects of economic development very well. It  has

laid   down   plans  and  has  provided  excellent

opportunities   and  favourable   conditions   for

foreign capitalists to come here and invest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our workers possess the aptitude and

ability to work hard. In the interest of the

country, they are willing to work hard. By doing

this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



they  help  industries to prosper.  Unfortunately,

their  wages are still rather low. That is why.  I

would  ask the Minister for Finance to try  to  do

something to raise their wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another point I would

like  to  make. Our external trade last  year  has

increased considerably. Total trade last year  has

exceeded  the  sum  of  $10,984  million.  It  has

increased  by  about $2,000 million over  that  of

1968. Although the figures show an improvement  in

our  economy,  generally  from  the  ship-building

industry, tourism and various other sectors of the

economy,  we  cannot  deny that  the  unfavourable

balance of trade is a weakness. Therefore, I would

like  the  Minister to find a solution to  improve

our  balance of trade. For example, we should send

more trade delegations to sell our goods overseas.

We  should not confine our trade only to  entrepot

trade but we should trade with many more countries

on a mutually beneficial basis.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has

given  a  warning that we must not  be  complacent

about our present situation. This is very true. We

must always remain alert. Because of this, we must

look  for  more  ways and means of increasing  our

income. We must explore new territories to  expand

our  economy further. For example, can we not look

into  the  question of starting fishery and  dairy

industries  in  our small island?  We  could  also

include  the  growing of orchids, or  perhaps  the

rearing of tropical fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that our tropical products are very

popular  and  welcome in Europe. In the  past  few

years the income from the export of these tropical

products   has   been  several  million   dollars.

Although  our  country is small, our  agricultural

industry  has  managed to earn about $200  million

per  year. So long as we continue to work hard  in

this  direction,  we will he able  to  expand  our

agricultural industry.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I agree with much of what the Member for

Sembawang has said. I would like wages to  rise  as

fast as possible, with the proviso, of course, that

this   will   not  have  any  adverse   effect   on

investment.  The  way  to do it  is  quite  simple.

First,  whatever work is being done now by  workers

should  be  done more efficiently and with  greater

skill;  to  the extent that productivity increases,

this  will  allow workers to get more pay  for  the

same  job. The second way in which we can  increase

wages  will be to develop those industries where  a

high  level of skill and a large number of  skilled

workers  are  required, such as in the  engineering

and  shipbuilding industries. Both  these  ways  of

raising wages should be pursued vigorously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is worried about unfavourable trade

balances.  I  do  not  know  whether  he  has  been

listening  in  regularly to Radio  Peking!  Because

Radio Peking is also worried about our unfavourable

trade  balance.  Within days of the publication  of

our annual statistics of imports and exports, which

invariably show a deficit on the balance of trade - this  can  be  anything from $500 million  to  $800

million - these figures are quoted by Radio  Peking

as evidence that we are being exploited, or heading

for  bankruptcy, or whatever it is.  Actually  this

large  unfavourable balance of trade does not worry

me in the least. For the balance of trade, that is,

the  goods  we  import compared with the  goods  we

export, is only one element in the total balance of

payments.   To   offset  this  unfavourable   trade

balance,   we  have  what  people  call   invisible

earnings,  i.e.,  earnings from shipping,  banking,

insurance services, the tourist trade, and  profits

made  on  the entrepot trade. Taken as a whole,  my

recollection  is that over the last four  years  we

have   had   a   favourable  balance   on   current

transactions,  taking visible and  invisible  items

together.  However, we should try,  of  course,  to

increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



our   exports,   not  so  much   to   redress   the

unfavourable balance of trade, because I think this

is  of such an order of magnitude that it cannot be

done,  but because it would mean more income,  more

employment, and more prosperity for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the breeding of tropical fish and the

growing  of  orchids, I am all with the Member  for

Sembawang  provided he does not ask my Ministry  to

do  anything about it. It is the responsibility  of

my    colleague,   the   Minister   for    National

Development. The Agricultural Research  Station  in

Sembawang,  which is in the Member's  constituency,

is doing a lot of work in breeding tropical fish. I

believe  they  have  discovered  a  way  of  making

Japanese  carp spawn in the tropics.  This  is  the

first time it is being done. In addition to orchids

and  tropical  fish, I may say that  we  are  doing

quite  a lucrative business in crocodiles. We  rear

crocodiles  not  only in farms in the  countryside,

but I am told in the city itself. However, lately I

read  in  the newspapers that some crocodiles  have

escaped, and I hope this will not prove a menace to

our   citizens   in   future,  This   business   of

crocodiles, tropical fish and orchids has,  as  the

Member said, a great prospect for growth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister's reply is not too

satisfactory. First, about the imbalance of  trade,

he  says  that I am influenced by Radio  Peking.  I

would  like  to inform him that I never  listen  to

Radio  Peking. I have raised this question  because

there  is  really a weakness in our trade.  If  our

trade balance gets worse, it is of concern to us. I

think the Minister will agree with me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in respect of other fields of

development,  I  think  we  should  engage   in   a

diversification  of our economy in  order  to  earn

more for our country. I think the Minister will, of

course, carry out these projects,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the progress of modern industrialisation in

the Republic deserves high admiration. Almost every

aspect  is  being looked after, such  as  technical

facilities, training, research, both in large-  and

medium-scale  industries.  Needless  to  say,  with

these modern industrial facilities production  from

these  industries will be speeded  up  and  a  vast

consumption  at  home and abroad is expected.  Sir,

for  export we have agencies like Intraco  and  the

many  missions abroad to look after sales.  But  at

home I think we have not done enough. I would like

to  suggest  that we encourage more  citizens,  who

have  a  small capital, to start cottage industries

or  backyard industries in order to act as  feeders

to  the manufactures of the big industries. I would

also  like  to  say that every assistance  must  be

given to them. To do this, I think we must cut  red

tape  to the minimum. For example, it I were living

in  a kampong or in a residential area and if I had

a  little  money to buy simple machinery driven  by

electricity,  I  would start to produce  something.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is high time that the Government

should  readjust its policy, so that the small  man

with a small capital can earn a decent living.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually I have great sympathy for what the

Member for Changi has said - sympathy for the small

man who is arrested by the Chief Building Surveyor,

the Fire Brigade, the Labour Ministry inspectors of

machinery, and so on. Of course, it is not possible

for  my Ministry to connive at breaking the law.  I

can only hope that this sturdy breed of resourceful

people  will  survive  the  persecution  of   these

bureaucrats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I should also say we should

recognise  that  what  the  Member  said  has  some

economic  sense. If we could have a large  base  of

small industries which can provide services to  the

larger manufacturing units, we would have given our

manufacturing   sector  additional   strength   and

flexibility which is a distinct advantage over  the

rather highly organised manufacturing industries of

the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the case of the Japanese industry.

You  have  the industrial giants, Mitsubishi,  Fuji

Steel,  and  so  on. Supporting the  production  of

these large-scale manufacturers, you have a host of

small-scale   units  virtually   run   as   cottage

industries. These cottage industries which are  run

with  very  low  overhead  costs,  have  tremendous

flexibility  because  they  can  switch  from   one

product  to another without a lot of retooling.  In

many  instances they club together  to  form  small

industrial co-operatives. A member of the  Japanese

Diet  who belongs to the Socialist Party (I do  not

know which of the Socialist Parties he belongs  to,

but  he belongs to one of them) came here and  said

that  if  we wanted to know more about how Japanese

cottage   industries,  often  run  on  co-operative

principles, are organised, he would be glad to help

us.  I  certainly  intend to avail  myself  of  his

offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subject actually may be quite relevant to us

in  the  immediate  future, because  urban  renewal

intends to knock



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



out   the   small  machine  shops  in   the   Horne

Road/French Road/Lavender Street area.  The  Urban

Renewal  Department  think that  these  are  small

motor-car   repairers,  and  they  classify   this

industry as a "dirty" industry. Actually  this  is

the  heart of our ship-repairing industry.  If  we

destroy  this  small industrial sector,  then  the

bigger  dockyards,  like  the  Port  of  Singapore

Authority,  the Sembawang Shipyard, or the  Jurong

Shipyard,  will find a very valuable and important

source  of  support knocked off from  under  their

feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one effective way whereby we can

strengthen  the  industrial  sector,   by   giving

facilities  to small-scale production units  which

still  have a very valuable part to play in  modern

industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I wish the Minister to inform this House whether,

in  the urban renewal scheme, the Government  will

demarcate a zone, not in Sembawang, of course, but

in  Changi,  where small machine shops or  cottage

industries can be set up in that area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, that is precisely what the Government is

planning  to  do.  There is a  piece  of  land  in

Thomson  around the old race track which  somebody

has  in  mind for this purpose. But I  have  grave

doubts whether this is the most suitable site.  My

Ministry  and the Ministry of National Development

are working jointly on this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In spite of this explanation, I still have my

doubts whether the site will be at Thomson or  at Changi.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you wish to withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, beg to move,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand there are 36 banks operating in

the Republic, of which 11 are locally incorporated

and  25 are incorporated outside the Republic. Can

the  Minister inform the House what are the  total

deposits  of  the banks incorporated  outside  the

Republic but are operating in Singapore,  and  the

deposits of locally incorporated banks for the last

ten years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, no new commercial bank licences

have been issued for the last ten years. Can the

Minister inform the House how many applications

have been submitted and how



many  foreign  banks  have  asked  permission   to

operate in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he also tell us what are the regulations

governing  the  granting of  licences  to  existing

banks,   either  foreign  incorporated  or  locally

incorporated, to set up branches in the Republic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last question is this. Do the profits made by

foreign  incorporated banks remain in Singapore  or

are they remitted to their parent bodies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the sentiments which

have  just  been  expressed by  my  colleague,  the

Member  for Changi. But being the co-mover of  this

amendment, I seek somewhat different answers. As  I

see  it,  we have in Singapore a banking structure.

In  the Estimates of Expenditure for 1969-70, there

is  a token provision of $10 for a Commissioner  of

Banking. In the Estimates of Expenditure for  1970-71,  there  is also a token provision  of  $10.  In

other  words,  is there a proper man to  fill  this

post full-time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Changi, has inquired

just   now  how  much  deposits  both  the  locally

incorporated  banks and those incorporated  outside

Singapore  have got from the people  of  Singapore.

The  post  of  Commissioner of Banking  is  a  very

important  one  and I do not think  that  this  $10

token  vote  is  a  sufficient guarantee  that  the

office will be well run. Can the Minister enlighten

us on the points which I have just raised?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The capital of locally incorporated banks - that

is,  capital  and  not deposits - comes  to  $204.8

million. The capital of foreign incorporated  banks

in   their  respective  headquarters  adds  up   to

$3,363.9  million, as far as we  can  ascertain.  I

will  not  guarantee the accuracy  of  this  latter

figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the licensing of new banks, my policy

is  to decline all applications because I think  we

already  have  too  many banks.  However,  in  very

exceptional cases we may allow new licences.  I  am

allowing   only  one  new  foreign   bank   to   be

established - it is a German bank ---, and this  is

because   of   new   interest   shown   by   German

industrialists   to   set  up   establishments   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the remittances of profits, foreign

incorporated banks are free to remit their  profits

if  they want to or to plough them back into  their

Singapore  business if they so desire. We  are  not

restricting the remittances of profits. It will  be

wrong to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol wants to know whether the

banking  staff  are qualified. The answer  is  yes,

they  are qualified. They are being trained  by  an

expert sent by the International Monetary Fund.  An

inspectorate  is being built up slowly  because  we

want   people   with   proper  qualifications   and

capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have provided a token sum for the Commissioner

of  Banking  because  he is the  same  man  as  the

Commissioner for Finance Companies. It is the  same

person  occupying two posts and doing two jobs.  In

fact,  he is doing work very much of the same  type

and  using the same staff. This token provision  is

just a matter of financial procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the

Minister's attention to the salary code.  The  post

of  Commissioner of Banking is a Grade E  post  and

the post of Commissioner for Finance Companies is a

Grade G post. Their salary codes are different.  So

with one man running two jobs, are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



the two departments safe and are they well run?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> They are quite safe and they are quite well run.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not very happy with those

foreign incorporated banks which earn their profits

in  Singapore and then are at liberty to send  them

out  wherever they wish. If that is the  case,  the

locally  incorporated banks should be looked  after

by  our  Government since they stay here.  Can  the

Minister  tell  us what contribution  the  foreign

incorporated banks make towards Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are an international financial centre. If we

have a policy of keeping out foreign banks and  not

allowing  enterprises to remit  profits,  then  you

will  find that our position as a financial  centre

will  slowly  shrivel. We may lose  a  few  million

dollars  when these people send back their profits,

but  in  return for this liberal policy of allowing

remittances of profits we get hundreds of  millions

of  dollars  of  new investments. So,  on  balance,

there  is no doubt that this liberal policy is  the

right one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the explanation, I beg leave to

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1461*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the, names of Mr N. Govindasamy and Mr J. F. Conceicao)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the post under this subhead is

"Higher   Executive  Officer".  I  understand   the

Government  has  made  provision  for   the   Staff

Training  Centre in order to train public  officers

who  have  just  been recruited  into  the  various

Government  departments. All the new recruits  will

he  trained in the Staff Training Centre; thus this

post  of Higher Executive Officer is provided  for.

At the Staff Training Centre these trainees will be

taught how to go about their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



business  and  do their job well.  But  it  is  not

enough to train them how to carry out their routine

work. They should receive some training in courtesy

and  the  correct  attitude to  adopt  towards  the

public. After all, Government is spending money  on

this Centre and on this post. Mr Speaker, Sir, you

will  agree  with  me  that, at  the  moment,  many

Government officers are behaving in the same manner

as  they  did before the P.A.P. first launched  its

revolutionary  campaign of trying to correct  their

attitude  and  behaviour.  I  will  compare   their

attitude  now with that obtaining some  years  ago.

There  is a marked difference. We all know that  in

October  last  year  there was  a  forum  conducted

jointly   by   the   People's  Association,   Radio

Singapore and another organisation. It was a  forum

in  which  the participants discussed  whether  the

attitude and behaviour of Government servants  were

satisfactory or not. During the debate  both  sides

gave  their  views to support their  arguments  and

there  were  pros  and cons. But  in  the  end  the

decision   was   in  favour  of  the   side   whose

proposition was that the attitude and behaviour  of

Government servants were not satisfactory.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Staff Training Centre should not just

concentrate on training the staff on how  to  carry

out  their  work.  The Centre should  also  conduct

courses on the proper attitude and behaviour to  be

adopted  because there have been complaints against

civil  servants. Some people complained to me  that

Government officers in certain departments  behaved

badly. I visited these offices myself. Sir, I  went

there in disguise. I put on dark glasses and wore a

modern  dress. I went into a post office  which  is

frequented  by  residents in the area,  as  it  was

reported  to me that the staff there were arrogant.

I  went  to a section in the post office which  did

not  sell stamps and I purposely said that I wanted

to  buy stamps. The person in charge spoke to me in

English. He said, "Why do you come to this  section

to buy stamps? You had better clear off."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



So I went off. This proved that the complaints made

by  the  residents were not false. They  were  well

substantiated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another occasion, I personally went to a

Government department as I wanted to inquire  about

a  certain  matter. When I wanted to  go  into  the

office,  a  person  asked me in Hokkien,  "Who  are

you?" I replied, "I am a Singaporean." I also told

that  person  that I was Chan Choy Siong.  Then  he

realised   who   I   was.  His   attitude   changed

immediately and he treated me differently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure there are other departments where the

staff  behave  in this way. There  have  been  many

recent  cases of residents being evicted under  the

urban  renewal  scheme. These people  went  to  the

department  concerned in the Ministry  of  National

Development. They wasted their time and energy  and

incurred expenses by going there. We should realise

that  we  are  Singapore citizens. We  should  also

realise   that   different  races  have   different

characteristics.  The  Indians   have   their   own

traditions and characteristics. The Chinese and the

Malays    have    their    own    traditions    and

characteristics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has mentioned that some

people  were  evicted just before the  Chinese  New

Year.  They  had been staying in their  houses  for

more  than three years. The staff of the department

concerned  should  have chosen a  more  appropriate

time  to  evict these people so that they were  not

inconvenienced. This shows that there is no  proper

understanding of the characteristics of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is about women whose husbands

were  members  of the defence forces and  who  were

killed during the Japanese occupation. These  women

are  receiving allowances from the Government.  But

the  department concerned has changed the procedure

of  paying  this  allowance. These  women  used  to

collect  their  allowance from  an  office  on  the

second  floor of Fullerton Building. But five  days

before  the  Chinese New Year, they collected  only

$20  each  and were told to go to the  Ministry  of

Interior and Defence to get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



the  balance. They were also told that  the  M.I.D.

would  inform them where to get their allowance  in

future.  The Minister for Finance should look  into

this  matter. During Chinese New Year,  traffic  is

very  heavy and it will take about half an hour  or

more  to get to the M.I.D. If these women are late,

then no consideration will be given to them and the

allowance  will  not  be paid to  them.  From  this

example, we can see that the officers concerned did

all  this  purposely. They knew very well that  the

Chinese New Year was coming. Why should they choose

such a time to inconvenience our people? They might

well  say that this was something which was routine

and  that  they  did  not have to  oblige.  If  the

allowance was to be reduced, they should have  done

so  sometime before or after the Chinese New  Year.

Why should the allowance be reduced just before the

Chinese  New  Year? I am saying this  so  that  the

Minister  for  Finance  and  the  Government   will

realise  that there are certain misgivings  in  the

minds  of  the people. They want to know  what  has

happened  to the P.A.P. Government which  has  been

boasting  that it is an efficient and incorruptible

government.  We  should therefore re-establish  our

image.  With  this provision, I hope we  can  again

brainwash the public servants.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of last year, the

Political   Study  Centre,  which  was   performing

somewhat useful functions in orientating the  minds

of  the  civil servants in Divisions I and II,  was

closed  down.  Perhaps  its  importance  had   been

reduced  as a result of the past good services,  or

perhaps  the new generation of civil servants  does

not require any political orientation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the functions of the Staff

Training Centre are rather vague. I begin to wonder

what  kind of staff training can be given  by  this

Centre  when  it is manned by just one H.E.O.,  one

Executive Officer and one general clerk.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, Sir, the civil servants of

Singapore  deserve praise for their  dedication  to

duty  and  their willingness to work  hard.  It  is

generally  accepted that we have one  of  the  best

civil  services  in this region. Our  officers  are

known to be honest, competent and efficient. I have

not  had any of the experiences that the Member for

Delta  has.  But complaints have quite  often  been

heard  of  a  few  Government and  statutory  board

officials for being discourteous when dealing  with

the  public. I admit that dealing with  the  public

especially when one is hard pressed for time can be

most  exasperating  and provocating.  Dealing  with

ordinary  people  who  are  not  well  versed  with

legislation  or government policy and procedure  is

bound  to test the patience of minor officials  who

come  in  contact  with  the  public,  unless  they

possess  special  talent and aptitude  for  dealing

with  the public. Such talent and aptitude may  not

be  possessed  by  all. But the  situation  can  be

remedied  by having an effective training programme

for those Government or public officers who come in

frequent  contact  with the public  in  departments

such  as  Immigration, Work Permit Office, National

Registration,   Citizenship,   the   Housing    and

Development Board, the Public Utilities Board, post

offices and other offices where ugly and unpleasant

situations  may  arise through misunderstanding  or

failure of communication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the politeness and tactfulness which we

associated with the Government in relation  to  the

public about ten years ago when the People's Action

Party came to power has now become less noticeable.

I  am  not advocating for one moment that we return

to  the  methods  used by the  Government  then  to

instil  fear  in Government employees in  order  to

exact co-operation and courtesy from such officials

when  dealing with the public. But I do advocate  a

systematic training programme for officials  to  be

taught  the need for courtesy in dealing  with  the

public  in  so  far as it is relevant  to  whatever

decisions  they have to make. It is the  invariable

practice in Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



departments for officers to give a curt refusal  to

requests  or inquiries from the public without  any

further  explanation, thus leaving the  members  of

the  public  baffled  and in the  dark.  The  Staff

Training  Centre  cannot, I  feel,  do  any  useful

training  with  only  three officials  of  clerical

grade.  Either  we  have  a proper  Staff  Training

Centre with the full complement of staff or none at

all.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Member for Telok

Blangah,  I rise to seek further information  about

the  Staff Training Centre. I would like to  ask  - What are the functions of the Centre? What sort  of

training  schemes  has it organised?  Who  are  the

staff  training instructors? - information of  that

sort.  I  know there are various examinations  that

civil   servants  have  to  take.   The   Permanent

Examinations Board of the Public Service Commission

conducts  a  number of examinations.  For  example,

there are examinations in law - the various aspects

of  it  -  general  conditions of  service,  office

procedure,  financial procedure and so on.  What  I

would  like to ask is what facilities are available

for  civil  servants  who are preparing  for  these

examinations? It seems to me that it is fair  that,

if  we wish our civil servants to prepare for these

examinations, courses should be run to help them to

take these examinations.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would imagine that availability of

books  and  reading material would be important.  I

notice that there is provision for periodicals  and

books  under  "Other Charges, Annually  Recurrent",

but perhaps that is inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after having listened to the Member for

Delta  and to the Member for Telok Blangah, perhaps

one of the courses that could be provided would  be

that relating to the public relations aspect of the

work of civil servants.

Blangah  has not had the experience of encountering

rudeness from certain sections of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



the  civil  service,  I  stand  together  with   my

colleague, the Member for Delta, in her complaints.

Certainly I think the Staff Training Centre is  far

from  adequate in this respect. There is  no  doubt

about  it.  The  staffing there may be  small,  but

there  may be other instructors coming in  between,

but  what  we  must not forget is this question  of

human   relationship.  Being  in  public   service,

whether in the statutory boards or elsewhere, those

at  the  counter invariably will be under a certain

amount of strain in having to deal with members  of

the  public.  Members of the public come  from  all

walks of life. In other words, tact, politeness and

courtesy  must always be uppermost in the minds  of

officers  who have to deal with them daily.  I  can

draw   from   my  own  experience   with   my   own

constituents.  Just to illustrate this  --  in  the

Electricity  Department  of  the  Public  Utilities

Board,  there  is  a counter for "Applications  for

Transfers", the words of which are written  in  the

English language. Two persons went there. They  did

not  know  where else to go. They had to make  some

inquiries. It so happened that at about  this  time

the officer handling this matter was about to close

shop.  However, since names are invariably  wrongly

filled  in,  one  of them went to this  person  who

rudely  told him, "Look, your name is not the  same

as  that in the identity card. Get lost and do  not

waste my time!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got this complaint, I, together with the

two men concerned, went to the P.U.B. the following

morning.  I asked these two men whether they  could

recognise  the officer who was rude  to  them,  and

they  said, "Here he is," pointing him  out.  So  I

asked  the officer, "Do you remember meeting  these

two  persons?"  He kept on denying  and  denying.

Then  I  told him I was so and so, and that  I  was

there  to  find out what had happened. I  told  him

that I was not going there to make a charge against

him   or   anybody.  In  the  end,  he  reluctantly

admitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not the only case of this nature. In

the hospitals, M.P.s also get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



such problems. I had an experience myself. I quoted

these two examples to show that during the last few

years  there have been clear signs of deterioration

in  the conduct of some of our civil servants. I am

not saying that all of them are discourteous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to a point which concerns the

Ministry  of Health - I am happy that the  Minister

for   Health   is   here.  One  of   my   Citizens'

Consultative  Committee  members  suddenly  had   a

stroke  in  town and he was rushed to  the  General

Hospital.  I went there when I got the news.  First

of  all, I found out to which ward this person  was

admitted,  and  I went to the ward, though  I  knew

that it was before Visiting Hours' time. I went  up

to the staff nurse and asked, "How is the condition

of  this  man?  I am so and so and he is  connected

with  my  constituency  and  the  welfare  of   the

constituents."  She  could not  even  care  to  say

anything. She just went about her work. In the  end

I said, "Look, can you answer this simple question?

Do  you  not know the condition of this  man?"  She

gave an irrelevant answer, and I said, "Look, I did

not  ask  you that yet. I am asking you  about  the

condition  of the man, because I am concerned  with

his  condition. If he had conked off, I would  have

lost   a  very  important  man  in  my  area.  What

happened?"  She just went about her  work.  I  then

said,  "All  right,  I will see your  Sister."  She

replied,  "Go and see the Sister if you  want  to."

That  sort  of  attitude, Sir, is  very  bad.  This

discourteous attitude is slowly creeping back  into

the civil service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Was the complaint reported?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, Sir, a complaint was immediately made - this

is  just  for  the information of the Minister.  No

doubt he was not informed of it, because I felt  it

was   a   frivolous   matter.  It   was,   however,

immediately  attended  to by  the  Matron  and  the

Acting  Secretary of the Hospital. In the  end  the

Medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



Superintendent rang me up and I said, "Forget about

filing  the complaint." I know very well  the  good

work  done  by  the  nursing staff  and  the  other

members  of  the hospital. They are  all  the  time

under  heavy  strain, and human  beings  are  human

beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here today debating the attitude of our

civil  servants  under this  topic.  Sir,  I  would

strongly urge the Finance Minister kindly  to  take

note of what we Back-benchers have been facing  and

seek  remedial measures, not those we took in 1959,

but  somewhat stern measures which would not  bring

about a further deterioration in the conduct of the

civil service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members that "guillotine" time for

this  Head is 4.40 p.m, and we are now only on  the

fourth  amendment,  There  are  fifteen  amendments

under this particular Head.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, obviously the Back-benchers

feel  very  strongly on the subject of courtesy  of

our  civil servants. I take the point. I  am  quite

prepared   to  accept  that  there   has   been   a

deterioration of standards in certain  sections  of

the  civil service, and this is not a matter  which

the  Ministers will accept with equanimity. I shall

see  what  can  be  done  to improve  standards  of

courtesy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It may be necessary to put a few heads on the

chopping block. The nature of human beings is  such

that  until  they  see  quite clearly  demonstrated

beyond all doubt that we mean business, we will get

this  kind of slackness creeping back. It will help

to  improve the standard of courtesy if we run some

kind of training courses for the civil servants. In

fact, I am having discussions with the Chairman  of

the Public Service Commission and Mr Devan Nair to

see  which  sectors of the civil service should  go

through  some kind of residential training  course,

and,  what  should be the content of  the  training

courses.  I  accept the proposition that  something

pretty  stern and energetic should be done, and  it

will be done.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Political Study Centre and the

Permanent  Examinations Board, we are  now  at  the

crossroads. As the old Political Study  Centre  has

served  its  purpose, we need something to  replace

it.  To be quite candid, the Permanent Examinations

Board  is  something of a mystery to me.  Some  ten

years  ago,  I tried to introduce some  reforms  in

this rather Byzantine institution. I got the Member

for  Alexandra - at least he is now the Member  for

Alexandra   -   as  a  member  of   the   Permanent

Examinations Board; my colleague, the Minister  for

Health, was also a member. But their membership  of

this  august institution did not make the slightest

difference to proceedings. Quite frankly, I believe

that   the  courses  of  training  prescribed   are

irrelevant, They are totally useless for  efficient

civil  service  administration. I  have  asked  the

British  High Commission to send a Treasury  expert

to  have  a  look  at our training system  and  see

whether   we  cannot  introduce  twentieth  century

systems  in  our  civil service  training,  and  no

doubt,  in due course of time, we will get results.

More than that I do not think I need say, except to

assure Back-benchers, that we will do something  to

improve the standards of our civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the salary code of this post of

Director  of the new Industry Department, it  leads

me  to  the  conclusion that this is  an  important

department,  as  the name implies. It  is  observed

that   this  new  department  will  incur  a  total

expenditure of $239,000 for the next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



financial  year.  Sir, my impression  of  this  new

department is that it will duplicate the  functions

of  the  Economic  Development  Division  or  the

Government's   agency,  the  Economic   Development

Board.  The latter, especially, has all the  credit

to  itself for the successful implementation of the

industrial programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question for the Minister concerned is

this  - what are the purposes of the setting up  of

this  new  department?  Will  he  amplify  on  this

subject for the benefit of Members?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would like to explain to the Member for

Mountbatten the difference of functions between the

Economic  Development Board and  the  new  Industry

Department of the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to attract industries into Singapore, we

have  passed several laws giving incentives by  way

of tax relief, licensing industries, tariffs and so

on.  These are functions exercised by the Ministry.

After  processing, the applications are sent to  me

for decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board is purely a

promotion  agency,  which is to sell  Singapore  to

foreign investors and to sell foreign investors  to

me.  Naturally  they will give  the  most  euphoric

account  of  any proposition which  they  get  from

overseas, and naturally they will sell Singapore in

the  most glowing terms to foreign investors.  That

is the nature of their work.



<br><br>4.15p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But between the industrial promotion people and

me, there is need for a rational assessment of what

the  Economic  Development Board sends  up  to  me.

Quite often I have to do this assessment myself. Of

course,  if  you have to read a memorandum  running

to, say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



20  pages  in  single spacing, this  can  be  quite

tiresome, quite apart from the fact that I  do  not

have  the  time  to check on the myriads  of  facts

included  in  the  memorandum.  Therefore,  it   is

necessary  for  a  body  of  officials  to   assess

E.D.B.'s  proposals and to submit their  assessment

to  me,  so  that  I  can get a fair  and  balanced

account   of   whether   the  particular   projects

recommended by the E.D.B. have, in fact, the merits

which they claim. This is to be fair to the E.D.B.,

to  be fair to the foreign investor, and to be fair

to the economy of Singapore. That is the reason why

this new department is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, of course, this work is already being

done in the Ministry, but on a rather ad hoc basis.

We  have  quite a number of chemical  engineers  as

well  as  mechanical engineers, and they are  doing

this  kind  of  assessment. But  I  would  like  to

formalise  the  structure of  work  into  a  proper

department, and this is what this new subhead seeks

to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

2007



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will observe that there is already an

item of expenditure called "Entertainment Expenses"

under   the  grouping,  "Other  Charges,   Annually

Recurrent" in the estimates of every Ministry  and,

in   some  cases,  important  departments  in   the

Ministry. This annual provision varies from $12,000

for  the Prime Minister's Office to $1,800 for  the

Public Works Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is now a new item called

"Entertainment Expenses for Permanent Secretary" to

be  found  in  the  same grouping.  This  provision

varies  from $1,200 for the Permanent Secretary  in

the  Ministry  of  Culture to $5,400  for  the  two

Permanent  Secretaries in the Ministry of  Interior

and Defence. Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



have  the  breakdown figures of these two items  of

entertainment expenses, but I do not intend to take

up   the   time   of   the  Committee   of   Supply

unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe some of us might have read a report in

bold  headlines in an afternoon newspaper some days

ago,  that  it cost the Government $2  million  per

year in clothing and entertainment. Sir, on the one

hand,  we  are asking our common workers  to  forgo

their claims for fringe benefits, and, on the other

hand,  we are pampering the top civil servants  too

much  -  if  I  may  be allowed  to  use  the  word

"pampering".  But that is not quite  my  point.  My

point  is  on the necessity of providing  this  new

vote  specifically  for Permanent  Secretaries.  If

indeed the Permanent Secretaries, in the course  of

their   duty,   are   called  upon   to   entertain

distinguished  officials  from  abroad,   such   an

expenditure  can be charged against the appropriate

vote   already  provided  for  the  Ministry.   The

alternative, therefore, is to increase the vote  to

meet the additional expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister for Finance would like to

enlighten  the  House on why  it  is  necessary  to

provide this new vote in the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think my colleague, the

Member for Mountbatten, has covered this topic very

well and leaves me with little area to cover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a new expenditure that will

henceforth  appear in the Estimates. For  how  long

this item will appear I do not know, because it  is

being  charged under the grouping, "Other  Charges,

Annually Recurrent". Under this vote, all Permanent

Secretaries will be given entertainment expenses. I

do not know whether or not this is an expense to be

incurred  in the course of their duties, as  it  is

just  charged  to "Entertainment Expenses".  But  I

would  like  to  know how much this will  cost  the

taxpayer  each year. No doubt in some  quarters  it

has  been speculated to be $2 million, but I do not

think so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this: is it right or not to give

Permanent     Secretaries    such     entertainment

allowances? Invariably we are going to  follow  the

practice  in commercial firms, where top executives

enjoy  certain perks, i.e., expense accounts,  etc.

But  this  item  is  an expenditure  on  the  civil

service,   in  which  every  cent  to  be  expended

requires  the  sanction  of  Parliament.  In  other

words,  Government should at all times  be  on  the

alert  to  see  that monies requiring  Parliament's

blessing are wisely and worthily spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Finance will care to

comment these remarks.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this new practice of allowing Permanent

Secretaries an entertainment vote is in  accordance

with  the  recommendations of the  Harvey  Salaries

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me dispose of this $2 million

nonsense on entertainment. I do ask Members not  to

give  too  much credence to what they read  in  the

local  newspapers. Most of the $2  million  is  for

uniforms of the Police and the Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to these entertainment expenses, there are

two  points.  One is that there is an entertainment

allowance given to a person; and whether he  spends

it  or  not,  that  is his business.  This  is  the

practice   in   some   institutions   or   business

companies.  The  other is the  entertainment  vote.

Here,  you  can only make use of the money  if  you

produce the vouchers for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, would it be a waste of money? In my opinion,

no.  In  my  view,  our Permanent  Secretaries  are

grossly  underpaid in relation to the  duties  they

perform  and in relation to the pay that  they  can

get  in  the  private sector. A managing  director,

bearing  a  quarter  of the responsibilities  of  a

Permanent Secretary of a large Ministry, gets  four

times his pay. And if we grudge the top echelons of

our civil service their minor perks, then I fear we

have  to put up with mediocrities - people who  are

less  dependable possibly - and the end result will

be a greater waste than this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



relatively small sum that we are setting aside  for

the entertainment vote for Permanent Secretaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I am not suggesting that we should abolish

this   new  item  of  expenditure  altogether.   My

suggestion  is  to  charge this  item  against  the

original vote of "Entertainment Expenses", which is

already  provided. In this way we will  not  create

the impression among the general public that we are

giving favourable treatment to top civil servants.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2093.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleagues here have spoken about the

inefficiency of civil servants, and so on, but what

I  have  to  say  about the civil service  concerns

"Clothing  for  Office Boys and Others  in  various

Departments".  "Office Boys and Others  in  various

Departments"  here means not only office  boys  but

the  many  other grades of uniformed civil servants

in  the  many Government departments, in  hospitals

and  so  on.  At present the uniforms are  made  of

thick  cotton material, which is warm to  wear  and

difficult  to  iron. And even when the  uniform  is

properly ironed, it does not look smart. There  are

now  other  types  of clothing material  available,

which  are thinner and therefore cooler,  and  they

also  look  smarter.  I therefore  suggest  to  the

Minister  to  look into this matter,  so  that  our

office  boys  and  uniformed  officers  will   look

smarter - without having to increase the cost.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think this is an excellent proposal. There

is  in  existence  in  the  Government  service   a

committee called the Uniforms Committee. I  do  not

know how often they







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



sit, or when was the last time they considered this

matter.  But in a big bureaucracy there is inertia.

Once  you  decide  on  a  particular  material  for

uniforms,  it  goes  on  ad infinitum,  until  some

enterprising  Member of Parliament draws  attention

to  the need for a change. I will certainly get the

Uniforms   Committee  to  consider   the   Member's

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the Conference on the proposal for a Regional

Institute of Higher Education and Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the second Council meeting of the South-east

Asia Fisheries Development Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the 25th E.C.A.F.E. Session in Singapore, which

cost us quite a tidy packet; about $156,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the first Preparatory Meeting on the Asian

Handicraft Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the I.L.O. Asian Regional Seminar on Trade

Union Research and Documentation Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) the A.S.E.A.N. Committee Meeting on

Transportation.

has just been completed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) the Fourth Asian Congress on Obstetrics and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) the Commission of Inquiry on Statistical

Activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) the Inter-Regional Seminar on Workers'

that  common  standards can be applied.  Otherwise,

you  may  find that my colleague, the Minister  for

Science  and  Technology, who does not  think  that

financial  matters are important,  may  host  these

conferences on a more lavish scale. You might  have

competition among Ministers as to who is  the  most

generous in ministerial meetings.

with  the addition of "General" in subhead  2104,

"Overseas  Service Aid Scheme" in  subhead  2105,

and  "Other  Overseas Officers" in subhead  2106.

More  than half a million dollars is involved  in

these  subheads. I wish to seek elucidation  from

the  Finance  Minister as to what these  expenses

are for, and for whom they are to be used.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The sum under subhead 2104 is to pay for

passages  and  expenses  incurred  by  our  civil

servants,  Ministers,  Parliamentary  Secretaries

and  others  who  go on overseas conferences.  To

ensure  that there is uniformity of standard  and

no  undue waste, all such proposals are vetted by

the Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for subhead 2105 is to pay for

officers enrolled under the Overseas Service  Aid

Scheme.  This  is  an  arrangement  whereby   the

British Government seconds some staff from  their

departments   to   Singapore,   and   meets   the

additional cost by way of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

pays  the  local salaries and passages  for  such

officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision under subhead 2106 is to pay the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, there are two separate types of allowances

under  these two subheads. Under subhead 2006 there

is  "Compassionate  Allowances" and  under  subhead

2007  there  is  "Singapore  Allowances".  Can  the

Minister  clarify  what these two  allowances  are?

With  regard to "Compassionate Allowances",  may  I

know what they are for and who gets them?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, compassionate allowances are paid to civil

servants who suffer injuries or death in the course

of their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, there was a victim of civil

disturbances in 1950. He sustained injuries and  he

drew  this  allowance. Widows who receive  a  basic

pension  below the minimum rate of $180  per  month

under  the  Widows and Orphans Pension Scheme  also

receive  these  allowances which are  made  on  compassionate  grounds. There are only a small  number

of people receiving such allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore allowances are paid to pensioners

who are resident in Singapore and receive a pension

of  $331 per month or less if they have dependants,

or   $257  per  month  or  less  if  they  have  no

dependants. This is a throw-back to the  past  when

civil  servants seem to have had the cost-of-living

allowances as well as the Singapore allowances.  At

that  time,  when  these people retired,  if  their

pension was below a certain level, they drew  these

allowances in addition to their pension.  You  will

find that the cost of living allowances on pensions

are provided for under subhead 2003. They belong to

the same family of allowances.

men, women officers in the civil service received a

marriage gratuity when they got married. But  after

the  1st of March, 1962, when they were all  placed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved with the intention

of eliciting information from the Minister

concerned whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



he   is  aware  that  there  are  other  clubs  and

organisations  catering  for  the  needs  of  civil

servants which also deserve assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am all for charity and assistance for

deserving  organisations. Though this sum allocated

for the Singapore Civil Service Association is only

$200  per month, it is necessary for us to see that

it  is  well spent. My fear is that the Association

will  not utilise such allocation to expand  itself

to  serve the deserving civil servants for whom  it

is  supposed to cater. As the Association functions

today,  it caters only for a small group  of  civil

servants   who   are   regular   patrons   of   the

Association. The vast majority of civil servants do

not  even  know of the existence of the Association

and   the   facilities  offered  by  it.  I   feel,

therefore,  that  the Minister in  charge  of  such

associations should take a keener interest in  this

Association and other clubs catering for the  needs

of  our civil servants in order to ensure the wider

participation of Government employees in sports and

other  recreational  activities.  It  may  also  be

necessary to extend token grants to various  sports

and recreational clubs of other departments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, until the Member for Telok Blangah raised

this  question, I too did not know of the existence

of  this  Association. However,  like  all  matters

connected  with  the civil service, this  provision

has  a  history. In this instance, it goes back  to

before World War II. Before World War II, there was

a  canteen  in  Empress Place and this  Association

apparently was either the owner or the landlord  of

this  canteen and it received from the hawkers,  or

whoever operated there, an income of $200 a  month.

This  canteen  was demolished and  the  Association

lost  this income. The Government, therefore, makes

up   for  this  loss  of  income.  I  assume   that

Government took over the land where the canteen was

situated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Association is well run or not and

whether  it  deserves  this sum  -  these  are  not

matters for me to express an opinion on. But  since

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



is  related  to some loss of income,  it  does  not

follow   that   other  associations   -   such   as

associations   of   doctors,   clerks,    telephone

operators  or  office boys - are  entitled  to  any

allowance from Government.

produce  practical results, a Productivity Code  of

Practice  was also drawn up. The Productivity  Code

of   Practice   subscribed  to  by  the   Singapore

Employers Federation and the National Trades  Union

Congress  provides for the establishment  of  joint

Productivity  Consultative Councils  in  industrial

establishments employing more than 50 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was felt that the implementation of this

Productivity   Code   of  Practice   will   require

considerable   promotional  effort   as   well   as

technical assistance, especially in the application

of  work study, quality control, cost analysis  and

other modern industrial engineering techniques.  To

assist  in  these purposes, the Singapore  National

Productivity Centre with an advisory board on which

workers, employers and the Government are  equally

represented was established. Incidentally, Sir, the

National  Productivity Centre in Singapore  is  the

only productivity organisation in this region which

was   established  as  a  result  of  trade   union

initiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the National Productivity

Centre,  it  has  made some, but  not  substantial,

achievements in its promotional effort  of  setting

up  Joint Productivity Consultative Councils in the

various industries in Singapore. In this respect, I

can  safely  say  that  the  National  Productivity

Centre  has  failed  in  instilling  the  need  and

importance    of    forming   Joint    Productivity

Consultative Councils in all our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre organises a

number of courses in work study, job evaluation and

incentives, management   techniques,   production

planning   control,   office  management   methods,

workers' education and so on. To a limited  extent,

it provides advisory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



services.  I  must  express the  gratitude  of  the

N.T.U.C. for  the  co-operation  of  the  National

Productivity  Centre in organising similar  courses

for   trade  union  officials  affiliated  to   the

N.T.U.C.  The trade union movement is also grateful

to  the National Productivity Centre for the advice

we  get  sometimes. It is, however, to be regretted

that  the  Centre  has either  failed  or  has  not

attempted to convince the employers of the need  to

set up joint consultative machinery between workers

and  employers  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating

greater cooperation and promoting productivity.  In

other  words,  the training courses have  not  been

matched  with  practical schemes for  putting  into

practice the principles taught in the courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the training courses, the National

Productivity  Centre seems to be  preoccupied  with

such   matters   as   industrial   relations,   the

recruitment of staff for industries, assisting  the

employers in industrial training programmes,  etc.,

matters   which   strictly  are  not   related   to

productivity.  The  National  Productivity   Centre

seems to have forgotten the fundamental purpose for

which  it was set up. Certainly it was not  set  up

for  the purpose of recruiting workers or assisting

in the training of workers for industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre has an Advisory

Council consisting of representatives from workers,

employers and the Government. This Council was  set

up in December 1967, and I shall be grateful if the

Minister in charge can enlighten this House on  the

number  of times that the Council has met to advise

the National Productivity Centre. Sir, I raise this

question   because   my   organisation   is    also

represented in the Council and I am told  that  the

Advisory  Council exists only in name  and  it  has

never   been   convened  to  advise  the   National

Productivity  Centre. Also in  1968,  an  elaborate

constitution  of Works Councils was drawn  up  with

appropriate comments and suggestions from the trade

unions  and  the employers' organisations.  I  fear

that the model constitution of Works Councils still

remains a model. I would also like to know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



from  the Minister how many industries in Singapore

have   been   assisted  by  the  N.P.C. to   form

productivity councils or Works Councils.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that from now onwards, the N.P.C.

will  be  fully responsible for promoting  and  co-ordinating   the  productivity  movement   in   the

Republic.  It  should then be able  to  ensure  the

proper  implementation of the Productivity Code  of

Practice.  It  is  also to be hoped  that  it  will

utilise the Advisory Council that has been  set  up

to   keep   the   N.P.C. in   contact   with   the

organisations which it is supposed to serve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, we have only one I.L.O. expert

attached  to  the Centre, when at one time  we  had

three for helping in the projects organised by  the

Centre. We understand that under the United Nations

Development  Programme, a special fund project  for

the  expansion of the Centre has been approved  and

that  more  equipment  and  experts  will  be  made

available to increase and expand the activities  of

the  Centre.  I hope, with their help,  the  Centre

will serve the purpose for which it was set up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I sent in this amendment,

I  was  trying  to seek some information  from  the

Minister  regarding the work and  progress  of  the

National  Productivity Centre. So much emphasis  is

being placed on higher productivity these days.  In

fact, the Member for Telok Blangah has provided  me

with  some  useful information. As  far  as  I  can

gather, the only report on the work and progress of

the   National  Productivity  Centre  was  a  short

statement  in  the annual report  of  the  Economic

Development Board for the year ending 1967. I would

like to find out from the Minister, as this sum  of

$663,000 for the Centre is the first time  that  it

appears  in the Estimates, whether the Director  of

the  National Productivity Centre will  present  to

Parliament  an annual report of its activities  for

each  year  or  will it be included in  the  annual

report of the E.D.B.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To answer the Member for Kampong Kapor first. I

intend   to  establish  the  National  Productivity

Centre  as  an autonomous organisation, independent

of the Economic Development Board. I think the past

inadequacies  of the N.P.C. were due  to  the  fact

that it was part of the Economic Development Board;

staff  were  appointed  by  the  E.D.B. and   were

responsible to it. Since the E.D.B. was  interested

more in promotion - getting in touch with potential

investors and seeing that they start something here

-  than  in  follow-up work such as maintenance  of

efficiency  in industries in Singapore, the  result

has   been   neglect  by  the  E.D.B. of   N.P.C.

activities. There has been clear evidence that  the

N.P.C. has suffered from such neglect. Therefore, I

propose  that  the  N.P.C. be  established  as  an

organisation independent of the E.D.B. How  and  in

what form the N.P.C. will be reorganised remains to

be  seen.  There is in Singapore an expert  in  the

field of management consultants, sent by the United

Nations, whose job it is to evaluate in some  depth

the   working   of  the  N.P.C. and   its   future

organisation  structure. As a result  of  this,  no

doubt something useful will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can best illustrate the difficulties

and  handicaps suffered by the N.P.C. by giving  an

account   of  actual  assignments  which,   to   my

knowledge,   the  N.P.C. undertook.   These   were

assignments commissioned by me. I asked the  N.P.C.

to do a study of systems of baggage handling at the

airport  to  see  where the hold-up  was,  and  how

matters  could be improved. The N.P.C. has quite  a

talented  team of engineers and it is a  pity  that

these  talented  young men and  women  are  wasting

their time because of absence of proper guidance of

leadership.  But  anyway  they  did  the  study  of

baggage  handling in the airport. I thought  it  an

excellent   study,  and  so  did  the   authorities

concerned,   and   they   are   implementing    the

recommendations of the N.P.C. with the result  that

there has been a marked improvement in the rate  at

which passengers are being handled at the passenger

terminals  through all the formalities of  customs,

immigration,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



health  and  so on. Of  course,  this  is  a

continuing programme of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second assignment which the N.P.C. undertook

was  to  study  systems of wage incentives  in  the

Jurong   Abattoir,   which   was   established   by

Government  at great cost with technical assistance

from  Danish Government. It is under the charge  of

my  colleague,  the Minister for Law  and  National

Development. The N.P.C. productivity study was sent

to  the  appropriate department, in this  case  the

Primary  Production  Department.  The  Director  of

Primary  Production  was  not  convinced  that  the

recommendations had any value. Whether he is  right

or  the  N.P.C. is right, I do not know. It is  not

for me to say. But in this instance the work proved

negative.  Whether  it is that the  recommendations

were unrealistic or whether it is that the Director

could   not   understand  the  recommendations   is

something  on  which I would not  comment,  but  it

illustrates the difficulties under which the  staff

of  the N.P.C. have to work. First, the employer or

the industrialist or whosoever it is has a problem,

must believe it can be solved by the application of

time and motion study or whatever remedy the N.P.C.

staff  are capable of working out. If the employer,

or  the  owner,  or  the  industrialist,  does  not

believe   that   the  N.P.C. can   make   such   a

contribution, then he will not make  use  of  these

services.  Since quite a number of  our  industries

are  small-scale industries where capital is rather

scarce,  and  where the owner or the  industrialist

improvises as best he can, clearly there are limits

to  which the services of the National Productivity

Centre can be put. This again helps to explain  the

reluctance  of  employers to  use  these  services.

Maybe  the  employers  are  wrong,  or  maybe   the

employers are old-fashioned or ignorant. Or it  may

be  that  in  most  instances the N.P.C. has  very

little to offer and that employers either solve the

problems with their own staff or engage experts  to

help  them. If that is so, we probably have to find

a  different  role  for  the National  Productivity

Centre. As the Member for Telok



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



Blangah  has said, a major effort is being  mounted

through  the  United Nations Development  Programme

special  fund  project  to improve  the  staff  and

expand the scope of services of the N.P.C. We  hope

that they will succeed. I am sure the N.T.U.C. will

offer its unstinting support to the N.P.C., because

if  we  could  improve production  systems  in  our

industry,  then  both the employer and  the  worker

stand  a  lot  to gain from it. More  than  this  I

cannot say, other than that my Ministry and  I  are

placing  a  lot of importance and emphasis  on  the

future  activities  of  the  National  Productivity

Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this amendment. I wish to seek

clarification  on  the set-up  of  the  Engineering

Industries Development Agency for which  a  sum  of

$6.1 million is to be voted. Sir, the setting up of

this Engineering Industries Development Agency,  in

fact,  should  have been thought of  earlier,  but,

nevertheless,  it  is not too  late.  This,  I  can

envisage, will certainly help our local engineering

industries, which are comparatively small in scale,

to expand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions for the Minister are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) When and where will this Engineering

Industries Development Agency be set up?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I am also trying to find out from the Minister

what   are   the  functions  of  this   Engineering

Industries Development Agency.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Engineering Industries Development Agency was

formally established in April 1968. It consists  of

a  conglomeration of workshops and various training

centres  which  the E D.B. set up since  the  early

1960s.  Like Topsy, this work centre just grew  and

grew, and eventually the E.D.B. found that they had

something  like six centres. First,  there  is  the

Metal    Industries   Development   Centre,   which

concentrates  on metal engineering  services.  Then

there  is  the  Prototype Production  and  Training

Centre.  This  is the result of a gift  of  machine

tools  donated  by  the Japanese  Government.  Then

there is the Electro-Mechanical Training Centre.  I

cannot remember who donated this equipment. I think

it  is  the  French Government. Then there  is  the

Electro-Chemical Engineering Centre. I am not quite

sure  what it deals with, but they dip metals  into

chemicals. Then there is the Woodworking Industries

Development Centre. Finally there is the  Precision

Engineering Development Centre. These six workshops

combine together under a loose organisation  called

the Engineering Industries Development Agency.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, everybody works with

tremendous  enthusiasm and energy. But  I  get  the

impression  that there is a distinct  lack  of  co-ordination among the six centres in the absence  of

any  clear  definition of the role that  they  will

play  in  our industrialisation programme.  So  the

process of tightening the organisation and spelling

out  the  roles  and functions of  these  different

units has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



going on in my Ministry for a long time.

We have not reached a final solution

yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly these workshops do two

things. First, they train people in certain

skills, whether it is in machine tools,

in woodworking, in chemical treatment

of metals, or in fine engineering. But

whatever it is, they train people. They

recruit students or employees who are

willing to upgrade their skills, and train

them for six months to a year, depending

on the course and the field of

specializsation. That is one function - training.

Second, they produce components for the

local industry, ie., metal

parts and so on. I believe they even tried

to make simple machine tools for the Technical

Department of the Ministry of Education. I do not

know if the Technical Department bought these

machine tools. Nevertheless this is the

sort of work they do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, a lot of energy goes into

this. These centres are quite active and

busy, particularly the Precision Engineering

Development Centre which is going

up in Jurong. This development centre

is quite impressive. They are spending

a sizable sum of money, as a result of

which I am told that some industries

will be established in Singapore to turn

out products that require precise

engineering, such as micrometer

gauges and possibly certain

types of technical instruments. That is

what they do, and this is the way they are

doing it, a bit haphazard no doubt.

But the organisation will be tightened,

and I think we will get better results and

better value for money in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 2127 is an item calling

for a sum of $ 1� million for Industrial

Training. In the explanatory notes provided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>





in the Memorandum on the Estimates,

this item is explained as a

subvention to an agency. There is also a

reference in the Memorandum on the

Development Estimates that  $ 1� million

is a subvention for the training of

Sembawang Shipyard technical staff. I

would ask the Minister whether these

two items are the same. If so, what is

the significance of the subsidy to be

provided only for Sembawang Shipyard

employees?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, they are

really two different items. The subsidy

for Sembawang Shipyard is really meant

to retrain employees of the former

British Naval Dockyard, now known as

Sembawang Shipyard, for other useful

work. Subhead 2127 is concerned with

the training programmed for the Jurong

shipbuilders, the company which will

build ocean-going freighters in Singapore.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members will know, we do not build

big ships in Singapore. We only build

ships of a few hundred tons - water-boats,

tugs, and so on. So if we want to

go into the big league and produce

ocean-going vessels, we have to train

the neccessary skills. This is being done in

conjunction with the Ishikawajima-Harima

Heavy Industries, or I.H.I. for short.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have 249 of our citizens

under training in Japan. Next year we will

send another 250. This money is

to pay for the cost of such training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir

I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0403

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2202.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead is entitled "Contribution

towards the Students' Gift

Accounts of P.O.S.B.", i.e., the Post

Office Savings Bank. Sometime ago the

Minister for Communications disclosed

that Government was trying to encourage

our students to save by saving with the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>









P.O.S.B. This is, I think, a move in the

right direction - encouraging children

to start saving when they are young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if the Minister would

care to enlighten this House by answering

a few questions. First, how much

savings have been collected from

students last year, and how many

accounts have been opened? Second,

how long does his Ministry intend to

continue contributing towards such gift

accounts? Third, as at last year, what

is the percentage of the number of savings

accounts opened as against the

total school population?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minster for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minster for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in order to give an adequate reply to

the Member for Punggol, it may be

neccessary for me to state that this question

of postal savings in schools has to be

divided into two sections, although

the point he has raised is in respect of

gift accounts. so I will try to give the

first section for his edification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started a campaign for schools'

savings beginning in January 1969. With

the full co-operation of the Ministry of

Education, that is to say, officials, principals

and teachers, we were able to

get 486 out of 511 schools, or 95 per cent,

to participate in the savings campaign.

More that 144,000 students opened

savings accounts, and this represents 28

per cent of the total school population.

which exceeds half a million. The

amount saved was more than $1.2 million,

a very significant sum. The only

people who do grumble are the hawkers

in the school tuckshops, because this

was the sum of money they did not get,

but is nicely tucked away in our

Savings Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular subhead brought up

by the Member refers to special savings

gift accounts for Secondary I students

in particular. This is what you call a gift

account. If a Secondary I student has a

minimum sum of $5 in his P.O.S.B.

account, then Government will donate

$5 to make it $10. But there is a little

catch here. It is not possible for the

student to withdraw the $10 the next day

and so have a good time with it.

It has to be kept in the Savings Bank





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



for the next five years. Of course, there

will be the four per cent interest credited

to his account. The idea is to

keep it in cold storage for five years,

so that when he leaves secondary school,

he will then have $10 plus the four per

cent interest accumulated for the last

five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid this campaign did not

quite succeed during the course of last

year. For the last 14� months, that is to say, from January 1969 to the middle of March 1970, there were only 4,290

accounts, and the sum contributed by

Government was $5 times this number,

which is $21,450. This year we hope

to step up the campaign to encourage

more of our Secondary I students to

save. As you can see, we have a provision

of $156,000 for this year. I have

indicated just now that we have handed

out only $21,450. But I think that, with

a little extra effort this year, we might

be able to utilise fully this provision of $156,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the

Minister for his replies to my questions, but

I have supplementary questions to

ask. Sir, he mentioned that gift accounts

are only meant for Secondary I students.

Can I suggest to him that we accord

this gift account to students in primary

schools also? The reason is that for

primary school students, there is a course of six years,

whereas for those in secondary schools there is a course

of only four years, with another two years in

the upper secondary. Why cannot we induce children to start saving

in the Post Office Savings Bank right

from the moment they enter school? In

this way, not only will much more savings be collected,

but the children will also benefit with a gift of an extra $5.

Will he consider this suggestion>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think the

Member's suggestions are very interesting.

There is an advisory committee

which advises me on these matters.

These suggestions will be put to them

for their recommendation. I will give

them favourable consideration provided

my colleague, the Minister for Finance,

is prepared to support me on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister

has mentioned that only $21,000 was

paid out last year although there was a

provision  of $281,250. In other words,  only  nine

per cent of the provision was

paid  out.  We  have  plenty of  money  under  this

provision.   And   since  my   suggestion   is   an

interesting  one,  why not make it  a  constructive

one?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the Member is calculating

only  one  aspect  of  the problem.  Four  thousand

students in Secondary I classes have started  these

accounts. This represents a little over 10 per cent

of  the students involved. We have figures from the

Ministry of Education which indicate that  the  number  of  students entering Secondary I  classes  in

1970  is  39,000.  For  last  year  it  was  45,000

students.  If the scheme is thrown open to  primary

school  students, then I think the figure  will  be

hundreds of thousands over the years.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0403 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the time has come for us to

review  the  policy and functions of  the  People's

Association and the manner in which such policy and

functions  are  being  implemented.  I  feel   that

lethargy has set in among the officers and staff of

the People's Association Headquarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community centres in Singapore have done a

wonderful job and are continuing to do so. However,

I  feel  that  the headquarters of these  community

centres, that is, the People's Association, is  not

doing  as  much  as  it can do at  the  moment.  It

appears   that   the  objective  of  the   People's

Association recently has been only to put up  shows

of  one  type  or another in order  to  create  the

impression that it is active or to create a  public

image for itself. It has not undertaken any project

for  mass participation. The community centre staff

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



left  to  fend  for  themselves in  many  community

centres. They do not receive much guidance, if any,

from  the  specialist sections in  the  People's

Association,  such  as  the Cultural  Section,  the

Sports Section, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Specialist Professional Units do

not offer any guidance or assistance to

the community centre staff. The Cultural

Section  is only interested in organising  cultural

shows at the People's Association level, but not in

helping  the community centres with their expertise

and  experience, with the result that the community

centres do not organise cultural

activities of their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said for the Sports Section. Many community centres are interested in, say, the coaching of basketball. It

is possible for the People's Association  to  organise coaching sessions  for  a number of centres whose residents may be interested in the game. What  happens now, I am told, is that the community

centre is expected to organise the coaching on its own and

that the People's Association pays for the fees  of

the  coach,  irrespective of whether he coaches  10

persons  or  30 persons in basketball. If  properly

organised, money can be saved by combining training

and coaching sessions for a number of centres which

can be conveniently grouped together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I myself have seen community centre staff not doing as much as they can do in a number of community centres. They have been

criticised for their lack of initiative, indifference, idleness and  arrogance by one of their supervisors, as reported in the People's

Association news bulletin recently. May I inquire

whether  this  warning given by the supervisor  has

resulted  in  any  improvement  of  performance  or

discipline, or whether the People's Association has

taken  any steps to improve the situation  and,  if

so, what are the steps taken? I sincerely hope that

the  Association has not taken the easy way out  by

forgetting the whole matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come to the establishment of community

centres,   a  matter  which  certainly  illustrates

another  area  of  lethargy  on  the  part  of  the

People's.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



Association.  Sir, the islanders of  Pulau  Blakang

Mati  were  promised  a  community  centre  by  the

People's Association about four years ago.  A  site

was  selected  and marked out for the  building  of

this  community centre. I believe tenders were also

called for the construction of the centre. However,

for  one  reason or another, to date this community

centre has not been built,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968 when I was elected Member of Parliament

for  Telok  Blangah, which included  Pulau  Blakang

Mati,  I raised the question of a community  centre

for  the island. I was told that no capital  outlay

involving large sums of money could be approved for

this  purpose However, with much difficulty  I  was

able  to  persuade  the Bases  Economic  Conversion

Department   to   release  a  building, centrally

located,  for  use as a community  centre  for  the

island.  Two  families who occupied  this  building

were persuaded to move out and preparatory work for

the  conversion of this building into a  community

centre  commenced .I believe the  Director  of  the

People's Association and other senior staff visited

the site a few times. Tenders were called for. From

the  activities  that went on, the  islanders  this

time were hopeful that at last they were going  to

have a community centre. However, the last official

communication  I had from the People's  Association

regarding  the community centre was  on  5th  June.

1969, when the People's Association requested  the

Public   Works  Department  to  call  for  tenders.

Subsequently, I made numerous inquiries and I was told

that  the cost of conversion of the building for  a

community centre would be more than $4,000 and that

the People's Association had only approved $4,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had on numerous occasions spoken to the

officials  of  the People's Association,  informing

them of the special need for a community centre  at

Pulau  Blakang  Mati  and that a  community  centre

could   be  started  with  even  less  than  $4,000

approved  for  that purpose, since a  building  was

available  and  work was partially completed.  Sir,

the People's Association was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



impressed with my representation. The islanders are

making  a big joke of the proposed community centre

for  which, they have waited for the past five  or

six  years. I believe the latest joke is that  when

one  of the officials  of the People's Association

went to Pulau Blakang Mati to inspect the building

and  have  a chat with some of the islanders,  they

shooed him off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I be told once and for all whether the

People's  Association is going to build a community

centre in Pulau Blakang Mati or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the officials of the

People's  Association  were not  impressed  by  the

Member for Telok Blangah, I can assure him that  I

am  indeed  very much impressed by the presentation

of  his  case.  First, I shall take up  the  second

point which he has raised, namely, the question  of

a  community  centre at Pulau Blakang Mati.  It  is

true that this question was raised about five years

ago.  But unfortunately at that time there  was  in

the  air the question of the British withdrawal and

we  did  not  know  then how many people  would  be

served  by  this community centre. When the  matter

was  raised again by the Member, there was also the

question of the accelerated British withdrawal, and

lately  there has been competing interest  for  the

development  of  Pulau  Blakang  Mati  by   several

Ministries,  and up till today we do not  know  who

will succeed in the end. Therefore, the question of

how  many residents there will be in Pulau  Blakang

Mati  in the end is still left open. I think it  is

largely,   for  these  reasons  that  the  People's

Association is unable to vote a large sum of money,

to  put  up  a  building which might be  used  only

temporarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the question of lethargy and the lack

of  efficiency among members of the staff  of  the

People's Association. Alas, I must confess that for

the, most part, his criticism is quite valid. I have

been   going  to  the  People's  Association  twice

monthly  trying to pump some life into  members  of

the staff. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



fact, we have expanded so much and the same problem

that faces the People's Association is also present

in   other  Ministries  in  that  we  do  not  have

sufficient  capable persons to run an  organisation

of this nature. But I have taken remedial measures.

If  Members  will remember, organising  secretaries

have  to go through a course at the National  Youth

Leadership  Training Institute in which  leadership

qualities are supposed to be instilled into them so

that  they  would  act as a catalyst  for  communal

activities in the community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime last year we reorganised the examination

system  in  the National Youth Leadership  Training

Institute. Our observation of those who have passed

and  have  been awarded diplomas after a three-year

course  in  the National Youth Leadership  Training

Institute indicates that these people do  have  the

theoretical   knowledge   of   leading    community

movements  or  activities. But,  unfortunately,  in

many cases they lack initiative, determination  and

willingness to work; or they lack the understanding

to apply theory to practice.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have made a change. Whereas before

passes  were awarded solely on academic  work,  the

present  system is to award 50 per cent  marks  for

knowledge  of  academic work, and 50 per  cent  for

other   qualities  such  as  leadership  qualities,

honesty,  application and initiative. So steps  are

being taken to see that those who will be appointed

as  organising secretaries of community  centres  - and  among them ultimately we will have supervisors

and the director - will be able to apply the theory

which  they have learnt to the work which  will  be

allotted to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of coaching groups of people for

sports  and  the  new system whereby  the  People's

Association  will  undertake to pay  the  fees  for

coaches    engaged   by   the   community   centres

themselves, this I think is largely because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



we  have found great difficulty  in  getting

suitable  coaches direct, and also because  of  the

difficulties  we face in certain sports  where  the

parental  body requires affiliation to the People's

Association before it would allow its coaches to be

sent  to  the community centres. As a  way  out  of

this,  I  believe the People's Association  decided

that  the community centres on their own could form

a  team  and affiliate themselves to the  parental

association.  Thus they would  be  able  to  get  a

coach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am as much concerned with the

efficiency  of  the  People's  Association  as  the

Member  for Telok Blangah is, and we have  in  hand

some steps which we consider taking to tighten up

the  whole organisation. At the moment, I am  faced

with  the  problem  of finding a  director  to  the

People's Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all that I want to know is whether the

Government  is  satisfied that  there  is  adequate

provision  for the education of our deaf  children,

as  such  education  is  peculiarly  and  specially

necessitated  by their condition. In my  experience

at  the meet-the-people sessions, I have discovered

that   there  may  be  some  inadequacies  in  this

provision. For that reason, I am bringing  up  this

question  because  it seems to me  that  by  making

provision for the education of our deaf



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



children, they will be less of a burden on society

if  they can look after themselves, if they can  be

self-reliant, or if they can even be productive. It

would  be interesting to find out what Government's

opinion is and whether it might be a good idea  for

Government  to take over entirely the  business  of

education for young children retarded in this way.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, in answer to the question by the Member for

Katong,  I  think  Government's  contribution   is

enough.  As  you  know. Sir,  besides  the  $12,000

annual  grant given by Government to the  Singapore

Association  for the Deaf and Dumb, the  Government

also  pays the salary of the nine teachers for  the

Oral  Section, five instructors and one  assistant

instructor for the Science Section who are attached

to  the  School for the Deaf in Mountbatten  Road.

The  salaries  of  these teachers  and  instructors

amounted  to $85,508 in 1969 and were paid  by  the

Social  Welfare Department. Therefore, we  can  say

that  the  approximate annual contribution  by  the

Ministry to the School is $100,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School for the Deaf at Mountbatten Road is

sited  on  a  piece of state land with an  area  of

40,000  square feet. Recently, the Association  has

applied  for the alienation of a further  piece  of

land approximately l0,000 square feet adjoining the

site  of  the existing school in order to  build  a

vocational  centre and workshop. This  project  has

the  support  of the Ministry, and the Commissioner

of Lands has written to the Association saying that

his office is prepared to consider recommending the

alienation of this land to the Association for a 30-year  lease  at  an annual rent of $12  per  annum,

subject,  of course, to planning approval.  So  far

the  Association has not submitted any  application

to the Chief Building Surveyor for such approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Association itself can carry on

looking  after the education of deaf children,  and

there  is  no  question of Government  taking  over

wholly the projects of the Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0403 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2352.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has proposed to

this  House  for  approval a  sum  of  $176,000  as

contribution to the Public Utilities Board in order

that  it  can carry out anti-pollution measures  at

Seletar Dam. I for one wholeheartedly welcome  the

Government's  new policy of combating  the  growing

menace  of  air  and water pollution  and  wish  to

express my thanks to the Government for wasting  no

more   time   in   tackling  this   problem.   With

urbanisation and industrialisation taking place  at

a   rapid  pace, and  with  irresponsible   people

disposing  of garbage, faecal, trade and industrial

waste in open grounds and water-ways, there are all

the potentials of a water pollution problem. I hope

no  one  will be complacent about it and treat  the

agitation  for  water  conservation  and  pollution

control as a passing whim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the measures the P.U.B. are proposing

to  take,  can the Minister concerned,  if  he  has

knowledge,  inform the House whether  the  measures

are  preventive in nature or measures to remove  an

existing pollution problem? As I believe that it is

hard  to  get money out of the Minister for Finance

unless  he  knows  it is going to be  usefully  and

profitably spent, can the Minister explain in  more

detail why he is proposing to give away this sum of

$176,000 to the PUB? Is it to be used to pay for  a

development  project as an anti-pollution  measure,

or   is  it  going  to  be  used  for  repair   and

maintenance  of some equipment, or is it  for  some

general  expenses connected with the  P.U.B. anti-pollution  plan? Is this sum of $176,000 the  total

P.U.B, expenditure for anti-pollution measures,  or

is  it only part of the P.U.B.'s expenditure on this

item?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to get some idea of the problem and I

searched the P.U.B. reports for some lead. There  was

a  blank.  Even the latest P.U.B. report  does  not

mention   any   pollution  problem.  However,   the

brochure  commemorating  the  opening  of   Seletar

Reservoir last August probably points partly to the

cause  of  the  problem. In the page  dealing  with

recreational  facilities in the  reservoir,  it  is

suggested  that boating, canoeing and fishing  will

be  permissible. Even the P.U.B. staff  has  got  a

canoeing  group.  On  the same  page,  there  is  a

photograph  of some Board members enjoying  a  boat

trip, including the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for Foreign Affairs when he was a  member

of   the  Public  Utilities  Board.  Besides  these

facilities,  other facilities like  sports  ground,

playground  and  parks will be  provided.  Can  the

Minister  clarify  if the sum of  $176,000  is  for

clearing  up the pollution caused by activities  at

the  reservoir?  I think the P.U.B. has  recognised

the  dangers of these activities and says, I  quote

from the brochure:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Board plans to allow boating, canoeing and fishing

in  the  Reservoir  with safeguards  against  water

pollution.'



<br><br>I  have  no doubt that the Public Utilities  Board,

the  Ministry  of Health and other departments  are

doing  everything possible to prevent the pollution

of  our  drinking  water at Seletar  Reservoir  and

other reservoirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health Annual Report, 1967 (Paper

Cmd.  1  of 1970) records that a survey was carried

out at the Seletar Reservoir catchment area between

April  and July 1967 by the Public Health  Division

of  the  Ministry in collaboration with the P.U.B.,

the  Survey  and Primary Production Departments  to

look  into  the sources of pollution of streams  in

the catchment area, The same report in page 60 says

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Under the Seletar Water Scheme, designed to tap

water  from eight catchments, a survey was  carried

<br><br>Sir, I presume this job was completed last year. In

this  case, what is the real problem that a sum  of

$176,000  is requested by the P.U.B. to  carry  out

anti-pollution  measures at Seletar  Reservoir?  In

the  financial year 1st April, 1970, to 31st March,

1971,  it  is  stated  in  the  Memorandum  on  the

Estimates  of Revenue and Expenditure of  Singapore

(Miscellaneous I of 1970) that there is an  overall

increase  in  the provision for the  Public  Health

Division   of   a   sum   of  $3.2   million.   The

Environmental  Health Section gets an  increase  of

$389,250  for  the proper maintenance of  catchment

drains  and an additional increase of $51, 280  for

the employment of more daily-rated staff due to the

expansion of environmental health service



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have spent $28 million for

the construction of Seletar Reservoir, and not only

do we have a maximum supply of two months' drinking

water, but we also face the danger of pollution  by

our  own foolishness and inconsideration. I do hope

the   Minister   can  impress  upon   his   Cabinet

colleagues the need to carry out an intensive  and

continuous anti-pollution campaign. It is better to

spend some time and money bringing to the attention

of the people the dangers of pollution and the need

to  remove  the  potentials of pollution, than  to

spend   huge  sums  of  money  later  to  eradicate

pollution itself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Kallang had just

one  simple question to ask, and whilst asking this

question  he took the opportunity to tell  everyone

his own views about pollution. The facts are simple

and,  as  the Member himself puts it, the  Minister

for  Finance  does not just dish  out  $176,000  to

every Tom, Dick and Harry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly-constructed Seletar Reservoir impounds

water  not only from its own catchment area,  which

is   a   protected  area,  but  also   from   eight

neighbouring streams. They are Sembawang,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



Sembawang   Kechil,  Simpang  Kiri,  Bukit   Mandai,

Mandai,  Mandai  Kechil, Pang Sua and  Peng  Siang.

Water  from each of these eight streams  is  pumped

into  the  reservoir.  I say "pumped"  because  the

streams  are  at a lower level than the  reservoir,

and  in  order to get the water in the  streams  up

into  the  reservoir, pressure by way of  pumps  is

used. The catchment area of these eight streams  is

about  8,000  acres  and this  area  is  completely

unprotected   and  is  inhabited  by  farmers   and

squatters.  A  considerable  amount  of   vegetable

farming and pig and poultry rearing is done.  As  a

result,  the  water  from these  streams  could  be

polluted,  so  that  when  Seletar  Reservoir   was

constructed,  we  had  to  build  2,778  water-seal

latrines  and  2,297  cesspits.  A  total  of   361

pigsties  were resited and 692 pigsties  demolished

in  the  eight catchment areas. The pigsties  could

pollute the water in the reservoir. Hence the water-seal latrines and cess pits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $176,000 provided under subhead 2352

will meet 50 per cent of the cost of purchase of 16

galley  emptiers which are needed to  dislodge  pig

manure  from the cesspits and dispose of it at  the

nearest sewerage treatment works. The other 50  per

cent  of  the  cost  will be  paid  by  the  Public

Utilities  Board. Unless the cesspits  are  cleared

from  time  to time, the manure will overflow  into

the  streams.  So this is a continuous  maintenance

problem  called an anti-pollution measure.  It  has

nothing   to  do  with  the  Government   pollution

measures   which  we  are  thinking  of   now --  air

pollution,  water  pollution and  so  on.  This  is

pollution  which has been in the farms  in  Seletar

for  many years. We build the reservoir and we  use

water from the streams. We therefore have to ensure

that the water is clean. It may interest the Member

for  Kallang  to know that these eight streams  can

supply  on  an  average of two million  gallons  of

water  a day for Seletar Reservoir. These are  only

the  eight streams. The water, of course, also goes

into  the main catchment area. It may interest  the

Member further to know that Seletar Reservoir  has,

during the last nine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



months, provided 4,000 million gallons of water for

use in Singapore. The Member also raised the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Customs and Excise

Department  is a very important department  because

it  deals  with foreigners coming into our country.

Therefore, it has to set a good example of  service

and   maintain  a  high  standard  of   efficiency.

Unfortunately,   I   have   received   unfavourable

complaints  against it. For example, some  tourists

complained that certain officials of the department

were   discourteous,  arrogant  and  so  on.   This

attitude  is  likely  to  generate  a  feeling   of

resentment in the tourists. If the officials in the

department continue to behave in this manner,  then

it  will  not  only affect adversely our  expanding

tourist  industry,  but it  will  also  affect  the

economy of our country. This arrogance on the  part

of  the  officials is a matter of serious  concern.

Therefore, I hope the Minister will take  steps  to

remedy the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Certain officials of the

Customs and Excise section at Paya Lebar Airport

are very inefficient.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



They are very slow and take their own sweet time in

dealing  with tourists, This also arouses a feeling

of  resentment  in the tourists. We should  try  to

improve the standards of courtesy and efficiency of

customs officers so that the tourists will go  back

with  a  good impression of our country. This  will

help  us  in our efforts to promote tourism.  So  I

hope  the Minister will deal immediately with  this

matter and take the necessary steps to improve  the

standard of efficiency and courtesy of the  Customs

and Excise Department.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The duty of custom officers is to catch smugglers

and,  as such, it cannot be expected that they will

rate very high in any popularity poll in Singapore.

I  would be greatly alarmed if customs officers are

the most popular of the civil servants. However, if

the Member for Sembawang has specific complaints of

misconduct, I will be glad to hear them. I  do  not

place much credence on general complaints, as it is

in  the nature of the work of customs officers that

they have to be unpleasant to people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards slowness in dealing with tourists at

Paya  Lebar International Airport, I am afraid  the

Member  for  Sembawang is behind time. The  customs

officers  used  to  take a lot  of  trouble  to  be

conscientious about this, but the new policy is  to

clear passengers as quickly as possible and not  to

make  checks unless they know that some  disruptive

or  shady  characters are in the plane. Records  of

passenger clearance are being kept by the  Director

of  Civil  Aviation, The average time  the  Customs

take  to  clear  a plane of 100 passengers  is  ten

minutes. Therefore, there is no question that  this

is one of the fastest Customs in the world. Whether

it is good or bad for Singapore, I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Minister is happy with the

efficiency of the Customs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



and  Excise Department, I am very pleased. This  is

because  it would be favourable to our country.  We

must  deal  with many countries in our  efforts  to

promote  tourism.  Therefore,  we  must  treat  the

tourists with great respect. Only in this  way  can

our  country earn more foreign currency. This  will

be  beneficial to our economy, and it will not give

our  Minister  for  Finance  too  much  trouble  in

getting  sufficient revenue.  However,  since  the

Customs   and  Excise  Department  is  under   good

control, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the.names of Mr Hwang Soo Jin and Mr N Govindasamy)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, revenue collection has increased

tremendously.   For  example,  our   Property   Tax

estimate  for  next year will reach the  figure  of

$114  million. This is the result of the prosperity

we  are enjoying now. On the other hand, it is also

due  to  the  Government  increasing  the  rate  of

property tax. Unfortunately, the increased rate has

affected both the rich and the poor. The burden  of

increased tax should fall on the rich as  they  can

afford to pay. They live in luxurious bungalows and

enjoy a high standard of living. It is unfair  that

the   poor  people  living  in,  for  example,  the

Sembawang  area,  Choa  Chu Kang  Constituency  and

Thomson  Constituency and so on, have  to  pay  the

increased  rate of property tax. In my constituency

I  have received several complaints from the people

saying  that  their property tax has been  doubled.

For  example, in a two-room flat, these people need

to  pay about $30 to $40 a year, but nowadays  they

have  to pay something like $ 100 to $120 per year.

This sort of measure is unfair.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, very often we have been

emphasising  that  we  are a  democratic  socialist

Government, and therefore we have a duty  to  look

after the interests of the people, especially those

belonging  to the lower income group. The officials

of  the  Income  Tax Department should,  therefore,

understand the policy of the Government  when  they

lay  down the rates of tax that the people have  to

pay.  They must sympathise with those whose  income

is limited, because it is already quite a task for

them  to  support  their families and  they  cannot

afford to pay more tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those cases I have mentioned are quite commonly

found in other rural areas including Choa Chu Kang,

the constituency of the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the Minister for Finance. I am sure he has received

similar  complaints.  I  hope  the  Minister   will

consider  lowering  the rate of  property  tax  for

these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree that it is the duty of the

Government  to  increase  property  tax   for   the

development  of the country, in point  of  fact,  I

think there are better ways of raising revenue. For

example, the government knows of many cases of  tax

evasion. If it could concentrate on this field, I am

sure  the  extra revenue collected  will  be  quite

considerable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very pleased to note that the

Government has recently invited certain specialists

from  America  to help us deal with tax  evasion.

This  is  indeed a very good move. I would like  to

know  how the government proposes to implement  the

measures to prevent tax evasion, and how much extra

revenue  Government will be able to raise.  I  hope

the  Government  will take steps  to  arrest  these

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Property Tax Division

does  not accept payment of taxes which come to  $2

or $3. Superficially this appears beneficial to the

people  in the rural areas whose taxes are  usually

low. But this is not equivalent to a tax exemption.

It is only a temporary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



suspension  of collection. This also  reflects  the

laziness and irresponsibility of officials in  this

Division.  For a few years now, these rural  people

have  not  been paying this tax, because when  they

went to pay, their payments were not accepted.  But

recently  they received notice to pay up their  tax

arrears. They found that their rates have increased

more than a hundred times. In other words, from  $2

to  $3 per year, their rates have been increased to

$200   to   $300.  This  is  fantastic   and   most

unreasonable. If the officials of the Property  Tax

Division  had agreed to receive payment every  year

or once every three months, then these people would

not  have  to  pay  such a large sum.  I  hope  the

Minister   will   carry   out   a   very   detailed

investigation into this unreasonable situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only wish to touch a

comparatively  minor aspect of the inland  revenue,

It  concerns the implementation of the amendment to

the  Stamp Ordinance, passed by this House  on  the

15th  October, 1969, to allow for payment of  stamp

duty on a number of legal documents by means of the

postal  franking machine. The amendment has  passed

into  law  now for some five months. I do not  know

how   many  applications  have  been  received  and

approved,  but  I  understand  that  a  number   of

applicants  have  as  yet  not  been  granted   the

necessary licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, this particular

amendment was introduced not only with a view  to

public convenience but also with a view to reducing

the  pressure on the Stamp Office. This was a  step

recommended by the Organisation and Methods Branch,

following  their investigations into  the  work  of

that Department. This being the case, I should have

thought that the Commissioner would have been  only

too  happy to grant the licences applied  for,  but

the  impression I have is that he does not seem  to

be too keen to grant licences.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Estimates of Revenue and

Expenditure for the last financial year, $500,000

was set aside under the heading of Special

Expenditure for the setting up of the Anti Evasion

Unit of the Income Tax Division, This year the same

item has again been budgeted, but this time under

"Personal Emoluments" of the Inland Revenue

Department. It seems to me that it is not possible

for the Unit to function within one year from the

time it was set up, and my impression seems to be

confirmed by the Minister in his speech in which he

made reference to the recent establishment of the

Unit and to the assistance of the American Inland

Revenue officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved with the intention

of  seeking further clarification from the Minister

on  the  function  of the Unit. Sir,  as  the  Unit

appears  in  the Estimates under the  Property  Tax

Division,  will the services of the  Unit  also  be

utilised by the Income Tax Division!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, human nature being what it is, everyone will

try  his  best  to evade income tax. It  is  common

knowledge that a number of businessmen in Singapore

make  it  a  point to keep one, two, or even  three

sets  of  accounts for the purpose of  facilitating

evasion of income tax.

course.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I am talking generally on Inland Revenue and

on the collection of income tax as well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well. You may carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Income Tax Department is to be

congratulated  on collecting more money  than  they

anticipated.  I believe the revenue of  the  Income

Tax  Department  was increased  by  $59.8  million.

However, I feel there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



are  areas  in  Singapore where  stricter  or  more

efficient methods of collecting tax can be  adopted

to further increase the revenue from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in common with many other countries in Asia,

Singapore  has  this  phenomenon  -  that  roadside

hawkers in certain selected areas are making better

business than even established restaurants. It will

be  interesting  to  know how many  of  these  busy

hawkers,  catering for tourists as  well  as  local

people,  pay  income tax. Take, for  instance,  the

many  stallholders  doing  business  opposite   the

Singapore  Cold  Storage  in  Orchard  Road,  Bugis

Street, Hock Lam Street, Albert Street, etc.  I  am

told  that  the average turnover per day  for  each

stall  in  such areas is much higher than  that  in

licensed   restaurants. It  will,  therefore,   be

interesting  to know how many of these  hawkers  do

pay income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully conscious of the difficulty that the

Income  Tax Department faces in getting proper  tax

returns   from   these   stallholders.   But   with

sufficient manpower, however, it may be possible to

station  an official near selected stalls to  record

the  daily  takings and to estimate the profits  of

the hawkers on the basis of such takings. There may

be  other methods which I am sure the American  tax

officials, being specialists in this field, will be

able to suggest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Anti Evasion Unit, if it functions properly,

should  be able to increase the income tax  revenue

much more than we have had this year, and the money

spent  on setting up this Unit would be well  worth

it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Members have raised two main points - property tax and the Anti Evasion Unit. At the risk

of  repetition when the other subhead comes  up,  I

think I will deal them, with your permission,  Sir,

in some detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property tax is levied on the annual value of the

property.  If  a  landlord rents  out  a  piece  of

property,  then  the annual value is  the  rent  he

collects from it. In that case, I assume the Member

for Sembawang, whose concern is for poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



people,  will  have no sympathy with the  landlord,

That  must  be so, because landlords are  not  poor

people. The problem will arise when the person owns

the  house in which he lives. This is the  trouble.

How  to  value it? There has been an uproar  lately

because  the  property tax levied on owner-occupied

residence has been increased 100 per cent and even,

I  am  told,  250 per cent, They say the Department

has  been quite ruthless and rapacious. Of  course,

that  is  one  way of looking at it. But  from  the

Property  Tax Department's point of view, they  say

the man is lucky to have got away so cheaply in the

past,  and that the present valuation is the  right

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now where the man lives in his own house, the

valuation attached to that house is related to  the

rent that can be fetched for similar houses. Let us

suppose  the Member for Sembawang lives in his  own

house. The house next door, which is the same  type

of  house, has been rented out for, say,  $2,000  a

year.  Therefore,  the  Member's  house  should  be

assessed   at   $2,000  a   year.   It   is   quite

straightforward. And if in the past his  house  has

been  assessed at $200 a year, it is only fair that

it should now be assessed at $2,000 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened is that the staff of the

Department has been strengthened and will  continue

to   be   strengthened, so  that  the  number   of

reassessments  now  being made is  increasing,  and

more  and  more  people are paying more  tax  which

should have been paid years ago. So there was quite

a  howl  about that. If they think that  they  have

been  unfairly treated, then they can,  of  course,

appeal.  It  is  quite strange that none  of  these

people  who  grumble about high taxes have  so  far

taken the legal redress available to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Stamp Ordinance, the Member for Jalan

Kayu  asked how it is that, after we have done  all

this  business  of  passing  a  new  law  to  allow

franking  machines to be licensed, the  people  who

asked  for franking machines did not get a licence.

I  do not know the details, but I can only guess  -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



either  the  Commissioner of  Stamps  has  not  got

enough franking machines or these people are not -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, can I just clarify one point?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin :</b> My point

is  this: I have come across  instances

where  the  people already have the machines.  They

applied  for  licences  and have  waited  for  five

months  now,  and  they have  still  not  got  any

answer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If the Member could let me have the details, I will

inquire into this. This is a matter which I  cannot

answer off the cuff, as I do not know what the facts

are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the Anti Evasion Unit. Last year it was

put  down  in the budget as a block vote of $500,000,

because  at  that time the Commissioner  of  Inland

Revenue did not know the number of staff he  needed

and  what their salary scales should be, and so on.

Therefore, it was paid out of a block.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we know the scale of operations , the

type  of staff, the salaries needed to pay for them

and  therefore, the Anti Evasion unit appears as  a

separate unit under the Inland Revenue head. It  is

not  part  of  the  Property Tax  Division.  It  is

another division of the Inland Revenue Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how does it operate? The staff have to

develop  certain skills, it is not as  easy  as  the

Member for Sembawang has suggested. You cannot say.

"So and so is evading tax." You then arrest him and

put  him  in gaol. It cannot be done that way.  You

have  to take them to court and prove that  he  has

been evading tax. You have to provide evidence that

he  has been evading tax, otherwise the Judge will

toss out the case. Therefore, the Anti Evasion Unit

has  the duty of collecting evidence to prove  that

such and such a taxpayer or such and such a company

is evading tax. They do it in various ways, some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



of   which  are  open  and  some  are  secret   and

confidential which I cannot discuss here. But I will

discuss the open system of catching tax evaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First they have to develop the skill in auditing

books  for tax assessment purposes. I am told  this

is  quite  a complicated technique and  has  to  be

learnt  from  people  who have experience  in  such

practices. In fact, the Anti Evasion Unit is slowly

building   up  a  staff  from  graduates   of   the

Polytechnic  who have obtained Accountancy  degrees,

University  graduates in Business Administratration

and  law  graduates and so on. They are trained  to

look  for  evidence of tax evasion in  the  account

books  which  can sustain a prosecution  in  court.

Having had the staff to collect such evidence, the

Unit  has  to  train  them  to  develop  skills  in

interrogation  and finally in prosecuting  the  tax

evaders  in  court. As I said, this is, so to  speak,

the   above-the-counter  method  of  catching   tax

evaders. It means getting trained staff and putting

them through a rigorous training programme, both in

Singapore and in the United States, in  order  to

develop  the  skills. It is a  long  hard  slog.

There  is no short-cut to it. We have just started

this  training with the assistance of employees  of

the  American Inland Revenue Department. This  work

will keep on expanding, progressing and improving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of taxing hawkers.

When   you   engage   20  investigating   officers,

including  professional lawyers, accountant and

so  on,  you are after the big fish. We  know  that

some hawkers do make money and if we catch them  we

will probably get $500 a year tax from them.  Members

must remember that if a hawker is married with only

two  children, he has to have an income of at least

$5,000 a year before he is liable to pay tax. If he

has an income of $6,000 or $7,000 a year, you do not

get  more  than  $100  tax from  him.  So  hounding

hawkers in large numbers will be really a waste of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



money.  What the Inland Revenue Department will  do

is to go for the big fish. I think in the course of

years  they will succeed. I am afraid the  big  tax

evaders   who  do  not  believe  that   will   find

themselves not only landed with a whacking big  tax

assessment, but they may find themselves landed  in

prison.  When that happens, I think people will  be

less  willing  to take the risk of  dodging  income

tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really concerned with the

practice of assessing for income tax purposes,  the

annual  values  of  owner-occupied  dwellings  even

though the concession limit has now been mercifully

raised  to  $6000.  Income tax is really  a  tax  on

income and, as such, must we really persist in  the

practice  of  taxing  notional  income?  Will   the

Minister  also consider extending the property  tax

concession  that  is  now  made  to  owner-occupied

dwellings   to  the  entire  island  of  Singapore,

instead of confining it to owner-occupied



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



dwellings in particular localities specified in the relevant Property Tax Orders?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

point I wanted  to  raise  has already been

made in an answer to the question

raised by the Member for Thomson and

so I am not raising it now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent decision by

the Government to reduce the rate of

property tax in respect of owner-occupied Housing and Development

Board flats is indeed a most welcome

move. This move is another indication

of Government's policy to support and

encourage a property-owning democracy.

The Government is also to be congratulated on resolving the anomalies in

the rates of assessment for similar properties. The rectification of such

anomalies greatly benefits the flat

owners, the majority of whom are wage-earners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, however, to which

I would like to draw the Minister's

attention. That is the manner in which

notices of assessment are issued. In

most cases, such notices are served on

flat owners several months after they

have moved into the flats. In some

instances after a period of more than

one year. This inevitably gives rise to a

situation where a flat owner is confronted with a property tax bill

amounting to a few hundred dollars in

respect of the property tax for the past

several months or year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Mr Speaker, Sir,

very few wage-earners can afford to pay

such a huge bill in one lump sum. Even

the Housing and Development Board is

aware of this problem and the Minister

for Law and National Development has

now permitted the inclusion of legal

fees, stamp duty, etc. into the housing

loan so as to enable the purchaser of

Housing Board flats to pay such fees

by instalments



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Property Tax Division has allowed

flat  owners  to settle their arrears  by  monthly

instalments,  it  imposes a fee  of  $5  for  late

payment by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



default. Such a fee adds insult to injury  as  the

delay  in  payment  was  occasioned  not  by  the

default  of the ratepayer but by the Property  Tax

Division  through its failure to issue its  advice

on time. The explanation given was that that this fee is

for the issue of demand notice and warrant  in

respect of tax outstanding which was not made

known, until months after. If the Property  Tax

Division had been prompt in issuing assessment notices,

such a situation would not have arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, $5 is not a big sum

for  any  flat  owner to pay, but is  it  fair  to

penalise a person for not paying what he owes when he is

not given the opportunity to know how much he is owing in the

first instance, and then subsequently he is allowed to settle

his arrears by monthly instalments? In

order to avoid penalising the ratepayers

unduly, may I respectfully suggest that

the Property Tax Division issue notices of

assessment to flat owners within a reasonable period of their occupying

their flats? By ensuring that the estimated

amount of tax payable is made known in time to the owner-occupiers,

they can make provision to pay the

tax before it is due. I am sure some

arrangements can be made between the

Property Tax Division and the Housing and Development Board offices to

collect their keys to the flats. If the Minister can

look into this matter urgently, the owner-occupiers of Housing and Development

Board flats will have one unnecessary frustration less.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not quite get the point of

the Member for Bukit Panjang. Why should we exempt from

income tax without limit the annual

values of owner-occupied dwellings?

There is something  -



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it will not

be  a  tax  on  income as such. It is  a  tax  on

notional   income  in  so  far  as  owner-occupied

dwellings are concerned. In the event of the house

being rented out to somebody else, then of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



course, you are deriving income from it. But so far

as owner-occupied dwellings are concerned, there is

no  income at all. What you are really doing is  to

tax the notional income of the house for what it is

worth if it is rented out in the open market.  And

beyond  the limit of $6,000, you tax the owner  for

income  tax  purposes. I am being purely  puristic;

however,  I  think I am also looking  in  terms  of

people who have to pay this tax.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once you give the taxpayers

certain  concessions,  you  are  just  looking  for

trouble.  At  one time everybody was  paying,  even

those with an annual value of less than $3,000, and

there  was not a murmur about the iniquity of  this

tax. I am afraid I cannot agree with the Member for

Bukit Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.As regards the limitation of concession to

property tax to certain area, actually there is  no

such limitation. Properties all over Singapore  are

eligible for this exemption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Sir, three orders made sometime in 1960 and 1961

and  called the Property Tax Orders limit the areas

within which owner-occupied houses must be located

before  this  concession  is  given.  I  think  the

concession   is  27  per  cent  for  owner-occupied

houses.  It  is the concession rate  I  am  talking

about.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Those are rates applicable to property tax and

not to income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> I am referring to property tax.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. Property tax varies from district to

district. City districts carry 36 per cent property

tax and others carry less for various reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Sir, I think there is a basic distinction between

owner-occupied  premises  and  premises  that   are

rented  out. For rented-out premises a rate  of  36

per  cent is charged. For owner-occupied houses  a

concession is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



given.  Now even this concession is restricted  to

particular areas of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> I wonder if this concession can be extended to

the whole island.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, we cannot do this. This concession is to

encourage  people  to buy Housing  Board  flats.  I

think that is the reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must press on. Time is getting short. The

Member  for Toa Payoh has said that the $5 fee  for

late  payment is unreasonable, Actually people  are

supposed to pay property tax without any assessment

notice. They know that every January and every June

they  have  to pay. If they do not pay,  then  they

have  committed an offence and they have to pay  $5

for  the  work  of reminding them. It  is  also  to

encourage  people to pay tax without prompting.  He

has a good  proposal in that owners of Housing Board flats

might as well pay property tax to the Housing Board

in  order  to  save them the trouble. Is  that  the

proposal of the Member for Toa Payoh?



<br><br>7.15 pm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> No, Sir, I agree that $5 is not a big sum. But

unfortunately,  the flat owner does  not  know  the

amount  he  is liable to pay until he receives  the

notice of assessment months later.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He just pays what he paid the

last time unless he gets a notice to pay more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to get some information from the

Minister.  There are two islands in my constituency

-  Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong Besar. Many plots of

state land on these two islands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



were leased to farmers for about 20 or 30 years. At

that  time, they were valued at $6 per acre,  After

the expiry of the lease, they have been revalued at

the  fantastic sum of $72 per acre.  Sir,  I  would

like  the Minister to enlighten this House  on  the

reason for this fantastic increase?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not know whether the Member for Changi is

referring  to  Land Office charges  in  respect  of

temporary occupation licences or --



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> That is right. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If they are temporary occupation licences, that

is  the responsibility of the Minister for Law and

National Development. In fact, I would have thought

that $72 per year would have been very cheap for an

acre  of  land.  If this friend of the  Member  for

Changi  thinks that the charges are  too  high  and

does not want the land. I am quite willing to take

it off from him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that there is an increase of 20

posts  of Valuation Officers, an increase of almost

100  per cent. It is also noted that the number  of

Valuers  has also been increased from 11  to  16, an

increase  of  almost 50 per cent. In  view  of  the

latter  increase,  I would like to  know  from  the

Minister  why  it  is necessary  to  increase  the

former by 100 per cent. Just now my colleague,  the

Member  for Sembawang, spoke about the increase  in

property



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to

inform   the  Minister  concerned  that  no  proper

records  are  kept  by  the  Radio  and  Television

Licensing  Section of people who  have  paid  their

Radio  and  T.V. licence fees. I have received  many

complaints. Even Members of this Houses as well  as

a  Minister  have had experience of this.  Compound

notices  have  been  issued to licensees  who  have

already  paid  their  fees. If  they  ignore  these

notices, they  will be served with a  summons  one

month  later. Sir, it would be embarrassing to  the

Government if these law-abiding citizens were to go

to  court  and show the magistrate that they  have

paid their licence fees. We will also be blamed for

not being efficient.

already brought up my point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am not quite clear what the point is. If

the  licensee has paid his fees and he  receives  a

demand notice, then, of course, there is no trouble

at  all  because he has paid up. Mistakes  of  this

kind  do happen because we have got something  like

200,000 licensees who have to pay their fees  every

year.   Sometimes  there  is  a  time  lag  between

recording the payment and issuing the notices. I do

not think this is a major problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan is not moving amendment (l)*. Mr Govindasamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0408 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1001*,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Budget Speech by the Minister for

Finance,  it  is noted that our entrepot  trade  as

well  as  internal trade still plays  an  important

role  in the economy of our Republic. Petty traders

as well as large-scale importers and exporters have

played  their part in the expansion of our economy.

I  feel,  therefore,  that  every  convenience  and

assistance  given to them will in the  end  benefit

the  Republic. Thus, if the volume of  their  trade

increases,  the  revenue  will  be  proportionately

increased.  I believe much inconvenience  has  been

caused to our importers and exporters in respect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



of  issue  of  Inward  and  Outward  Declarations,

whether deliberately or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a trader wants to import certain goods from

abroad, in about three out of 10 cases, he  has  to

go  first to the Imports and Exports officer in the

Trade  Division located in Fullerton Building where

I  am  told  he  has  to get clearance  from  three

different  departments,  namely,  the  Imports  and

Exports  Office,  the Statistics Division  and  the

Customs  Division. Having cleared with these  three

departments,  if  the goods to be imported  involve

customs import duty, he is then required to  go  to

the  Customs  Office at Maxwell  Road  to  get  the

clearance and then to go back to Fullerton Building

for  the  necessary permits. In the  event  of  any

doubt arising as to whether import duty is involved

or  not in respect of the goods to be imported,  he

still  has  to  go  to  Maxwell  Road  to  get  the

necessary  clearance from the Customs there  before

he  is issued with the necessary permits ultimately

at  Fullerton Building. As this entails unnecessary

difficulty  and  inconvenience,  it  may  be  asked

whether  it  would be possible to amalgamate  these

two  sections so that the traders are  not  shunted

from  Fullerton Building to Maxwell Road  and  then

back  to  Fullerton Building for these permits.  If

these  two  departments come  under  one  roof,  it

would,  in  my opinion, be much more efficient.  It

would   involve  better  utilisation  of  manpower,

minimise duplication of work and simplify the issue

of  Inward and Outward Permits. I am told  that  in

most other countries Import and Export Permits  are

issued   by  the  Customs  authorities.   Even   in

Singapore,  the enforcement of Imports and  Exports

Declarations, the checking of the declarations, the

payment  of  necessary duties, the  examination  of

goods, etc., are done by the Customs authorities in

the  harbour, airport, etc. Even the issue of these

declarations  or  permits outside office  hours  is

done  by  the  Customs.  If  such  declarations  or

permits can be issued by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



the Customs outside office hours, I should like  to

know  why the Customs authorities cannot issue  the

required permits during office hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reason is, the issue of the

declarations would be simplified if it is  done  in

one  and  the  same building instead  of  different

buildings, especially when they are located quite a

distance from one another.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the position is not really as bad as the

Member makes it out to be. In most instances  where

goods  are not dutiable, Customs officers  are  not

involved  and  the  importers  need  only   go   to

Fullerton  Building. Even where duty  is  involved,

but  the  consignment  is  small  or  consists   of

personal effects, the Customs and Excise Department

has  stationed  13  officers  in  the  Imports  and

Exports Office and can give the necessary clearance

without the person having to go to the Customs  and

Excise Department. But where there is a substantial

consignment of goods, and where it is necessary  to

check  the importer's background, then the  Customs

officers  will  have  to do the checking.  However,

this  does  not mean the importer goes to Fullerton

Building  and  is then shunted to the  Customs  and

Excise  Department at Maxwell Road,  If  he  is  an

efficient importer, he will know that he has to  go

to  the  Customs and Excise Department  first,  and

when  that is cleared he goes to Fullerton Building

and the formalities end there. I agree that it will

be  a  good thing to have these procedures  in  one

building.  However, neither Fullerton Building  nor

Customs  House  in Maxwell Road is  big  enough  to

house  both of them. So until we get more money  to

have  more  massive  Government offices,  importers

will have to put up with this minor inconvenience.

Foreign    Affairs   and   Minister   for   Labour,

particularly, with  regard to  the  passage  of  a

labour  law  last year in this House,  whether  the

Government  has  carried  out  a  review  of   this

Ordinance  and  the consequent of implementing  it,

and  what  benefits have accrued to both management

and  labour.  I have the feeling that,  as  far  as

management  is concerned, they have been able  to

make  use  of  this  amended  law  for  their  own

purposes. On the other hand, what we have been able

to see that our working class has suffered --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, we are now on the amendment to

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, not really. The Minister for Labour himself

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> All right, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, although ours is a small country,

we    have   been   participating   positively   in

international  affairs since independence. In  the

United  Nations,  our representatives  have  spoken

very  frankly on international problems, and  their

speeches  have  been heeded by the  other  nations.

This  shows that ours is a youthful but progressive

country  and  that we are on an equal footing  with

other big countries on foreign affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main characteristics of our foreign policy

are  those of neutrality and non-alignment. We want

to  be  friends with all countries, especially  our

neighbouring  countries. If we want  to  have  very

close  co-operation with these countries, we  must

continue with this policy of neutrality. This is  a

very   enlightened  policy.  We  will  become   the

Switzerland  of  Asia if we adopt  this  policy  of

neutrality.  This  will be beneficial  to  both  the

country  and  the  people. With the  advancement  in

science and the improvement of communications,  the world

has  shrunk.  This  is conducive  to  regional  co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago a regional association called the

Association of South-east Asian Nations was formed.

Through this association we have been co-operating

closely  with neighbouring countries in the spheres

of education, culture, trade and so on. With

regard to A.S.E.A.N., I believe our people are  very

concerned with whether it will bring benefit to our

country.  I  would like the Minister  concerned  to

enlighten  this  House on whether A.S.E.A.N.,  ever

since  its inception, has made any contribution  to

regional co-operation, and what its schemes  are.

What does it propose to do and what benefits have

we  enjoyed from A.S.E.A.N.? Each year we make some

contribution to it, and therefore we must get  some benefit in return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to know whether our

representatives have been taking an active part  in

all the agencies of the United Nations and what are

our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



contributions  to them. What is our foreign  policy

for  the  current year? In which countries  are  we

going  to  set up our foreign missions in order  to

maintain closer relations with them?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noted that the allowances

given  to  our  foreign diplomats and  their  staff

consist   of  an  overseas  allowance,  a   special

allowance,  an entertainment allowance,  a  special

make-up allowance and a children's allowance. I  do

not  know what "special make-up allowance" is,  but

anyway  there is no mention of housing  allowances.

If  housing  allowances are included in  the  other

allowances,   I  would  like  to  know   if   these

allowances  are sufficient to enable our  diplomats

to have decent houses in keeping with their status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know if the diplomats on

their return to Singapore after a tour of duty are

provided with quarters until they are able to  find

their own accommodation,



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Why should they not!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I feel that these considerations are important in

order  to attract more people for foreign service.

Will   the  Minister  look  into  this  matter   of

providing  quarters  for  our  diplomats  on  their

return  to Singapore until they are able  to  find

their own accommodation?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can partially answer the

question  of  housing raised by  my  namesake,  the

Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite recently I have visited some of our

missions abroad, and I must, at the outset,  pay  a

tribute  to  our  ambassadors  who,  working  under

difficult  conditions, yet do a very  good  job  of

what they have been sent out there to do. I believe

that  last  year  we did send an advance  party  of

officials from the Ministry of Finance to countries

where  we intend to set up embassies, The idea  of

sending  an  advance party to set up an embassy  is

most admirable, but the question is how did they do

their job?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves much to be desired, because I have

been to one of our missions where I found that  the

advance party had been there for more than a month.

They  had informed the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs

that  all was well and that the Ambassador and  his

staff  could  come and set up the office.  However,

even  details of equipment for the office were  not

looked  after,  and the embassy had to  work  under

difficult  conditions, sometimes  without  even  a

typewriter.  Sir,  I think the Ministry  should  be

careful in setting up embassies, especially  before

sending  our Ambassadors and some of our  officials

abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other aspects where a lot of

improvement can be made. One is that in the country

that  I  am  referring to, the advance  party  went

ahead  and  rented a few houses for our  officials.

But  the Ministry was not yet in a position to send

the  required number of officials to this  embassy.

As  a result, the Foreign Ministry had to pay rents

for  these  houses which were not  occupied  for  a

considerable number of months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I want to take up is the

question  of furniture and other necessary fittings

for  the  houses of Ambassadors and  officials,  as

well  as for the embassy itself. In many instances,

I believe the cost of hiring these fittings is very

expensive in a number of foreign countries. It will

be  cheaper if they buy the required furniture  and

equipment before setting up the embassies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of houses for Ambassadors, some of

them  may  be located in proper diplomatic enclaves

in  these  countries, but they should be such  that

the  Ambassador  would be able to  entertain  other

Ambassadors  in  that country. If  the  houses  are

small,  then  the  problem of entertaining  becomes

very difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this year's vote for the Foreign Ministry

has  been increased. I hope that more care will  be

taken in setting up embassies abroad.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that, as we

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



not come to the Moment of interruption, I can enjoy

some  free  time  to speak on foreign  affairs.  No

doubt  just  now  I have missed the opportunity  to

speak  on  two  of  my amendments when  we  reached

"guillotine"  time.  But  the  second  part  of  it

pertaining  to  A.S.E.A.N. has already  been  dealt

with  by  the  Member  for Sembawang.  So  on  this

amendment  to cut the Minister's salary by  $10,  I

would like to join the crowd by airing my views  on

these two points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, we have to make annual

contributions to international organisations. There

are  organisations  like the United  Nations  under

which  you  have  the  United  Nations  Development

Programme, etc. I would like the Minister  to  give

this  House  an idea of how much Singapore  has  to

contribute   to   each   of   these   international

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the A.S.E.A.N. set-up.

A.S.E.A.N. was set up a few years ago, and over  the

last  few  years  the Foreign Ministers  of  member

countries  have been getting together and  Standing

Committees  have been formed. A lot  of  discussion

and  consultation  has been going  on,  and,  as  a

result, we are asked today to vote for a sum of  no

less than $3 million towards the A.S.E.A.N. Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would be grateful if the

Minister   for  Foreign  Affairs  would   care   to

elaborate on how and in what form the $3.08 million

would  be  utilised  towards the  A.S.E.A.N.  Fund.

Where  is  the base of operations, in other  words,

whether  it  is  in  Singapore,  Kuala  Lumpur,  or

Djakarta? And how many of its representatives  will

be grouped together in order to set up this central

body   to   control  the  membership  subscriptions

towards the A.S.E.A.N. fund?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is a follow-up of what my

colleague, the Member for Telok Blangah,  has  just

raised. This concerns our establishment of missions

overseas. I have had the opportunity to visit  some

of  our foreign missions, the chanceries, and  also

the  residences  of our Ambassadors.  My  point  is

this: we send our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



Ambassadors to represent Singapore.



The  image  of Singapore must, therefore,  be  well

projected, and one of the ways of doing  so  is  to

see  that every care and consideration - I  am  not

saying that no care has been taken - should be  given

towards  the  setting  up of  these  chanceries  or

getting adequate residences for our Ambassadors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another important point that we

should  remember:  the question of  staff.  In  the

course  of  my  visits to quite a number  of  these

foreign  missions, I have noticed  that  our  home-based  staff  are small in number, and the  locally

recruited staff are equally small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to reach the Moment of

interruption  because I want the Minister  to  give

his answers tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the staff recruitment in a mission is very

important in two respects. Let us say in a  mission

we  have staff from the Ambassador downwards, maybe

the  Counsellor,  then  the  First  Secretary,  the

Second  Secretary, a general clerical officer,  and

some  locally recruited staff. I am of the  opinion

that  in  quite a number of missions there is  much

work to be done, and the nature of the work is such

that  sometimes  it  has to be done  by  home-based

staff.  Let  us  take,  as  an  illustration,   our

Permanent Mission to the United Nations, New  York.

Looking  at  the staffing position,  we  have  four

locally recruited staff. But we do not know exactly

the  home  staffing position. I can make  a  guess.

There  is so much work to be done and some of  this

work should he handled by home-based staff. In this

respect, I am happy to note that there was  a  post

of Confidential Secretary in our High Commission in

London,  and I have brought this matter  up  today.

You  can  see  that  this post  has  got  a  little

abbreviation, "pa", which means that the  post  has

been  abolished. This goes to show that every  care

must  be  taken in recruiting staff. I shall  cover

the  other details at the proper time as I have put

in my amendments to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have brought up the question of extra

officers to he recruited for these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



various  overseas  missions,  Invariably  in   some

missions  we have only the First Secretary  and  an

Attache,  and  no Second or Third Secretary.  These

two  posts  of  Second  and Third  Secretaries  are

important.  Their duties will have to be  specially

defined  so  that they will know what to  do.  They

will  also take a load off the First Secretary.  In

some cases you will notice that we have Counsellors

in  the  various missions. I fully  agree  that  we

should  have Counsellors, but they are  so  few  in

number.  Will the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs  not

consider recruiting suitable officers to fill  such

posts?  Counsellors do a variety of work. No  doubt

they  are  only termed "Counsellors", but they  are

important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will

consider these suggestions and ensure that  in  the

next  or  future Budget Estimates,  there  will  be

provision for more officers, especially from home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the question of their

salaries.  I  am told that these are based  on  the
