<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Prime Minister

if  he  will instruct the Public Utilities  Board  to

install separate water meters for each stall  in  the

Housing  and Development Board Bendemeer Road  Market

at the Kallang Basin Estate Neighbourhood I, Phase 2,

and  in all markets and hawkers' centres where  water

supply is required by stallholders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed) (for the Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not feasible for

operational and economic reasons to install  separate

water meters for each stall either in the Housing and

Development  Board Bendemeer Road Market  or  in  all

markets and hawkers' centres. The total cost  of  the

meter  installation,  distribution,  maintenance  and

billing is high, and it is not justified by the small

consumption of water of each stallholder or hawker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At hawkers' pitches and markets under the control

of  the Hawkers' Branch, Ministry of Health, a single

meter  has  been  supplied for the  use  of  all  the

hawkers.  All the stalls at each of the new  hawkers'

pitches  at  Dunearn  Road, Orchard  Road  Car  Park,

Newton Circus, etc., have formed committees under the

guidance  of the Hawkers' Branch to look after  their

own   interests   and   to   work   out   their   own

administrative procedures. This arrangement  has  to-date  been found to work satisfactorily. Perhaps  the

stallholders  in  the Housing and  Development  Board

Bendemeer  Road  Market at the Kallang  Basin  Estate

Neighbourhood I, Phase 2, should be advised to form a

similar body to adopt such an arrangement.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, can the

Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office  say

whether  the Public Utilities Board will be  prepared

to  provide  public service if its profit goes  above

one cent from each stall-holder?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I have said earlier

on,  it  is  uneconomical to put  this  project  into

operation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Will the Minister of State

inform  the House if it is the opinion of the Housing

and  Development Board that each stall-holder  should

have his own water meter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if I may reply to that  supplementary

question.  This is not so much a question of  economy

as a question of convenience for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



all  hawkers and stallholders concerned,  as  in  the

example given, in which they formed themselves into a

committee and were served by one meter. This has been

done in many housing estates by many hawkers' stalls,

and  I see no reason why this could not also be  done

in the case of the estate mentioned by the Member.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is this an

introduction to a socialist way of life for one small

sector?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is not an introduction to a

socialist  way  of  life, but an  introduction  to  a

common-sense approach to problems.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Labour the number of workmen who have been insured by

their  employers  in  accordance with  the  Workmen's

Compensation Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

statistics  on  the number of workmen who  have  been

insured  by  their  employers are not  available.  It

should  be  pointed out that until  the  coming  into

force of the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment)  Act

in   November,  1971,  employers  were  not   legally

required to insure against their liability under  the

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would, however, appear that most of the

employers  do have insurance policies to cover  their

workmen.  From  reports received from employers  when

submitting  their accident reports, it  is  estimated

that  more  than  95 per cent of the  employers  have

insured  their  workmen under the provisions  of  the

Workmen's Compensation Act.

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour Inspectors when making their routine

inspection  will  check that employers  have  insured

themselves  in respect of their liability  under  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is also considering the possibility of

requesting  employers to submit returns to  ascertain

that  they  have  insured  themselves  against  their

liability under the Workmen's Compensation  Act.  The

necessary  regulations  and forms  will  have  to  be

published  and  staff found to check the  returns  if

Central  Provident  Fund is to provide  workers  with

some  savings  for  the time when  they  retire  from

To allow withdrawal of money from the Fund, before  a

member  has  qualified  for withdrawal  in  order  to

proceed  on  pilgrimage  to  Mecca,  would   not   be

Serangoon  Secondary Technical School  where  Science

and Mathematics are taught in English as from January

1969,  arising out of a policy decision,  it  is  not

made  compulsory to teach Science and Mathematics  in

English to the Malay-medium students in all the other

11  secondary schools. However, as early as in  1970,

the  principals of these schools have been encouraged

to  use  English  as  the medium of  instruction  for

smooth  implementation of this scheme to use  English

as  the  medium of instruction for these two subjects

in  the  Malay  secondary schools,  the  Ministry  of

Education explained the following five points to  the

school principals:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that there is no element of compulsion;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that the scheme need not be implemented

immediately if it is not feasible;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) that if it is feasible, a feasibility study

should  nevertheless be carried out with  a  view  to

implementing it as early as possible;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) that problems pertaining to equipment, staffing,

students' ability, and the parents' reaction must  be

carefully looked into; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) that even if implementation is feasible, the

scheme should be phased out gradually.

if  he plans to resite the creche at Moh Guan Terrace

in  Kampong  Tiong Bahru and expanding its  services;

or,  alternatively,  if he will consider  building  a

creche in Kampong Tiong Bahru.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are already adequate

creche facilities, including a children's centre,  in

the  Tiong Bahru and Kampong Tiong Bahru areas, which

are, in fact, within the distance of approximately  a

mile of each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no plan to resite the creche at Moh Guan

Terrace because it is rendering a valuable service to

working  mothers in the Tiong Bahru area as  well  as

Kampong Tiong Bahru. This creche has a capacity of 40

children, and its average daily attendance is 30.  If

this  creche  at  Mob Guan Terrace has  to  be  moved

elsewhere, especially out of Tiong Bahru itself, I am

sure  the Member for Tiong Bahru will agree  with  me

that the many working mothers in Tiong Bahru will  be

greatly  inconvenienced  by  being  deprived  of  the

necessary creche facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is appreciated that some of the residents

in  Kampong Tiong Bahru may require the facilities of

a creche, there already exists in the nearby Bukit Ho

Swee estate a Government creche run

creche, which has a capacity of 120 children, has  at

the   moment,   an   average  daily   attendance   of

approximately  one-half its total capacity.  As  this

creche  is in close proximity to Kampong Tiong Bahru,

there  should  be no difficulty for any  resident  of

Kampong  Tiong Bahru estate to avail herself  of  the

services of the Bukit Ho Swee creche. In fact,  there

are  already  20  children from Kampong  Tiong  Bahru

attending  this  creche daily. And  since  there  are

still many places in this creche for the children  of

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  Finance's painless Budget,  which  was

presented  to  this House last week,  has  been  well

received both inside and outside this House. What  is

most  welcome  is  his declaration that  no  new  tax

measures,  either directly or indirectly, are  to  be

introduced for the next financial year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>He has, in fact, "sweetened" the painless Budget with

certain  tax reliefs in order to benefit  the  common

man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement reflects the foresight of the

Government and the soundness of its economic planning

and  its  programmes of expansion in the past decade,

and  it exudes an atmosphere of quiet confidence  for

the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribute which the Minister for Finance paid to

the  workers of all ranks and occupations  for  their

contribution  to the success of Singapore's  economic

development is very appropriate. Now that the workers

can  see  for  themselves the fruits  of  their  past

efforts   and  sacrifices,  they  should   have   the

determination  to  work  even  harder  to  ensure   a

continuing,  if not greater, prosperity and  progress

in the coming years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of the Government, as reflected in the

Budget   Statement  presented  to  this  House,   and

elsewhere,  have  clearly  shown  that  it   is   not

oblivious  to  the  part played  by  workers  in  the

economic  development  of the  Republic.  As  far  as

practicable, the Government has made every attempt to

utilise   the   success   of   Singapore's   economic

development  for  social  upliftment  so  that  every

citizen of Singapore, including the workers, will  be

able to cultivate a more gracious life-style that  is

in  accord  with their enhanced financial  means.  In

this  respect, the recent decision of the  Government

to  increase the rates of the Central Provident  Fund

contributions  and also to increase the  remuneration

of employees in the public sector in order to promote

Government's  home-ownership  scheme  for   Singapore

citizens, is highly commendable. It is natural  that,

with  increasing  economic prosperity,  there  should

follow a rising level of our expectations which  have

manifested themselves in, for instance, the desire to

own  the house or flat in which we live, and also the

desire   for   more   and   better   facilities   for

recreational and cultural pursuits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the National Wages Council, in

which  the  Government,  the  National  Trades  Union

Congress, and the employers are equally represented,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



for  the purpose of formulating guidelines on  wages,

indicates an awareness of the need for workers to  be

given  an  equitable  stake  in  the  fruits  of  the

economic  development and progress of  Singapore.  At

the  same time it is vitally important for the future

of  the  Republic that wage increases should  not  be

allowed  to get out of hand or it would result  in  a

vicious spiral of inflation which can only damage the

interest of the Republic. The National Wages Council,

therefore,  has assumed a role of utmost significance

not  only to the workers but also to the rest of  the

people of Singapore, in that it serves as a regulator

for  the economic health of the Republic. In relation

to the economy of Singapore itself and in relation to

the  competition among the developing nations of  the

world   for  foreign  capital  and  investment,   the

difference  between  a rational and  a  chaotic  wage

policy  can  spell the difference between  prosperity

and disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the recent statement on the wage policy of

the  Government and other indications point to an era

of greater affluence for the workers of the Republic,

the fear that wage increases for the workers would be

more  than swallowed up by price increases  is  still

valid. Legislation for price controls may seem to  be

necessary  in  order  to  eliminate  profiteering  by

traders, but there are other practical considerations

which  are  likely to stultify such legislation.  For

this  reason,  the N.T.U.C, has decided  to  initiate

measures,  which  are  compatible  with  the  limited

resources  at  its disposal, to protect  the  workers

against  the  ravages of profiteering by unscrupulous

traders.  One  such measure is the  establishment  of

CASE (Consumers' Association of Singapore) to promote

a   greater   consciousness  among   the   individual

consumers   in  Singapore  against  exploitation   by

traders   in   respect  of  prices,   qualities   and

quantities of goods and services offered for sale  to

the public. Another measure is the proposal to set up

a Consumers' Co-operative which, by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



offering   goods   and  services  to   consumers   at

reasonable   prices,  will  place  the   unscrupulous

traders who charge extortionate prices at great risk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance

stated  that steps are being taken to streamline  the

Immigration procedures to ensure that persons who can

positively contribute to the economy of Singapore are

permitted  entry into the Republic. It  also  appears

that the Government is encouraging employers, both in

the  public and private sectors, to establish schemes

for  the  training of workers within the industry  as

part  of  a  scheme to develop and  to  use  our  own

manpower resources to its maximum so as to reduce our

dependence on foreign labour. On the face of it,  the

policies  of the Government in this area seem  to  be

correct. I must, however, draw the attention  of  the

Government  to the difference between the formulation

of  a policy and its actual implementation. While the

grounds for formulating a policy have been given  the

most careful consideration, the manner in which it is

implemented is, however, not given the same amount of

detailed consideration, and is consequently likely to

be fraught with abuses, some flagrant, some petty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the applicants are technicians and possess

technical  or  scientific  qualifications,  no  great

difficulty  is  entailed in  the  evaluation  of  the

economic  significance of their  talents.  But  where

they  possess skills which are based on aesthetic  or

popular  taste,  or fashion, for which  there  is  no

objective criterion, it frequently appears  that  the

policy  of the Government on the control of entry  of

foreign labour into the Republic is open to abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the employment of foreign

musicians.  With  the help of the  Tourist  Promotion

Board,  some  hoteliers and impresarios, have,  under

the  pretext  of  promoting  tourism,  succeeded   in

obtaining  entry  permits for foreign  musicians  who

are,  in  fact,  no better than our local  musicians.

Many  such foreign musicians, who have not been  able

to  make a name in their own countries or have yet to

gain inter-national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



national experience and reputation, are  willing  to

take on jobs at very low wages. It is hard to believe

that  tourists who come to Singapore from  the  three

main tourist countries, the United States, Japan  and

Australia,  where their own artistes are  of  a  much

higher   standard,  are  likely  to  return   to   be

entertained with such inferior musical talent.  As  a

result, there is resentment and frustration among the

local musicians for being unable to earn a living  in

this  trade  or to obtain an opportunity  to  improve

their  skills  for  employment in  the  international

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, when it became apparently necessary for

an   advertising   firm  to  effect  a   retrenchment

exercise, a local executive, not a foreign executive,

was  given the walking certificate, regardless of the

fact   that  the  local  executive  was  much  better

qualified. In such a situation, it would be extremely

difficult for the Immigration Department to  form  an

opinion  as  to whether the advertising  firm  should

have  dispensed  with  the services  of  the  foreign

executive  rather  than  the  local  executive.   The

talents  of  a good advertising executive  cannot  be

readily measured by any objective criteria. My  point

is  that  if an employer wishes to employ  a  foreign

executive  in  preference to a  local  executive,  it

would not be difficult for him to advance one pretext

or  another to convince the Immigration Department of

the   need  for  an  entry  permit  for  the  foreign

executive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the abuses resulting from the present mode of

implementation of Government's immigration policy  in

relation  to  foreign personnel, if left  unremedied,

would surely bring about a demoralising effect on the

local  personnel  who are qualified to  replace  such

foreign personnel. It is not only in the interests of

our  local technicians or executives but also in  the

interests  of  the  Republic  as  a  whole  that  the

Government's immigration policy should be implemented

in a constructive manner so as to give a fair balance

between the need for foreign expertise and skill  and

the need to give our local citizens every opportunity

to acquire such expertise and skill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that the Government will be able to

take   the   necessary  steps   to   streamline   our

immigration procedures so as to eradicate the  abuses

in respect of the employment of foreign personnel. In

my  view, it will be a step in the right direction if

the  Government  is  able to set up  a  "consultative

machinery"  whereby the Immigration Department  could

form a reasonably correct judgment as to whether  the

skill of any foreigner is of any use to the Republic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

present Budget is not only the third painless  Budget

in  the last three years but it also provides six tax

reliefs,  especially in a situation of  international

monetary  instability  and the  final  phase  of  the

British   military   withdrawal.   This   undoubtedly

reflects our strong economic position and it provides

a  boost for the attraction of investment, both  from

Singapore and abroad. Obviously, the emphasis of  the

Budget  is  to meet the problems and the consequences

of  industrialisation and commercial  development  in

the  coming  years. As the Minister for  Finance  has

said, our aim is to transform Singapore which has  an

economic  growth rate of 15 per cent into a  regional

centre   for   brain  services  and   brain   service

industries within 10 years. This aim is very  fitting

to  a  country like ours. We should make full use  of

the good qualities of our people and try our best  to

develop   industries  which  do  not   occupy   large

stretches  of  land,  so  that  we  may  achieve  and

maintain  an annual economic growth rate  of  15  per

cent.   This   will  also  help  to  complement   the

development of our neighbouring countries which  have

large expanses of territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister, earnings from tourism

continued to grow and showed an increase of 17.2  per

cent  in  1971 as compared with that for the previous

year, 1970. However, the Minister also said that  the

hotel occupancy rate has fallen from 73.5 per cent in

1969  to  70.7 per cent in 1970 and down to 65.4  per

cent in 1971. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



shows  that  the hotel occupancy rate is  going  down

while  the number of tourists coming to Singapore  is

increasing.  The Tourist Promotion Board should  work

out   a   solution,  otherwise  its  expenditure   on

publicity  and  promotional efforts to  attract  more

tourists will not be justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the six tax relief measures, that for

accelerated   depreciation   for   industrial   anti-pollution  devices  is  the most  meaningful  to  the

health  of  our  people. The other reliefs  will  not

benefit  our people as much as this one. Our  people,

be  they property owners or otherwise, have the right

to   enjoy  a  clean  and  healthy  environment.  The

Government  is  expecting a loss of $3.5  million  in

revenue by implementing these tax reliefs. This shows

that the interest of the masses is not forgotten.  If

the  factory owners delay the installation  of  anti-pollution  devices  in  their  factories,  then   the

Department  concerned will have  the  right  to  take

enforcement measures against them forthwith.  As  the

Minister has said, these six tax reliefs are meant to

assist Government's economic and social policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has all along been trying to promote

and to preserve the good cultural characteristics and

heritage of our people and also to uphold the  family

link  and  good  tradition  of  piety  towards  one's

elders.  All this is worth preserving. We can achieve

this if we encourage our people to do it through  our

taxation policies and measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider providing tax

reliefs for taxpayers who maintain their parents.  At

the  moment  there is tax relief for  the  taxpayer's

wife and children. Since we are going to increase the

remission  of income tax from $100 to $300 per  annum

for  expenditure  on maintenance of gardens,  I  hope

that  at  the  proper time the Government  will  also

allow  taxpayers a certain relief for the maintenance

of their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painless Budget for the third year presented

during  a situation of international monetary  crisis

is most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



satisfactory  to  all.  With  the  various   measures

proposed  in the Budget, we will be able  to  achieve

and to maintain an annual economic growth rate of  15

per cent.

<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   I  rise  to  offer   my   heartiest

congratulations to the Minister for Finance  for  his

very lucid presentation of the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greater consequence than the Budget details for

next  year is the ambitious development plan for this

decade   revealed  by  the  Minister.  The   policies

outlined  are far-reaching in scope and are  designed

to implement vast economic and social changes in this

decade.  The economic changes targeted are tremendous

for,  at  the  rate of 15 per cent a year  growth  in

Gross  National  Product, our G.N.P, will  double  in

five years and quadruple within a decade!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate question that comes to mind is

whether  the  rate  of  15 per cent  is  feasible.  I

believe  it is attainable because the technology  gap

is  still  large  and we can bring in  the  necessary

expertise and manpower. Moreover, the strategy is  to

produce  for  world  markets and  to  increase  local

skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has outlined five basic areas of

policy,  namely,  manpower, science  and  technology,

infrastructure, taxation and promotion. I would  like

to  draw attention to four policy areas, two of which

are not covered by the Minister's speech.



<br><br><i>Wage Policy</i>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns wage policy. The key terms of

reference of the National Wages Council is to  assist

in  the  development of a wage structure,  consistent

with long-term economic and social development. There

are four aspects here that need attention:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Major wage changes will occur if demand greatly

exceeds  supply  of labour. To prevent  this,  it  is

necessary  to co-ordinate manpower supply and  demand

and to recommend appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



immigration  and  increased supply of  local  skills.

This   is,  by  far,  the  most  critical   task   in

formulating wage policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Increases in wage rates in the leading sectors

affect  adversely  the  supply  of  labour  to  other

sectors.  Wage  adjustments  in  these  sectors   are

necessary  and  can lead to closure of  firms  unless

increases   in  productivity  are  made  via   better

organisation,  modernisation  or  incentive  schemes.

Here  is  where the National Productivity Centre  can

play a decisive role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) From time to time, wage adjustments are also

required  in the public sector to prevent a drain  of

manpower  and expertise. Here, the Wages Council  can

help via regular surveys of wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In a rapidly growing economy, the income gap

between  the haves and the have-nots tends to  widen,

unless  a  conscious effort is made  to  prevent  it.

Here,  the  Government  can set  a  good  example  by

allowing  a higher percentage increase in  wages  for

low-wage  earners  and  a  lower  one  for  high-wage

earners.



<br><br><i>Rentals and Land Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from wage policy, attention must be paid to

development  of a coherent land and property  policy.

Appreciation in property values leads to higher rents

which  are  passed  on  to consumers  through  higher

retail  prices. More crucially, production costs  are

increased,  affecting  our  competitive  position  in

world  markets. Long leases on industrial  land  give

windfall  gains  for  some.  Quite  clearly,  in  the

interests  of equity and efficiency, a coherent  land

and property policy needs to be defined.



<br><br><i>Pricing of Public Goods and Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point I wish to discuss is the pricing of

public   goods   and   services,  especially   public

utilities.  These  are  public monopolies  and  their

pricing  policy affects producers and  consumers.  At

present,  each statutory board sets its  own  pricing

policy,  whether to cover costs only  or  to  make  a

profit. I believe an overall advisory body to develop

a  consistent  pricing policy for  public  goods  and

services is needed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Capital Market</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech the Minister referred to the

importance  of  developing  a  capital  market.   The

abolition of stamp duties on credit instruments is  a

right  step.  I believe some thought should  also  be

given   to  the  development  of  a  secondary  stock

exchange  to  deal with securities which are  riskier

and  do  not meet present Stock Exchange regulations.

The  development  of  a capital market  is  important

because modern corporations require more capital than

the traditional family enterprises can provide.



<br><br><i>Social Adjustments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which the Minister could not cover in his

long   Budget  speech  is  the  problem   of   social

adjustments to rapid economic development. On  recent

occasions  I  have talked about the tensions  arising

from  urban  renewal, a growing income  gap  and  the

demonstration  effects of spending  by  the  rich  on

luxury  goods. Immigration of workers will give  rise

to  social frictions, since non-citizens do not enjoy

the  same housing, health and educational privileges.

Recently, Government announced the provision of  some

housing   for  immigrant  workers.  Nevertheless,   I

foresee  pressures  developing  for  the  easing   of

permanent residence and citizenship qualifications as

young  immigrant workers get married to Singaporeans.

I am fully confident that the Government will be able

to  deal  with these social problems. There  is  much

more  room  for  adjustment in an  economy  which  is

expanding!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome Government's move to narrow the wage-gap

between the public and private sectors and to  narrow

the  income-gap.  In particular,  the  increased  tax

relief  for  low income taxpayers and remission  from

estate duty on small estates deserve our full support

because they are steps towards a more just and  equal

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 12 years the Government has worked

for  Singapore's long-term viability.  It  has  never

made  empty election promises and has never hesitated

to   take  strong  and  painful  measures  to  secure

Singapore's future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



There  is  great  concern for equity  as  the  Budget

shows,  but  not  at the expense of  our  future.  If

Singapore is to achieve the bold targets laid down in

the Budget in the next ten years, we have to ensure a

continuing political stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Government's

policy as presented in the Budget.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on  the  7th  of this month  the  Minister  for

Finance  announced  his Budget  proposals,  in  which

there  are  no  tax increases or new taxes.  Instead,

there  are  increased tax reliefs which  benefit  the

people  in  the  middle and the lower income  groups.

This is a far-sighted and satisfactory budget. It  is

most welcome and has the support of all the people in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremendous progress and stability and peace in

Singapore  can  be attributed to the enlightened  and

able leadership of our Prime Minister and his Cabinet

colleagues, together with the co-operation  and  hard

work  of  our  people. Over the  past  decade,  these

people  have taken great steps and concerted  efforts

to  ensure  the success of our industrialisation  and

continuing prosperity of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us take a look at the

countries  around  us, far and near.  Their  economic

development is not as good as we would imagine. Every

year  they have to increase taxes in varying degrees.

But the people of Singapore on the contrary have been

fortunate  to  enjoy painless budgets over  the  past

three  years.  These are clear indications  that  our

economy is very sound, evidenced by a surplus in  our

budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already modernised. However, our

people  should  not be complacent  with  the  present

prosperity  and  success. They  must  take  concerted

efforts  to  continue the hard work  to  ensure  that

there  is  continuing economic growth for  Singapore,

and  that there is always a great deal of surplus  in

our Budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now look at the advanced

countries,  such  as  the  United  States  and  Great

Britain. At one time they had peace at home, and they

enjoyed the greatest riches of the world. But because

of  the social indiscipline, lack of organisation and

hard  work  on the part of their people  in  general,

their  economy  is on the decline, resulting  in  the

devaluation  of  the  U.S, dollar  and   the   Pound

sterling. Therefore, what happened to them can  serve

as  an object lesson to us. We must continue with our

hard  work and frugality. This is of great importance

to a small country like Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of science and technology and

industrialisation in Singapore, other  problems  come

into  evidence. There are tendencies among our people

to  take  life easy and to enjoy the good  things  of

life.  They  tend  to be more concerned  with  making

money  than  with  getting themselves  interested  in

matters  of national importance. They even resort  to

degenerating and corrosive habits. As a result, there

is  a  mounting wave of crime and some form of social

unrest and disorder in Singapore. For example, we can

see  that  there  is  an increase in  secret  society

activities,  and  that  crimes like  rape,  gambling,

murder, kidnapping, blackmail, traffic offences,  and

tax evasion, are being committed in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is also subject to the degenerating

influence of the West. Some of our young people  take

to  "with-it-ism". They turn to drugs and  keep  long

hair,  thereby creating very serious social problems.

These   are  the  by-products  of  prosperity.   This

degenerating   influence  has   come   from   Western

countries  which, although industrially advanced,  do

not care much about the welfare and problems of their

youths.   Instead  of  finding  solutions  to   these

problems,  they resort to permissiveness.  Therefore,

we  must  be very careful about our youths. Half  our

population consists of young people under the age  of

21 years. We must take immediate steps to ensure that

our  social  discipline does not  suffer  or  is  not

affected by such influences.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government must continue in its economic

and  social  construction, it must at the  same  time

ensure  that such corrosive influence from  the  West

does  not  become too much of a problem in Singapore.

We  are  a  small country without natural  resources.

Although we have some cultural ballast inherited from

the  past, we must make sure that this poisonous  and

corrosive  influence  from  the  West  shall  not  be

allowed to gain a hold in Singapore, particularly  to

affect  the youths. We must not allow our  youths  to

degenerate as did the youths in the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that in this direction the

Government has set up the Central Narcotics Bureau to

take  effective and immediate action to combat  drug-taking.  At  the  same time the Government  has  also

declared  "war" against long hair. But  in  spite  of

this  action, we can still see people with long  hair

moving  around  in  Singapore.  They  are  still  "at

large". They claim to be "progressive", and are "with

it". They even ignore the advice of the Government. I

would  therefore  suggest that  the  Government  take

legislative action against the keeping of long  hair.

We  should not be afraid of criticisms against us for

being  undemocratic and for interfering with personal

liberty. I am sure that the people of Singapore  will

understand  and  will be on our  side.  In  order  to

ensure  that there is a fine and proper social ethos,

the   Government  should  also  take  steps  in   the

following direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, yellow culture should be banned. To ensure

that  our  young people and our work  force  are  not

corroded  by  this Western influence, the  Government

must  take immediate steps to ban yellow publications

and  stop  their  circulation in Singapore.  Instead,

encouragement should be given to good and  beneficial

publications and film shows. The educational level of

the people should be raised, and made fully aware  of

the   evils  of  yellow  culture.  Healthy   cultural

activities shou1d be encouraged and conducted in  the

various  sections of the society. In  this  way,  the

people  will  have beneficial and healthy recreations

to counter the corrosive Western influence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, low-taste films should be banned in

Singapore. At present, there are far too many  sword-fighting movies This is bad for our young people.  We

must  further  tighten  the film  censorship  in  the

interest of our country. Films or movies which have a

bad effect on our citizens should be banned. Instead,

encouragement  should be given to  the  screening  of

beneficial  films in the cinemas. In this  way,  more

educational films will be shown, and the people  will

learn through them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would urge the Government to take

stringent   measures  against  the  importation   and

circulation  of undesirable gramophone  records  from

overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the social ethos should be reformed. To

do  this,  it is necessary to begin at home.  Parents

must  set good examples to their children, and should

not  concern  themselves merely  with  making  money.

Otherwise they would neglect the education  of  their

children,  which is equally important. Children  will

be  well-educated only if they receive education both

at home and in school Then they will be patriotic and

able  to  resist  the  corrosive Western  influence..

Therefore, I urge that, our economy permitting, there

should  be  a  whole-day session at secondary  school

level, so that students will be able to spend more of

their time usefully in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in short, the rise or fall of a

country  depends on the social ethos  prevailing.  No

doubt,  we  must  do all we can to  ensure  that  our

national economy is properly maintained. Moreover, we

should  remove  all  undesirable  influences  in  our

society.  The people should be urged to work together

and  to work hard for the national interest. In  this

way, a bright future for Singapore is then assured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on behalf of the people of Thomson, I

support this Budget policy.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

the  four hon. Members who spoke before me have aptly

commended the Minister for Finance for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



his  Budget Statement. I think this is the first time

that any Finance Minister in any country has not only

presented a Budget without new taxation measures  but

has also given away revenue amounting to $3.5 million

approximately.  I  may be wrong.  The  historians  in

Parliament can clarify this. Any benefits to anybody,

although  the benefits given by the Finance  Minister

would  not  be for the lower income group, should  be

applauded. In fact, at the end of his speech, Members

of the House did applaud in complete disregard of the

Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are grateful to the Minister for Finance

who acknowledged the efforts of the workers for their

contributions  for a very successful year.  With  the

rapid  withdrawal of the British military  forces  in

1971,  never in the wildest dreams did the people  of

Singapore expect a 14 per cent increase in our  Gross

National  Product. However, this has  been  achieved,

and  the credit goes to the Government as well as  to

our   workers   for  their  hard  work,   dedication,

restraint  and co-operation. When I say "workers",  I

do  not  confine  it only to workers in  the  private

sector  and  lower ranks of the public  service,  but

also  include  our  top  civil  servants  and  senior

statutory board employees. People who work with their

brain  are  as much a worker as those who  work  with

their brawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion our economic progress in the past few

years   has  also  been  the  result  of  the  unique

political situation obtainable in Singapore  today  -

without any official parliamentary opposition  as  we

have  in this Chamber today. Sir, being a responsible

Government, we have been able to plan and execute our

policies  with the object of obtaining what  is  good

for  our people. Our actions have been geared to what

we  can  do  best  for the people  to  improve  their

material,  cultural, educational and aesthetic  well-being,   without  always  worrying  about  what   the

Opposition Members of Parliament would say. In  other

words, as Back-benchers, we do not have the slightest

desire to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



a  noise in Parliament just for the sake of it, so as

to  be able to subserve the purpose of getting votes.

The   time  of  the  Ministers,  Minister  of  State,

Parliamentary Secretaries, Members of Parliament  and

civil  servants  has not been wasted in  unnecessary,

irrelevant, or hair-splitting arguments in  order  to

score   points  and  win  votes  for  the  Opposition

political   party,  but  rather  spent  usefully   in

planning for a better life for our citizens.  If  the

composition of this House were different, if  we  had

representatives   from  any  of   the   irresponsible

political  parties  that have  mushroomed  in  recent

months,  we would have squandered a lot of time  with

arguments   designed  to  catch  the   ear   of   the

electorate, rather than to safeguard the interest  or

welfare of Singaporeans. Members on this side of  the

House   have  criticised  the  Government  and   will

continue  to do so not to score points, but  to  make

constructive  and  objective  criticisms.  Very   few

people in Singapore realise that our achievements  in

the  past few years, with odds against us, have  been

the  result  of all 58 Members of this  House  coming

from  the  same Party, and that Parliament  has  been

able to initiate necessary action with the minimum of

fuss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one newspaper has described our Minister for

Finance, after his Budget speech, by saying  that  he

has scored "first a hat-trick and then a Six". May  I

extend  the analogy of the cricket language by adding

that  he  has also played his way into the  pages  of

"Wisdens".  In  fact,  I have been  waiting  to  hear

criticisms  from Opposition parties on the  Financial

Statement. Not a squeak has been heard, which goes to

prove   that   our  Budget  has  not  been   a   mean

achievement. Any Opposition party would be  hard  put

to  improve  it. Sir, the increase in  earned  income

relief  will  benefit  about  33,000  taxpayers.  The

increase  in the exemption from $6,000 to $12,000  in

the net annual value of owner-occupied residences for

income   tax   purposes  will  benefit  house-owners,

including those who live in palatial homes. Remission

from  Estate  Duty  on  estates between  $10,000  and

Board flat owners. Good luck to them. Except for

the  $1,000  income tax exemption, I have  looked  in

vain  in  our financial policy for benefits  for  our

lower  income  group of workers, i.e, the  one-  room

Housing   Board   flat  dwellers,   the   unfortunate

unemployable persons. Every citizen has a right to  a

share of whatever prosperity the Republic enjoys. The

annual allowance of one month's salary for workers in

the public sector is a welcome gesture. They now look

forward  to  the Wages Council's recommendations.  We

hope this will provide some additional benefit in the

form of an increase in wages for wage-earners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am pointing out is that the lower income

group  will not benefit from the exemptions that  the

Finance  Minister has outlined. We have to find  ways

and  means of raising the standard of living of  this

group. One aspect of this is the anomaly found in the

Public   Utilities   Board   charges   for   use   of

electricity. Sir, the rich and the well-to-do live in

comfortable air-conditioned rooms and pay at the rate

of  7 cents per unit for electricity consumed. On the

other  hand,  the  poor, who cannot  afford  an  air-conditioner, have to be contented with a ceiling  fan

which  only circulates the hot air in the  room,  and

they  have  to pay 18 cents per unit. I should  think

that  the charge should be the other way round.  This

is  one  way of giving indirect relief to  the  lower

income  group.  I  am sure our able Finance  Minister

will  find means of distributing our fortune a little

more  in  favour of the lower income  group  than  it

appears in his Budget speech for this year.

Speaker,  Sir, on behalf of the people  of  the  Paya

Lebar  constituency, may I express my admiration  for

the  Budget  proposals  for the  new  financial  year

announced by the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we look at past history and at

conditions  prevailing in the surrounding  countries,

we  will  find  that  if the financial  policy  of  a

country



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



is  to  allow  a small number of people  to  enjoy  a

better life and to force the majority of - the people

to  go  through  a more difficult and  hard  life  or

suffer  greater hardships, then the economy  of  that

country  will go from bad to worse. It might even  go

to a point beyond redemption. We all know that in any

society  the middle and lower income groups form  the

majority  of the people. If they have a better  life,

then  they will form the base of a motivational force

in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Budget for the new

financial year, there is provision made for an  extra

one  month's  salary  as annual allowance  for  civil

servants  and  also  for  those  working  in   quasi-Government bodies as announced by the Prime  Minister

earlier.  The Government also intends to  review  the

salary scales of the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget also there are no new taxes. On the

contrary,  there  are  six  tax  reliefs.  There  is,

therefore, no additional burden on the workers in the

middle and lower income groups. This a wise and  far-sighted  move  on the part of our Government.  It  is

also  in line with our Government's policy to  strive

for  a  more equitable distribution of wealth amongst

the  people. It has been the Government's policy  all

along  that the income gap between the rich  and  the

poor  should be narrowed. The standard of  living  of

the  people should be raised. There should be greater

equality among the various classes of people  in  our

society. Therefore, in this respect, this Budget is a

most  outstanding one and we welcome it.  It  is  not

only a "painless" one but is also far-sighted. It  is

a  positive  contribution to the development  of  our

country. If we analyse carefully the economy  of  our

country, we can see that the economic development  of

Singapore is well advanced. However, there are  still

many  difficult  problems  which  will  require   our

renewed efforts to overcome them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Budget, there is a

provision   of  $209,700,000  for  the  Ministry   of

Education. This represents an increase of $18 million

over that for 1971. However, if we consider our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



education  policy as a whole, we will  see  that  the

increased  provision for this Ministry is mainly  for

the expansion of technical education in order to meet

the  increased  demand for skilled  workers  for  our

industries. Under the present circumstances, in order

to  cope with the industrialisation programme of  our

country,  there  is a pressing need  to  train  large

numbers of workers to acquire the necessary technical

skills within a short space of time. This is indeed a

step in the right direction. It is, therefore, beyond

reproach. However, from the long-term point of  view,

if we over-emphasise technical education to the point

where  we  overlook or omit education in  the  social

sciences  and  the  other arts, then,  I  think  this

policy cannot be a perfect one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote an example. Today

Singapore is going through a period of prosperity. It

has been brought about through the able leadership of

our political leaders, from the Prime Minister to the

Ministers,  Ministers  of  State,  and  Parliamentary

Secretaries. All of them are not specialists  in  the

technical  field.  Therefore, I  think  that  in  our

efforts to train more and more people in the field of

technical  education, we should  not  overlook  their

training  in the field of social sciences  and  other

arts.  We should not neglect this field of education,

otherwise  we will one day be faced with a  situation

where  we do not have the people well trained in  the

social sciences.

the  Finance  Minister  for a Budget  which  is  both

instructive and stimulating. -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement that there will not be additional

taxes  is welcome and the tax reliefs, especially  of

income  tax  on  the imputed income of owner-occupied

houses,  income tax allowance for earned  income  for

low  income salary earners, and estate duty on  small

estates, will,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



I am sure, endear him to our people, but certainly to

the people of Serangoon Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low income salary earners in my constituency

will  appreciate the removal of the 20 per cent limit

in  the  income tax deductions for earned income  and

the  raising  of  the  tax  allowance  to  a  maximum

deduction of $1,000. The middle income salary earners

in the Serangoon Gardens constituency who, by dint of

diligent  duty  and  by stint of scrupulous  savings,

have  acquired  a modest house for a home  will  also

appreciate  the remission of estate duty  on  estates

between $10,000 and $25,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I trust that the Finance Minister's

ministration  of  the exchequer  throughout  the  new

fiscal year will enable him to endear himself to  all

of  us once more next year on a similar occasion,  to

which  point my constituents and I look forward  with

abiding expectation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But very much more than expectations will be

required  of  each  of us if we are  to  sustain  the

economic growth which we have registered so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though our economic performance will be affected by

international  monetary  and  trading  uncertainties,

there  is  reason  to  believe  that  we  have  taken

measures  to protect our economy through a policy  of

selective  investment by multi-national manufacturing

companies  which have, as the Minister  puts  it,  "a

scope   for-   progressive  growth  in  technological

content in their manufactures". -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of this policy depends, among other

things, on the availability of an adequate indigenous

technological capability together with the  will  and

discipline   to  strive  for  economic   growth   and

security.  The  former requisite may be  achieved  by

proper  planning,  stimulation  and  organisation  of

human  resources.  The latter, however,  is  a  human

attribute  determined  by genetic  endowment,  values

acquired  in  the  family  during  growth   and   the

persuasions of the social and cultural environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a new generation in our society, born after

the  last  World War, is bursting into adulthood  and

constitutes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



tutes the new manpower of the nation. While expecting

the  different social and intellectual responses  and

life-styles  of a new generation, our survival  as  a

nation   demands  that  our  human  resources  remain

industrious, disciplined and relentlessly striving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough to ensure the continuation of this

human  resource  with the promise of  personal  gain.

Personal  gain is a strong motivation, but by  itself

it  is  socially disintegrative. And as we move  into

the  era of the multi-national corporation and as our

city  shapes into a global city with global exposure,

the  problems  of  social  integration  and  national

cohesion become correspondingly more acute.  In  this

situation, social discipline becomes a critical need.

But  at  the same time discipline provokes resistance

because,  on  the  one  hand,  youth  today  is  more

enlightened  and independent and, on the other  hand,

it  is more intensely exposed to the liberal norms of

behaviour  of  other  societies.  Indeed,  Sir,   the

problems  of  a new and youthful generation  are  now

only just emerging and will require our attention and

energies  in the immediate future despite - in  fact,

it  is because of - the high growth rate which all of

us hope will be achieved in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pleasure in supporting the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on behalf of the people of  Sembawang,

may I express my support for this Budget for the next

financial  year which was presented by  the  Minister

for  Finance  on  the 7th of this month.  His  Budget

Statement contained very good news. For example,  not

only  will there be no new taxes, but there will also

be  no  increases in the rates of existing taxes.  On

the  contrary, six items of tax reliefs are  granted;

thus  the  benefits to the people are  increased.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, these measures are for the welfare  of

our  people.  The  good start that  we  have  at  the

beginning  of  this year is, I am sure, conducive  to

economic  expansion. It will be  a  stimulus  to  our

plans for further industrialisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has made a detailed

statement  on  the international monetary  situation,

and  touched  on, for example, the upward revaluation

of  the  German Mark, the devaluation of the American

Dollar,  and  the 10 per cent surcharge on  all  U.S.

imports  levied by the American Government  in  1971.

The  effects  of these measures on the  rest  of  the

world, more particularly South-east Asia, are severe.

They  have  led to a recession in trade.  However,  a

comforting thought is that, despite the international

trade   recession,  we  have  been  able  to  survive

economically,  and above that we have  been  able  to

achieve a growth rate of 14 per cent. This is a  rare

achievement. It goes to show that the economy of  our

country  is  strong,  and  that  in  spite  of  these

difficulties and recurrent problems we have been able

to achieve this high growth rate. We are thus able to

enjoy the prosperity of our stringent economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has also mentioned

that  our  per  capita  Gross  National  Product  has

increased from $2,960 in 1970 to $3,317 in 1971. As a

result,  the purchasing power of our people has  also

increased.  This  is  an  important  factor  in   our

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the success of our

industrialisation  programme  is  dependent  on  good

leadership   and  planning  on  the   part   of   our

Government.  The  departments  concerned  have   been

playing a leading role in this respect. However,  our

workers  have  also  put in their  efforts.  The  co-operation  between employers and employees  has  also

contributed  to  our success. Many of  our  factories

have  increased their production. Industrial disputes

have been reduced to the minimum. In fact, the number

of strikes has been minimal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all this, our Gross Domestic Product has

increased  substantially  and  the  standing  of  our

country  is very high in the international scene.  We

have attracted more and more investors from overseas.

This,  in  turn,  will  lead to  a  higher  level  of

industrialisation  and economic  expansion.  We  know

that  this  success  is the result  of  the  combined

effort  of  all  our  people.  We  must  ensure   the

qualities of perseverance and industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



try  of  our  people are maintained, so that  in  the

coming years we can achieve yet greater objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the need for public

health. As everybody knows, the medical care  in  our

country has enjoyed a very good reputation. Following

the  rapid  economic  expansion of  our  country  and

population  growth,  the Ministry  of  Health  has  a

greater  and  more important role  to  play.  At  the

moment,  we  have three big hospitals. We have  taken

over  the Sembawang and Alexandra Hospitals from  the

British  Armed  Forces.  These  two  hospitals   will

contribute greatly to the well-being of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have achieved a great deal, there are

certain  areas  for improvement. On the  Ministry  of

Health,  I  would  like to put  forward  two  points.

First,  I  hope  that the Minister  for  Health  will

consider providing in the hospitals beds for  parents

whose children are hospitalised so that they can look

after  their children. Secondly, I hope the  Minister

will  consider increasing the number of  surgeons  in

our hospitals so that cases which require surgery can

be dealt with speedily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our policy is to build more hawker centres for

the benefit of the hawkers, so that their standard of

living will be gradually improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the question of rural

development.  We  know that our Government  has  been

working hard to provide facilities for the people  in

the   rural   areas.  A  good  example  is  Sembawang

constituency.  Through the efforts of the  Urban  and

Rural Services Committee, the Government has provided

more  than  a million dollars for the Sembawang  area

for   various   public   services,   such   as   road

construction, drainage, rural electrification (Street

lighting and domestic electricity) and water  supply.

All  these  projects have improved the appearance  of

Sembawang constituency. Of course, the Government has

been  working  not  only to benefit  constituents  in

Sembawang   but  also  those  in  the   other   rural

constituencies. The Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



taken these measures to improve the lot of the people

in  the  rural  areas.  It  goes  to  show  that  the

Government  believes  in the  fundamental  tenets  of

democratic socialism. It is also trying to reduce the

gap  in the standard of living between the people  in

the  city and the people in the rural areas, so  that

everyone can enjoy the fruits of our economic growth.

For  the next financial year, the provision for urban

and  rural services is $3.25 million, as compared  to

52.5  million for last year. There is an increase  of

about  $700,000. This is, in fact, good news for  the

people   in   the  rural  areas.  I  am  sure   rural

development from now on will continue to improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy to note that the Minister for

Finance  has  emphasised in his Budget Statement  the

need  for defence and national security. There  is  a

need for administrative skills in matters of national

defence,  and the training of personnel  in  all  the

various  fields can play an important part in raising

the  educational  level of our  Armed  Forces.  These

measures are important for the strengthening  of  our

armed forces. In addition, I think that there is also

a  need  to  inculcate  a  sense  of  patriotism  and

national  consciousness in our  youths,  so  that  in

times  of  crisis  they  will  be  prepared  to  make

sacrifices for the country and for their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, the Budget for the next financial

year  certainly meets the approval of all the  people

in  Singapore. Let me express my full support for the

Minister and for his words of praise for the  workers

of  Singapore. Because of the spirit of dedication of

our  workers,  our country has survived  the  various

international crises, and our economy is  stable  and

prosperous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to call upon all the people

in  our country, irrespective of colour or class,  to

come  together and, in a united effort, take part  in

nation-building  and  to  strive  for   yet   greater

achievements in the next financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Finance Minister's Budget

proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in spite of the difficulties  arising

out  of  an international economic recession and  the

British  military withdrawal, resulting in a loss  of

$400 million in British military expenditure, we  are

presented  with  yet  another  painless  Budget.  The

Minister  for  Finance informed  us  that  our  Gross

National  Product  has reached $7,000.8  million,  an

increase of 14 per cent over the previous year.  This

is a clear indication of the correct economic policy,

our  political and social stability and the diligence

and   verve   of   the  people  of   Singapore.   The

announcement by the Prime Minister on the payment  of

an   annual  allowance  of  one  month's  salary   to

Government  servants  and  the  promise   of   salary

adjustments  in the next financial year is  really  a

piece of good news to the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a tremendous inflow of foreign

capital  into  Singapore, coupled with  a  growth  in

construction,   industrialisation  and  urbanisation,

thus   resulting  in  a  rise  in   the   prices   of

commodities.  The  cost  of  living  is,   therefore,

rising,  and this gives the situation in which  wages

and the cost of living are racing against each other,

somewhat  like  a race between the tortoise  and  the

hare.  Therefore,  the  wage-earners  are  always  in

difficulty in the face of a rising cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our productivity is progressing, our economy

is  developing steadily, and our national  income  is

increasing every year. As the Prime Minister and  the

Minister for Labour have recently said, the fruits of

prosperity  and  economic  growth  should  be  shared

equitably  amongst all the people and should  not  be

monopolised by a minority at the expense of the  hard

work  done by the workers. The adjustments  of  wages

and  the rationalisation of conditions of work should

be  carried out now. We must raise their income,  for

in  this  way the working class will have a sense  of

security,  and  will feel proud that  they  are  also

contributing to the economic growth and prosperity of

Singapore by their efforts. This will give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



them  further  impetus  to  face  the  challenge   to

increase  their  productivity.  They  will  also   be

prepared  to  meet  new changes and  to  continue  to

contribute to nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having achieved political, economic and social

stability, we should now have a look at our  society.

A  new or reasonable society does not mean that it is

faultless  or without failings. There are aspects  of

some of our people inclined to the darker side of our

society.  We  must  bring them round  to  the  proper

track,  so that they can correct themselves. We  must

have  the  courage  and the confidence  to  plan  for

further progress towards greater equality of all  the

people.  We must think of ways and means to help  the

poor  and aged people with big families, particularly

the  daily-rated  employees.  Because  of  their  low

wages,  they have to take up part-time employment  or

even  part-time peddling as unlicensed hawkers. Under

the  heavy  burden and great pressure, they  have  to

work  day-in and day-out and most of them are  plying

their  goods along the roadside to earn their  living

against  the law. Therefore, we must try  and  devise

some ways to assist these poor people. Perhaps we can

grant  them  temporary licences or even give  them  a

rent   subsidy   to   help  them  tide   over   their

difficulties  arising out of low  wages  until  their

sons or daughters are able to work to supplement  the

income of their family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we should also build more cr�ches in

industrial  or Housing and Development Board  estates

in  order  to allow the wives of people of middle  or

lower  age group from this section to enter into  the

labour  market,  so that the total  income  of  their

family  will  increase and be able to meet  the  high

cost  of living. In this way, our work force will  be

increased to meet the needs of our industrialisation.

We  may  make use of the community centres as cr�ches

by  improving and providing more facilities  for  the

children.  The  cr�ches  will  also  bring   together

children  of various walks of life and ensure  social

integration at a very tender age. The children put in

these  cr�ches  will benefit much from the  education

provided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



there. And with better education for the  poor

children,  the  vicious  cycle  of  the  poor  people

remaining  poor forever from generation to generation

can be broken down, and we shall be able to bring  up

a better generation for our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as in other industrial countries, Singapore is

also confronted with the shortage of labour. This  is

inevitable.  According to the statistics provided  by

the Ministry of Labour, we have already issued 60,000

work  permits.  This  serious  labour  shortage   has

brought  about an immigration of foreign labour  from

neighbouring  countries and even from  countries  far

away. With this influx of foreign labour, we run  the

risk of having city slums and social problems. Unless

we  are  prepared  to build low-cost  houses  and  to

provide  education  for their children,  our  present

standard of living and our economic objectives may be

endangered by the influx of foreign labour. We should

be  aware  of our own situation in dealing with  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must set up a plan for our long-term

economic   development  in   the   context   of   our

geographical  position,  population  potential,  land

area   and   other  relevant  factors.  Our  national

development  must  be determined  by  these  factors.

Although  we have achieved full employment,  we  must

try to prevent our workers from being over-selective,

leading to great mobility in labour, wastage,  and  a

reduction  of  our  national  productivity,   thereby

slowing down our economic expansion. Through the  co-operative efforts of employers and employees and  the

Government,  the  workers must  be  told  that  their

interests  and  the  interests  of  the  nation   are

interdependent.  In  fact, their  interests  and  the

productivity of the country in relation to a  greater

market  are closely interlinked, because demands  for

products are dependent upon the purchasing power  and

it  will  increase with the benefit of larger profits

which   come  from  higher  productivity  and  bigger

markets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the question of urban

renewal  and  the  problems  brought  about  by   the

construction  of numerous high-rise  flats.  We  know

that  land is a scarce commodity in our country,  and

therefore  there is a great need to build higher  and

still  higher blocks of buildings. This is, in  fact,

the  only  option  open  to us.  However,  we  should

carefully investigate the problems brought  about  by

these  high-rise flats and the high concentration  of

population in small areas. We cannot allow factories,

schools, shopping centres, supermarkets, and  private

firms to decide freely what their working or business

hours should be, because this will create the problem

of  traffic  congestion. Because of the  shortage  of

land   and   the   exorbitant   costs   involved   in

implementing  the Mass Rapid Transit System,  whether

it  be monorails or underground trains, we cannot  at

the  moment  carry  out  these  projects.  We  should

investigate to see whether there is a need to stagger

their  working hours, so that the problem of  traffic

congestion  will  not arise. Perhaps  some  of  these

shops and firms should be diverted or resited in less

congested areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the urban renewal programme, many so-called

high-class shopping centres have sprung up  recently.

They have been given a great deal of publicity. It is

the  hope  of the people that these shopping  centres

will provide some sort of service to our society but,

in  point of fact, they are an "abnormal development"

of  our society, because their prices are very  high.

These  high-class shopping centres  are  supposed  to

cater  specially for the rich and the  tourists,  but

there  are only a few tourists. The majority  of  the

consumers  are, in fact, local people, and  they  are

attracted   by   the   expensive   decorations    and

advertising  gimmicks put up by local businessmen  of

these  shops. Many of these shops have been attracted

to  site  in  shopping centres, but, in  fact,  their

business is not all that good, because of the lack of

support  from the local clientele. What  little  they

earn goes to pay for the high rentals. It is only the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



big   developers   who  stand  to   gain   from   the

construction  of these so-called high-class  shopping

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Government should take a more

concerted  effort  to  establish  the  needs  for   a

satellite  town  before we carry out such  plans.  We

need to have more up to-date statistics to study  the

population  trend,  the urgent needs  of  the  people

which  follow  the  progress of  society.  We  should

consider   building   modern  multi-storey   shopping

complexes  so  as  to  provide  better  services  and

amenities in our housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the construction by the Housing and

Development Board and the Jurong Town Corporation  of

shopping  complexes which are let out  at  reasonable

rentals,   the  shops  should  be  able  to   provide

commodities at reasonable prices, so that the  people

in  these  satellite towns may be  able  to  purchase

goods  at  a fairly reasonable price. These  measures

will also help to divert the crowd and to reduce  the

problem  of traffic congestion in the city areas.  We

have  to construct shopping complexes to provide  the

people  in the satellite towns with various amenities

and  services, so that their cost of living  will  be

reduced.  We  should not consider providing  services

without  caring  for  the  purchasing  power  of  the

people.  Sir,  we  know that we are a  small  country

without  any  natural resources, but so far  we  have

been able to achieve great economic expansion in  the

face  of international uncertainties and disruptions.

The  payment  of  an annual allowance  to  Government

servants  is  a rare step in this direction.  I  hope

that with greater efforts we shall be able to achieve

even greater things in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people of Kampong Kapor,

I   support  the  Finance  Minister  in  his   Budget

proposals.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

financial policy of the Government enunciated by  the

Finance  Minister gives a picture of quiet confidence

and  visions of Singapore marching forward  into  the

future full of promise. The fact is that, in spite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



of the effects of the British military withdrawal and

the  international monetary crisis, which for a  time

threatened  to  slow down our economic progress,  the

Government  has  ridden  the crest  and  attained  an

advance  in 1971 of about 12.1 per cent for  the  per

capita  G.N.P, at current market prices.  This  is  a

creditable achievement for which the Government  must

be congratulated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of points, however, arise-when considering

the  Budget  speech as a whole. A matter that  should

cause-concern is the increasing use of direct, trade

policies   by  our  neighbours.  It  is,  I  suggest,

therefore, necessary for us to-formulate a policy  to

gradually minimise our dependence on traditional  re-export commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is another economic earner and, despite the

increase  in  the number of tourists and in  earnings

(about  ten  times  higher than 1960),  there  is  a.

decline in the occupancy rate of hotels since 1969. A

question  that naturally poses itself is whether  our

Tourist Promotion Board has done enough in the  past.

Though  greater efforts must be-made to attract  more

tourists from Japan, Australia, and the rich European

countries like the U.S.A., I think it will be prudent

to  step  up efforts and projects to attract tourists

from  the  less affluent countries also, so that  the

tourist industry could reap additional earnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement that measures are being taken to

reorganise the civil service and to restructure their

salary  scales is most welcome. The annual  grant  of

one month's pay as a non-, pensionable allowance will

go  a long way towards narrowing the differences, in

wages   between  the  public  and  private   sectors.

However,  these  measures  in, themselves  are   not

sufficient  to curb the flow of experienced  officers

into  the  private sector. I suggest that  Government

Service  could  be made more attractive  by  offering

civil  servants  more  liberal terms  in  respect  of

housing,  car loans, and so on. To prevent a  further

flow  of  officers into the private  sector  existing

measures should be tightened. Such measures would  be

justifiable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



because,  by  and large, those who leave for  greener

pastures  use the knowledge, experience, and training

that they have gained in Government Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the private sector would

very  soon  also  see wage increases when  the  Wages

Council makes its recommendations. The picture is one

of  promise  and  joy to our working population.  But

what  lurks  in the background is creeping  inflation

and  spiralling  prices  in the  wake  of  a  general

increase  in  wages. If this is not controlled,  then

wage increases will prove futile and barren.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property Tax has of late been a subject of much

discussion  by house owners. Following an upsurge  in

rentals  in 1970 and 1971, annual values were raised.

The  position is somewhat different now,  as  rentals

have  dropped  significantly and  the  annual  values

fixed  previously would now appear to have no bearing

on the present rentals. I would, therefore, urge that

a further review of annual values be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to increase Defence expenditure is

recognised  when we are continuing to  build  up  our

Armed Forces. No good and true Singapore citizen will

argue  about  this,  hut  one  can  legitimately  ask

whether a sudden increase of 16.5 per cent over  last

year's expenditure is really necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A matter that has of late been receiving the close

attention  of Government, trade unions and  employers

is industrial safety. The recent explosion in a barge

in  Jurong, in which five people lost their lives and

another  five seriously injured, is a tragic reminder

that with new methods of work, new machinery and  new

working  environments  which come  with  progress  in

industrialisation,  new  dangers  lurk   behind   the

unsuspecting worker. It is, therefore, vital that the

problems  of industrial safety should be  studied  in

greater depth, so that a comprehensive programme  can

be  devised to meet not only known dangers  but  also

possible dangers of which little or nothing is  known

now. Apart from the sorrow and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



suffering  that  industrial accidents  cause  to  the

injured  worker and his family, the loss of  workers,

particularly  skilled workers, in the  context  of  a

full-employment situation, is something that  we  can

ill-afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to our road transport, the traffic

system  is  now in a chaotic state. Though steps  are

being  taken  to educate the public, to  control  the

traffic, and to widen roads, and so on, unless a mass

transport system is introduced in the next few  years

the problem will become unmanageable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If subways are to be introduced, this is the

opportune  time  because while the  Central  area  is

being  reconstructed  and  with  high-rise  buildings

coming  up,  subways can be constructed with  minimum

dislocation to the traffic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that a Commission be appointed to

look into the problem and to report on it.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  like my colleagues, I would like to express  my

support and convey my congratulations to the Minister

for  Finance for announcing his third painless Budget

in  this House. Sir, although we are not entirely out

of  the woods yet, our economy has all the time  been

going up instead of declining. This is largely due to

the  able leadership of the Government, combined with

the  strong will and determination of the  people  to

overcome obstacles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, despite increases in expenditure

for  Defence, Education, Social Services, and others,

the Minister for Finance has been able to balance his

Budget  without having to increase existing taxes  or

introducing new taxes. On the contrary, he  has  been

able   to   introduce  six  tax   reliefs.   I   must

congratulate the Minister for Finance on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must also echo the disappointment of the

rural  people.  There  is no mention  in  the  Budget

Statement  of any change in the policy on agriculture

and  fisheries. I am not an economist, and so I  will

not be able to say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



how much profit can be made out of agriculture and

fisheries  as compared to industry, for  the  same

amount of land that is being used. However, I know

that   some   land   should   be   allocated   for

agricultural  purposes.  I  am  sure  most  of  us

remember  that  during the Japanese occupation  of

Singapore, almost every family planted tapioca  or

potatoes for their own consumption. But now  there

is  no  land available in the city to grow even  a

plot of potatoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our farmers are engaged in the production

of supplementary food. Due to lack of proper care,

they  are left entirely on their own for survival.

Agricultural land is continually being diminished.

If,  for  any reason, there is further decline  in

the production of supplementary food, we will have

to spend a great deal on foreign exchange in order

to  import  food from other countries, and  should

this supply be cut off for any reason, we will all

be  starved  to  death.  I, therefore,  feel  that

definite policies must be formulated for fisheries

and  agriculture,  in  order  to  look  after  the

interests of our farmers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are about 23,000 families

engaged  in  agricultural or  fishing  activities.

Together   with  relatives  and  allied   workers,

merchants    and    hawkers,   I    think    about

200,000-300,000    people   are    dependent    on

agriculture  and  fisheries for their  livelihood.

This  constitutes more than one-tenth of our total

population.  So their contribution to our  economy

cannot be completely ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are signs that agriculture and

fisheries are on the decline. We can see from  the

annual   reports   of   the   Primary   Production

Department that farming and fishing activities  in

Singapore are declining at a tremendous speed.  We

must  do  something to stop or check the  decline.

Because  land is scarce in Singapore, we  have  to

find  ways  and  means to make  the  best  use  of

whatever     land    we    have     and,     after

industrialisation, allocate some land  to  farmers

for  agricultural pursuits. However, the  tendency

is  towards urbanisation and industrialisation. As

a result,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



it  is understood that agricultural land available

amounts  to  only  a small area of  33.000  acres.

Apart  from the small portion of private  land,  a

greater  part  of  it  is State  land,  leased  to

farmers   under  Temporary  Occupation   Licences.

Because they have to farm under T.O.Ls they always

have the sense of insecurity and are convinced  by

the  fact that they are often resettled from  time

to time. After resettlement a few unfortunate ones

have  to  move again. As a result of resettlement,

farmers experience great inconvenience and losses.

The  Government  should therefore  take  steps  to

avoid resettling the farmers more than once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, farmers require land just as fish require

water.  Since land is leased to them under T.O.Ls,

they   are   always  liable  to  resettlement   or

eviction.  Psychologically, this has a bad  effect

on them. Because of this, they tend to take things

easy, instead of trying to find permanent ways and

means  to  increase their production.  This  is  a

great blow to our agricultural activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although we are not in a

position   to  implement  "Land  to  the  Tillers"

scheme, we should designate agricultural areas and

grant  longer leases of, say, 30 to 50  years,  so

that  they  will be able to till the  land  for  a

fixed  period,  so  that they can  also  plan  for

improvement and expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister for Finance may probably be

aware,   the   prices  of  primary  farm   produce

especially  of  pigs  and  eggs,  have  gone  down

recently.  In some cases, the prices have  dropped

to  below  cost.  Some  farmers  are  experiencing

considerable  hardships and are on  the  brink  of

bankruptcy.  This  shows  the  weakness   of   our

agricultural  economics. Farmers  are  engaged  in

these activities for a living and they only manage

to make ends meet. But with the small returns they

get,  they  cannot be sure of even three  meals  a

day.  This is the case not only in times when  the

harvest  is  poor, but also when  the  harvest  is

good.  This is the result of the rising  costs  of

fertilisers  and  animal feeds.  Farmers  normally

obtain  animal  feeds and fertilisers  on  credit.

They repay the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



suppliers  for their fertilisers and  animal  feeds

when they have a rich harvest. The suppliers act as

a sort of middlemen and moneylenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite of the rising costs of

fertilisers and animal feeds, the prices of primary

farm  produce are going down. We can see from  this

that  a bad relationship exists between the primary

producers  and the middlemen. I can  only  use  the

word  "exploitation" to describe the  relationship,

in  the absence of a better term. Sir, farmers  are

not  rich. They do not even have the money  to  buy

things  on cash terms. They have to purchase  their

supplies on credit. It is only when their livestock

are  big enough for sale and sold will they be able

to  raise  some  money to pay for the  supplies  of

animal feeds and fertilisers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty which the farmers face is that

when  the harvest is plentiful, there is an  excess

of  supply over demand. Again the poor farmers will

be  exploited by the middlemen and the suppliers of

their  animal feeds and fertilisers. As  a  result,

the  prices  of their products dropped.  They  will

then  again  experience difficulty in repaying  the

debts  that they have incurred. This is an  unusual

phenomenon  which  should be removed.  A  socialist

Government   cannot   continue   to   ignore    the

unreasonable acts of the middlemen who exploit  the

primary producers. Government must do something  to

ensure that everybody gets the fruit of his labour.

All along their interests have been looked after by

the Primary Production Department by providing them

with  technical  aids. If the Government  does  not

give  further help to the farmers in  the  form  of

financial aid, planning, marketing and sales,  then

whatever  benefits they may get  from  the  Primary

Production   Department  will  be  cancelled   out,

because  of the low prices of their produce.  There

will  then be no profit to the farmers despite  all

the technical aid provided to ensure good harvests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this time last year

I asked the Minister for Finance about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



the  establishment of an agricultural  bank.  After

one  year's  deliberation, may I know what  is  the

decision  of  the Minister? Even  if  there  is  no

intention to set up an agricultural bank,  I  think

the   Minister   should  consider  setting   up   a

department in the Development Bank of Singapore  to

deal with financial matters relating to farmers and

to  provide low-interest loans. It is only  through

the granting of low-interest loans that farmers can

rid   themselves   of  the  exploitation   by   the

middlemen. This move will improve their well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of over-production is due

to the farmers' lack of ability to analyse markets.

They  produce without any proper planning.  But  we

cannot  blame them for this, because  they  do  not

have  either  the  knowledge,  the  data,  or   the

machinery  for  analysis of the market.  This  work

should,  in fact, be done by the Primary Production

Department,  so that the problem of over-production

can be solved. In addition to this, I think Intraco

should  also  assist farmers to  explore  and  open

markets  overseas so that the agricultural  surplus

products  can  be exported. I think the  Government

should  also encourage the setting up of industries

and factories processing agricultural produce. This

will absorb the surplus farm produce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to eliminate the exploitation of

farmers by middlemen, it is necessary to set  up  a

co-operative for farmers. The Government  has  been

successful  in  the implementation of co-operatives

for  transport  and insurance for the  workers.  So

there  is  no  reason  why  the  Government  cannot

succeed in the field of agriculture. It is  no  use

for  Government officials to sit in air-conditioned

rooms,  expecting  farmers  to  come  forward   and

register  themselves  to form a  co-operative.  The

Government should take a positive step to help the

farmers,  because they are usually  very  busy  and

they  lack  the necessary experience and knowledge.

If the Government does this, great benefits will be

shared  not  only  by  the  farmers  but  also  the

consumers at large.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on

fisheries. We know that Singapore is surrounded  by

the four seas. But our fishermen can only catch one-quarter  of  our  total consumption  of  fish.  The

Minister for Law and National Development has  said

that  this  is a shame. According to a  survey  our

consumption  of fish is the highest  in  Asia.  The

figure  comes  to 35.6 kilos per person  per  year.

Following  the  increase  in  our  population,  the

consumption  of  fish is bound to increase.  It  is

estimated that by 1975, our consumption will  reach

the  figure of 82,000 tons. On the other  hand,  we

can  see  from  the annual reports of  the  Primary

Production  Department that if  fishing  activities

are  declining and if allowed to continue, we would

have  to import more and more fish. Then this  will

not only lead to a loss in foreign exchange but, if

there  is  any external factor, also to an increase

in  the price of fish. The people who stand to lose

will  be our home consumers. Sir, we know that  the

South  China  Sea  and  the Indian  Ocean  have  an

abundant  supply  of fish, and  there  is  a  great

potential  for deep-sea fishing. There are  fishing

trawlers from Taiwan and Japan catching the Tuna in

the  Indian Ocean, and they are exporting  them  to

Europe.  Why cannot we do the same thing? In  fact,

the distance from Singapore to the Indian Ocean  is

only  half that from Taiwan or Japan. In  the  same

way, there is no reason why we should not succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep-sea fishing has not been developed to any

significant  extent  in the  last  few  years.  The

setting  up of a Fisheries Training School  is  not

sufficient  by itself. Deep-sea fishing requires  a

large  amount  of  capital and  it  involves  great

risks.   Without   the  active   participation   of

Government, there is not much prospect of  deep-sea

fishing  developing as an industry. The  Government

has  already withdrawn the pioneer industry  status

for  deep-sea  fishing.  However,  other  kinds  of

preferential treatment should be given to encourage

local  and overseas businessmen to develop deep-sea

fishing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no conflict of interests

between  deep-sea  fishing and  off-shore  fishing.

Therefore,  the  Government should also  encourage

off-shore  fishing. It is a fact  that  during  the

last  few  years the Government has  neglected  the

development of off-shore fishing. In fact,  it  has

regarded off-shore fishing as an archaic or useless

occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must also look after the sea-beds from which large quantities of fresh fish are

obtained. I am referring now to the small  trawlers

which operate near the off-shore areas, and in  the

process they affect the natural environment of  the

sea. The presence of these small trawlers makes the

sea  more choppy and, as a result, the fish and the

prawns do not reproduce in large numbers. We should

impose  a total ban on the operation of these-small

trawlers in the off-shore areas. The Marine  police

and  the  Primary Production Department should  co-operate in this respect. During the last year, only

eight trawlers were arrested and we-cannot help but

have  some  doubts on the efficiency of the  Marine

Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now touch on the question

of   reclamation.  We-know  that  the   large-scale

reclamation  of  land  has  led  to  land  and  sea

pollution. This has an adverse effect on the catch

of  the  kelongs in various areas.  Of  course,  we

cannot   criticise   the-Government's   reclamation

schemes. However, we must consider the question  of

giving  assistance  to these kelongs  so  that  the

fishermen can carry on with their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that in the last few

years  there  were  many cases of  fishermen  being

robbed  by pirates. Some of them were also arrested

by  foreign governments. Sometimes they  were  also

kidnapped and were released only after the  payment

of  a  few  thousand dollars. I am  sure  that  our

Government  and  all  the  people  are  sympathetic

towards these fishermen for their hardship. I  hope

the Government will think of some adequate measures-to reduce, if not altogether eliminate,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



such  incidents. For example, our  Government  can

enter  into  an  agreement with  our  neighbouring

countries  on  the question of fishing  rights  so

that  our  fishermen will be allowed  to  fish  in

their  territorial waters without  fear  of  being

arrested,  tortured  or  prosecuted.  The   Marine

Police  should  also increase their vigilance  and

prevent  plundering by sea pirates.  I  have  also

been informed that some of these pirates have even

come  to  our  kelongs to rob  our  fishermen.  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  the  personal  safety  of   these

fishermen must be protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance knows better than I do

of   the   contributions  that   agriculture   and

fisheries make to our economy. I only hope that he

will  spend some time considering in depth how  to

develop our agriculture and fisheries and  I  hope

that  in  his  next Budget speech he would  devote

more  time to agriculture and fisheries. I am sure

the  200,000  or 300,000 people of  Singapore  who

depend  on  agriculture and fishing will  be  very

grateful to him. I support the Budget presented by

the Minister.



<br><br>4.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I wish to thank the  Minister  for

Finance for presenting his Budget and to say a few

words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy Budget announced on the 7th of this

month  in  this House by our Finance Minister  has

caught  nearly  all Singaporeans by surprise,  not

only because there are no new taxes but there  are

simply no taxes at all. There are instead six  tax

reliefs  which will benefit most of the people  in

one  way or another. We can boast that we are  one

of  the  very few countries in the world which  do

not  have to introduce new taxes but instead grant

tax  reliefs for the current financial year.  This

is  one  of  the happiest moments in our  nation's

history.    Let    me    -offer    my    heartiest

congratulations to the Minister for Finance on his

very illuminating Budget Statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Singapore's performance has contradicted

the World Bank's predictions made a few years ago.

Experts  from  the  World Bank  had  then  made  a

forecast  that our country would face a  recession

and  unemployment. However, the  reverse  has  now

happened.  We  have virtually full employment  and

the  talk  of recession has disappeared, with  the

boom condition continuing throughout last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I note from the Budget Statement that

our  port  is being used less for entrepot  trade.

That may be a cause for concern, but I am sure the

Port  of  Singapore Authority would  by  now  have

thought of alternative forms of raising income.  I

also  notice  that  there is  no  mention  of  the

containerisation of our port or of its  facilities

for  which  a great sum of money has already  been

spent.  How much of this expenditure is worthy  of

producing  an income for the port is a matter  for

conjecture.  Do  we  have a sufficient  number  of

ships  coming  here to make use of  our  container

facilities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national shipping line, the Neptune Orient

Lines, has been rather shabbily treated by the Far

East  Freight  Conference. When are  we  going  to

break  the  monopolistic and arbitrary control  of

our shipping by this foreign-based F. E. F. C.? We

are  an independent country and we should be  able

to  trade  with  any  country  and  with  as  many

countries  as  possible. The F.E.F.C, should  not

dictate  the  terms  of trade carried  on  by  our

national carriers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since China is giving us a helping hand to break

the  monopoly of the F.E.F.C., we should carry  on

more trade with her and with other countries which

show a concern for our economic survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our urban renewal programmes over the past few

years  have been going on at too fast a pace,  and

this  has  resulted in a shortage of workmen,  and

above  all  the shortage of cement. It seems  that

our  cement factories are not producing enough  to

meet  local requirements. There seems to be a good

reason for opening



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



another   cement   factory  in  view   of   further

development  that will take place in the  years  to

come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister recently announced the proposed

payment  of  a non-pensionable annual allowance  to

all  civil  servants. This is a good  idea  and  is

welcomed  by  all. However, let me point  out  that

those  who deserve a further increase in wages  are

really those in the low income groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wages Council make their recommendations

for  a  minimum wage for our workers, we only  hope

that  shopkeepers  and hawkers will  not  have  any

excuse  for  profiteering. In the  past,  upon  the

slightest   excuse   the   capitalist   monopolists

increased their prices unnecessarily. It  is  hoped

that  in  this  connection, the  NTUC's  Consumers'

Association of Singapore will prove to  be  a  more

effective organisation than it is now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our per capita income has again been assessed as

the second highest in Asia. This is largely due  to

the  Finance  Minister's wise calculations  in  the

past,  our  Government's  ceaseless  drive  towards

industrialisation and, above all, to the success of

our family planning programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years we have seen an enormous

increase   in   the   number  of  quality   hotels.

Unfortunately, for this same reason  the  occupancy

rate  is only 70 per cent and in some hotels it  is

even  less than that. To help the rate go up, there

should be more intensive tourist promotion efforts,

and  other  means should also be explored  so  that

many more tourists will be attracted to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words, Sir, I thank the Minister for

Finance   for  his  Budget  and  express  my   deep

appreciation and my congratulations to him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to join my colleagues in this House to

congratulate   the   Minister   for   Finance   for

presenting a painless Budget to Parliament  on  7th

March,  1972,  for the financial  year  1st  April,

1972,  to 31st March, 1973. I am sure most  of  the

people  in Singapore from workers to employers  are

happy  that  there are no new taxes. Not  only  are

there  no  new taxes, but the Minister for  Finance

has kindly introduced six tax reliefs in his Budget

Statement,  which will give satisfaction  to  those

who benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our present rate of economic and industrial

growth,  I  sincerely hope that eventually  workers

will  be exempted from paying income tax. I believe

that  income  tax  should  be  paid  by  employers,

investors and industrialists only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that the

workers  in  Singapore  have  done  their  part  in

response  to  the Government's appeal for  national

survival  and nation-building. Through their  toil,

sweat  and  sacrifice, they have  helped  to  bring

economic   boom   and   industrial   progress   and

prosperity  to the Republic of Singapore.  Although

they  stand  to  benefit in the present  successful

economic  growth  and  industrial  expansion,   the

employers,  investors  and  industrialists  benefit

many times more than workers. To the workers, wages

and  bonus  are always limited, but profit  to  the

employers is unlimited. Whatever wage increases  or

bonus  given to the workers will be taken  back  by

the  businessmen because the workers  have  to  pay

high  prices for edible and non-edible commodities.

Yet the employers are unwilling to give the workers

any  high  cost-of-living  allowance  to  meet  the

frequent  increase of prices of goods.  Businessmen

can  increase the prices of the goods anytime  they

like,  but  workers cannot ask for an  increase  in

wages anytime they like. The workers must abide  by

the collective agreement. Where is the fairness?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do appreciate that frequent

wage  increases  will never stop the  increase  in

prices  of  commodities and will cause  inflation,

but  the Government must, at least, put a stop  to

unjustifiable increases in prices of commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers are prepared to continue the

tripartite   co-operation  and  to  maintain   the

present industrial peace. We give our assurance to

the  Government that we will maintain our  present

political  and economic stability. We are  willing

to  work  harder to achieve greater  economic  and

industrial  growth for the Republic  of  Singapore

for  the benefit of all workers, employers and the

Government.  But please do not ask us to  continue

giving sacrifices all the time. The benefits  most

employers  derive  from  the  enforcement  of  the

Employment  Act  and Industrial Relations  Act  of

1968  have  been tremendous, especially on  longer

working  hours, lesser number of public  holidays,

restriction  of overtime work, limitation  to  the

annual bonus to one month only, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, most employers have benefited

from the toil, sweat and sacrifices of the workers

since  1968 and they have already made substantial

profits    together   with   business   expansion.

Therefore,  the time has come for  them  to  share

their profits sincerely with the workers by giving

them   bigger  bonus,  adjustment  of  wages   and

improvement in fringe benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th March, 1972, the Prime Minister announced

at  the  N.T.U.C.  Delegates Conference  that  the

Government  would pay its employees an  allowance

of  an  extra month's salary at the end of  March,

1972,  and  would increase the C.P.F, contribution

from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. He also said that

the  Government would review the salaries  of  the

Government employees in Divisions I to IV, as well

as the public daily-rated workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers in Singapore welcome the good news

announced  by  the  Government  that  the   C.P.F.

contribution for the workers in the private sector



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



would  also increase from 10 per cent  to  12  per

cent  as from July, 1972, and it will be increased

gradually to 15 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all employers will follow the good example

set   by  the  Government.  The  workers  are  not

demanding  fantastic bonuses or wage  adjustments.

We  only ask the employers to give a bonus if they

make a profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well known fact that annual bonus has

been  paid by Chinese employers as well as Western

employers since pre-war days. When employers  make

profit  they  must pay bonus to the  workers.  The

workers  are  the ones that help the employers  to

make  profit  in  their business. Therefore,  they

must share their profit with the workers by paying

them  bonus. Mr Speaker, Sir, annual  bonus  is  a

necessity  to  the workers. Bonus is  indeed  very

helpful to the workers especially to pay for their

children's school textbooks, school uniforms,  new

clothing's for the new year celebration;  to  meet

additional  expenses on new year,  such  as  food,

drinks  and  ang-pows;  to settle  all  the  debts

incurred and, if possible, to put something  aside

for  saving.  Bonus is a necessity to the  workers

especially the lower and middle income  groups.  I

am  sure  all  managerial and executive  employees

would like to get an annual increment of salary as

well  as  bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite understandable that

Government  is  not giving bonus to its  employees

but  an  additional  extra month's  salary  as  an

allowance  is  just  as  good  as  a  bonus.   The

Government  employees really  deserve  this  extra

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the N.T.U.C, held its Ordinary

Delegates Conference from 3rd to 5th March,  1972,

and   the   Industrial  Policy   and   Resolutions

Committee's  recommendation on the  bonus  payment

was  unanimously  adopted  by  the  Delegates   as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Committee agreed that the statutory limit of

one  month  is unrealistic and is further  of  the

opinion that there should be no blanket ban on the

payment  of  bonus.  Hence the Committee  strongly

recommends  that  bonus be made a negotiable  item

without any ceiling on the quantum of bonus.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the restriction to only one month's salary

as a bonus payment through negotiation was imposed

by  the Government under the Employment Act, 1968.

With the present economic boom most employers  are

making very good profits, and I strongly appeal to

the  Government to allow the workers to  negotiate

bonus with their employers up to three months.  If

this proposal is agreed to by the Government,  the

N.T.U.C, will be prepared to accept it although we

prefer  that  there should be no  ceiling  on  the

quantum of bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his

Budget Statement in Parliament on 7th March, 1972,

paid  tribute  to  the workers  for  changing  the

difficulties and uncertainties caused by the  loss

of   neighbouring  markets  upon  separation  from

Malaysia  and  loss  of unemployment  and  foreign

exchange  upon the British military rundown,  into

economic opportunities, o opportunities which have

now   produced   our  present  healthy   financial

situation.  Yet it is most regrettable that  there

are  still  some  unscrupulous employers  who  are

against the formation of trade unions to represent

the workers and victimise the union organisers  by

dismissal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the N.T.U.C, is forming a union

for the managerial and executive employees. We are

now  drafting its constitution. The response  from

one  oil  company  is very good.  Out  of  its  25

managerial   and   executive  employees   covering

secretary,  superintendent,  auditor,  accountant,

chemist, engineer, etc., 24 have already signed in

support  of  forming a union. They have officially

written to the N.T.U.C. Secretary for Organisation

and   Administration  to  join   this   union.   I

understand   one  of  its  management   expatriate

representatives  had said hostile  and  anti-union

remarks  about  their 24 managerial and  executive

employees  for  signing in support  of  forming  a

union.  I  hope  the management representative  of

this   oil  company  will  appreciate  that  their

managerial and executive employees have the  right

to  join  a  union to protect their job  security,

better wages, bonus and conditions of service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the petroleum workers' union, i.e., the

United  Workers of Petroleum Industry, is watching

the  development closely on this oil company,  and

we  fully  support  its managerial  and  executive

employees  to join the union to be formed  by  the

N.T.U.C. It was reported by the N.T.U.C. Secretary

for  Industrial  Disputes that a  good  number  of

dismissals took place while the union was awaiting

recognition,  pending  a ballot  to  be  taken  by

members  of the union. In fairness to the  workers

and to stop the tendency of employers to abuse the

various  prerogatives so conferred  upon  them,  1

request the Government to amend section 17 (2) of

the  Industrial Relations Act (Cap. 124  of  1970)

and remove such prerogatives immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the N.T.U.C is preparing a brief to the

Government on alleged victimisation of workers  by

employers  who  are anti-union,  and  I  hope  the

Government will not hesitate to use the big  stick

on  them. I would suggest that employers  who  are

hostile  or  against trade unionism, or  victimise

trade  union organisers, should be packed  into  a

box  and  despatched back to their own  countries,

and  the sooner we do it the better it will be.  I

am  glad  the Prime Minister has stated  that  the

Government  would not allow workers to be  bullied

or coerced by employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the amendments to the

Industrial  Relations  Act, 1968,  employers  were

given  the  power of hiring and firing, promotion,

transfer   and   retrenchment.  There   are   some

unscrupulous  employers  using  these   managerial

prerogatives to victimise workers as well as union

organisers.   It  has  been  proven   that   these

employers    have    abused    their    managerial

prerogatives.  Therefore,  I  request  that  these

managerial prerogatives should be deleted from the

Industrial Relations Act immediately.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, with regard to the existence  of

the  Wages  Council, of which  N.T.U.C, is  being

represented by our President, Mr Phey  Yew  Kok,

Mr  Devan  Nair,  our  Secretary-General  and  our

Adviser, Prof. Tom H. Elliott, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



have  full  confidence in them. I hope this  Wages

Council will be helpful to the workers and not  be

restrictive to the reasonable wage increase demand

by  the workers. I hope the Wages Council will see

that   the  bonus  payment  system  will  not   be

abolished. Perhaps, I may say the workers have the

right to demand bonus payment if the employers are

making good profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Government's policies as

presented in the Budget Statement of the  Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a week has passed

since  the  Minister  for  Finance  delivered  his

Budget  Statement,  but the  benign  and  cheerful

effect  of the Minister's words is still with  us.

The  Budget  has indicated correctly the  relative

well-being  of our people, and holds out  a  happy

expectation  for  the future, if  we  harbour  our

resources  as prudently today and tomorrow  as  we

did  yesterday. The keynote of the  Budget  speech

seems  to  be one of prudent confidence  based  on

commendable achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no warrant for complacence. We

have  to do better. One aspect to look at  in  our

striving  to  improve is the  question  of  labour

productivity. The Minister has admitted that rapid

industrial expansion has been wholly dependent  on

a  growing labour input. For the future,  however,

there   can   be  no  industrial  growth   without

productivity. Therefore, a vigorous programme  for

the  up-grading of our manpower skills has  to  be

embarked on energetically, to increase the average

productivity of our workers. In this connection, I

would  like  to  urge also that more  co-ordinated

efforts  be spent on making people more  conscious

of  the  necessity for quality in our products.  I

suggest that there will be a grave potential waste

if  proper attention is not given to developing  a

pride in workmanship, pride in contributing  to  a

finished  product of high quality. There seems  to

be a mistaken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



belief prevailing in certain quarters that quality

is   equated  with,  so  to  speak,  Rolls   Royce

standards  therefore appealing only to a  few  and

hence  possessing  limited marketability.  Nothing

could  be  more disadvantageous to our  industrial

growth than this mistaken concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore to stress, with manufacturers

and  workers alike, a right view of quality  which

implies conformity to standards set in relation to

reliability  of performance. And the criterion  of

reliability  has  to be what is  expected  by  the

buyers  of  our goods. If we cannot fulfil  market

expectations    of    the    standard    of    our

goods-obviously good-bye markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that, when the Minister talks of "new markets

.., found for the products manufactured by  local

industries" and "increasing promotional efforts  .

being  made to establish new markets overseas",  I

am sure he will remember that this will result not

only from increasing management sophistication and

greatly  improved skills of workers but also  from

better  quality of goods. I do not think that  the

last factor will, of necessity, and automatically,

be  an  outcome of a combination of the first  two

factors.  I  do not think that simply  because  we

have excellent management and skilful workers, our

goods  will  automatically be of the best  quality

Steps must be taken to ensure that all three  come

together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these steps is, of course, what the

Minister himself has mentioned, namely, that there

must  be  an  equitable sharing of the  fruits  of

greater  efficiency (and this must include  better

quality). The difficulty is how to determine this;

and  the National Wages Council will have its work

cut   out   to   solve  this  problem.   But   the

determination of incentives to workers to  improve

quality, as well as the assessment of rewards  for

higher  productivity should be an urgent  part  of

the task of the Council,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way there is also the difficulty of

determining  in  what way quality may  be  ensured

through incentives to manufacturers. Generally,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



of course, there could be accelerated depreciation

for   capital   investment  in   quality   control

equipment. I would like to imagine that  the  only

reason why the Minister did not add this (seventh)

tax  relief  item to the six tax relief  items  he

listed, was the difficulty in distinguishing,  for

example, quality control equipment from production

equipment. I hope that Government will not forget,

however, its undertaking given in the addendum  to

the  President's  address at the last  opening  of

Parliament  in July, 1971. In the section  of  the

addendum  relating to the Ministry of Science  and

Technology, it was stated that consideration would

be  given  to  the  possibility of  providing  tax

relief  for expenditure on equipment and technical

manpower  used for quality control  also.  At  the

same  time if incentives are at all to be  offered

to  employers  to  improve the  sophistication  of

workers  through training schemes,  it  should  be

hoped  that  incentives will also be  offered  for

training in quality control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget Statement it is clear that no

avenue  should  be overlooked that  will  lead  to

assurance  of higher productivity. This seems  all

the more urgent with the reference of the Minister

for  Finance  to  the continuing pressure  on  the

balance  of  payments  which  he  hopes  will   be

relieved through our industrial growth as well  as

through "invisible" earnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is one important activity that results in

such earnings. The Minister for Finance has stated

that,   with  greater  promotional  efforts,   the

tourist  industry may be expected to increase  its

earnings.   I   hope,  however,   that   as   much

promotional   pressure  will  be  applied   inside

Singapore as outside it to boost tourism. By this,

I  refer to efforts to make the tourist appreciate

Singapore   as   a   city  well  worth   visiting.

Singapore's  cleanness and greenness are  features

favourably  commented upon by  visitors.  But  the

people  with  whom  tourists  normally  come  into

contact  should be encouraged to treat the tourist

well  and further give him a favourable impression

of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one category of people tourists meet

often  is the taxi-driver. Some taxi-drivers  have

commented   that  previously  foreign  service-men

stationed  in Singapore represented  a  very  good

clientele. Now that these service-men are fewer in

numbers,  taxi-drivers should realise a  potential

new   clientele  that  tourists  could  represent.

Therefore,  the minority of taxi-drivers  who  are

disposed  to take tourists for a ride at a  higher

fare  than the standard rates should be shown that

this  is  shortsighted. Tourists are pleased  when

they  find that they can get from place  to  place

without fear of being mulcted over fares. And,  of

course,   the   Tourist  Promotion  Board   should

encourage  the  acts  of  honesty  we  read  about

sometimes  in  the  papers,  when  taxi  men,  for

example, return valuables and money left in  their

vehicles, and when other forms of help are  given,

even at the risk of trouble to the taxi-drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of people tourists come in contact

with  are  shopkeepers.  Recently  I  overheard  a

tourist  complaining that he  was  unable  to  get

small  change for a dollar note from any of a  row

of  stores in a shopping complex. He had wanted to

use a public telephones, but was unable to do  so

until  another foreigner offered him a  couple  of

shillings  for this purpose. If this uncooperative

attitude  is  characteristic of  shopkeepers  this

will not do our tourist image much good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hazard, for example, a visitor to

Singapore  faces,  is the young  voluntary  worker

selling  flags  for  charity.  Could  these  well-intentioned young people be advised to leave  non-

Singaporeans alone? One point worth noting may  be

the  rather  high  hotel  charges  prevailing   in

Singapore.  Earlier today we heard the Member  for

Potong Pasir raising the question as to how is  it

that  occupancy rates are falling. One may make  a

shrewd  guess  that hotels with a  high  occupancy

rate  are  those whose charges are tolerable.  One

point  worth  noting  is  that  the  low  rate  of

occupancy  may  be  due to the rather  high  hotel

charges prevailing in Singapore. With



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



greater  ease  of air travel, it is not  the  rich

traveller who passes through Singapore as often as

the  couple  or the person who has  saved  for  an

earnest  look at a foreign land. And such are  not

those  who  necessarily want  plush,  chandeliered

environs  where the charges are commensurate  with

the princely setting. A tourist may be disposed to

stay longer than the average of 3.9 days that  the

Finance Minister has referred to, if he were  less

deterred   by   high  hotel  rates.   Could   this

deterrence be a significant reason, among  others,

why  the  average stay of visitors has risen  only

from  3.3  to  3.9 days in five years?  Would  the

Tourist Promotion Board be doing reliable research

on this and similar matters?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to note that the Tourist Promotion

Board  has  set up a special conventions  unit  to

encourage  the  holding  of  more  conventions  in

Singapore. It would be just as useful to note that

help  might  fruitfully  be  extended  to  humbler

groups than connectionists, for example, students,

educational  groups from various countries.  These

serious-minded people come here to study our  ways

and our land and institutions. When they return to

their  own countries they play the role of willing

ambassadors  for Singapore, and in  the  long  run

help  to make Singapore better known to their  own

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, it would also be good for the

Tourist   Promotion  Board  to   give   help   and

encouragement  to  our cultural  ambassadors  like

members  of the recent successful cultural mission

to  Adelaide when they go abroad. And 1 would also

imagine  that  it would be realised as  a  serious

function of the Tourist Promotion Board to act  as

patrons of local art and artistic activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to make brief comments on a

few   other  matters  the  Finance  Minister   has

referred to. I will keep to the order the Minister

himself  has  observed.  With  regard  to   public

housing, it is gratifying to note a higher  growth

rate in 1971. I hope that, with a reduction in the

rate  of  hotel  construction and construction  of

shopping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



complexes as well as of urban renewal projects,  I

hope  public housing will show an even higher rate

of  growth, so that tens of thousands of people on

the waiting list for Housing and Development Board

flats will receive their allocations earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Mass Rapid Transit System, we

were  told that the feasibility study would  begin

this  year. Anyway it will get underway soon. What

I  am  concerned about is that we do not wait till

the  implementation of this system before  we  see

orderly traffic on the roads. Something should  be

done   soon  especially  through  persuasion   and

education,   initially,  to  make   driving   more

characterised  by consideration and  courtesy  and

less  by a kind of law of the asphalt jungle. This

will  help result in more safety for our children,

pedestrians,  motorists,  and  help   reduce   the

appalling  toll  of  road deaths  and  injury  and

monetary loss through traffic accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, the Minister has observed that

our  success  will depend on the capacity  of  our

people  to  improve themselves through  education,

training and experience. What the Minister  means,

of  course,  is that stress should  be  placed  on

continuing education, or adult education. If  only

the   Minister   had  put  it   that   way!   Then

encouragement  would be given  to  those  agencies

making  continuing  education  provisions,   which

should be always ready to orientate themselves  to

national objectives. With the bewildering rate  of

accretion of technical and technological  know-how

a  painful  characteristic of  our  modern  world,

every  encouragement should be given to people  to

make  them  aware of the necessity for  continuing

education.  At the same time because of  the  very

emphasis, in modern circumstances, on science  and

technology, it is hoped that continuing  education

could also provide a much needed cultural or  even

liberal  and gracious balance against too great  a

preoccupation with materialistic concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On yet another matter reference has been made to

the  appointment  of  the Labour  Adviser  to  the

Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



Labour.  The  principle behind such appointment  -

the  utilisation of available consultancy -  is  a

sound and commendable one. Perhaps there could  be

one  or  two  more of such appointments  to  other

ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally may I end on a sylvan note. I am glad

that   the  Parks  and  Trees  Division  will   be

expanding its area of activity with the opening of

new  parks  and wooded areas. The Parks and  Trees

Division  has  done a very good job in  Singapore.

However,  apart from the added pleasure  of  these

amenities,  the Parks and Trees Division  may  now

feel  less disposed to rip up asphalt and pavement

in  order  to  plant trees and shrubs and  thereby

occasionally block the view of motorists  as  well

as  make the job of someone who wishes to  take  a

walk  along  a pavement by the roadside  a  pretty

adventurous one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to add to those commendatory remarks

of  other  Members, my own humble commendation  on

the Minister's able statement on the Budget.



<br><br>6.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir originally I thought of speaking  in

English,  but in view of the fact that the  Member

for  Whampoa has spoken in Mandarin, I would  like

to speak in Mandarin also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since independence, Singapore has, in the various

annual financial budgets, made provisions to  take

care   of   its   long-term  economic  development

interests.  She  has  never resorted  to  increase

taxation suddenly in order to get revenue quickly,

as  this  would lead to the inevitable  result  of

"killing  the  goose that Jays  the  golden  egg".

Among  certain Eastern economic theories  of  long

standing,  there is one that says "when wealth  is

gathered, the people will scatter, and when wealth

is scattered, the people will gather". Now this is

only  directed  at the corrupted economic  system,

and Singapore has nothing to do with this type  of

decadent and corrupted economic system. Of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



we  also  pay  attention to  the  accumulation  of

national  wealth, but this should not be  done  at

the  expense  of the interests of the people.  The

reason why our national coffers can increase their

intakes is because of the diligent efforts put  in

by our people. Under these conditions of increased

productivity,  our national G.N.P, has  reached  a

high  peak,  bringing  about  greater  wealth  and

better  living  conditions, to be shared  by  more

people  who  have  participated  in  the  economic

production. Thus the interests of the people  have

not  declined.  On  the other  hand,  the  average

individual's income has been raised. This  is  one

of   the  main  reasons  for  Singapore's  general

prosperity.  The  more decisive fact  is  that  we

have,  through  industrial development  and  other

efforts   at  economic  promotion,  overcome   the

serious unemployment situation that existed before

1959 when the People's Action Party came to power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore has reached a stage of full

employment.  This  is  an  undeniable  fact.  Full

employment is what socialists think of as an ideal

attainment in economic development. A few  decades

ago    some    British   socialists    in    their

"Reconstruction Manifesto" had listed one of their

important   ideals   and   objectives   as    full

employment. In their declared manifesto, "The Four

Pillars  of  the  House of Tomorrow"  one  of  the

pillars  related to the ideal of full  employment.

Very  few people could have expected that the good

things  of "tomorrow" in the dreams and ideals  of

those socialists could now become a reality in our

little island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to taxation, of course, any Finance

Minister who does not declare or envisage any  new

taxes will be a popular Minister. However, much as

we  want to be free from any taxation or to  enjoy

tax reliefs we cannot always put this into effect.

A  nation  is just like an individual.  There  are

times  when  we need to call upon every individual

to  contribute his part in the form of taxes,  and

this   should   receive  the   response   of   all

conscientious  people. In spite of this,  we  will

still  be  glad  to  see  our  industrious  people

enjoying and sharing the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



fruits of our economic progress. The good news that

there  will be no new taxes and further tax reliefs

are    given,   reflects   our   general   economic

prosperity, and we can all the more realise that on

this  occasion, our personal interest matches  with

our   national  interest.  They  are   not   always

incompatible with each other. But when the national

interest is taken care of, then individual interest

will be better safeguarded. This cannot be denied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget speech, one important point worth

noting  is  the adjustment of the salary scheme  of

the   Civil  Service.  The  Civil  Service  is   an

important link in a democratic system. When a party

forms the government, its policies will have to  be

implemented  by the Civil Service. This  processing

machinery should, therefore, be reliable and  there

must  be  a sense of integrity. In the past  a  few

civil  servants  created a bad  impression  of  the

Civil Service. However, to speak the truth, we have

now  many capable and good civil servants,  all  of

whom  we  can be proud of. Our Minister for Finance

was  one  of  them. Judging them  from  any  angle,

whether  it be efficiency or integrity,  our  Civil

Service  can be said to be the best in this region.

That our democratic socialist principles can be put

into  effect and that our economic growth has  been

speeded  up, we owe all this to the Civil  Service.

They  have  played an important role; they  are  an

important factor in the whole process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the Government had been

able  to re-adjust our economy by various means  so

that  the  private  sector  has  benefited  a  lot.

However, the private sector has become a good green

pasture in the eyes of civil servants. Thus if  the

Government does not adjust their salary  scales  so

as  to reduce the discrepancy in wages between  the

public   and  private  sectors,  then  more   civil

servants  will  resign to join the private  sector.

Although this will not shake the foundation of  our

Civil  Service, it is necessary for the  Government

to bring the salary scales of the Civil Service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



more  equitable  with those of the private  sector.

Then this will make working conditions in the Civil

Service   more  attractive.  This  will   also   be

conducive  to  the  principles  of  democracy.   Of

course, 1 do not wish to relate the good traditions

of  incorruptibility of the Government  service  to

the readjustment of the salary scales. Although the

one  month's salary as an annual allowance may  not

be  any  reflection on the integrity of  the  Civil

Service,  even  if an allowance of  less  than  one

month's  salary  would  not  at  all  affect  their

integrity.  However, a rational salary system  will

be  conducive to the good traditions of  the  Civil

Service. The reputation of our Civil Service as one

of  integrity and honesty is a national  asset.  We

should  try  to  safeguard and  preserve  this.  If

conducive measures are necessary to safeguard  this

asset, then we must not neglect them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, some Government departments are undergoing a

reshuffle   of   personnel  and  changes   to   the

administration   as  a  whole  with   a   view   to

introducing computerisation and modernisation.  All

these  are  meant  to raise the efficiency  of  the

Government administrative machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading between the lines of the Finance

Minister's Budget speech, we can see the reflection

of  the upward trend and the mood of the people  in

their effort to march forward in the path of nation

building. I cannot help giving my full support  for

the Minister for Finance's financial policy.



<br><br>6.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  Finance Ministers present surplus budgets  to

Parliaments,  Members  need not  necessarily  offer

bouquets  to  them since in modern  welfare  states

surplus  budgets are considered more as a  pedantic

luxury which developing nations cannot afford.  But

in  the  case  of  a  nation like  Singapore  while

maintaining   the   high   tempo   of   development

activities  with  a 14 per cent increase  in  Gross

National  Product,  thus  raising  the  per  capita

income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



from  $2,960  to  $3,317 in 1971, together  with  a

surplus  budget,  we  cannot  help  expressing  our

appreciation  of the Finance Minister  as  well  as

those   who  assisted  him  in  this  task.   While

simultaneously stressing the need to  maintain  the

same high standard, we should not hesitate to adopt

a  constructive and critical outlook in this Budget

debate so that the upward trend is not deflected by

unforeseen errors, even of an insignificant nature.

Hence,  the Government's financial policy statement

and  the  Estimates  of Expenditure  for  the  year

1972-73 presented to the House should be viewed  in

this perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, at the outset, state in categorical terms

based on my personal experience in this House, that

I  would  not  hesitate  to  appreciate  the  basic

approach  of our Finance Minister who has exhibited

in  the  past  a readiness to listen to  criticisms

from   all   sections  of  this  House,  and   many

suggestions which can be implemented were  accepted

without any reservations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one will dispute the fact that

the   economic   and   political   problems   which

confronted the Republic during the past  few  years

have  to  form  the backdrop before  we  are  in  a

position  to view the economic achievement  in  any

perspective.   As   against   neX1igib1e    natural

resources,   substantial   reduction   in   British

military expenditure, the necessity to explore  new

and  highly competitive international markets,  the

turbulent  political situation  around  with  extra

demand  on  our  defence, and a young  and  restive

population  demanding new horizons  in  development

planning   and  employment  along  with  a   highly

volatile  international monetary situation,  it  is

rather a pleasant surprise that our G.N.P, rose  by

$860.8  million  to  reach  $7,000.8  million-   an

increase of 14 per cent- within a period of  twelve

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister would prefer to call it a non-inflationary growth since, according to him, the

general  price level has not increased appreciably.

However,  the  latest issues of the Monthly  Digest

of Statistics' for January and February 1972 do not

appear attractive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



with  regard to consumer prices. There appeared  to

be  an  overall increase of approximately three  to

four  per  cent. But in the general context  of  an

overall  growth  as  related to the  general  price

level,  I  do  agree that there  has  not  been  an

appreciable increase. Nevertheless, it is  not  out

of  place to suggest that constant vigilance has to

be  kept  with regard to price levels so  that  the

growth is not retarded by inflationary pressure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by the Finance Minister, the structural

transformation  of  the economy  from  an  entrepot

trade to an industrial society appears to be moving

at  a desirable pace. It is rather sheer necessity.

prevailing   opportunity,  long-term  requirements,

along  with  the  spirit of entrepreneurship  which

have  accelerated this process. I observe from  the

figures  that  over the decade  the  share  of  the

manufacturing  sector,  as  related  to  the  Gross

Domestic Product, has increased from 11.2 per  cent

to  28.5  per cent, while that of the trade  sector

has dropped from 70.7 per cent to 55.5 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector alone has made

substantial  progress over the decade.  The  sudden

spurt  appears to have taken place during the  last

three  to four years from $716 million in  1968  to

$1,490.9 million in 1971. The entrepot and domestic

trades  together are maintaining an average  growth

rate  of  approximately 14 to 16  per  cent  during

1966-71  while there appears to be a  marked  drop,

that is, 9.6 per cent in growth rate during 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has maintained that domestic trade

fared  better and that it was entrepot  which  has,

due   to  logical  circumstances,  declined.  Here,

progressively   direct  trade   link   improvements

maintained by our neighbours had a negative  impact

on   the  entrepot  sector.  Leaving  alone   their

changing  role in trade patterns, even our approach

during  the  last few years has been to  promote  a

structural  transformation and, therefore,  not  to

continue  to  serve  as  out-posts  of  a  decadent

economy  which used to he subjected in the past  to

violent fluctuations, depending on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



rise  and  fall  in rubber and tin  prices  in  the

international markets. Hence, I might say  that  it

augurs  well  that a modest rise in domestic  trade

and  overall  accelerated progress in manufacturing

and  construction sectors will go  a  long  way  in

assisting  us in attaining the desirable  objective

of  full-employment  with one of  the  highest  per

capita income in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, may I also add that those

employed in the entrepot sector could be eventually

absorbed  into  the growing domestic  trade  sector

with  minimum dislocation. From that point of  view

also  expanding domestic trade sector is a  healthy

sign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears from

information  furnished  to  this  House  that   the

manufacturing  sector  has registered  the  fastest

growth rate, and we cannot rule out the significant

role    played   by   the   electronics   industry.

Incidentally I might say that this industry,  which

employs  a very high percentage of labour force  at

competitive  wage  rates, is expanding  its  export

markets substantially. At the moment there is a ban

on  the  exports  of strategic goods  to  Communist

countries   by  the  United  States  and   if   the

prevailing  political  climate  improves  for   the

better   between   East  and  West,   the   further

possibility of substantial increase in  exports  of

electronic goods can be expected in the near future

with  Singapore too sharing a part of that boom  in

terms   of  additional  employment  and  additional

positive points to our balance of payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making a reference to the manufacturing

sector,  the  Minister has stated in general  terms

about the prospects of multi-national manufacturing

concerns.  It  is  perfectly true  that  we  cannot

expect  a  complete diversification with regard  to

the  establishment of foreign-owned  industries  in

terms  of  nationality of the industrialists  since

only  matured  economies  with  a  high  level   of

technology   and  expertise  can  cope   with   our

requirements for industrial expansion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



and   sophisticated   international   markets   for

finished  products.  Nevertheless,  it  has  to  be

understood  if  our  industries  and  manufacturing

concerns  are  oriented  in  one  or  two   foreign

countries,  then stress and strain  in  the  parent

economy might be transposed to a limited extent  to

our  domestic economy. Leaving economics alone even

from political angle. "cornering of economy" by one

or   two   countries  might  eventually   lead   to

undesirable  pressures  when  we  are   facing   an

economic  turbulence.  Hence,  I  might  say   that

diversification  of  industries  on  a  nationality

basis should be considered as a healthy sign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While analysing the manufacturing and

construction sectors, we cannot afford to  overlook

the  fact  that of late both shipbuilding and  ship

repairing  have made substantial strides.  But  the

shortage  of  skilled manpower continues  to  be  a

serious   threat  to  accelerated   expansion   and

although   inviting  foreign  nationals  might   be

considered as a temporary measure. I might say that

we have to expedite with our programmes relating to

training   within  industry  along  with   overseas

training  with the parent concern. The shortage  of

labour,  if  I  am  not mistaken, appears  to  have

created the twin problems, namely, on the one  hand

it  has pushed up to an appreciable level the  wage

rates   with  sophisticated  pinching   among   the

different  groups and, on the other  hand,  it  has

created   minor   bottlenecks  in   the   expansion

programme.  Nevertheless, with all these drawbacks,

it   is   rather  interesting  to  note  that   the

shipbuilding  yards  have continued  to  receive  a

stream  of  orders for tankers as far away  as  the

Continent  while the repairing yards appear  to  be

fully booked for a longer period. Incidentally  may

I  add,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that we must continue  to

assure our workers employed in this sector and  who

contribute  to  our valuable foreign exchange  that

the   Labour  Ministry  will  continue  to  enforce

maximum  industrial safety so that the  price  paid

for  rapid industrialisation will not be that heavy

in terms of human sacrifice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has also referred to

trade deficits by the high cost of import of goods.

I wonder whether the devaluation of the U.S, dollar

would, in fact, keep prices down while, at the same

time,  pegging down the cost of production of those

goods  which require raw materials from the  United

States,  especially in the case of the  electronics

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is thinking in terms of invisible

items,  like tourism and insurance, to jack up  the

balance  of  trade  accounts  favourably,  then  he

should  have  definitely noticed that  tourism  has

increased  its share of the Gross Domestic  Product

from $30.5 million in 1960 to $323 million in 1971.

It  is  indeed  a general indication that  earnings

from invisibles have increased substantially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also stated that invisible items

like ship repairing might also bring in more on the

credit   side.  I  might  also  add  that   freight

insurance and building a nucleus of merchant  fleet

to  transport  our goods as well as  the  cargo  of

other countries across the seas might add up to the

invisible items in the balance of payments accounts

in  terms of transportation charges. It is a  long-term  approach. There is no necessity to overstress

this aspect of the problem since the Government  is

aware  of  the  heated debate in domestic  shipping

circles  over the alleged monopoly of some  members

of  Far  East  Freight Conference who  periodically

appeared  to  be  increasing their freight  charges

apart from creating problems relating to rights  of

cargo handling by national shipping lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of tourism and its contribution to

our   foreign   exchange  earnings  have   received

sufficient  attention in the  Budget.  But  I  also

notice that with regard to the hotel industry,  the

occupancy  rate has fallen from 73.5  per  cent  in

1969  to  65.4  per cent in 1971. The expansion  of

hotels  may have been one of the reasons  for  this

decline.  Nevertheless, I am afraid I  cannot  rule

out   the  possibility  that  sharp  increases   in

accommodation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



charges  and prohibitive prices of other facilities

to the tourists, including food and beverages, with

additional  taxes  over and  above  the  exorbitant

prices,  might  have had a negative impact  on  the

inflow  of  tourists especially in the  middle  and

lower  income  brackets. I  might  add  that  while

providing first-class amenities comparable  to  New

York  and Tokyo might be a desirable objective,  it

would  simultaneously be equally desirable to  keep

the  hotel industry under constant check, at  least

as  a  temporary measure, so that tourism can catch

up  at  a  faster pace. It is not out of  place  to

refer  to  the  spate of criticism  in  the  press,

including  one  from a Hong Kong businessman,  that

even  a  mild breakfast with coffee in one  of  the

first-class  hotels  in  Singapore   cost   him   a

substantial amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would also like to stale that a

congenial political climate both internally and  in

the  surrounding regions is essential for  economic

advancement   notwithstanding   all   other    pre-requisites.  Here  too  the domestic  situation  is

comparatively calm with a stable Government on  the

saddle. On the labour front too, although a  strike

here  and  there might be considered as  flexing  a

muscle,   by  and  large,  workers  have  responded

enthusiastically  by maintaining industrial  peace.

But  it  need not necessarily mean that  we  should

hold  on  for  a longer period with regard  to  the

division of the "National Cake".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection. I welcome the setting up of

the   National   Wages  Council   with   tripartite

representation which will provide assistance in the

formulation  of general guidelines on wage  policy,

and   recommend  necessary  adjustments   in   wage

structure with a view to developing a coherent wage

system   consistent   with  a  long-term   economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me express the hope

that  the  Finance Minister, who has not held  this

portfolio for a long period, has acquitted  himself

creditably,  and  I hope he will  be  in  the  same

Ministry to present us next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



year  with  another  painless  Budget  which  will

continue to reflect his ability to take the nation

along the highway towards economic progress.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to   join  my  colleagues  in  congratulating  the

Minister  for  Finance for presenting  a  painless

Budget.  Hence I fully endorse my support  to  the

motion moved by him on 7th March, 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I do not wish to repeat the

observations made by my colleagues nor have I  the

brilliance  or  intelligence to do  an  analytical

dissertation  on  the  well  presented   financial

statement,  for  much  ground  has  already   been

covered by Members of the House. Therefore, I will

confine myself to one small observation, i.e., the

involvement of public moneys by Government through

the  Economic  Development Board in  what  I  call

"adventurous projects".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance must be the most

elated   man   in   town.  The  success   of   our

Government's  economic  and  industrial   policies

deserve not only mere words of praise but  also  a

deeper  search  into the causes and factors  which

helped to put our economy beyond the stage of  the

launching  pad.  Only cynics and  pessimists  will

raise  doubts as to the present economic  buoyancy

of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I cannot hesitate to commend the Economic

Development   Board   for  its   achievements   in

attracting foreign investment into the Republic, I

am  a little sceptical as to whether the Board has

all  the information and, even more important, the

expertise  to  ensure  the  soundness   of   every

investment.  I  would like to know  what  are  the

factors that guide the Board before it decides  to

participate in some industrial ventures.  I  agree

that  direct capital involvement by the Government

would  lend  great credibility to any  project.  I

have  no  doubt  that  many  detailed  feasibility

studies  must  have  been made  to  ascertain  the

viability of each project.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



Unfortunately,  Sir, these  feasibility  studies

have  in some cases turned out to he nothing  more

than  speculation.  One can  no  longer  take  for

granted  that the Economic Development  Board  has

the  capacity, in terms of personnel,  to  justify

its  involvement  in  joint projects  with  either

foreign or local investors. Of course, one  cannot

summarily  dismiss the achievements of the  Board.

But  I believe the Government can save itself from

considerable  embarrassment  and  pain   if   more

meticulous  studies  are  made  before  Government

invests public money in adventurous projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the situation is further aggravated by the

nomination of Government representatives to  serve

on  the  board of directors of certain  companies.

These  representatives, their brilliance in  other

fields  notwithstanding, may know next to  nothing

in that particular undertaking. Sir, some Economic

Development Board officials do not appear to  know

the  real  value of money. I hear many a potential

foreign   investor  smacking  his  lips  when   he

negotiates terms with E.D.B, officials -  like  an

agile  cat  ready  to pounce  upon  and  devour  a

canary.  I  would earnestly urge the  Minister  to

strengthen  the  staff of the E.D.B, before  more

harm befalls us.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is  customary  on Budget day for the Minister  for

Finance    to   review   the   nation's   economic

performance.  We have been assured  that  we  have

done  well  and the common indicator  of  economic

progress, the G.N.P., has registered a 14 per cent

increase  which, by any standard, is an impressive

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, to the average man in the street,

this  means  very  little. What lie  is  basically

interested  is  whether he is  enjoying  a  better

standard  of  living today than  a  year  ago  and

whether  his take-home pay today can buy  him  the

same,  if  not  greater,  quantity  of  goods  and

services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government, I feel that in reviewing the

national  economic  progress,  we  should  not   be

obsessed  by  plus  or minus in percentages  alone.

Sir,  we  should attempt to look behind the figures

and  see whether we are a step nearer our objective

of  bringing  about a more just and equal  society.

Have  we  succeeded  in further  bridging  the  gap

between  the  haves  and  the  have-nots?  Have  we

succeeded in improving our physical environment  by

providing  a  greener, cleaner and safer  place  to

work  and  to play? Have we succeeded in  providing

better  and  equal opportunities for education  and

for  employment?  These are some of  the  pertinent

questions the average man in the street will ask in

deciding  whether,  as  a  Government,   we   have

effectively  carried out what we  set  out  to  do.

Unless  we  are able, as we have done  so  far,  to

continue to give satisfactory answers not  only  in

words  but in deeds to each of these questions,  we

shall  lose  the confidence and the  trust  of  the

people and whatever impressive statistics are shown

will be meaningless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this time last year the question of cost of

living   featured  predominantly  in   our   Budget

debates.  A  number of us had urged in  this  House

that  an up-to-date index of cost of living  should

be  introduced  so  as  to provide  a  rather  more

accurate means to measure any ups and downs in  our

cost  of  living.  It is, therefore,  a  matter  of

regret  that  no action has as yet been  taken  to-date. Sir, I would like to take the opportunity  to

urge   the  Minister  to  give  priority  to   this

particular  matter so that in subsequent  years  we

will be able to assess more accurately whether  our

workers have generally benefited substantially from

the  greater economic growth, or whether  they  are

caught in a wage and price spiral.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the setting up of the

National     Wages    Council    with    tripartite

representation  from  labour, employers  and   the

Government is to be welcomed. And it is pleasing to

note that among other things, the determination  of

equitable shares will henceforth be the concern  of

the Council. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



is  to  be hoped, however, that the recommendations

of  the  Wages  Council will have the whole-hearted

support  of enlightened employers on the  one  hand

and responsible union leaders on the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a representative from a constituency which

still  has  a very large number of people depending

on  agriculture for their livelihood, 1  share  the

disappointment  of the Member for Jurong  over  the

absence of any reference to the agricultural sector

by  the  Minister in his speech. In the  supporting

statistics,  it  is  shown  that  agriculture   and

fishing have contributed a sum of $188.3 million to

our total Gross Domestic Product as against that of

$171.2  million for the preceding year, an increase

of  4.3  per  cent.  Whilst the  increase  is  only

marginal and insignificant, when compared  to  that

of  25.1  per cent for manufacturing and  quarrying

and  that  of  22.3 per cent for construction,  the

total sum of $188.3 million is nevertheless a  very

substantial  amount  when  we  consider  that   the

contribution of the "glamour-service" industries of

banking  and  insurance  amounted  to  only  $112.6

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I appreciate that with the tremendous pace

of industrial expansion and extensive urban renewal

the  pressure  upon our limited land  resources  is

increasing  day  by  day,  it  is  unrealistic  and

impractical  to  talk in terms of  a  comprehensive

policy  of agricultural development in the  context

of  Singapore.  It is, however, in my  opinion  not

impractical to consider bringing about some  degree

of  stability  to this particular  sector  of  our

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years most of our farming

families  have  lived  in a state  of  uncertainty,

uncertainty over price fluctuations of farm produce

and    uncertainty   over   the    likelihood    of

resettlement.  In so far as price  fluctuations  is

concerned, as long as there is no price control, it

is  to be expected that the level of prices will be

dictated  by supply and demand patterns.  But  what

concerns  me  is  that whilst  retail  prices  have

remained fairly stable over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



the  years according to available statistics,  the

ex-farm  prices,  i.e, the  prices  received   by

farmers  from  middlemen, vary quite  considerably

over any one period of 12 months and often bear no

relationship to the retail prices paid by ultimate

consumers.  This is one area where  some  research

should  perhaps  be conducted so as  to  determine

whether certain measures can be taken with a  view

to  providing facilities that will enable  farmers

to  have  rather more direct excess  to  consumers

with resultant lesser dependence on the middlemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of resettlement, here again

I  appreciate  that this only takes place  when  a

particular piece of land is urgently required  for

development.  What I am wondering is  whether,  at

this  juncture, it is possible for us to designate

certain  areas  in  the Republic  as  agricultural

areas on a fairly permanent basis. And as and when

farmers  are  affected  by development,  they  are

resettled in such permanent areas without fear  of

being   resettled   once   again   by   subsequent

development  projects. This will  go  a  long  way

towards  giving greater peace of mind  to  farmers

and  will also help in more comprehensive planning

of  infrastructure development in  the  designated

areas  concerned, As we become more urbanised  and

industrialised, there is bound to be a minority of

people who will find the pace of life too much for

them  and  will  prefer  something  resembling   a

pastoral  way  of life. I do sincerely  hope  that

there will still be a place for such people in our

society to live a way of life they prefer and,  at

the same time, to contribute economically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in supporting the motion, I would

like to thank the Minister for increasing the vote

in  respect of urban and rural services under  the

Development  Estimates to $3.25  million  for  the

ensuing period. This increase will mean that  more

roads  and  other facilities can  be  provided  to

people living in the rural areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to support the financial policy statement

made  by the Minister for Finance in this House  a

week ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be greater emphasis placed on

research   and  the  building  up  of   indigenous

technological  capability, not  only  related  to

hardware engineering and consultancy services  but

also,  to  further end-uses of the  raw  materials

which   are  found  in  great  abundance  in   the

countries bordering us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1968, soon after the British announced

their  accelerated  military withdrawal  from  our

Republic, every effort and inducement was made  by

the  Government to promote and attract industries.

They were labour-intensive industries with primary

and  secondary  level skill content  to  meet  our

unemployment  problems. Today it  is  a  different

picture.  We  have full employment. Traditionally,

Singapore has been thriving for the last 150 years

on its entrepot trade with the additional function

of  a  transhipment and servicing centre. But this

important  sector of the economy is  growing  less

significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the growing number of school-leavers coming

out  each  year, our Government has  to  diversify

from the traditional commercial and servicing role

to  manufacturing, in order to absorb these  young

men and women. Therefore, for a start, we have  to

establish  labour-intensive  industries.  We  have

been  so  successful  in  the  promotion  of   our

industrialisation programme that we are now placed

in  a position which has compelled us to relax our

immigration laws by opening the employment gate to

foreign  labour to meet the shortage of industrial

labour.  But, unfortunately, this state of affairs

cannot  carry  on indefinitely. We  may  reach  an

unmanageable  situation if the number  of  foreign

workers  keeps on increasing. This may  wreck  the

fabric  of our social order, which our Government

has taken so much planning, effort, and energy  to

build up during the last six years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above circumstances, it is vital

and essential that we must give careful thought to

which direction our next step will be, and in what

kinds  of  industry we should concentrate  on.  We

have  limited  manpower, but we have  intelligent,

educated, disciplined and adaptable workers. If we

look  around the countries in Asia, we can emulate

the second greatest industrial nation in the world

-----  Japan.  She has no iron ore, bauxite,  coal

or   oil,  and  yet  today  she  is  the  greatest

shipbuilding and car manufacturing nation  in  the

world,  owing  to the industry and resourcefulness

of  her people who are, at the same time, creators

and   innovators   of  science   and   technology.

Therefore,  on a smaller scale, our  Republic  can

follow the excellent example of Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan gets her iron ore from Australia and oil

from  the  Middle East, and these sources  of  raw

materials  are  thousands of miles away  from  her

home  country. We are more fortunately placed, as

we  are  right in the centre of one of the richest

regions in the world waiting to be developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia and Malaysia produce rubber, tin,

timber,  and  many other natural resources,  which

are  raw  materials  for manufactured  goods  like

rubber   tyres, shoes,   waterproof   raincoats,

plywood,  veneer, etc. Indonesia,  which  is  less

than 30 miles away from us, is now one of the  top

five oil producing countries in the world. She  is

also   rich  in  minerals.  Therefore,  all  these

countries  are  potential manufacturers  of  goods

which are now being imported. Our neighbours  send

their  raw  materials to industrial nations,  like

Japan  and  the E.E.C, countries which manufacture

them  into  finished goods, and imported  back  to

their own countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country, being so strategically placed, can

play  an important role as innovators and creators

for   new   industries   for  these   neighbouring

countries   in  the  region,  if  our   engineers,

scientists and technicians will devote their  time

and energy in doing research into the uses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



of these raw materials. After successfully getting

the  know-how and expertise of turning  them  into

new  useful products, we can pass on our knowledge

to  our neighbours and establish industries  right

on  the spot where the raw materials are obtained,

thus  cutting  down the cost of freight,  handling

charges,  insurance,  etc. In  this  way,  by  co-operation  in our skilled manpower, expertise  and

finance,  and establishing cross-national ventures

with  our  neighbouring countries, the concept  of

regional co-operation would soon become a fact. At

the  same time, it will create trust and establish

a  better  friendly relationship between  all  the

countries  in the region for their collective  and

mutual benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now come to another

subject.  The  Member for Bukit Ho Swee  has  been

very articulate about the high cost of living  and

the  restraint  on workers' wages because  of  the

Employment  Act.  As an employer,  I  am  in  full

sympathy with the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some measures must be seriously considered by the

Government  to  improve the  earnings  of  workers

without   creating  an  inflationary  trend.   The

establishment  of  the National Wages  Council  is

most   timely,  and  1  hope  that  some  remedial

measures may result from the deliberations of  the

Council.  At the same time, it must also be  borne

in mind that without stability in wage rates and a

disciplined  labour force, foreign investors  will

think  twice before coming to our shores.  On  the

other  hand,  the  minor boom  prevailing  in  all

sectors  of the economy have been largely  due  to

the  efforts  and cooperation of our  hard-working

and  disciplined  workers  and  responsible  trade

unions.  To  prevent  an inflationary  trend,  any

spiralling increase in wages due to union  demands

will  create  a situation where productivity  will

not in the long run catch up with the increase  in

wage  rates. It will be a vicious circle and  will

affect  the workers most, due to the high cost  of

living caused by inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee,

the Prime Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



recently  announced the granting  of  one  month's

extra  pay to all Government servants. The private

sector  should respond to the clarion call of  the

Prime  Minister. I have a proposal  to  make,  and

that  is  to give a high cost of living  allowance

equivalent to 10 per cent of the basic pay to  all

workers drawing less than a total remuneration  of

$750  per month. The workers in this wage  bracket

form  the majority of our working population,  and

they  are  affected  most by the  rising  cost  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Members who are concerned with

trade  unions will sound a word of caution to  all

workers  to be patient, and to play their part  in

the  long-term interest of the nation. I  am  sure

that  with  their understanding and  co-operation,

the   Republic  will  reach  greater  heights   of

prosperity in the l970s, which in turn will mean a

higher standard of living for everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on that note, I beg to support

the financial policy of the Finance Minister.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am grateful to Members  for  the

many  congratulatory  and  approving  remarks   of

Members on the financial policy which I dealt with

in  my policy statement. As the Minister in charge

of  financial policy, it was my privilege and good

fortune  to  be  able to present an annual  Budget

Statement   which  was  entirely   painless,   and

therefore  received  the  approval  of   so   many

Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hasten to disclaim any credit solely for

this result, it is quite obviously impossible  for

any one man, except as a member of a team, to have

achieved  this result, which has been the  product

of  a  sustained effort over many years by  people

from  the top leadership of the Government to  the

Members  of  Parliament, to the party  and,  above

all,  as I said in my annual Budget Statement,  to

the  workers of all classes and occupations. Apart

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



these  remarks,  I would like to say  how  much  I

appreciate  the many suggestions and  constructive

criticisms  I  have  heard today.  They  are  most

valuable  and  I  propose  to  give  very  careful

consideration when I have the time to  study  them

in  Hansard. I say so, because many speeches  were

made,  some for the first time in a new  language,

and  there  may  be  some loss in  interpretation.

Therefore, if I deal with these remarks in  a  way

which  shows some lack of comprehension, I ask  to

be  excused.  The  remarks, of course,  vary  very

considerably.   For  example,   the   Member   for

Serangoon   Gardens  remarked  that  he  obviously

thought  that  my  Budget  Statement  suited   the

residents  of Serangoon Gardens very well  because

of  the  tax reliefs. On the other hand, my Budget

Statement was perhaps not quite as welcomed by the

Member for Jurong, whose problems are farmers, and

agriculture,  and  fisheries, and  also  by  other

Members concerned with adult education. And  there

were  also views with a mixture of both  good  and

bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard a number of suggestions for further

tax  reliefs, but while I am prepared to  consider

them  for  further  painless budgets.  I  think  I

should  say  right  now  that  it  will  be  quite

impossible  to  exempt all workers  from  taxation

measures;  if  the definition of "workers"  ranges

from  those who are now already exempted from  tax

to  those  who, as in my definition of workers  in

all  classes  and occupations, are not  only  just

manual  workers  but  also  those  who  use  their

brains.  There were some suggestions  for  reliefs

for   maintenance  of  parents,  and  others   for

expenditure on quality-control equipment.  On  the

latter,  there is already a provision in  the  law

whereby  accelerated depreciation can  be  allowed

for  approved equipment, particularly for research

and development and methods related to science and

technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the suggestion from the Member for

Telok Blangah regarding relief to poor people  who

use  electric fans, and are thereby charged  at  a

high rate of electricity for lighting as against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



cheap  domestic power. I believe this matter  will

be  resolved  by the Public Utilities  Board  when

they adopt a new tariff system in which the supply

of  both power and lighting will be calibrated  by

the  same meter. Consumers will then have  to  pay

the same rate for both electricity and power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Will it cost more or less?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> From what I have gathered, it

will  cost  the small consumer slightly less.  But

this matter is still under examination because  of

its  effect upon industry. Nevertheless, I believe

a decision will be taken fairly soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with some of the other

comments  under  various subject heads.  First  of

all, I welcome the exhortations which many Members

have made regarding the necessity for hard work. I

thank  the  Members  for Telok Blangah,  Serangoon

Gardens, Sembawang, and River Valley among  others

for  bringing this to the attention of workers  in

all  classes  and  occupations.  The  comments  on

workers were made under the various subject  heads

like  the National Wages Council. I think quite  a

number of Members touched on this. The Member  for

Moulmein  stated  that  I  had  not  stressed  the

importance of this Council in my Budget Statement.

However,  I thought I had mentioned that this  was

one  of the strategic objectives for the next  10-year  Development Plan. It is one of  the  two  or

three most important objectives, and I have placed

great  emphasis on the importance of the  National

Wages  Council, and the deliberations  which  they

are  going  to make over the next few months.  But

their  first recommendations are important because

they  will  set the tone for the whole Council.  I

have no doubt that they will pay attention to what

all  the Members have said in this House and  will

certainly consider the four main points which  the

Member for Moulmein has brought up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, I have no

doubt that the Wages



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



Council will consider his views in greater detail.

The  views on bonuses, fringe benefits, and so on,

are, really a matter for the Wages Council, and  I

do    not   want   to   anticipate   what    their

recommendations  will be by saying  anything  here

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some mention of closing the income gap

between the haves and the have-nots. I do not know

whether this classification is meaningful  in  the

context   of  Singapore,  where  there  is   great

mobility  so  that the present-day have-nots  very

soon  get into the position where they become  the

haves.  Therefore,  what we all  want  is  a  more

egalitarian  society.  At the  same  time,  it  is

necessary  to  stress that rewards  should  go  to

those  who  make the effort and not to  those  who

merely  think that just because all men are equal,

they  should also have a share of the reward.  The

principle  is  that there should be equal  rewards

for equal effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great number of Members welcome the annual

allowance,  or  the 13th payment, which  has  been

introduced  by  Government, I have no  doubt  this

will  be  taken as a guide for the private  sector

and will to some extent determine the attitudes to

be  taken  as  to whether or not bonus  should  be

payable.  On the Government side, it is felt  that

this  13th payment is necessary in order that some

extra  funds  will be available  for  the  festive

seasons,   like  Christmas  and  the   New   Year.

Therefore, this lump sum payment is very  welcome.

Whatever  the  decision is as to  whether  or  not

bonuses  should be paid, I think this 13th payment

is likely to be welcomed by all parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Wages Council, I need only say that what

we  want  to achieve is an orderly and progressive

increase in workers' remuneration, in the interest

of  all parties concerned. The need for industrial

peace  is  not less important because  of  evident

economic  development; rather, we must expect  all

to  try  their hardest to progress further and  to

achieve  the  same growth rate  for  the  next  10

years.  I  hope the Member for Bukit Ho Swee  will

not disagree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



with  me  if I say that the tripartite partnership

between  Government,  management  and  labour,  is

really  what  we  want to achieve.  It  is  not  a

confrontation   we   want   between   labour   and

management, with Government as a referee,  in  the

Wages Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of suggestions on industrial

safety,  productivity  and  the  introduction   of

quality control, in order that workers can improve

on the quality of their products thereby obtaining

a  share  of  the greater profits derived  from  a

better  sale  of these products,  I  am  sure  all

Members  will support the suggestions  which  have

been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broad range of remarks was related to the

social   adjustments  which  are  likely   to   be

necessary in this period of rapid economic  growth

that  is  expected for this decade. I welcome  the

comments made on the need to make wage adjustments

so that we have a more egalitarian society. I also

welcome  the  remarks on the  improvement  in  the

quality of life as we go up the economic scale.  I

do not necessarily subscribe to the idea suggested

by  one Member that the economic progress that  we

are  likely  to  achieve will bring  with  it  the

degenerative and corrosive aspects we see  in  the

West. These are not necessarily the by-products of

affluence. If we have regard for the cultural  and

traditional  values of the East, I have  no  doubt

that we can, by special efforts

--  and  no  doubt the guiding efforts too  of  my

colleagues,  the  Ministers for Home  Affairs  and

Culture  prevent a decay setting in  our  society,

such as has been experienced in some countries  in

the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the suggestion by the Member for

Kampong  Kapor that we should try and get more  of

our  women to work in industry and trade. I  think

this is an excellent suggestion. The percentage of

our  women in our present work-force is rather low

as compared with some of the industrially advanced

countries. The present shortage of labour  can  be

very quickly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



and  easily met if we can increase the  number  of

our  women who are prepared to work for a  living.

This,  of  course,  brings with it  the  attendant

problem of providing cr�ches where children can be

taken care of while their mothers go to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with another topic which is

apparent  in many comments, i.e., the  problem  of

price  increases, which the Members for  Moulmein,

Potong Pasir, Jurong, Anson, Jalan Kayu, and a few

others dwelt upon. With regard to the necessity of

keeping  prices down, I should like  to  say  that

this question is always uppermost in our minds.  I

welcome  the NTUC's initiatives which resulted  in

the setting up of CASE, and their consideration of

forming a Consumers' Co-operative. There seems  to

be  a misconception on the part of the Member  for

Jalan  Kayu  that  nothing has been  done  to-date

about producing a cost of living index, which will

be  considered more satisfactory than the  present

index.  The  position is that we  have  started  a

household expenditure survey, and an index will be

ready  in  course  of time. This  is  because  the

survey  requires  fairly detailed book-keeping  by

housewives  who  are invited to help,  and  it  is

hoped  to be completed by the time the next Budget

Statement  is made in this House. In the meantime,

we  will,  do whatever we can to try and stabilise

the  cost  of  living. However, it is  not  always

possible  to  keep prices down.  If  we  take  the

international  price of sugar as an  example,  our

housewives  will have to pay perhaps a price  very

much  higher  than the controlled price  which  we

have imposed on our local sugar refineries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another series of remarks were related to

immigration    problems.   The    relaxation    of

immigration laws brings with it certain  problems.

We  should  realise  that if  we  allow  unmarried

workers  to  immigrate into  Singapore,  there  is

bound   to  be  some  social  tension.  But  these

problems will have to be dealt with as they arise.

There are also difficulties in deciding who are to

be allowed in, e.g., whether the foreign musicians

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



on  aesthetic  grounds better or only  as  good  as

those  we have locally. This is very much a  matter

of  taste. I do not claim to be capable of  judging

the  respective merits of those musicians who  make

such  a  lot  of noise in our night spots!  if  the

criterion is merely how loud you can play, then  it

is subject to scientific determination. However,  I

am reliably told that other values are involved.  I

would  suggest  that  if our  local  musicians  are

really better than foreign ones who are now allowed

to  come  in large numbers, then it should soon  be

evident  to all those who are in the business  that

in  the end the foreign musicians will, because  of

the  high  cost of importation, have to lose  their

places to our local boys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there were some remarks on the various

Ministries. I do not claim to be able to answer for

all  of them, hut perhaps I can start by commenting

on  the remarks made on matters within my Ministry.

A  number  of  Members have touched on  tourism  in

their  speeches. I am grateful to  them  for  their

suggestions  for its improvement.  I  am  sure  the

Tourist  Promotion  Board will  take  note  of  the

exhortations made by the various Members in  regard

to the Board's effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a few remarks which. I think, were not

perhaps  quite justified. One was the  question  of

taxi  drivers  raised by the Member for  Katong.  I

think  he  spoke  of  taxi drivers  mulcting  their

fares.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I qualified it by saying "a

minority of them".



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> In fact, I was going to defend

them  by mentioning the reports in the Press  about

taxi drivers who had been very honest.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I mentioned that too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> You did? Thank you. There was

some  mention about hotel rates being  high.  I  am

afraid  I  do  not  quite follow  the  argument.  I

believe that if Members are in-the-know about these

things  and  are prepared to ask for rebates,  they

will find that our hotel rates can be extremely low

by   international   standards.   They   are   very

reasonable.  In fact, the occupancy rate  has  gone

down. One Member wondered why the occupancy rate is

in  reverse  proportion to the number  of  tourists

coming  in.  The answer is very simple.  There  are

more  rooms than the required proportion  to  cater

for the number of tourists coming in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another suggestion that the prices in

some of the coffee houses are rather exorbitant.  I

am  a  bit puzzled by this because, although I have

also  read  the same letter in the press concerning

this  matter, I believe that quite a number of  our

young boys and girls now make it a custom to go  to

these  coffee houses. I cannot understand how  they

can   afford  it  if  the  prices  are  very  high.

Nevertheless,  this is a matter which  the  Tourist

Promotion Board may well consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now go on to the Economic Development

Board,   A  very  serious  criticism  against   the

Economic  Development Board was made by the  Member

for  Changi, although he did praise its efforts  at

economic promotion. He said that they had gone into

risky  ventures, and he took exception to  this.  I

should  like  to inform him that the E.D.B, itself

does  not  participate in industrial  ventures  any

longer. Therefore, I cannot understand his remarks.

Their  efforts  are  now  confined  solely  to  the

promotion  of industrial ventures, while industries

are  being  financed  by the  Development  Bank  of

Singapore. The feasibility studies which the E.D.B.

make  are  usually for the benefit of entrepreneurs

so  that they will be encouraged to investigate  in

further detail the various projects that have  been

studied.  I  do not think the E.D.B, can  guarantee

that any feasibility studies they make will ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



that   anyone   investing  in  the  projects   will

certainly  make  money. But  if  his  criticism  is

against  the  Government going into these  ventures

and  against the competence of our officers in  the

Boards  of Directors, I should like to say that  in

some  of  these ventures the directors have  proved

that,  even if the Member considers them  not  very

capable,  they  would  at least  be  able  to  make

profits  for  the  owner, that is, the  Government.

These   profits  are  particularly  good   in   the

shipyards  that  we  own. I think  the  Member  for

Changi should know whether this is an industry that

requires particular skill in management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa suggested that we should

consider  setting up a secondary Stock Exchange  to

deal with shares of ventures which are rather risky

and  do  not qualify for listing under the  present

Stock  Exchange  Regulations. I am rather  hesitant

about  this suggestion. I do not think we  want  to

encourage our shareholders, who are perhaps not  so

well informed about shares, to place their money in

such ventures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah welcomed the intention

of the Ministry of Finance to mechanise the various

Government  Ministries  and  departments.  I   will

certainly press on with this mechanisation. He  has

also  mentioned manufacturing industries,  and  has

made a number of suggestions in, for instance,  the

electronics,  ship  building  and  ship   repairing

industries. He has also made various other  remarks

on  trade  and  tourism. I  have  noted  all  these

remarks and will give them consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noted the remarks of the Member for

River   Valley   on   the  development   of   local

technology.  His remarks strike a very  sympathetic

chord.  It  may  be because I was involved  in  the

setting  up  of the Industrial Research Unit  which

has   now   become  the  Singapore  Institute   for

Standards and Industrial Research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now deal with the suggestions made about

the various Ministries. As I have said, I can do so

only on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



very general basis because I am not responsible for

them.  The Member for Paya Lebar has said  that  in

respect  of  education, the  pendulum  has  perhaps

swung   too  far  in  the  direction  of  technical

education.  I myself do not think so, in  fact,  we

could  do  with  a  lot  more technical  education.

However,  I  accept  the point which  he  no  doubt

wanted to make, and that is, that in our pursuit of

science  and technology, we should not  forget  the

need  for a knowledge of the humanities and of  the

social sciences, particularly those which deal with

political  as  well as social leadership.  I  think

among the many tasks which this Government has been

faced,  the  most difficult one - it  may  be  more

difficult than promoting a G.N.P, growth rate of 15

per cent per annum is the promotion of a spirit  of

national  consciousness, a sense of  identity  with

the country. If we can inculcate this spirit in our

people, then many of the other tasks which we  have

set ourselves will be made that much easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also listened with great sympathy to the

Member for Jurong's very eloquent address in favour

of  agriculture and fisheries. The Member for Jalan

Kayu  has  given his wholehearted support  to  this

matter.  I  can only say that, although I  did  not

make   mention  of  this  subject  in   my   Budget

Statement,  I am fully conscious that  we  must  do

what   we   can  to  promote  the  development   of

agriculture and fisheries, as we will have to  keep

all  our  economic sectors as viable  as  possible.

However, in  the context of Singapore, agriculture

must  be of an intensive nature. We simply  do  not

have  enough land for the kind of farming  that  is

very  extensive and which is in evidence  in  other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also spoke of our limited

33,000  acres of agricultural land and about 23,000

families  who are dependent on farming and fishing.

Our  agricultural farming must be of the kind which

produces  leafy vegetables. We have never  produced

rice  and Singapore cannot produce any rice. I hope

that we would never have to attempt to produce  any

of the staple commodities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



However, we have given every encouragement to  the

ways  in  which Singapore can be most  productive.

This  is  animal  husbandry,  concerned  with  the

production   of  pigs  and  also  with  industrial

methods  of  rearing poultry, i.e., if  you  start

with an egg at the top of an industrial or flatted-farm  building,  it should after going  through  a

spiral  come  out at the end as a  chicken!  These

projects  in  animal husbandry,  egg  and  poultry

production,  have pushed its contribution  to  the

G.D.P, to the very high value, as has been quoted

by the Member for Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also made a plea for the setting up of an

agricultural bank, and was very aggrieved that  in

spite  of having made this suggestion a year  ago,

the  matter has not been taken up. I am  afraid  I

must  keep on disappointing him because I  do  not

think  there  is  enough business  to  justify  an

agricultural bank in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the financing of fisheries, the

Development  Bank  of  Singapore  has  already   a

division of at least several officers to deal with

loans  to  fishing fleets. Again,  the  amount  of

business  which they have been able to do  is  not

very large. I would suggest to the Member that the

best hope for financing is though the Ministry  or

the  department concerned with the extension  work

of  supplying poultry or pigs to the  farmers  for

rearing. The other method would be by fostering co-operatives, which was also mentioned by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to fisheries, as pointed out by the

Member for Jurong, it is true that we produce very

little for our own consumption. As Chairman of the

Economic Development Board for a number of  years,

I  tried to foster deep-sea fishing projects,  but

did  not  quite succeed. It does seem  as  if  our

young boys are so accustomed to urban living  that

they are unprepared to go for long periods out  to

sea  to catch fish. The various efforts which have

been  made have not been quite successful. If  our

local  boys and local entrepreneurs have any  real

interest  in deep-sea fishing, I think they  would

get  great  encouragement from both the Government

and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



Development Bank of Singapore. And I am sure  that

our  Marine Police and other departments will  try

and  protect our fishermen wherever they can  from

being  arrested,  unless  they  stray  into  other

territorial waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu mentioned the

resettlement of farmers. He seems to consider that

the   Government  should,  as  far  as   possible.

resettle  our  farmers  in permanent  areas  which

would  be  kept  for that purpose.  That  is  very

difficult in the circumstances of the very limited

land  available.  Various  Government  departments

themselves have had in the past to be resettled in

favour of other Ministries. I  remember that  when

Jurong  was being established and we were  pushing

westwards,  all of a sudden a few,  hundred  acres

of  land  were suddenly lopped off for the Defence

Ministry from the Master Plan for Jurong Town, and

all  our plans had to come to a dead halt.  If  it

was  not  possible in the old days for either  the

Jurong Town Corporation or the E.D.B, to safeguard

their lands, it is very doubtful that the needs of

farmers   can   over-ride  those  more   important

considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now come to ports. It was said that T

had  not mentioned anywhere in my Budget Statement

the progress of our container port. The Member for

Anson is obviously very interested in this. But  I

am  riot responsible for ports other than to  make

financial  provision  for it  in  the  Development

Estimates. However, I am sure that with a vigorous

Chairman  at  the  head of the Port  of  Singapore

Authority, its development is not lagging. At  the

last  World  Bank meeting, we certainly registered

our  interest  in financing for this subject  with

the World Bank directors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two Members mentioned the Far East Freight

Conference and the treatment given to the  Neptune

Orient  Lines.  I do not wish to say  anything  at

this  stage about the Far East Freight Conference,

and  the Neptune Orient lines' claim for a greater

share in the cargo trade. I would merely say  that

for  some  of the shipping lines in the Conference

to  make  claims  on our cargo  trade  because  of

historical grounds is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



really  to invite a reply on a political basis.  It

certainly smacks of colonialism to speak  of  their

traditional right to the cargo trade of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong suggested that it is

desirable  to  aim at a higher rate of  growth  for

public housing, especially when urban renewal sites

are  not  being let out for further development.  I

can   assure   the  Member  that   any   slack   in

construction activity will certainly be taken up as

a matter of priority for public housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for the tribute which has been paid

to  the Parks and Trees Division. Perhaps it is the

Member for Katong who made this comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have dealt with most of

the  points raised by Members. I would merely  like

to  say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



that  it  has  been very  pleasant  to  be

Minister  for  Finance at a time when  the  economy

enables  you to be a popular Minister, and  I  hope

that  our economy will equally continue to boom  in

the next few years.
