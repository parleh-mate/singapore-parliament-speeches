<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I said yesterday that the 16 Hong

Lim resolutions were concocted not to save the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



country but the flagging political fortunes  of  the

Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clue to the whole thing can be found in the

Member's  speech  yesterday.  He  quoted  the  Prime

Minister's speech in the Assembly in April 1958. The

Prime   Minister  in  that  speech  said  that   the

attention of the people of Singapore was focused  on

the City Council and that it had captured the hearts

and  minds  of the workers. The day when the  Member

for  Hong Lim was the Mayor of the City Council  was

the golden age of Singapore politics, for the simple

reason that he was the number one bossman. Sir, I do

not  deny that the P.A.P. City Council captured  the

hearts  and  minds of the workers of Singapore.  Nor

can  I  deny that the Member for Hong Lim  did  some

good   work.  But,  at  the  risk  of  earning   his

displeasure,  I will say - and so do the other  P.A.P.

Councillors  all  but one of whom today  are  P.A.P.

Assemblymen  on  this  side of  the  House - that  the

former  Mayor  likes to think that  all  the  credit

should  go  to him. He forgot that it was the  Party

and  not  the  Mayor  or Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  as  an

individual  who  won the hearts  and  minds  of  the

workers.  It was this delusion that what the  people

fell  for was his personality which had led  him  to

the  present impasse. He wanted people to treat  him

as  a  superman,  a  Tarzan and a Flash  Gordon  all

rolled  into one. Therefore, when he was on strained

to  work  as a member of the team in the Cabinet  he

found the whole thing distasteful. It was inevitable

that  he  should  clash with Cabinet colleagues  who

refused  to  treat  him as a superman.  He  disliked

having  to  do things which helped to build  up  the

reputation of the Party as a whole. What he  enjoyed

most  was  building  up  a myth  of  the  invincible

superman  single-handedly fighting against desperate

odds.  So,  Sir,  he  started first  with  intrigues

within  the  Cabinet, trying to play  one  colleague

against   another.  He  employed  the  now  familiar

technique  of 'I, good man. You, good man.  But  he,

bad man.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have had occasion in this

debate  to remind hon. Members of Standing Order  46

(1) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not  be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br>All  these  details of the personal conduct  of  the

Member  for  Hong Lim appear to me to be  completely

out  of  order, unless, of course, they are  brought

forward  on a substantive motion. I would also  like

to  remind hon. Members that we are on the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech and Standing Order  13  (2)

states, inter alia:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Debate thereon that is, on the speech shall be

confined to the policy of the Government as outlined

in  the  speech and on amendments (if any) moved  by

Members...".



<br><br>As  I have said before, there may be some bearing on

the  general state of affairs in Singapore anent the

personal conduct of the Member for Hong Lim. But  if

the Minister embarks on details of the nature he has

enunciated, then I think he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself am not

interested in the personal conduct of the Member for

Hong Lim, but what I want to point out is the action

that  he  took as a member of the Government  within

the   Government  to  divert  the  policies  of  the

Government and subvert the Government. Sir, I  shall

try  to  avoid bringing in details and I shall  only

outline  the general technique that was  adopted  by

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, at first he began by trying to play

one  Cabinet colleague against the other. When  this

failed,  he  then  turned on  to  the  Parliamentary

Secretaries,  trying to win them over with  childish

inaccuracies,  that the Party might  cheat  them  of

their  pay, that their telephones were being  tapped

by  the  secret  police, and so  on.  This  got  him

nowhere.  Then  he  turned to the Assemblymen.  That

also  got  him  nowhere  except  for  the  two   who

obviously decided to follow him to the other side of

the  House.  But  he  never tried  to  convince  the

Government of the correctness of his stand on the 16

resolutions except to bring them up in this Assembly

and  which  he  offers  as a  panacea  for  all  our

troubles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



In  fact,  his  intrigues were never  based  on  the

merits or otherwise of the 16 resolutions which have

now  become a major topic with him. They were  based

purely  on  the  exploitation of the baser  side  of

human nature, like fear, cupidity and jealousy,  all

of  which were testified to by statements signed  by

Assemblymen on this side of the House. Of course, he

has  claimed  that these statements  were  extracted

from the Assemblymen by force and intimidation.  The

Assemblymen concerned are here and it is up  to  him

to challenge any Member on this side of the House to

get  up  and say that he signed these statements  by

the Party under duress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having failed to make any headway inside the

Government  among the Cabinet members, Parliamentary

Secretaries and Assemblymen, his next target was the

party  conference of cadres, Assemblymen and  branch

secretaries  held  in June. Obviously,  a  different

technique  was called for. So he brought in  the  16

resolutions in order to get support. Here too,  Sir,

he  lost out and again he explained away his  defeat

by  claiming that those who voted for his  expulsion

did  so  because the place, was surrounded by secret

police  armed with guns. The hundred or  so  members

who  were  present there knew very well  that  there

were  no  guns and no secret police. But he was  not

interested   in  trying  to  win  over  people   who

obviously had lost any respect they might  have  had

for  him.  So  it has now come to a point  where  he

alleged    yesterday   that   the    Cabinet,    the

Parliamentary  Secretaries and  the  Assemblymen  on

this  side of the House are no longer revolutionary,

that  they are led by colonial-minded leaders,  that

they  have  betrayed the principles of  the  P.A.P.,

that   this   Government  is  run  by   the   famous

trio - Blades, Thomson and Meadows - and that the P.A.P.

have  achieved nothing during the past year  except,

of course, the Ministry of National Development. The

wonder  of it is that if he really believes in  what

he  says now, then how is it that he managed to stay

in  such a reactionary Government for one year?  And

he  would  have  stayed on had  not  the  Government

decided  to  precipitate matters by  asking  him  to

leave. Or is it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



suggested that the P.A.P. has been reactionary  only

since  June - about two months ago - when he was ejected

from the Government and from the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech yesterday, he claimed that he could

not  see any difference between the policies of  the

present Government and what he described as the  Lim

Yew  Hock Government. Also to sustain his claim that

the  P.A.P. is no longer revolutionary,  he  quoted

extensively from the 1954 P.A.P. Manifesto. Sir,  it

is  good to know that the Member for Hong Lim  draws

spiritual sustenance and inspiration from a document

drafted  long before he entered the Party by  people

who   are  still  in  the  Party.  He  also   quoted

extensively  and approvingly speeches  made  by  the

Prime  Minister. It is strange that the  Member  for

Hong  Lim should find spiritual nourishment for  his

anti-colonial spirit from the speeches of a  man  he

now    describes    as   pro-colonialist.    Equally

noticeable, Sir, is that the Member for Hong Lim  at

no  time  quoted any speeches by himself to  sustain

his  anti-colonial flame. I do not think  that  this

was due to any modesty on his part. The sad truth is

that there is little relevant material worth quoting

from  his  writings or his speeches. The Member  for

Hong  Lim  was  one of our leading slogan  shouters,

slogans generally provided for him by the Party, but

he has contributed little to the theory and practice

of  anti-colonialism. He has been telling us in  the

last  few days how he is going to fight colonialism;

but  during the last four years - and during  the  one

year   he   was  in  the  Government - he  has   never

contributed  anything  by  way  of  any  theoretical

article  to  show how best we can fight colonialism.

The  only major contribution was an article  to  the

P.A.P.'s  Fourth  Anniversary Souvenir  publication,

and the only notable thing about this article is its

title.  It  reads  "Since I became  first  Mayor  of

Singapore". The other contributions to the  souvenir

dealt  with  such  topics as "Preparing  Ourselves",

"The New Phase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



after Merdeka", "Our Economic Future", "The National

Approach to the Problem of Education", and so on. As

against  such weighty and adult topics,  the  Member

for  Hong  Lim's  contribution was  on  the  subject

dearest to his heart - himself. All the four years  of

struggle  of  the P.A.P. was not worth noting.  What

was worth noting by the world at large was "Since  I

became first Mayor of Singapore". From his point  of

view,  the  history  of  Singapore  falls  into  two

periods - before  Eng Guan, and after  Eng  Guan.  His

resentment  against his Party and his colleagues  in

the  Government  springs from his belief  that  they

have  refused steadfastly to accept him as a man  of

destiny  and  a  superman. So today he  accuses  the

Government of being reactionary, of being run by pro-colonial leaders, and of being stooges of the famous

trio - Blades, Meadows, and Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think there is one man who thinks otherwise.

I  intend  to call him to testify on our  behalf.  I

know  that  next to God, this man is  held  in  high

esteem by the Member for Hong Lim. That person is no

other   than   the  former  Minister  for   National

Development. I know for a fact that the  Member  for

Hong  Lim  will not dismiss the former Minister  for

National  Development  as  a  stooge  of  the  Prime

Minister nor as a pro-colonialist, nor as a man  who

can  be  intimidated into saying things he does  not

want  to  say. I am referring to the speech made  by

the former Minister for National Development in this

House on 21st July, 1959, [Hansard], Vol. 11, No.

6.  This was said in the course of a debate  on  the

address  of  thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech.  I  am quite sure that as far as the  Member

for  Hong  Lim is concerned, there can be no  higher

authority   on  any  matter.  In  his  speech   made

yesterday  and the day before, the Member  for  Hong

Lim  contended  that in stressing the  limits  under

which  the present Government had to work,  we  were

talking  like the Progressive Party and the Lim  Yew

Hock   Government.  Yet  this  is  what  the  former

Minister for National Development had to say on 21st

July, 1959, Hansard, col. 347, 4th paragraph:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, we understand the limitations of the

present   Constitution,  which   do   restrain   the

political  power  of the elected representatives  of

the  people. We do understand those limitations.  We

do  understand  that the elected Government  has  to

work  within certain defined powers and  that  there

are  curbs  and  restrictions on  those  powers  and

functions which a normal fully elected Government is

supposed to exercise."



<br><br>Was  the  former  Minister for National  Development

talking  like  the Lim Yew Hock Government  when  he

said  this? Was he saying these things in  order  to

fool the people of Singapore into accepting what the

Member  for  Hong Lim now brands as  a  pro-colonial

constitution?  Yesterday, the Member  for  Hong  Lim

argued    that    the   present   Constitution    is

unsatisfactory because the British,  to  quote  him,

"still exercise control politically and economically

and  that  these  controls are more far-reaching  in

consequence  than the control they  exercised  under

the  1953 Constitution." Yet here is what the former

Minister for National Development had to say on this

subject, at col. 347:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, we also understand that within the

island  state of Singapore, we also have limitations

on  our  economy, limitations which even a  magician

turned  Minister for Finance cannot solve. I do  not

envy my colleague, the Minister for Finance, for his

heavy  tasks. But we the P.A.P., understanding those

very  limitations, have come up today  and  accepted

the responsibilities of Government because there  is

no choice left to the people."



<br><br>This  confession  places  the  former  Minister  for

National  Development in an awkward spot. From  what

had  been said by the Member for Hong Lim, it  could

only  mean  that  the former Minister  for  National

Development  assumed  power  and  office   under   a

constitution  which  he  knew  gave  colonialism   a

tighter  grip on the Island's economy. I wish,  Sir,

that  the  former Minister for National  Development

were  here to defend himself against the smear  that

he  is  a  colonial stooge. I am sure he would  have

dealt  with  the Member for Hong Lim in  a  language

that  would constrain you to call him to order.  But

fortunately   the  former  Minister   for   National

Development is not here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, yesterday the Member for Hong Lim

described  the Minister for Finance as belonging  to

the  pro-colonial faction of the Government. And yet

the   former   Minister  for  National   Development

expressed high regard for the Minister for  Finance.

In  fact, he said that he understood the limitations

on   our  economy  which  "even  a  magician  turned

Minister  for  Finance cannot solve."  And  he  also

said. "I do not envy my colleague, the Minister  for

Finance."  And he went on to say that he  could  not

understand why Members of the Opposition  had  spent

so  many  days  debating and yet were  not  able  to

contribute any constructive ideas to the running  of

the  Government  machinery but just  to  attack  the

Government, especially the Minister for Finance. The

Member  for  Hong Lim also suggested  that  we  were

supporters  of colonialism if we continued  to  work

under  the  present  Constitution.  Yet  the  former

Minister  for National Development, after  outlining

the limitations of the present Constitution, said we

would be shirking our duty if we failed to work  the

present Constitution. I quote col. 347:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The masses cannot get what they want - even the

basic necessities which any modern Government should

be able to provide. And it is the task of the P.A.P.

Government,  knowing the political and the  economic

limitations of the present situation, to come up and

accept the responsibility of this Government, as  we

did so in the City Council. When we were in the City

Council,  our  powers  were as  limited  within  the

framework of the Constitution as our powers  now  in

the   present  Government  are  limited  within  the

present  framework of the new Constitution.  But  we

will  be taking a wrong move if we refuse to  accept

the responsibility of Government."



<br><br>Sir, I am not trying to create bad blood between the

former  Minister  for National Development  and  the

Member for Hong Lim, because I know a bond of mutual

admiration  exists between them. But the point  that

needs to be clarified is whether the former Minister

for  National  Development was or was not  deceiving

the  people knowingly by saying things which he  did

not believe to be true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim now contends that this

Constitution  is  a  fraud and that  we  should  now

reopen talks with a view to liquidating the remnants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



of  colonialism, that is, fight for the independence

of  Singapore. Yet the former Minister for  National

Development  suggested, in  that  same  speech,  the

course  to be followed in order to gain independence

for Singapore. I quote col. 348:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our way is the way of ultimate independence

through merger with the Federation, and before  that

is  achieved  we have to accept whatever limitations

are  imposed on this Government by the so-called new

Constitution - limitations  imposed  on  us  in   this

island State with no raw materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term policy - that is, the providing of

the  basic  necessities of life to  the  14  million

people of this island - and in our long-term policy of

attainment  of  reunification of Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya, one thing is  paramount  and

that   is,  Mr  Speaker,  the  unity  of  all   the

communities and the races in Malaya."



<br><br>That  was the strategy that the former Minister  for

National  Development  advocated  was  necessary  to

achieve  independence for Singapore. So,  I  do  not

know whether the former Minister would therefore  be

described  as  being pro-colonialist or pro-Meadows,

Thomson,  Blades, or a stooge, if  he  continued  to

talk in the fashion that we are talking today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it may be that the Member for Hong Lim

might - one  never  knows  how  he  behaves - decide  to

attack  the former Minister for National Development

in  this fashion, If he has such intentions,  may  I

draw  the  attention of the Member for Hong  Lim  to

another  far-sighted  remark  made  by  the   former

Minister   for  National  Development:  the   former

Minister  knew  that there would be opportunity  for

demagogues - and not very bright demagogues at that - to

exploit    the   limitations   that   the    present

Constitution  imposes.  Any  petty  demagogue,   the

former Minister for National Development knew, could

try to embarrass the Government by taking ultra Left

lines. For all I know, he might have had people like

the  Member  for Hong Lim in mind when he  made  the

following observations (col. 348):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the limitations of the Constitution,

the  role  of  the  Opposition  is  even  much  more

important  than ever. The role of the Opposition  is

to  provide constructive criticism to the Government

and not just to attack



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



the  Government in all its policies. We  have  heard

speeches from the Opposition Benches and I have  not

even  heard  for  one single moment  any  Opposition

speaker  give  any constructive ideas.  Perhaps  the

hon.  Members in the Opposition are not  capable  of

doing  it. Then what they should do is not to  speak

too long."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been listening to the 16 resolutions which

the  Member for Hong Lim and his comrades have  been

offering the nation for the last two months. Not  so

long  ago,  the  Member for Hong Lim held  a  public

lecture on "How to Fight Colonialism". None  of  the

speakers put forward any concrete measures on how to

fight colonialism. Not one of the speakers was  able

to  put forward as effective a strategy as that  put

forward  by the P.A.P. and endorsed by the former  .

Minister for National Development. For example,  one

of   the   resolutions  asked  that  the   Singapore

Government  should  reopen  talks  with  the  United

Kingdom  with  a view to revising the  Constitution.

What  we  are not told, however, is in what way  the

Constitution should be revised; If what is asked for

is  that we should have complete independence,  then

the  former Minister for National Development agreed

that  it was not practicable for two reasons. First.

having regard to the power situation in this part of

the  world, the British would not agree  to  such  a

proposition in any case. Secondly, independence  for

a  small  island like Singapore would  be  a  phoney

independence.    Economically,    politically    and

militarily,  even  an independent  Singapore  cannot

withstand  outside  pressures.  These  are  not  new

arguments.  They were thrashed out publicly  in  the

Tanjong Pagar by-election and in public speeches  by

P.A.P. leaders, in articles and editorials  in  the

Party  publications long before the  elections.  The

contention  then was that we had no  choice  but  to

accept  what we described as three-quarters Merdeka,

and  it was first propounded in the Petir, our Party

publication, as far back as May, 1956,  three  years

before  the general elections. I have looked through

the  past issues of Petir for contributions  by  the

Member for Hong Lim for any dissenting opinion  from

him; and for a man who now poses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



as  the leading theoretician of anti-colonialism  in

Singapore,  together with the Member  for  Aljunied,

there  appear to have been no more than one  or  two

articles in all these four years from him.  Nor  did

he  ever raise any objections with any of his  Party

colleagues  during the three years  discussion  took

place  about what should be the strategy  we  should

adopt  in  the  particular  situation  obtaining  in

Singapore. The choice as we saw it then, and  as  we

see  it now, is that we either accepted power  under

conditions  of  qualified  independence,   or   left

colonialism  to  carry on through Right-wing  forces

who  would  have  wiped out not  only  the  Leftwing

adventurers but the non-Communist Left as well. That

is  the  choice still, and the Member for Hong  Lim,

apart  from  slogans,  has not produced  one  cogent

argument  or constructive suggestion as to  how  and

why the anti-colonial fight could be carried out  by

other  means. Another of the 16 resolutions  demands

that  we  should  hold  talks  with  the  Federation

Government for merger. Fine. But how does he propose

that  we  should do it? Do we summon the  Federation

leaders  and say, "The time has now come to talk  of

merger,  because the Member for Hong Lim says  so."?

Or do we send an ultimatum to the Federation leaders

telling them that either they start talks on  merger

or  else  the Member for Hong Lim will invade  their

territory with his liberation army?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim knows that we have done

everything   we   can  do  to  get  the   Federation

interested in merger. He also knows that merger will

not  come simply by demanding it.. He knows that  it

is  a long delicate process of convincing the people

of  the  Federation, in particular the Malays,  that

they have nothing to fear from merger and everything

to  gain as a result. The Member for Hong Lim  knows

all this, because when he was still in the Party  he

was   convinced  that  our  strategy  was  the  best

strategy   to   gain   eventual   independence   for

Singapore.  The  Member for Hong  Lim,  by  bringing

forward   resolutions   which   he   knows   to   be

impracticable,  is doing so in order  to  offer  his

services  to the Left-wing adventurers who  used  to

twist his tail once



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



upon  a time. In his speech yesterday, he said  that

he   bore   no   ill-will  towards   the   Left-wing

adventurers who tried to oust him from the Party. He

did  not  take this Christian attitude of  forgiving

his  enemies at the time when he was smarting  under

defeat. He was all for fixing them. But now that  he

has  no  longer any following within the P.A.P.,  he

offers his services to these adventurers because, in

his present plight, he cannot afford to be choosey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said the day before what the

Left-wing  adventurers  want  is  an  atmosphere  of

tension and uncertainty, and that is why the  Member

for Hong Lim comes forward with resolutions which he

knows are impracticable and foolish. But that is the

price  he  has  to  pay  for  the  support  of   the

adventurers who he thinks would reinstate  him  into

the  superman that he thinks he should be.  And  the

Left-wing  adventurers have a different  reason  for

wanting  the  Member  for Hong Lim  to  raise  these

phoney issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is a non-Communist socialist Party, and

it  is necessary for Left-wing adventurers, who  are

not  as clear-headed and as realistic as they should

be,  to  show  that a non-Communist socialist  Party

cannot  satisfy the needs of the masses for a better

life. They fear probably that the P.A.P. might  show

the masses that a non-Communist, socialist democracy

can work in Singapore, and in Malaya eventually.  So

it  is  necessary to take action now to prevent  the

P.A.P. from  succeeding in its experiment,  and  in

order  to do that, it is necessary to revive tension

and  uncertainty to make sure that no  economic  and

stable  political development takes place. So  that

they   can   say,   "There  you  are.  Non-Communist

socialism  cannot work." Another reason  is  perhaps

that  by reviving tension and uncertainty, they hope

to  drive  the  P.A.P. into the arms of  either  the

Right-wing, and thus discrediting itself in the eyes

of  the  masses or, they hope, into the arms of  the

Left-wing  adventurers, who have  been  increasingly

disturbed  by the fact that the P.A.P.,  during  the

last  one  year, has not accepted any  control  from

them, and has chosen to act independently in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



the interest of the P.A.P. and nobody else. And that

is  a  situation  which they  are  not  prepared  to

tolerate.  What  they want is to create  tension  to

force us into their arms so that they can manipulate

the  P.A.P. to  serve their own interest.  Whatever

happens,  they  can be sure that the P.A.P. has  no

intention of becoming dependent either on the  Right

or  Left-wing adventurers, and the Member  for  Hong

Lim would be better advised to tell his manipulators

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim also complains that

the Government was intimidating the Press, and, as a

result, his speeches and those of his comrades  got

only  500 words, and that of Mr George Thomson,  he

complains,  got  2,500 words. It is  true  that  the

Government discussed the matter of Ong Eng Guan with

the representatives of the local Press. We explained

to  the Press representatives the nature of the game

that  the Member for Hong Lim was playing, and  that

was  to whip up tension and agitation by circulating

fabricated  stories,  inaccuracies  which  he  hoped

would   provide  fuel  to  inflame  passions,   and,

therefore, create a situation in which it  could  be

said  that  the  whole  of Singapore  has  risen  in

support of the 16 resolutions. He knew that  he  was

not putting forward his point of view or stating his

case,   but  he  was  quite  prepared  to  use   the

newspapers to create a situation which could lead to

public  disorder.  There  was  no  intimidation.   I

explained these things to the Press. In fact, one of

the  newspapers  informed us that they  had  already

decided,  after  the first Press conference  by  the

Member for Hong Lim - to quote the words of the editor

concerned - "to cut out any drivel". They agreed, and

we  also  agreed with them, that if he said anything

worthwhile,   anything  new, anything   which   was

legitimate, they would print it, but that they would

keep a look-out for any material which they knew  to

be   either  fabricated  or  calculated  to  inflame

passions, and then they would, of their own  accord,

cut down stories of that nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Member for Hong Lim can fabricate

news.  Let  me  give a few instances.  He  made  the

charge  that at the Party conference last June,  the

place  was  surrounded by secret police  armed  with

guns.  Again  he charged that Assemblymen  had  been

intimidated  personally by the Prime  Minister  into

denouncing him and his action. In fact, I think  the

day  before yesterday, he even said that an  article

under  my name in the Petir of 14th July was  really

not  written by me but by the Prime Minister.  Well,

Sir,  for  something like 15 years I have earned  my

living  by  writing for newspapers, and, that  being

so,  I  think I am quite capable of writing  my  own

speeches. In fact, that particular article was  only

a  reproduction of a speech I made before 150  Party

members,  and it was also made impromptu. There  was

no  written script. Secondly, the Prime Minister was

not  at that meeting, because he happened to be away

from Singapore on that day. The Member for Hong  Lim

knows  all that. But he fabricated this story purely

in  the  hope of convincing the people outside  that

the  Minister  for Culture is really a  pro-Ong  Eng

Guan  man, but that he has been made to say  things,

he  has  had his arms twisted by the Prime Minister,

who  wrote his articles and his speeches.  In  fact,

yesterday,  the  Member for  Hong  Lim  reached  new

heights  of  recklessness  by  repeating  inaccurate

statements   about   Indonesian  soldiers   invading

Singapore.  He also tried to exploit  the  issue  of

Nanyang University, which he knows is a delicate and

highly  emotional issue. I would say that the Member

for Hong Lim has politically reached the point of no

return,  and  I  have no doubt that  in  the  coming

month,  his  remarks  will  reach  new  heights   of

recklessness on the basis of "after me the deluge".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Member for Hong Lim raised the issue of

the  two  journalists recently detained. He  doubted

whether  they were really K.M.T. agents. He  claimed

that  they  were arrested because they attended  his

Press conference. Let me briefly give the background

of these two journalists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wong Chin Sen, one of the detained journalists, had

long  worked for K.M.T. papers. In 1956 he was  sent

for  studies in Taiwan and attended a K.M.T. school

for  cadres on political service, taking  what  they

call  a post-graduate course for overseas graduates.

This  included,  Mr  Wong  admitted,  living  in  a

military  camp and being taught military  drill  and

discipline.  In 1955 he was one of the  four  K.M.T.

personalities behind the organisation  of  an  anti-Communist  movement among Rightist students  of  the

Chung  Cheng High School. The purpose was to recruit

young  people to go to Taiwan for higher  education,

which  also included K.M.T. indoctrination  and,  no

doubt, military training as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other journalist, Loke Peng Lum, had also been

long  associated with K.M.T. organisations which  we

regard  as  subversive organisations, because  their

purpose  is to encourage local citizens to be  loyal

to  the Taiwan Government. Mr Loke also worked  for

K.M.T. papers and admitted to being a K.M.T. member.

He  was  trained in the Central Military Academy  in

Hung Chiang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is the record of the K.M.T. activities that

these  two journalists had pursued. Prior  to  their

arrest, they were working for the Tiger Press which,

since  its  inception,  has  consistently  published

stories  which, more often than not, were fabricated

and completely false, with the intention of creating

dissatisfaction against the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not surprising for two reasons. First, the

proprietor   of  the  concern  had  instructed   the

journalists     that    he    wanted     anti-P.A.P.

stories - stories  which would  discredit  the  P.A.P.

Secondly,  because many of the staff  of  the  Tiger

Press  consist of journalists who had  to  get  away

from  Singapore  as a result of Government's  action

against mosquito and yellow publications. So, K.M.T.

journalists,  graduates  of  yellow  newspapers,   a

proprietor who has given instructions that all he is

interested  in  are  anti-P.A.P. stories - all  these

three  elements  conspired together not  to  publish

news  but  to  fabricate stories. We  ignored  these

mischievous  stories for a while. In fact,  we  drew

the attention of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



managing editor of the paper that while we  did  not

care two hoots whether they criticised us or not, we

would not tolerate fabricated stories prejudicial to

the  maintenance  of  public order.  In  fact,  very

often,  they published stories which were calculated

to   rouse  communal  prejudices  and  hatred.   For

example,  they  had  a  story  when  there   was   a

controversy  over  the  Nanyang  University  issue;.

claiming  that  the Prime Minister  had  decided  to

boycott  the  Nanyang  University  convocation.  The

intent  was to arouse suspicion among the people  in

Singapore that the present Government and the  Party

had   suddenly   become  adherents  of  anti-Chinese

culture and anti-Nanyang University. And at  a  time

when feelings could be aroused, this paper continued

to   publish  completely  fabricated  stories.  They

admitted they were fabricated and, in fact, the  two

journalists confessed that they knew that what  they

and the Tiger Press were doing was such as to invite

trouble for themselves from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, when the Ong Eng Guan affair came into

prominence, the Tiger Press, with the aid  of  these

two  journalists, published irresponsible and  false

stories    which   could   have   led   to   serious

disturbances.  The K.M.T., like their  counterparts,

the   Left-wing  adventurers,  were  interested   in

fishing in troubled waters - not only fishing  but  to

stir  up the water as well. For example, during  the

excitement over the Ong Eng Guan affair,  the  Tiger

Press   published  a  story  from  their   Singapore

correspondent saying that Lim Ching Siong  had  been

put  under  house arrest. The story  was  completely

false.  The journalist concerned knew it was  false,

but  there  was no doubt what the purpose was.  They

felt  that in the tension created by the controversy

over the Ong Eng Guan issue, a story like this could

create  dismay and agitation among the followers  of

Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong, and possibly could  lead  to

disturbances  which would suit the  purpose  of  the

K.M.T.   It   was   because  of   these   sustained,

mischievous stories calculated to incite people  and

possibly  threaten public order that we  decided  to

take  action against the two journalists long before

the Ong Eng Guan affair came into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



prominence. It is true that we thought that the  two

journalists,  having regard to  their  past  record,

would  not  have hesitated one moment  to  fabricate

further stories which could have led to disturbances

and  possibly far more serious consequences. It  was

for  that reason that we decided to take in the two

journalists  and  detain them. Perhaps,  it  is  not

surprising  that the Member for Hong Lim should  now

find himself in a position where he has not only  to

fall  back  on the support of K.M.T. agents  but  to

defend them as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday and the day before yesterday, the

Member for Hong Lim challenged the Government to say

what  were the mistakes it had made during the  past

year.  If  it is any consolation to the  Member  for

Hong  Lim,  let us say that the biggest mistake  was

the Member for Hong Lim. The biggest mistake we made

was  appointing  the  Member for  Hong  Lim  to  the

important post of Minister for National Development.

The  Opposition also know this. That is why some  of

the more awkward questions they have directed at the

Government  very  often concerned the  work  of  the

Ministry  of  National  Development.  The  Ministry,

under  the former Minister for National Development,

we  admit, constituted our Achilles heel. The former

Minister  spent  so much time plotting  against  his

colleagues that he had little time or energy left to

carry  on the more important but less exciting tasks

of  building houses for the people and providing the

architects  and technicians to build schools,  roads

and  hospitals.. After all the oratory  and  thunder

about  social revolution during the past  year,  the

Minister for National Development claims that he has

built  no more than 124 units. Sir, this was  simply

because  the  former  Minister had  reorganised  his

Ministry  so  thoroughly that when you  pressed  the

button,  the wheels did not turn. He had malayanised

his  Ministry  so  completely that  there  were  not

enough  architects  and  technicians  to  carry  out

Government plans of reconstruction. However, Sir, we

are  not evading responsibility for what he did. The

mistakes that the Member for Hong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



Lim  made  we  will accept as the  mistakes  of  the

Government.  In  fact,  Sir, until  he  raised  this

challenge,  we  had  not  decided  publicly  to  pin

responsibility for the blunders in the  Ministry  of

National  Development  on  him,  but  since  he  has

challenged us, we shall say that he was the  biggest

mistake of all. That was one of the reasons  we  had

to  remove him from the Government; to isolate  him,

to  deprive him of his powers gradually, because  we

knew that if he had been allowed to go on as he did,

then   the   Ministry  would  have  collapsed.   The

Government  projects  and  plans  would  have   been

brought to nothing. All we could have done then  was

to  ask the Minister for National Development to  go

out  personally and put up houses, bus shelters  and

standpipes,  which  I am quite sure  he  would  have

attempted  to do. In fact, it was this knowledge  on

the  part  of  the Minister for National Development

that  his  Ministry's  plans of  reorganisation  and

Malayanisation  policy  were  gradually  coming   to

naught  which prompted him to call the  whole  thing

off  and declare the Constitution unworkable. It  is

far  nicer, he thinks, to make meaningless  speeches

about anti-colonialism. It does not at present  need

great ability to sit down and write speeches - perhaps

have speeches written for him by others - but it needs

a little more ability to sit down quietly and put in

hard constructive work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has now embarked on a

new  career. But this time, this man would  probably

meet with more than verbal censure if he should show

the  kind  of  loyalty he has shown  to  his  former

colleagues and Party to which he owes such  prestige

and respect as he may still enjoy among the people.

Also  now  that  he  has gone to  the  side  of  the

Opposition, may I also add the warning that since he

has failed to subvert the Government on this side of

the  House, it is possible that there would be  more

dissension  within  the  ranks  of  the  Opposition?

Anyway,  Sir, I wish the Member for Hong Lim success

in  his new career of adventurism. May his Left-wing

adventurers have mercy on his soul when they  decide

they have had enough of him.

<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Prime Minister's

motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for

his policy speech last month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the P.A.P., I am proud of its record

of  work in the past. Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite  of

the  strong criticisms made by hon. Members  on  the

opposite side, the people have clearly seen how  the

Government has solved many of the difficult problems

left by the Lim Yew Hock Government, and how we have

fulfilled   our  Party's  promises  to   them.   The

prosperity and stability of this State in  the  past

one  year  will  surely win the  confidence  of  the

masses.   If   we  can  only  have  a  more   secure

environment,  we can bring about greater  prosperity

and happiness to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always been a Party which has the

courage to face reality. It is because of this  fact

that we called a meeting to discuss the work done in

the  past one year. We will continue to make further

improvements and effect timely rectification of  our

past mistakes, so that we will be more efficient  in

our  tasks in the coming year. Hence, in the  policy

speech, we have boldly admitted our few mistakes and

shortcomings in the past one year. We are  not  like

the  old  Lim  Yew  Hock Government which  concealed

their  foul deeds. When they could no longer do  so,

they   became   corrupted,  and  their  organisation

collapsed. It is not a habit of the P.A.P. to  make

false promises. The policy handbook published by  us

at the time of the General Elections is our guide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our general policy on women has been firm and

realistic.  The  past one year  has  been  of  great

significance  to  them. Under the  guidance  of  the

Government,  the women's movement in  Singapore  has

made  favourable  progress.  The  humiliations   and

tragedies  suffered  by women have  disappeared  for

good  with  the  collapse of the old government.  In

order  that  they might enjoy legal  protection  and

basic human rights, the Minister for Labour and  Law

recently introduced the Women's Charter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



which  will  usher  in  a  new  era  for  women.  In

accordance  with the recommendations of  the  Select

Committee  on the Charter, we shall make  amendments

to  the  Charter. To protect the interests of  girls

and  women, the Government has also taken firm steps

to  deal  with  people who live on the  earnings  of

prostitutes.  The women and girls'  section  of  the

Ministry  of Labour has cooperated with  the  Police

anti-vice squad in making surprise raids on  hotels.

Preventive  measures have also been instituted.  All

hotels  used  for immoral purposes were  ordered  to

close  business  and the proprietors concerned  were

punished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service provided for the settlement of family

disputes   is   even   more  comprehensive.   Female

magistrates will be appointed to deal with cases  of

maintenance  allowance.  A  female  magistrate   has

already   been  appointed  to  deal  with   juvenile

delinquency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Government's policy on housing, there is

a  statement  in  our booklet on our Five-Year  Plan

which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is important we should build low-cost housing

units  so that housing would be within the means  of

the  poorer classes of the public. At the same time,

housing  units will have to be designed to suit  the

needs    of   the   people   employed   in   various

occupations.'



<br><br>Owing  to  the  administrative mess in  the  various

sections  of  .the S.I.T. under the old  Government,

much   time   was   spent   in   reorganising    the

administrative work during the past one year. Today,

under   the   positive  direction,  of   the   P.A.P

Government,  many housing :schemes are in  progress.

When the Housing Board was established, it estimated

that for the next 10 years at least 14,000 units  of

houses  should be built annually in order  to  solve

the housing problem. However, owing to the defective

organisation of the S.I.T. in the Urn Yew Hock  era,

there  was only an annual output of over 1,000 units

of  houses.  That  is why there is still  a  housing

shortage  in  Singapore. I must point out  that  the

P.A.P.  Government  is  one which  looks  after  the

interests of the poor. The Housing Development Board

has plans to build en masse low-cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



houses  to meet the needs of the workers. A  housing

project  is  included  in the Five-Year  Development

Plan.  Under  this project, it is estimated  that  a

total  of 52,000 units or an annual average of  over

10,000 units will be built in Queenstown, MacPherson

Road,  Kampong Tiong Bahru, Alexandra Road,  Kallang

and Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Government, taking into consideration

the  economic situation in the State will  press  on

with its tasks ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members on the opposite side want to confuse

the  people. They only know how to shout  a  lot  of

slogans or suggest many impracticable plans. We must

take into consideration the limitations within which

to  achieve our objectives. The shouting  of  a  few

slogans  will not be of benefit to the  people.  Our

stand  is firm. We are determined to strive for  the

completion of the Five-Year Plan and to struggle for

the  building  of  an independent, democratic,  non-Communist and united Malaya.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, let me on behalf of the people  of

Choa  Chu  Kang express our thanks to the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  for his speech  delivered  on  20th

July, 1960, at the opening of the second session  of

this  Assembly. I have made a thorough study of  the

Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara's  policy   speech   which

dispassionately     reviews     the     Government's

achievements during the past year and which sets out

the  future construction plans and the Bills  to  be

introduced.  The great achievements of the  past  14

months should be attributed to the understanding and

co-operation of the people and the correct  guidance

of  the Government. We should not be complacent with

these achievements, because we have still a long way

to  reach our goal. However, these achievements will

stimulate us to further efforts in order to, fulfill

the mission bestowed on us by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be inappropriate if

there is only praise without admitting our mistakes.

During  the  past  14  months,  we  did  make   some

mistakes,  but  they have been rectified.  Moreover,

this Government will make use of the past experience

gained  to pave the way for nation building  and  it

will  adopt  a realistic approach to deal  with  the

affairs of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, though Singapore is a tiny island

dependent on its entrepot trade, a lot of its people

live  on  farming and poultry breeding in the  rural

areas.  This  section of the people do not  live  in

peace  and  happiness, as they are supposed  to  be.

They work day and night on the farms and yet, due to

the  high  cost of fertilizers and the  unreasonable

prices  offered  by the purchasers of  their  crops,

they  are  unable  to  pay  their  debts  from   the

proceeds.  Superficially they  have  farms  full  of

green vegetables but, as a matter of fact, they  are

all  the  time facing the embarrassing situation  of

whether  to pay their bills, thereby getting  a  new

supply of fertilizers, or to keep the money for  the

livelihood and go without the fertilizers.  Further,

if  the  landowners irrationally reclaim  the  land,

they  have  to  face  yet another grievous  problem.

Although  there is a group of farmers whose  incomes

may  not be below the subsistence level, they number

only a few.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result of the combined

effort  of the labour of the people and the research

work of the Veterinary Department, the production of

chickens,  ducks  and  pigs is increasing  with  the

times  and  the poultry strains are being constantly

improved.  Therefore,  our poultry  quality  is  not

inferior   to   that  of  advanced  countries.   Our

production of eggs not only meets the demands of the

island's  population but it can also be exported  to

neighbouring  countries. Unfortunately,  the  local

production of eggs has been recently handicapped  by

the  imposition  of  a tariff by the  Federation  of

Malaya  and  our own free trade policy. Consequently

in the face of this keen competition, the producers'

incomes have been much reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Hansard, Vol. 13, No. 1,

paragraph 4 of col. 11 and paragraph



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



1 of col. 13, you will see that the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara has expressed the intention  of  the

Government.  Here  after, this Government  will  pay

attention  to  internal  influences,  and  it   will

introduce mechanical techniques and provide  medical

facilities  in  order that the farmers  and  poultry

rearers  can  increase  their production  and  raise

their standard of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you have been to the rural

areas,  you  will  easily find  out  the  unbalanced

development between rural and urban areas.  In  view

of  this, a Rural Services Advisory Council has been

set up to adjust the unbalanced development, that is

to  say,  to  look after the forgotten interests  in

those  areas, and to provide services of all  kinds.

This  Council has been carrying on its work smoothly

for   a   year - supplying  electricity   to   densely

populated areas, erecting street lamps, laying water

mains  and  installing standpipes in  water-shortage

areas, constructing proper .drainage systems in low-lying and swampy areas, paving pedestrian side-paths

to  roads  where  school-children  cross,  or  where

traffic   is  heavy,  building  public   roads   and

agricultural roads to facilitate traffic of vehicles

and  villagers, constructing bus-stop sheds for  the

convenience  of  the  residents, repairing  damaged

roads   to  prevent  accidents,  and  also  building

children's  playgrounds,  roofing  urban   drainage,

improving back-lanes, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council is paying special regard to areas

neglected  by  the  past government  and  is  giving

priority to these areas to provide all the necessary

services;  whereas  the plans  for  areas  specially

favoured  by the previous government are temporarily

laid  off, while their funds are allotted  to  other

areas  badly needing improvement. Hon. Members  here

can  clearly  see  that the  Government  has  not

changed  from  its previous policy or deviated  from

its  election  promises, and that the  Council  will

exert more efforts to serve areas needing priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to increase social

services  for  the  60,000 babies born  every  year,

Government must expand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



school,  hospital and housing facilities.  In

achieving  this, we have to utilise  more  and  more

lands.  Contrasting the limited land  available  and

the  unlimited  increase in the  population,  it  is

evident  that  in future some arable lands  will  be

acquired by Government for social purposes. Thus the

land  holdings  will be reduced,  unless  Government

build  more  and  more skyscrapers at  present.  The

people  must look for some other outlets  for  their

families' surplus labour. This situation is  already

taking place. The families of workers in urban areas

are increasing and the children after leaving school

have  to look for jobs. If I am not mistaken,  there

are  at  least 30,000 children leaving school  every

year,  of  whom only a small number go  for  further

study.  The  rest  enter  the  labour  field,   thus

increasing the existing figure of 48,000 unemployed.

Mr  Speaker, I believe you and the Members of  this

House  understand  the work of the  Government.  Any

government has to face the problems of unemployment,

whatever  its political system is. The  question  is

whether  the government will assuage and  solve  the

problem or let the situation deteriorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, being a responsible government,

we  have to find a solution and the best solution is

to  industrialise.  If we fail to industrialise  the

whole State, then the government will in consequence

succumb  to the pressure of the unemployed,  despite

its tremendous capabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government never shouts empty slogans;

during the past 14 months, over $100 million capital

has  been  invested in this country. This investment

is  a  concrete proof of our realistic approach  and

our  attainments. On the other hand, the  Government

is  taking  further  positive  action  by  providing

2,438½  acres of land in Jurong. Can anyone  simply

say  that  this  Government does  not  shoulder  its

responsibilities?  Can  anyone  allege   that   this

Government  has  not  done  anything  to  solve  the

problem  of  unemployment? I think  the  Member  for

Mountbatten is still hibernating - sitting in the yard

and looking at the sky.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now that the politicians,

economists and those concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



unanimously    recognize    the    importance     of

industrialisation, I do not intend to touch  on  the

problems  of  a  Common Market,  raw  materials  and

technicians.  But  I  would like  to  say  something

relevant  to the relationship between employers  and

employees. If there happens to be industrial  unrest

and   no   solution   can  be   found   during   the

industrialization  stage then the  industrialization

plan  will  be  handicapped. Of  course,  industrial

peace must not be maintained at the great expense of

either  party,  but  it  can be  maintained  through

negotiations  between workers and  employers,  their

mutual   understanding  and  cooperation   and   the

impartiality  and rationality on  the  part  of  the

Government.  Perhaps in performing this function  we

may come across frustration and difficulties, but if

all  parties  concerned  can,  use  the  medium   of

negotiation  in  the, interests of  the  country,  I

cannot   see   why   industrial  peace   cannot   be

maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will be happy to see that a

Labour Advisory Council will be set up consisting of

representatives   of   both   the   employers    and

Government. Its functions have been elaborated on by

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his policy speech.  I

firmly  believe  that  industrial  schemes  and  the

maintenance  of  industrial  peace  will   be   much

benefited  from  a  comprehensive  study  and  joint

discussions.  I  am here congratulating  in  advance

their successful performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this age of scientific

inventions  and  the  rapid  growth  of  industries,

scientific and technical training and the raising of

the cultural level among the workers and farmers are

indispensable  in  order  to  carry  out  industrial

expansion. This Government has devoted much  of  its

efforts  to  the development of the Polytechnic  and

other  technical institutions in order to train  and

provide  more  technicians for the  industries.  The

elimination  of illiteracy is a great and  difficult

task,  and should be shouldered by every section  of

the community. Since the introduction of the Lembaga

Gerakan Pelajaran



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



Dewasa Bill in this House, the Board has  been

set  up this year and action has been taken to carry

out the programme. Iii his speech on "The Problem of

Adult  Education" over Radio Singapore  last  night,

the  President of the Council, Mr C. V. Devan Nair,

clearly described the purposes and the activities of

the Board. Excuse me now for quoting an extract from

his  speech for the benefit of hon. Members so  that

they  can  better  understand its significance.  The

third paragraph of his speech reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The success of a democratic society depends on the

participation  of  its citizens  in  its  democratic

activities.  In our society, the social,  political,

cultural and economical behaviour of the majority of

our  people will decide our direction and objectives

we  are  heading  for. We must bear  in  mind  blind

thought will create blind action, which in turn will

bring  about regrettable consequences. On the  other

hand,  correct thought will bring about wise action,

as a result of which we will be able to head for our

significant and understandable objectives.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member give the name and date

of that paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Nanyang Siang Pau,

page  2.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this long-term  campaign

for  eliminating  illiteracy will teach  the  people

their  duties to the society and, furthermore, raise

their  cultural level in order' that they can better

master  their  work in industrialization  and  other

aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last two days, the

Member  for Hong Lim has kept on boasting about  his

ointment  in  his old tune accompanied by  a  broken

Chinese  violin. He boasted extravagantly about  his

sacred ointment and his dental technique. But he was

crazy;  he  forgot that an intelligent audience  was

aware  what sort of ointment he was publicising.  Of

course,   people  can  understand  that  a   dentist

graduated  from  a  dental  college  with   complete

equipment  is  more efficient than a  quack  dentist

with  only  a  simple  tool and that  the  qualified

dentist  is  more  able  to  extract  teeth  without

causing pain and even substitute a new set of teeth.

Yet  the  quack dentist still blows his trumpet  and

beats his drum all over the place. Mr Speaker,  the

P.A.P. is no magician playing tricks to deceive  the

people. We will never boast



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



to  the people that we can make Singapore as big  as

Malaya  at a glance. Nor will we boast that  we  can

make Singapore full of large factories overnight. We

are not capable of those tricks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those who have closely watched

the  conditions  in our country and  also  the  hon.

Members  here  all know that, now in  Singapore, if

there     is    no    industrialization    or     if

industrialization  fails, what conditions  Singapore

will   face   and   what  kind   of   serious   test

parliamentary  democracy will face;  and  developing

thereafter, what kind of a position will emerge?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government is

reforming our society with reason, dispassion and  a

realistic attitude, and also in accordance with  the

mission   entrusted  to  us  by  the   people.   The

responsibility of the Government, on the  one  hand,

is  to  see  that  the people will get  a  just  and

reasonable  share  of their labour  and  enjoy  good

social  services. On the other hand, the  Government

must maintain industrial peace, and assuage the wave

of  increasing unemployment so as to maintain social

order.  These are our principles and objectives.  No

force of whatever kind can shake or deviate us  from

our belief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Prime

Minister's motion.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Bukit Merah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to support the motion before the  House.  I

just want to deal with certain matters raised by the

Member  for Hong Lim. The Member for Hong Lim during

his   speech   told  the  House  that  the   present

Government  did  not malayanise but  was  doing  the

reverse  thing. What did he mean by  that?  Does  he

want to malayanise the Government departments as  he

did during his regime in the City Council, and while

he was in control of the departments of the Ministry

of  National Development? If we were to  follow  his

advice,  we  would have been left with no architects

and  no engineers to build houses and carry out  our

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret that he planted his friends who

studied with him in Australia and friends from  Batu

Pahat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



in  key posts. A salesman who had no qualifications

or   experience  was  appointed  as   Deputy   Chief

Administrative Officer in the City Council.  Another

of his men was appointed to look after the health of

one and a half million people. This gentleman closed

the  incinerator which caused rubbish to pile up and

flies to breed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment on houses was raised without

considering  the  after effects. 400  S.I.T. houses

were put up for sale without consultation or without

the  approval  of  the Cabinet.  Had  there  been  a

qualified and efficient civil servant who  knew  his

duties,  he would have advised the Member  for  Hong

Lim  against  such  moves.  Is  this  the  kind   of

Malayanisation the Member wants us to put through?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim spoke about Mr Thomson. He

alleged    that   Mr   Thomson   brainwashed    the

Assemblymen.  It is true that Mr Thomson  gave  the

Assemblymen   two   lectures   on   the    Singapore

Constitution,  but he never gave us any  lecture  on

socialism, as alleged by the Member for Aljunied  in

his  speech  at  the Badminton Hall The  Member  for

Mountbatten also attended these lectures.  She  will

testify whether Mr Thomson ever gave us any lecture

on  socialism. Then it was alleged in this  Assembly

by  the  Member for Hong Lim that Mr Thomson  wrote

speeches  for  Assemblymen. From  the  speech  I  am

making,  all  of  us  here can  see  for  themselves

whether this speech is written by a lecturer of  the

calibre of Mr Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the allegation by the Member for

Mountbatten that she was not invited to  the  visits

by Assemblymen to the various police stations, all I

can  say  is  that it is not true.  I  received  the

circular  in  which  I saw the names  of  Opposition

Members.  Of  course, the Opposition  Members  would

have  received these circulars but they  might  have

decided not to attend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, propaganda was made by the Member for

Hong Lim yesterday and the day before yesterday that

the Organising Secretary of the Tanjong Pagar Branch

was  shouting "Merdeka" outside the City Hall  steps

when  we, the P.A.P. Assemblymen, marched towards

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



Assembly  House  two weeks ago  when  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara opened this Session. The records  of

this  House will show, and also many members of  the

public  who  sat  on  the public  gallery  also  can

testify,   that   this  gentleman,  the   Organising

Secretary  of the Tanjong Pagar Branch, was  sitting

in the public gallery of this House on that day and

not  outside  this House or outside  the  City  Hall

steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I have said, I think there is no need for

me  to tell this House that the Member for Hong  Lim

is trying to out-do Herr Goebbels.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  no  one can doubt  that  the  policy

speech delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is  a

historical   document.  It  is  a  detailed   policy

directed  towards the urgent needs of the people  of

Singapore  at  the  present  stage.  It  meets  the

interests  of  the masses. This policy  speech  very

eloquently  shows  the  realistic  attitude  of  the

Government - standing on firm ground - in  the  tackling

of  major  national problems. Past  Governments  had

never  been  able to produce such a far-sighted  and

optimistic   plan  for  work.  The  Lim   Yew   Hock

Government   was   only  a  transitional   caretaker

Government which lived out its time, like  the  monk

who peels his daily round of bells for so long as he

is  a monk. Its policy was just a patched assortment

of  a  few plans. How could it be compared with that

of  the P.A.P. Government, which has been worked out

after careful consideration? The Member for Hong Lim

has  said that our policy is the same as that of the

Lim  Yew Hock Government. This obviously shows  that

he  is  pointing at a deer and saying that it  is  a

horse, and confusing the distinction between what is

black  and what is white. He is trying to sell  some

cheap propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristic feature of our policy statement

is  that  we  shall  lay on the small  island  of

Singapore a foundation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



for  the initial stage of industrialisation. We  all

know   that   the  one-million-over  population   of

Singapore  eagerly  hope to  live  in  peaceful  and

secure  surroundings. People want the Government  to

solve for them the problem of unemployment, to find

for them homes in which they can live, and to create

more  places in schools for their children to study.

A  Government  which can satisfy these  three  basic

needs  is a successful Government. What must  we  do

before  we can achieve these aims? According to  our

understanding,  only  by  maintaining  the  entrepot

status  of Singapore and free enterprise on the  one

hand,  and  accelerating  industrialisation  on  the

other  can we hope to solve the problems confronting

us.  This  concept does not come about  only  today.

This is also not my personal idea. This concept  was

stated  earlier  in  the  P.A.P.'s  Five-Year   Plan

election    outlines,   and   was   enthusiastically

supported  by  the  people.  Therefore,   the   most

outstanding  question  in our policy  speech  debate

today is how to solve the problems of our daily life

through  industrialisation, thus changing  Singapore

into a secure, peaceful and prosperous society. This

has  always been our declared policy which  has  not

increased  or decreased a bit. That we have  changed

our  policy and not kept our promises could only  be

uttered by lunatics and maniacs. Of course, we  hope

that  such a man will go to the Woodbridge Hospital.

The  factual  problems of livelihood are complicated

and  require us to work hard to solve them. How  can

the  solution be based only by shouting one  or  two

anti-colonial  slogans? Maybe there are  people  who

fancy  this. Then, they must be revolutionaries  who

are floating in the air.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr  DEPUTY  SPEAKER (Mr G.  Kandasamy)  in  the  Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has said that there are

many pro-colonial inclinations in our policy speech.

But  where are the proofs? He cannot bring  out  any

proof. In the past two days, he could not read out a

single so-called pro-colonial part. Such doings can

only  reflect the attitude of the Member  for  Hong

Lim towards others, creating rumours



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



and  smearing,  giving out cheap propaganda  without

substantiating it. But let me tell you,  the  P.A.P.

is  a  Party which has grown in its struggle against

colonialism.  No  one can change its  character.  No

matter  how  the  Member for Hong Lim  and  his  two

followers smear, there are still stout anti-colonial

fighters in our rank and file.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the statement commemorating the 4th anniversary

of  our  Party,  we have said that there  should  be

flexibility  in  the  struggle against  colonialism.

There  are  many  bends  in the  way.  To  be  anti-colonialist is not so simple as the Member for  Hong

Lim thinks, like pushing the white men into the sea.

The  real  task is to restore the sense of  personal

pride  in  the people and to heal the sores  in  our

economy  which  had been exploited  by  colonialism.

Does the Member for Hong Lim think deeply about this

problem?  Does  our  rigorous educational  work  not

prove that we have begun destroying the foolish  and

ignorant  situation left over by the colonial  rule?

Is  this  not  a  positive  expression?  We  suggest

building an industrialised city. Does this not  mean

we  have begun to eliminate poverty and unemployment

left over by the colonial rule? Is this not positive

action?  What  do the Member for Hong  Lim  and  his

followers know about anti-colonialism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, only frustrated politicians and hooligans

still  take  anti-colonial slogans  as  their  life-saving  panacea. Any Ah Mau, Ah Kou [Tom,  Dick  and

Harry]  will shout anti-colonial slogans.  Even  the

president  of  the  canine-feline  society  recently

called  a meeting to discuss this problem.  What  is

the  difference between the ballyhoo by  the  Member

for  Hong  Lim  and  that by his  good  friend,  the

president of the canine-feline society?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all thought that the Member for Hong Lim would,

after six weeks of shouting at his Press conference,

have some grand ideas concerning anti-colonialism to

be  expounded in this House. We were all  ready  for

the  attack. We all wished we could kill a tiger  as

Wu Sung did. But we were terribly disappointed. What

we saw was only a pale, sick little cat. What we saw

was  only the bitterness and dissatisfaction of  one

who,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



after abusing his authority, had it stripped off. It

is  only natural that he would express his anger and

dissatisfaction,  just  like  the  howling   of   an

Alsatian dog after the extraction of its teeth.





<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Deputy  Speaker</b>: Order. I do not think  it  is

proper  for an hon. Member to accuse another  Member

that should be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the Chinese

language  we  say  "cat and dog".  That  is  Chinese

usage. It is nothing serious. "Ah Mau, Ah Kou"  [cat

and  dog] may be said to be equivalent to "Tom, Dick

and Harry" in English.



<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Deputy  Speaker</b>: Order.  I  do  not  know  the

that  the  so-called expression  "cat  and  dog"  in

Chinese  phraseology means "Tom, Dick and Harry"  in

English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker</b>: I have given a ruling, and I

shall insist upon a withdrawal.

Chinese  and  English languages,  I  am  obliged  to

withdraw  this phrase. But I have to make  it  clear

that I do not mean that he is a dog or a cat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the Member for Hong Lim speak for two

days. What did we get? From where did he derive  his

inspiration of the anti-colonialistic concept? It is

from  what the previous Member for Changi,  Mr  Lim

Cher  Kheng,  had  spoken! He  quoted  some  phrases

without  regard  to the context of the  past  policy

statement of the P.A.P. to stuff his empty  speech..

His  two-day  speech  only proves  to  us  that  his

thinking is childish and empty. Therefore,  what  we

heard   were   smears   and  unfounded   and   blind

accusations. He said the Government had sent Special

Branch agents to intimidate his followers. But  when

the Minister for Home Affairs yesterday asked him to

substantiate his accusation with concrete  evidence,

he could not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have no intention to

change  this House into a scolding party. I  do  not

mean  to further strike a fallen dog. As the  Member

for Hong Lim says -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker</b>: Again reference has been made

to  an animal. I wish to make it clear to the Member

that  he  must not make any more references of  that

nature,  and  I want the reference  made  just  now

withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker</b>: If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask

the  Member  for Havelock when he says  "Ta  lo  sui

kou",  he  is  using the Chinese idiom and  not  the

literal expression of meaning to hit down a  dog?  I

would  appeal to the interpreters to be more careful

in their interpretation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask whether

the  Deputy Speaker wants me to withdraw this  term?

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, the Member for Hong  Lim  said

that  we  do  not  have thorough  anti-colonial  and

Malayanisation  policies. What he  pointed  out  was

that Thomson, Meadows and Blades are not yet sacked.

According to his logic, the most ideal anti-colonial

work  is  to  sack Thomson, Meadows and  Blades  and

employ people like Owen, Lui Boon Poh, Lui Boon Phor

and  Low  Chye  Chuan. These people are  either  his

fellow  students in Australia or his  neighbours  in

Batu Pahat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is anti-colonialism

really as simple as that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



Will  there really be universal peace by the sacking

of  Thomson,  etc.? At his so-called Press  meetings

and  the mass meeting and in this House, the  Member

for Hong Lim brought up this Mr Owen. When he was a

Minister,  the Member for Hong Lim called Owen  back

from  Australia to become the Treasurer of the  City

Council. What great abilities Owen really has, we do

not  know. But we know one simple fact. Owen was the

Member  for  Hong  Lim's classmate when  he  studied

accountancy in Australia. From this, we can see that

the  thinking  of the Member for Hong  Lim  is  very

simple.  According  to  his understanding,  the  so-called Malayanisation means not the substitution  of

capable   local   people  in  place  of   expatriate

officers,  but  the substitution of Ong  Eng  Guan's

people for expatriate officers. According to his way

of  thinking, the so-called Malayanisation  is  only

"Ong  Eng  Guanisation". The technical personnel  he

employed came from Australia, because the Member for

Hong   Lim   was   a   student  in  Australia.   The

administrative personnel he employed came from  Batu

Pahat,  because  that was his home  town.  While  he

headed the Ministry of National Development, because

of his vigorous "Ong Eng Guanisation" -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> On a point of order,

Mr   Deputy  Speaker.  Mr  Owen  is  a  qualified

Bachelor of Economics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker</b>: It is not a point of order but

a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, just now I was saying that  when  the

Member  for Hong Lim headed the Ministry of National

Development,  because  of  his  vigorous  "Ong   Eng

Guanisation"   plan,   there   remained   only   two

Australian-trained architects in his  Ministry.  All

the other British-trained technical personnel had to

find other jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us speak frankly and

to the point. Did we lead the people in the struggle

against  colonialism just to enable every member  of

our  families to become a high state official (kuan)

in order to make more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



money?   Did  the  people  elect  us  to  form   the

Government  just  to  see that our  families  become

prosperous? Yet this is what the Member for Hong Lim

believes  in.  In his childish way of thinking,  the

anti-colonialist movement is only led  by  him.  The

other  people,  though once his  comrades,  are  but

puppets  of  colonialism. Therefore, in  this  anti-colonialist  struggle, he should have the  right  to

install  his  relatives, friends and  classmates  in

different  posts. What have we really  done  in  the

past to make him so very angry? We only stopped  him

from   abusing  his  power  to  build  up  his   own

authority.  We only stopped him from using  his  own

classmates  and  friends to  control  the  different

government departments. Because of this, he believes

that we are pro-colonialists! In his own eyes, there

are no people more capable and less corrupt than his

friends  and  relatives. The story of the  big  four

families spread far and wide during the Chiang  Kai-shek  era  of China to the effect that the posts  in

the  Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs  were

held by members of the same family. Maybe the Member

for  Hong Lim greatly envies such a one-family rule.

Therefore, we can see why he calls the Minister  for

Finance, who is not his relative, a running dog  for

the   colonialists.   The   other   Ministers   and

Assemblymen are also not his relatives or  his  die-hard followers. Therefore, they are called weak  and

incapable people. What is anti-colonialism? If anti-colonialism means the chasing away of white men from

their  jobs  and  replacing  them  with  one's   own

relatives and friends, then I will be the first  one

to oppose this kind of anti-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his so-called mass meeting at the Badminton

Hall,  I  would like to refer to page 2 of the  54th

issue  of  Petir dated 23rd July, 1960,  criticising

the  whole  affair.  The  title  is  "How  to  fight

colonialism". I now quote the article:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ong Eng Guan gave a lecture last week. There was a

big  question  mark  at the end  of  his  talk.  The

audience  who  attended the lecture were  under  the

impression  that  they would be able  to  hear  some

interesting  things  on anti-colonialism,  but  they

were  greatly  disappointed because a  big  question

mark still remained in their minds. This was because

Ong Eng Guan and his few followers had no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



views to offer on how to fight colonialism except to

attack viciously and to distort the personal conduct

and private lives of some Party members. Did Ong Eng

Guan  believe that the struggle against  colonialism

would be successful only if the "ruling clique" were

eliminated?  Did he suggest that if the  Party  were

led by him the problem of fighting colonialism would

cease  to  exist? Was the so-called "Save the  party

and   save  the  country"  panacea  so  simple   and

efficacious? If he believed in that, then  he  would

be  under  estimating the forces of colonialism.  He

would  be  underestimating the significance  of  the

hard  struggle waged by the people of Singapore over

a long period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another question the answer to which the

audience anxiously waited to hear: When did Ong  Eng

Guan  and his followers suddenly become the fighters

against  colonialism? Surely it was not before  June

1957  because he was then branded a reactionary  and

certain  people wanted to evict him from the  Party,

It  was  the  central leadership which came  to  his

rescue  to  help him to retain his position  in  the

Party.  Neither  did  he become  a  fighter  against

colonialism  after the Party's victory in  the  City

Council  election  in  December  1957.  The  Party's

achievements in the City Council for the  period  of

15  months were a result of the people's support for

the  Party,  the hard work and planning  of  the  13

P.A.P.  City Councillors, and their strict adherence

to  the Party's policies and discipline. Had it  not

been   for  the  fact  that  all  the  P.A.P.   City

Councillors strictly adhered to the Party's policies

and  discipline, Ong Eng Guan would  have  lost  his

mayoralty long ago, not to speak of his achievements

in the City Council. Those people who served as City

Councillors are now all in the Party. In one  voice,

they  denounce  Ong  Eng Guan's anti-party  conduct.

What  has  he  to  say to this?  It  was  absolutely

impossible  for  him to turn into a fighter  against

colonialism after the May 1959 general elections, as

every  one  knew that what Ong Eng Guan did  in  the

past  year as Minister for National Development  was

to establish his small kingdom -'.

Speaker, Sir, I have no right to argue with you, but

in  order to clarify this issue and at the same time

comment  on  "a  dog  which  has  fallen  into   the

water" - his  behaviour and his work during  the  year

when  he  was  a  Minister - well,  I  have  to  speak

briefly. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But, what is the struggle against colonialism? Is

it  to instigate A to start a smear campaign against

B and to incite C to launch an attack against D, and

then to scheme in order to get some people to become

his  faithful  followers?  Does  this  amount  to  a

struggle  against colonialism? A great revolutionary

does  not waste his talents and energy on this  sort

of  trifling,  meaningless and  shameless  intrigue.

Perhaps  Ong  Eng  Guan posed as  the  only  fighter

against colonialism in the Party, but if what he has

been  doing  under  cover  of  anti-colonialism   is

exposed, it will only reveal his baseness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pretext of eliminating corruption and

bribery  and  reorganising the Singapore Improvement

Trust,  he sacked a great number of S.I.T. employees

without  any  discrimination.  He  then  filled  the

vacant posts with his faithful followers. Now,  does

this constitute the task of fighting colonialism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to consolidate his small kingdom and to

have  more  direct  control  of  his  employees,  he

evicted  hundreds  of S.I.T. tenants  from  a  nine-storey  building. Is this also one of the  tasks  of

fighting colonialism?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help his relatives and faithful followers, he

asked  his  schoolmates,  their  friends  and  their

brothers  to  take  over  the  high  posts  in   his

Ministry,  but  they were not competent  enough.  Is

this also one of the aspects of the anti-colonialism

struggle?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these and other facts have shown that Ong Eng

Guan's  so-called anti-colonialism struggle  was  no

more  than  his  personal struggle to establish  his

fame and his own position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle against colonialism is a protracted

movement by the masses. The advance does not  follow

a  straight  course. There are two  aspects  to  the

movement: its revolutionary phase and its  phase  of

construction.  It  is a cause  which  needs  a  long

period of time to accomplish -'.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  when the Member for Hong  Lim  spoke

yesterday,  other  Opposition Members  were  smiling

very  happily. They laughed. They thought  they  had

caught  P.A.P.'s "ailing leg" and could hit it  back

as  much as they wished. Not only the S.P.A.,  which

is  the  greatest enemy of the people of  Singapore,

had  this  idea. Even those minor political  parties

like the Workers' Party, Party Ra'ayat, outside this

House had the same intention. They wanted to fish in

troubled  waters  and to loot during  a  fire.  They

thought this is an opportunity which occurs once  in

a  thousand  years. They thought  they  could  unite

together  to attack the P.A.P. and put it to  death.

But how childish and foolish such a thought is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, we have committed errors. We allowed the

Member for Hong Lim to abuse his powers to build his

own little kingdom. But we have the courage to admit

publicly the error and publicly to rectify it. We do

not avoid a political storm. We have the courage  to

let  our defects be made known to the people. We  do

not  try  to  hide our small defects. We  discovered

there  was  a  tumour in our body, and  we  had  the

courage to have it operated on and removed. What is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



more  honest  or  straightforward  than  this?   The

expulsion  of  the  Treasurer  of  the  Party  is  a

temporary  setback. But this incident clearly  shows

that  among  so  many political  parties,  only  the

P.A.P. is  honest,  clean  and  incorruptible,   a

straightforward  Party  which  could   rectify   its

mistakes whenever they occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the choice confronting us

today  is whether to improve the livelihood  of  the

people  through industrialisation or, as the  Member

for Hong Lim would do, to follow unprincipled slogan-shouting  politicians who do nothing but  cause  the

collapse of the nation's economy. Today, the  people

are  in deep waters and in "hot fire". They are  all

awaiting  the  execution of our  effective  economic

measures to solve the livelihood problems.  But  the

Member  for Hong Lim and those Left-wing adventurers

who  are  using  him just shout empty  anti-colonial

slogans to confuse the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our State is facing a greater problem. What does an

insignificant Ong Eng Guan matter? We must  not  let

this  incident make us lose our heads. We must stand

on  solid ground and use realistic measures to  deal

with our pressing problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to quote from

today's  Sin Chew fit Poh about what the Member  for

Hong Lim said yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Yesterday, the Member for Hong Lim said that

although  six  months  of  this  year  have  already

passed, the Government has not carried out any  work

regarding the 1960 economic development scheme.'



<br><br>Such  a  man who talks easily to deceive the  people

cannot  endure long. Yesterday I did  not  have  the

necessary  material in hand and therefore could  not

clarify   the   issue.  In  the   1960   Development

Estimates,  we  have  provided $39,900,000.  In  the

first  half  of  the  year, work  that  was  already

completed  amounts  to  $3,440,000.  Work  that   is

expected to finish this year amounts to $26,600,000.

From these figures, we know that they amount to over

half   the   total  amount  provided  for   in   the

Development  Estimates.  From  this  we   dan   also

disclose the person that deceives the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Hong Lim also spoke on the

housing  problem - that  he could  only  build  a  few

houses  last year, because the Minister for  Finance

refused  to give him funds for the purpose.  At  the

same  time, he said he had correspondence  to  prove

it.  But today, I have the opportunity to "beat  the

dog that has fallen into the water."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year at the Cabinet Estimates

Committee, documents relating to S.I.T. funds showed

that  the  Minister for Finance made a provision  in

the   1959  S.I.T.  Estimates  of  $7  million.  The

remaining  money  was allowed to be  used,  for  the

Minister  for Finance had marked the word "allowed".

The  Minister for Finance had shown in the Estimates

that  $1  million could be used for land and general

development, $2,500,000 for resettlement, which  sum

the   Minister  for  Finance  had  marked  "Release"

meaning  he (the Member for Hong Lim) could use  the

funds. $519,000 for development of Kampong Koo Chye.

which  was also marked "Release". As to the  Kampong

Tiong  Bahru development scheme, because our  former

Minister for National Development had many fantasies

and  many plans and changes, therefore, although the

monies were available, the plans were unable  to  be

implemented.  There is another  good  proof  of  his

deceit,  In the Straits Times of 13th October,  last

year,  on page 2 - I think I will now speak in English

so that it can be clearly understood (in English):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ong gets $17 million to begin his big plan... Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan  said  that today  the  Minister  for

Finance,  Dr  Goh  Keng Swee,  had  agreed  to  the

defreezing  of $17 million. He added, "Work  on  the

building   of  houses  according  to  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust plan will start early  next  year.

Plans  for the construction of houses with  the  $17

million grant are in full swing."'



<br><br>(In Mandarin): From this we can see what he is like.

Moreover, yesterday he said he had correspondence to

prove that the Minister for Finance refused him  the

funds.  I will give another proof; this is a  letter

dated  9th November, 1959. This letter was from  the

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



for National Development to the Minister for Finance

and  was signed. In the first paragraph, it says (In

English):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Please refer to your letter of 17th October, 1959,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Funds for Housing.

for S.I.T. housing for this year and the next.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clearly discloses the falseness of the charges

which  the  former Minister for National Development

made against the Minister f or Finance in regard  to

the funds allotted to him. Another proof can be seen

in  the letter dated 17th October, 1959, written  by

the   Minister  for  Finance  to  the  Minister  for

National  Development. Let us see what the  Minister

for Finance says here (In English):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We will commence the building programme as early

as  possible. I am in sympathy with your proposal to

get on with the job.'

Yesterday  I did not see the Member for  Hong  Lim's

true or not, and so I could not clarify. But today I

have  the  material and so I can clarify  the  whole

thing. But unfortunately, the Member for Hong Lim is

not  here. However, his followers can convey to  him

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  the  Member for Hong Lim  said  that  the

reason why there were very few S.I.T. buildings  was

that  the  Minister for Finance  did  not  give  him

adequate  funds. I have proved several  points  just

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to mention a few more points regarding

the building of houses at Kampong Koo Chye after the

big fire. I have a document here which clearly shows

why  up  till now Kampong Koo Chye has not  had  its

buildings  completed.  It  is  because  the   former

Minister for National Development was indecisive  in

this  work so that tenders for the building of these

houses  could  not be carried out. The closing  date

for  this  particular tender was the  30th  October,

1959,  in  the afternoon at 2 o'clock. This  clearly

shows  that  the failure to build houses at  Kampong

Koo Chye is not because the Minister for Finance did

not give the necessary funds, but because the former

Minister for National Development did not carry  out

his  duties properly. One day he had one  plan,  and

another day, he had another plan; so that in the end

the  houses  meant to be built at Kampong  Koo  Chye

could  not be started. Unfortunately the Member  for

Hong Lim is not present here today. Otherwise, I can

very  clearly show him this document here  to  prove

whether the Minister for Finance refused to give him

the  necessary money or whether he did not build the

houses in time.

persons concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the speeches made in

this  Assembly, it is essential for  me  to  explain

first  to  the  Member  for  Mountbatten,  who   has

attacked  the  Government,  particularly  on   those

matters  appertaining to the Minister  for  National

Development. According to her, dwelling-houses built

in  1959 totalled 821 units only. She is alleged  to

have  said that this demonstrated a failure  on  the

part of the Government, which previously crowed. But

at the moment the crowing of the cock could be heard

only in the morning. I would like to clarify to  the

Member  for Mountbatten, Mr Speaker, that the  cock

does not force the hen to lay eggs until the time is

ripe,  or  the hen which lays one egg per day  could

not be forced to lay two eggs per day, or to operate

on  the  hen  with the object of getting more  eggs.

This would be a failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is aware that the

housing problem is a major problem, because  of  the

increased  population and because of  the  increased

birth  rate  which, according to  our  estimate,  is

60,000 per year. Then school-leavers from the middle

schools,   after  getting  jobs  and  then   getting

married, will need houses. The problem which we  are

facing  is housing; the problem which is facing  the

Minister   for   Labour  and  Law  is   to   provide

employment; and the problem facing the Minister  for

Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



is to provide proper education. To satisfy the needs

of  the people, we are compelled to provide at least

14,000  houses each year for the next ten years.  We

already  know, since the S.I.T. started its  housing

campaign  12  years ago, that they had built  46,918

houses only. This means 3,900 houses per year on the

average.  It should be remembered that my Government

received  a mandate from the people during mid-1959.

We  were  therefore obliged to carry on the misdeeds

which   were  bequeathed  to  us  by  the   previous

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the 820 units mentioned by the Member

for Mountbatten, this figure represents houses built

between June 1959 and 31st January, 1960, under  the

charge   of   the  former  Minister   for   National

Development.  However,  the  Government   is   fully

conscious  of its obligations to the people,  and  a

Housing Board was established in February 1960  this

year.  A  feature which was carried out  intensively

was to review the housing problem in Singapore as  a

whole.   The   Board   has   decided,   within   its

limitations,  to  try to build houses  to  meet  the

needs  of  the  people. During the next Government's

five-year  period,  the  Board  will  provide  about

52,842  houses, costing about $230 million.  In  the

five-year programme, these low-cost houses  will  be

constructed in areas such as Queenstown,  MacPherson

Road,  Kampong  Tiong  Bahru,  Alexandra  Road,  St.

Michael's Road, Kallang, Toa Payoh and also  in  the

rural  areas. In this year 1960, it has been planned

by  the  Board, apart from carrying on with the  old

work,  that  it  will construct about 9,000  houses,

costing  $38 million. Now, 4,700 houses are  in  the

course  of  construction, and the remainder  of  the

tenders will be out soon. It is expected that in the

year  1960, 1,800 houses will be completed,  and  in

the  year  1961,  a  total  of  approximately  7,000

houses. This is a well thought out plan, and not  an

illusion; or, as the saying goes, "If the cock  does

not  crow,  there will be no daylight." This  is  in

accordance  with the plan drawn up  by  the  Housing

Development Board, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is a pity that the Member for Kampong Kembangan is not in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



this  Chamber,  so  he  has  not  the  pleasure   of

listening to my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Member for Kampong Kembangan

started  off by saying that in the Prime  Minister's

speech,  it  was  mentioned  that  there  were  more

dangerous elements than communalistic elements.  Mr

Speaker, we admit that these two elements are indeed

dangerous.   Communalism  could  be   exploited   by

opportunistic  leaders to inflame communal  feelings

between the races. This could again be exploited  by

a  third party to stir up inter-racial conflict. So,

Mr  Speaker,  whether  they are  contained  in  the

speech  made by the Prime Minister or in the remarks

by  the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan,  both  these

elements are considered dangerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Kampong Kembangan asked the

Prime  Minister to declare his Party stand.  If  our

Party,  he says, is openly anti-Communist, then  he,

on  behalf  of the organisation he represents,  will

give  it a 100 per cent support. And this, he  says,

will  bring  about closer realisation  of  a  merger

between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.  Mr

Speaker,  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan  is  not

following  closely  the  political  developments  in

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. He  is  also

ignorant  of the political stand taken by the  Party

that is in power today. Before the elections, we had

clearly   defined  that  we  are  a   non-Communist,

socialist  and democratic party. This  is  positive,

Mr  Speaker,  because if we are  a  party  of  non-Communists,  it  does  not mean  that  we  are  pro-Communists.  We  are  aware  that  if  we  are  pro-Communists,  it means that the M.C.P. will  ride  on

our  backs. This was clearly enunciated by my  Party

before we went to the electorate. And if -

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It seems that I am following the footsteps of the Member for Kampong

Kembangan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we take the stand of being anti- Communist, it automatically means that we will be in

the  Western  bloc  which has established  an  anti-Communist bloc. If we are non-Communists, this means

that our stand is firm and one which is fitting  and

appropriate to the situation obtaining in Singapore.

This non-Communist stand taken by the P.A.P. is also

similar  to  that  taken  by  many  other  socialist

countries.  This  should be a grim reminder  to  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan, so that we will not be

ridden  on  by any group whatsoever. It  is  not  an

assurance  that  if  the P.A.P. is  genuinely  anti-Communist,   then   his  Party   will   support   it

wholeheartedly  and that will bring about  a  merger

with  the Federation of Malaya. We have clearly said

that   the  Malays  in  the  Federation  are   still

apprehensive   about  the  Chinese   population   in

Singapore.  If  81  per cent of  the  population  in

Singapore  comprised Malays, then I think  we  would

have  declared our independence on 31st August last.

But   unfortunately,  the  population  of  Singapore

comprises   more   than  80  per  cent   non-Malays.

According to our political analysis it is clear that

we  are  making an all-out effort so that the  whole

population of Singapore - Indians, Chinese, Malays and

others - will   show   their  undivided   loyalty   to

Singapore   and   demonstrate  to   the   Federation

Government that we love Singapore as our motherland.

This is the thing that we have been fighting for not

only  by the People's Action Party, but also by  all

the  people throughout Singapore. What amuses me  is

the  statement  that if the Prime  Minister  of  the

present P.A.P. Government states clearly that we are

anti-Communist, then it is hoped that the Government

of  the Federation of Malaya will confer on him  the

title "Tun", like the one that has been conferred on

the last Chief Minister of Singapore. P.A.P. members

do  not aspire to these titles. We are fighting  for

the  benefit  of the masses, and we  do  not  expect

praises in return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when I see the Member for Kampong Kembangan open the Malay annals, it reminds me of my

school days, when I learnt about Sang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



Nila   Utama  who  landed  on  the  fore-shores   of

Singapore.  Mr  Speaker, there is  no  one  on  the

Government side who will deny historical facts.  The

reality that we are facing now is the most important

thing  that  we  should bear in mind.  We  not  only

acknowledge the enunciation in the Preamble  to  the

Constitution  that  the Malays  are  the  indigenous

people  of Singapore, but we have clearly stated  in

our election manifesto that the P.A.P., if in power,

will   fully  discharge  its  obligations  and   the

enunciations in the Constitution. There is  no  need

for  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan to awaken  us

any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the threat that if any Party changes the

Constitution  of Singapore "without consulting  us",

then there will be trouble. The hon. Member went  on

to say that he would then retire from this Chamber.,

There  is  no mention of this in the speech  by  the

Prime Minister, nor is it contained in the speech of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Is it just an exhibition

to  show that "I am really the warrior of my  native

land"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Kampong Kembangan

then asked for clarification. He is reported to have

said that in my Party there are Communists, Leftists

and Rightists. Then he asked the Prime Minister, who

is  the  Secretary-General  of  my  Party,  to  give

details as to the number of Communists in my  Party.

Mr  Speaker, members in my Party fight for  a  non-Communist  and socialist Malaya. Just because  there

are  a  few incidents in my Party, it does not  mean

that  there  are  Communists in my Party.  For  that

reason,  I  say  frankly that we  allow  opportunist

members to shout at the top of their voice and  say,

"I,  alone,  am  a revolutionary and a progressive".

We, in the Party, are non-Communists, socialists and

democratic.  We  are  a Party  based  on  collective

leadership with collective responsibility.  We  sink

or swim together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in addition, the Member for Kampong Kembangan pleaded for the special rights of the

Malays   so   that  they  can  be  safeguarded   and

protected.  We will say frankly that the  Government

is fully conscious of this fact. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



that  reason, the special rights of the  Malays  are

contained in the Party Manifesto. There is  no  need

for the Member for Kampong Kembangan to keep harping

on this point, because every member of the Party, be

he a Malay, Indian or Chinese, is at all times aware

of  his  obligations to the Malays. For that reason,

the  Government  has given free education  to  Malay

pupils  from primary school up to university  level.

Mr  Speaker,  there is an old Malay proverb  which

says that the hand which is asking for something  is

held low and the hand which is giving it is held up.

There  is  no  need for me to go begging.  But,  Mr

Speaker, what should be noted is whether we  want  a

communal organisation or whether we want to mobilise

the  Malay  population into changing  their  way  of

thinking and going in for further studies.  This  is

most  vital  because, although the  Government  will

provide   for  these  facilities,  if   the   Malays

themselves do not change their way of thinking, then

there is no force on earth that can change the  fate

of this particular race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a follower of Islam, and in the Koran it is

stated that God will not change the fate of a nation

if  that  nation  does not wish to bring  about  the

change  itself. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  urge

all  the Malays in Singapore to avail themselves  of

this  opportunity offered by the Government, as  the

results  of  the  1959 Senior Cambridge  Examination

showed  that only one Malay girl obtained  Grade  I.

This is my appeal to all political organisations  to

encourage the Malays to change their way of thinking

to suit the changing times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough just to organise a body, hold

meetings,  pass resolutions, make protestations  and

demands,  and so on. It is most important to  exhort

the  people to change their outlook and way of life.

President  Soekarno said that a thousand souls  will

not change the fate of a nation if they are childish

in  their  outlook, lit is most important  that  all

political parties should strive to change the  Malay

way of thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Kampong Kembangan

asked the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



Minister  about  the  cordial  relationship  between

Singapore  and Indonesia, and whether the  visit  to

Indonesia  by  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for National Development was really for the

purpose  of  raising  the  educational  standard  in

Singapore  or  was  it  just a  pleasure  trip.  The

cordial relationship between Singapore and Indonesia

exists  not  because of the efforts  of  Yaacob  bin

Mohamed.  It exists because Singapore and  Indonesia

are  conscious  of  the need for  further  cementing

their   relationship,  whether  in  the   field   of

education  or other fields. For instance, since  the

P.A.P. came  into  power, a cultural  mission  from

Indonesia  gave an exhibition of Indonesian  culture

to  the  people  of  Singapore.  An  interchange  of

cultures   between  Singapore  and   Indonesia   can

contribute  towards  a better understanding  between

them.  There is, a Malay saying that if you  do  not

see  a thing, you will never learn to love it. After

we saw the exhibition of Indonesian culture with our

own  eyes,  a  mission headed by the Prime  Minister

left for Indonesia. It resulted in the issuance of a

joint  statement  signed by the  Prime  Minister  of

Singapore  and  the Indonesian Prime  Minister,  Dr

Djuanda, on the close relationship between  the  two

countries.  In  addition, many educationalists  from

Indonesia  paid a visit to Singapore.  We  have  Pa'

Kasur with his famous angklung. All this is good  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the time Sir Stamford

Raffles  set  foot in Singapore up till  now,  there

have  been no Malay middle schools. We do  not  deny

that the standard of education in Singapore is high,

but it is not so with Malay education. Even when the

coalition  Government (at first it  was  called  the

Labour  Front-U.M.N.O., but later  on  there  was  a

change  to  S.P.A.-U.M.N.O.) was  in  power,  not  a

single  Malay  middle  school was  established.  The

P.A.P. does  not wish to hoodwink  the  masses.  It

realises  that  as  Malay is  `to  be  the  national

language,  Malay schools should be established.  For

the  purpose  of ascertaining whether  the  national

language (Malay) or Indonesian language



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



should be used in Government departments or  in

schools  from the lowest to the highest  University

level,  I was sent to Indonesia under the auspices

of  the  Education Committee, and not in my capacity

as   a  Parliamentary  Secretary,  to  see  how  the

Indonesian  language  could  be  used  from  primary

school  to University level. A memorandum containing

the  recommendations has already been submitted  to

the Minister concerned. My trip to Indonesia was not

for  the  purpose of seeking pleasure.  Perhaps  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan feels that his  former

colleagues went, abroad to enjoy themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most amusing, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

the Member for Kampong Kembangan has said that, as a

result of an interview with the former Minister  for

National Development, some drains were repaired  and

the  burial  ground at Teyban was fenced.  He  also.

said  that  he  was  disappointed with  the  present

Minister for National Development for not  paying

any  heed  to  his  constituents.  This  is  amusing

indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, because the care of drains

is  not  the  problem of the Minister  for  National

Development.  It is the problem of the Minister  for

Health.  It is most improper to call for the  police

when  a  man  breaks  his leg, or  to  send  for  an

ambulance when a man commits a theft. As a Member of

this  Assembly,  the  Member for  Kampong  Kembangan

should  know  where to address his  complaints.  The

care  of  drains is a matter concerning the Ministry

of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the burial ground at Teyban, if

you  will permit me, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would  like

to present the facts. This subject was brought up by

the  Singapore  Malay  Settlement  Union.  When  the

P.A.P. took office, I was attached to the Ministry

of  National Development and was appointed  Chairman

of  the Singapore Malay Settlement Union. I received

a  letter  asking the Ministry to fence  the  burial

ground  because of the stray cattle and because  the

roads  inside were used by vehicles. In the  company

of the Chairman of the Rural Board and the Secretary

of  the  Singapore Malay Settlement Union, I visited

the site. Work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



was   started  on  29th  September,  1959.  On  17th

November,  the  leader  of  U.M.N.O. in  the  Malay

Settlement called on me and I explained to him  that

our Ministry was prepared to fence the burial ground

at  Teyban.  Mr Speaker, Sir, one day later,  there

was  a  news  item  in  the Utusan  Melayu  of  18th

November  stating that the U.M.N.O. Malay Settlement

Branch   appealed  to  the  Minister  for   National

Development to fence the burial ground as  a  result

of a recent meeting held. Mr Speaker, Sir, this was

very  strange indeed. A few days later, Inche  Osman

Ghani,  as Secretary of the Malay Settlement, issued

a  Press  statement  which appeared  in  the  Berita

Harlan dated 20th November, 1959. It stated that the

resolution  of  U.M.N.O. had been  conveyed  to  the

former  Minister for National Development, and  that

the  work  of fencing the burial ground to keep  out

stray cattle would be undertaken by the Ministry  of

National  Development. He added that his office  had

received  a  recent petition from  U.M.N.O.  Kampong

Melayu on this subject. But he pointed out that work

had,   in  point  of  fact,  been  planned  by   the

authorities  concerned three  months  prior  to  the

receipt of the resolution. The facts should  not  be

misrepresented. So credit should be given  for  what

we are doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before I speak about my former colleague, the Member for Hong Lim, it would be

appropriate  for me first to reply  to  the  queries

raised  by  the Member for Geylang Serai,  who  felt

dissatisfied with the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara. Firstly, in prefacing his speech, the Member

for Geylang Semi said in this Chamber it was obvious

that  the  situation in my Party is  unhealthy.  But

actually  the boil has been operated upon,  and  the

dirt  removed. So the situation in my Party is  very

healthy  indeed, and not unhealthy, as  alleged  by

the Member for Geylang Serai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a strange thing, Mr Speaker, that the hon.

Member  emphasised that the speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara was far from satisfactory, because it

touched  on what would be done, and no mention  made

of what had already been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



done. It is customary for people always to think  of

what  is  going  to happen. What is  past  is  past.

Whenever I recollect the past, I shed tears.  But  a

political party which fights for the benefit of  the

people  does not turn back to past events. It  looks

forward and plans its future, so that mistakes  made

in  the past will not be repeated. The speech of the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara was, therefore, so framed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member for Geylang Serai said that he

could  not  find  the  term "non-Communist"  in  the

speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Mr  Speaker,

there is no need for a man, in love with a lady,  to

keep  on saying day and night, "I love you,  I  love

you." The mere mention of the P.A.P. makes clear its

stand - that   it   is  a  non-Communist,   socialist,

democratic  Party. There is no need  to  repeat  our

stand. To repeat "I love you, I love you" again  and

again is an indication of falsehood There is no need

for  my  Party  to repeat that it is  non-Communist,

socialist and democratic, as I said just now. If  we

take an anti-Communist stand, we will be trapped  by

the  Western bloc. If we are pro-Communist, we  will

be  the tools of the M.C.P. Therefore, the P.A.P. is

non-Communist,  like the governments  of  Indonesia,

Egypt  and  India.  We know that this  non-Communist

attitude will develop and flourish in other parts of

Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to labour on the special position of the Malays. I have explained this

earlier  in my speech, but I only wish to  touch  on

the  laws of Islam, which are mentioned in the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's speech and elaborated on by  the

Minister for Labour and Law. The Member for  Geylang

Serai  has  taken  the  opportunity  to  remind  the

Government not to forget the question of  tithe  and

also wakaf. As I said earlier, the P.A.P. Government

is  a government that need not be reminded again and

again.  The P.A.P. Members in this Assembly comprise

people  who are always conscious of the environments

in  the society. Members of the P.A.P. see a pitiful

sight during the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



fasting   month.   Muslim  people   from   outside

Singapore  receive  tithe on the  roadside,  thus

depriving  the poor Malays in Singapore  of  their

rights.  Our Government is conscious of this,  and

therefore  the  Minister for Labour  and  Law  has

framed  laws concerning the rights of the  Islamic

people  and  also tithe and wakaf.  I  hope  these

matters  will be implemented next year. I am  sure

it  will  be  a delight to the Member for  Geylang

Serai  when we say to him "Thank you for reminding

us."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the time has now come for me, as a

close  friend of the former Minister for  National

Development,  and  as his Parliamentary  Secretary

who  was  very  close to him,  to  touch  on  this

matter. Mr Speaker, at the sittings of this House

yesterday  and  the  day before,  we  witnessed  a

person  who was once a smart orator and  a  clever

politician, one who is highly cultured and  sharp-witted;  but,  all of a sudden, in  this  Assembly

yesterday,  he converted himself into a proficient

magician.   Fortunately,  Mr  Speaker,   he   has

forgotten  to distort the facts Which  he  himself

and his former Party have made regarding its clear

and  positive  stand. Yes, Mr  Speaker,  in  this

world, we can find men who pose as, "I alone am  a

revolutionary. I can go to the ultra  left  in  my

own  Party." Mr Speaker, this kind of  man  is  a

laughing stock of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the commencement of his speech on the 3rd

August he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are sitting here on this side because the

Prime  Minister has forced us to sit here. He  has

evicted us unconstitutionally and by force.'



<br><br>This  phraseology  is very amusing  in  the  Malay

language. This can be spoken only by those who are

desperate and are begging for compassion from this

Assembly. Mr Speaker, it is a fact that  man  can

only  taste  the  fruits of his  labour  from  the

efforts he puts in. If he plants `tapioca, he will

get tapioca And if he sows the seed of disunity in

the Party, expulsion will be his harvest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the Member for Hong Lim, who was the

former Minister for National Development, to be an

expert at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



firing  crackers.  The  crackers  which  he  fired

exploded  and illuminated the sky so  widely  that

many  people  gathered at the  Badminton  Hall  to

listen   to   the   "hero"  of  the  fire-crackers

propounding   his   thesis  on   "How   to   Fight

Colonialism". If he were a real revolutionary  and

fully conscious of his responsibilities, then  the

people  would  go  there to listen  to  the  Party

member  who  has been expelled. This  is  how  the

imagination  and minds of the people who  attended

the  Badminton  Hall rally could be captured.  But

what  did the people get, Mr Speaker? Not tactics

on  "How to Fight Colonialism". The orators in the

rally  explained "How to Fight the Leaders of  the

P.A.P."  and "How to Fight Collective Leadership".

That was the thesis propounded to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was obvious that the crackers could only emit smoke after they had been fired.

Mr   Speaker,  after  the  big  bang,  the  smoke

vanished  and  what  was  left?  Ashes  from   the

crackers  that were fired.. If such  an  explosion

should  leave  behind glowing embers,  then  those

embers  could inflame the people but the  ultimate

result is that the ashes which remained were swept

away  by the road-sweeper. Mr Speaker, the people

are  conscious  of  all this,  and  they  are  not

deceived.  They could be deceived but  only  once.

The   people   could   see  who   are   the   real

revolutionary leaders or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should not forget that in our struggle against colonialism, there are three

categories involved. The first group are those who

fight  unconstitutionally.  This  group  will  not

accept  compromises  from colonialism.  They  will

oppose colonialism until 100 per cent independence

is  achieved. They are even prepared to  sacrifice

their  lives. This kind of struggle will  lead  to

bloodshed, and we will find thousands of  victims,

as  has  happened in Indonesia,  if  there  is  no

compromise.  The Indonesian people  chose  between

death  and  life.  This  is  the  unconstitutional

struggle.  The second group, Mr Speaker,  is  the

group  that  fight constitutionally,  they  demand

independence  but are prepared to compromise.  But

they  do  not forget the demand for 100  per  cent

independence. In the process, however,  they  are

prepared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



to  sit  round  the  table and negotiate.  They  are

prepared to accept constitutional changes. They  are

prepared to hold the reins of Government and at  the

same  time, when power is in their hands, they  will

use  this  power as a means of voicing the  people's

stand against colonialism and arousing them to fight

against  colonialism. They will use that  power  for

the benefit of the people. There is the third group,

Mr  Speaker, the puppets. They are not fighting for

independence,  but  they  accept  gifts   from   the

colonialists, and their task is  to  safeguard  the

responsibility  entrusted to them  by  the  colonial

masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has analysed the political situation in

Singapore  from its geographical point of view,  and

has  placed itself in the second category. For  that

reason,  the  P.A.P. contested the  1955  elections

under  the  Rendel Constitution with the  object  of

using  the  power that we would receive to  ask  for

more  than  that given `by the Rendel  Constitution.

For  that reason, the P.A.P., including the  Members

on   this   Bench,  went  to  London  to   ask   for

independence, including our strong man,  the  former

Minister for National Development, who fought  as  a

member  of  the  second group  mentioned  just  now,

resulting in his being the first elected Mayor,  and

later  on,  Minister for National Development.  Then

the political developments proceeded in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as a very close friend of his, 1 do not say that I am a real revolutionary and that I

wish  for  100  per cent Merdeka. If I  were  really

fighting  for  independence  unconstitutionally,   I

would expel myself. But we have had words like "I am

a  real  revolutionary" after he has  been  expelled

from the Party membership and from the Ministry. Mr

Speaker,  I am greatly surprised because the  Member

for  Hong  Lim criticised the policy speech  of  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara, implying as though there was

no  more  colonialism in Singapore. The Member  said

that  the  sense of national pride, as mentioned  by

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, can only be felt in  an

independent country. Mr Speaker, Sir,  a  sense  of

national  pride can also be felt by people,  whether

they are colonised or semi-colonised, or whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



they  have achieved independence.  With  this

feeling  of  national pride there  will  emerge  the

feeling of love towards the country and nation. This

has  happened in Indonesia, which is prepared to die

in  the struggle against colonialism. But the Member

for  Hong  Lim is no longer a Minister to  lead  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not know if there are people who have no feeling of national pride and who owe their

loyalty to a country outside Singapore. But if  they

are  really loyal to this island State of ours, they

should   be   proud.   We  are  heading   for   full

independence.  We should have this  sense  of  pride

because  we  live in a society comprising  a  multi-racial  people.  We are now going  well  ahead.  The

trouble we now have is the result of the actions  of

the ex-Minister for National Development. We have no

place  for such people in our society. It is strange

to  find the Member for Hong Lim quoting the  speech

of  the Secretary-General of the P.A.P. in which  he

said that 80,000 British troops had to surrender  to

the  Japanese  troops  after the  water  supply  for

Singapore  from  Johore had  been  occupied  by  the

Japanese. Therefore, he says, the Prime Minister  of

Singapore  has  asked the people not  to  fight  the

British  hard, because if we do that,  then  British

troops  will ask the Federation Government  to  stop

our  water  supply at Gunong Pulai and we will  then

die of thirst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, are these words spoken by a person who has produced the 16 resolutions, who wants to have

discussions with the Federation of Malaya on merger?

The   Federation   Government  is   an   independent

government.  Is it not contemptible to suggest  that

British  troops  can  prevail  upon  the  Federation

Government  to  stop the water supply of  Singapore,

which is in Johore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the independent Federation of

Malaya  has  never been under the  sway  of  British

troops.  The  Member for Hong Lim means  to  suggest

that  the  Federation of Malaya is not 100 per  cent

independent  now. That is what the  ex-Minister  for

National Development and the present Member for Hong

Lim  would  suggest as being the position  regarding

the independence of the Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



Malaya.  I feel he has spoken without giving careful

thought  to  what  he  said. He  did  so  merely  to

unburden himself.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I can be of some assistance

to  the  Member  for Hong Lim. There is  a  Standing

Order - Standing  Order  22 - which  allows  a  prepared

personal  explanation  to  be  made  later  on.  The

Standing Order reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the leave of the Speaker or in his absence

the  Deputy  Speaker, a Member may make  a  personal

upon  the  explanation. The terms  of  the  proposed

statement shall be submitted in full to the  Speaker

or  in his absence the Deputy Speaker when his leave

to make it is sought.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member wishes to take advantage of that

have heard and what I have noted down. I do not know

whether  anyone  will want to  deny  what  was  said

yesterday. I followed the debate from the  beginning

through  the  simultaneous interpretation.  However,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I should like  to  clarify  this

point. Mr Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said on  the

question of merger with the Federation and I think I

need  not  elaborate, but I am  interested  to  know

whether  the person who says that we should  discuss

and  negotiate with the Federation was motivated  by

his  personal  antagonism towards the  Minister  for

Health.  In  my capacity as Chairman  of  the  Malay

Settlements,  Singapore, I am in a position  to  say

that a piece of land, which had been gazetted by the

previous  government  as  a  Malay  Settlement,  was

revoked or cancelled by the ex-Minister for National

Development. Mr Speaker, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me that there has

been  quite a lot of misunderstanding of the  Member

for  Hong  Lim's speech, as alleged by him.  I  have

already indicated that the Member could make use  of

Standing  Order  22. But perhaps  it  will  be  more

convenient  if  he  makes use  of  another  Standing

Order.  That  is  Standing Order 43,  paragraph  (4)

which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Member who has spoken to a question may again be

heard to offer an explanation of some material  part

of  his speech which has been misunderstood; but  he

shall not introduce any new matter.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the hon. Member thinks he has been

misunderstood in some material part of his speech, I

will  permit him, after the Parliamentary  Secretary

has  completed his speech, to make that explanation.

At  the  moment,  I  do not think the  Parliamentary

Secretary is giving way.

appointed the Chairman of the Malay Settlements  for

the  island of Singapore. Unfortunately, I have  not

brought  the particular Gazette that is relevant  to

this  matter.  If  I had known he would  raise  this

point, then I would have had this Gazette ready.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land, which is about 41 acres in area, had been

gazetted  by  the  previous Government  as  a  Malay

Settlement.   But   the  Gazette  Notification   was

cancelled  by the Minister for National Development,

the   present  Member  for  Hong  Lim,  without  the

knowledge  of the Chairman of the Malay  Settlement,

who has been duly gazetted. Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it now behoves the Chair to be

more   strict  on  irrelevancies.  I  have   already

indicated  that  all  these details  relate  to  the

personal  conduct  of  a Member  of  this  Assembly.

Therefore, the only way these details can be  raised

and  debated is by way of a substantive  motion.  If

the  hon. Member feels strongly about the point,  he

must give notice of a substantive motion. Then every

detail  which it is thought necessary to be  brought

forward  can  be brought forward. At the  moment,  I

must  remind  all  hon.  Members  that  we  are  on

Standing Order 13, which says specifically that the

debate  on  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech,

"shall be confined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



to the policy of the Government as outlined in

the  speech  and  on amendments (if  any)  moved  by

Members...". So that in future, I think I must  insist

that  the  broad  aspects of  that  policy  must  be

debated.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I shall try

to  control  myself  so as to  follow  the  Standing

Order.  But  in  my opinion, this matter  does  have

relevancy  to  the policy speech  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  as  affecting the  welfare  of  the

Malays, in an effort to build an independent  nation

by merging with the Federation of Malaya. I am not a

communalist,  but in order to make  the  Member  for

Hong  Lim realise that if he really wants a  fighter

who  wishes to bring about merger between  Singapore

and  the Federation of Malaya, then I would like  to

remind   him  that  in  the  Constitution   of   the

Federation  of  Malaya, there occur  over  and  over

again  matters concerning the special rights of  the

Malays.  However that may be, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

P.A.P. has regazetted the area I have mentioned just

now  and  work will be carried out in the future.  I

mention  this  point not so much  to  bring  up  the

question of communalism as to point out that this is

the  way  how  a  person, who  considers  himself  a

revolutionary wishing to have discussions  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya,  conducts  himself.  He  has

stated  that  if  we  can make  the  Malays  in  the

Federation  have confidence in us, then  perhaps  it

would  be  possible to bring about a merger  between

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. Mr Speaker,

I  am surprised that the Member for Hong Lim accuses

the  present Government and his ex-Party  of  being

led  by  two  people,  the Prime  Minister  and  the

Minister  for  Finance. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it  would

appear  that all this while the Member for Hong  Lim

had not realised this point. It is only since he has

been  expelled that he realises it. But  we  do  not

wish  to  be  accused that we are followers  of  the

Prime Minister and that we are pro-colonial. For  my

own  self,  I  have struggled for 14  years  against

colonialism. At that time, perhaps the  Member  for

Hong Lim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



was  studying in Australia. I am not here to  relish

the  fact  that I am a revolutionary, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  but  I want to deny the fact that I  am  pro-colonial.  The  P.A.P., as a party  that  holds  and

subscribes    to   the   principle   of   collective

leadership, will not accept what has been stated  by

the  Member  for Hong Lim. The steps taken  by  this

Government  in  this House have the backing  of  all

members  of  the  Party.  We  are  all  collectively

responsible for what has been uttered in the  policy

speech  in this House. Therefore, if only two people

in  the  Party are accused while the others are  let

off,  then  I feel that the seed of disunity  should

not  be sown in this House, so long as there are  40

people  solidly behind the Government. We are  solid

and  united  in  our stand. The statement  that  was

issued  by  the Party, and bearing the 40 signatures

of  the  Members, was not signed at the point  of  a

gun, as alleged. We are not revolutionary members of

the  Party  who only confine ourselves to  the  four

walls  of  the office without going out to meet  the

people.  Nor do we call upon photographers  to  come

along and -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member must have

regard  to  the authority of the Chair and  not  now

completely irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, some

colleagues of mine have said that I, as a Member  of

the  Government, will not run away like a  rat  when

the House is on fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Prime Minister's motion

expressing our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

for  his  speech. But before concluding  my  speech,

however,  I would like to speak on Malayan  culture,

with  Malay culture as its basis, in Singapore. This

policy   has   been  implemented   by   the   P.A.P.

Government.  I  would  like  to  quote  one  of  the

resolutions arrived at by the Permanent  Council  of

Malay Language and Literature at a meeting which was

held  in  Malacca.  Any  element  in  Malay  culture

appropriate to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



the  times  should  be nurtured and  developed.  The

P.A.P.  Government has nurtured and developed  Malay

culture  to  the extent that concerts were  held  by

Chinese  students  in Jurong at which  Malay  dances

were  performed. This concept has gained  ground  in

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resolution was that any foreign element

which does not conflict with Malay culture should be

studied  with  the  object of  evolving  a  national

culture.  This  means that the Malays have  accepted

certain elements in the culture of other races. This

was one of the resolutions of the Congress, and not

the  decision of the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister for National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governments of the Federation of Malaya, North

Borneo   and   Sarawak  should  establish   cultural

departments   in  cooperation  with  other   similar

bodies.  In  Singapore, we do not  have  a  cultural

department but a Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no necessity for me to

dwell at length on this subject, except to say  that

the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan has  not  made  a

careful study of Malay culture. There is no need for

me  to  say ten times a day that I love this and  I

love that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have been accused by the Hon, the Prime Minister  of

being afflicted with political myopia just because I

dared  again to raise the issue of the cuts in  the

variable allowances of Government servants. Perhaps,

Sir,  the Prime Minister is not aware that, if there

is  any political myopia among members of the public

in  Singapore,  in  Great  Britain  and  other  free

countries  of  the  world concerning  the  state  of

affairs  in  Singapore, he and his Government  alone

are responsible for that political myopia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was nothing in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to show that the survival of the

State  of  Singapore  was at stake.  The  propaganda

machine of the Government has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



saying  for  the last 14 months that  everything  in

Singapore was fine and wonderful.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Which it is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Everything was under control.

Sir,  the  second paragraph of column 5  of  Hansard

dated  20th  July,  1960 (Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The correctness of the policy laid down in the Five-Year Plan has been shown by the fact that under the

new   Government,  Singapore  has  enjoyed   greater

political  and economic stability than it has  known

during the last 15 years...'.



<br><br>Sir, in the face of that statement, if we Members of

the  Opposition were to challenge it by means of  an

amendment  to the Address of Thanks, we  would  very

likely  be  accused of being irresponsible.  But  on

Wednesday in this House the Prime Minister  threw  a

bombshell,  and the next day, on the front  page  of

the  Straits Times there appeared in big  headlines,

"Assembly  warned:  They scattered  and  went  under

cover - today  they  are reorganising  and  regrouping

again - 'RED  FORCES  GATHERING' - They've   built   up

forces  since  the election". Sir, how  were  we  to

know,  having only heard the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, that things in Singapore had changed

all  of  a sudden from one of economic and political

stability  to  one  of  political  instability - to  a

situation  of  crisis?  Therefore,  Members  of  the

Opposition   cannot  be  accused  of   having   been

afflicted  with  political myopia  in  view  of  the

propaganda appearing day in and day out in the Press

and  over the Radio that everything in Singapore  is

fine and wonderful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has really brought up a

domestic  party issue - an internal party struggle - and

made it into a national issue, telling the people of

Singapore  that  unless they  support  him  and  the

ruling clique, Singapore will go down together  with

them. Sir, the issue does not seem to be so easy  as

that.  If  it  were,  Sir - if  we  put  the  national

interest  before  Party  interest - and  if  it  is  a

question of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



survival of the State, we would be only too happy to

support  them, but we do not believe that the  issue

is so simple and so clear as that. And when we study

the  Prime Minister's speech carefully, Sir, we find

that  the issue becomes more confusing. I would like

to  read,  Sir,  a paragraph which appeared  in  the

Straits Times of Thursday, 4th August:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The policy of the Communist Party is to unite with

all  progressive  forces - of  which  the  P.A.P. is

acknowledged as one - to struggle against  the  forces

of  reaction,  namely colonialism,  imperialism  and

feudalism.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  Prime Minister correctly infers that  the

P.A.P. is one with whom the Communist Party would be

glad  to unite. This confirms what was said  in  the

White  Paper  of  1957, that the Party  was  heavily

infiltrated by Communists and, Sir, in the  presence

of  one  of our Members and Government Members,  the

Police  have  indicated that Communists  are  to  be

found  in the People's Action Party. The Member  for

Hong  Lim,  having  more internal knowledge  of  the

P.A.P., has said that there are three groups in  the

P.A.P.:  there  are the Right-wingers,  the  genuine

Socialists and the Communists. Sir, in view of  that

statement, how can the public be now asked to depend

upon  the People's Action Party to save them in this

crisis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another paragraph in Straits Times reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But, as I see it, the danger is not that the PAP.

will  deviate  from its declared  policy, but  that

these  Left-wing adventurers, unable  to  manipulate

the  P.A.P. to abandon its non-Communist principles,

will begin a fight with a Government which, by their

own admission, is progressive.'



<br><br>Sir,  it  is  really  an admission  that  there  are

certain backseat drivers who have greatly influenced

them  before, and to whom they are willing to listen

up to a point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> That point, Sir, will be

mentioned later by the Prime Minister himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the people of Singapore before the

elections  feared  that the Prime Minister  and  his

Party were trying to capture power by riding on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



tiger,  and they feared that one of these  days  the

tiger  would show its claws and its fangs.  Sir,  we

prefer -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Cats!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - a situation where the

Government  of Singapore is not in the  hands  of  a

Party that depends on a tiger for its strength.



<br><br>In another paragraph, Sir, it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"What is worse than the worst that can happen in

the  immediate  future? It is  that  the  Government

finds itself out-manoeuvred and out-propagandaed  by

these  Left-wing adventurers, that the  P.A.P. will

have to take the count in this fight ..."'.



<br><br>This  is the sentence which has perplexed a  number

of people -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"...and the Communists will be counted out for many

years..."'.



<br><br>It  implies, Sir, that the P.A.P. Government or the

Communists  will be knocked out. If the P.A.P. does

not  fall, the Communists will be protected. On  the

face  of it, Sir, that is the meaning. Then it  goes

on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"We are not unaware that with the C.P. on one

side'  of us and the' colonialists on the other - each

side will want to pull us to its side."'



<br><br>A wonderful bargaining position, Sir!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"We are also aware that failing this, each of

these two contending forces is quite prepared to use

us  as  buffers in their machinations  against  each

other."'



<br><br>A  little  lower  down the column, Sir,  appear  the

following words:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"But it is the business of the Government to

ensure that if a collision has to take place between

these  Left-wing  adventurers  and  the  colonialist

imperialists the P.A.P. should let them break  their

heads on each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we are confident that whatever the temporary

maneuverings  and ups and downs, we as non-Communist

party socialists have a historic role to play in the

political   struggle  of  Malaya  in  this   crucial

stage."'



<br><br>Sir,  those are words uttered by the Prime  Minister

himself  and  they are worth careful study.  If  the

Communist  Party  fights the British,  the  People's

Action Party will duck, and say nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has been accused of

being an opportunist. This looks like opportunism on

a very high level, so high that many people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



cannot understand it, so flexible that it does  not

appear to be straight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Resilient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No wonder the Tunku in the

Federation  is  himself confused  and  unhappy  over

Singapore under the People's Action Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Who told you that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> But the Prime Minister has said

that the Federation's policy is anti-Communist -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Therefore?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - whereas he has to adopt the

policy of being just non-Communist. So what chance

is there of Singapore ever having a merger with the

Federation, if that is the policy of the present

Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everything was fine and wonderful until the

tiger  under  them began to be restive and  to  look

round. And in their own words, Sir, we may say  that

the  tiger was tempted by what the Member for  Hong

Lim had to offer. And lo! all of a sudden everything

in  Singapore  now is in a dangerous state.  Anybody

who  brings  up the question `of the pay  issue  is

told,  "You  have got political myopia!"  The  great

danger  is that the Left-wing adventurers are  being

tempted to go towards the Member for Hung Lim. That,

Sir, is the P.A.P. version.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well to ask at this time three questions in

order  that  we  may  be able  to  see  things  more

clearly. First, is the People's Action Party a truly

free,  reliable, democratic, socialist Party, or  is

it  not?  At this juncture, Sir, until we  see  more

purging,  it  is still a Party that is riddled  with

Communists. It is like a beam, or a pillar,  painted

outside but in such a state that it cannot guarantee

the stability, security and prosperity of Singapore.

What  has happened? The words that have been uttered

bear out what I have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is this: are the people

of Singapore being really limited to a narrow choice

of  just two - either, support the extreme Left  Party

or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



section of the P.A.P., or the near-extreme Left

faction of the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Or the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am sure the people are

wiser  than  that. They know that the choice  before

them is not limited to two. They are not going to be

given the choice of the devil and the deep sea. That

is    really    what   is   being    presented    to

them - sugarcoated - so  that  they  will  suffer   from

another  kind of political myopia. Sir, we are  free

men. We have tasted a degree of freedom, and we want

more  freedom. Today, I say quite plainly, Sir, that

we  have  got  less freedom than we  had  under  the

British  colonial power. We want Merdeka,  and  more

freedom; not less freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, maybe people do not behave frankly in front of

the Government. If there is any social function, and

if  members of the Government are there, before  the

people dare to criticise the Government, they  look

around.  Then,  again and again,  people  have  been

nudged,  "Ssh, don't say that." They  only  dare  to

speak  freely when they know there are  no  `hostile

ears around. Sir, this is a bad state of affairs. In

a  truly democratic and free country, people  should

be allowed to express their opinions. They should be

allowed  to disagree without any fear of any hostile

reaction or repercussion. We are sorry to say,  Sir,

that even in schools, some boys have dared to say to

their teachers, "I will report you to the Ministry."

[Laughter] Sir, you will notice that the Government

side  has  adopted  an  attitude  of  arrogance  and

ridicule,  thinking thereby they could belittle  the

issues. These are important fundamental issues in  a

free  democratic country. It is an open secret  that

the most active section in the Education Ministry is

the  Complaints Section. We know that there must  be

complaints;  complaints  must  be  listened  to  and

investigated.  But  when a boy thinks  that  he  can

intimidate his teacher `by saying he will report  to

the Ministry, then discipline is in danger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Disappears.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, there is another question.

In   view   of  the  Federation's  attitude  towards

Communism and non-Communism, can the People's Action

Party  Government ever be successful in drawing  the

Federation and Singapore together? Or even  bringing

the  Federation  and  Singapore into  such  friendly

relationship that we know that their prosperity will

also be our prosperity? We are afraid, Sir, that the

gulf  in  the last 12 months has become wider.  This

bombshell  that  was thrown into this  Chamber  last

Wednesday is not going to make the gulf narrower.  I

would  say that the Malays are even more frightened.

Sir,  that is what has been accomplished politically

in the last 14 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we ask the question: which statement is the

correct  one? The policy statement of His Excellency

the   Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  that  there  is  now

political  and economic stability to  a  degree  not

found  in the last 15 years, or the statement  made

here  that there is great danger because "Red Forces

are Gathering"? I believe, Sir, these were the words

of the Hon, the Prime Minister, "they have scattered

and  went undercover before the last elections  when

the  Lim Yew Hock Government was in power." How  is

it that in the last 14 months they have been allowed

to build up their forces to the point where they now

become  a real threat to the Government and a danger

to  the  stability of Singapore? Sir, it is for  the

Government side to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, comparing the speeches of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  this year and last year, I notice  that  the

speech  delivered last year was characterised  by  a

spirit   of   super-confidence,  great   pride   and

expectation  and  a certain degree  of  supercilious

arrogance  and intolerance. Experience  is  a  great

teacher, and after 14 months' experiment in the art

of  government,  they have changed  their  tone  and

their  tune. This time, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech  emphasises at the very start the limitations

under which the present Government has to work.  The

difficulties are quite well known. They claimed that

they did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



not   want   to  be  in  power  under   the   Rendel

Constitution,  because their  hands  would  be  tied

behind their backs and because power would be in the

hands   of   the  colonial  officials-the  Permanent

Secretary,   the  Chief  Secretary,  the   Attorney-General, the Governor. And therefore they wanted  to

attain  power under the present constitution.  Under

the   present  Constitution,  Sir,  they  have  full

control  of internal affairs and finance. Therefore,

logically,  in the last 14 months, they should  have

been  able  to  give Singapore greater security  and

greater prosperity. But the visible results achieved

so  far have been most disappointing. Sir, they  may

deny  it,  and their denial will be printed  in  the

Press,  and circulated all over the world,  but  the

number  of  people in Singapore who voted for  them

and who have been disappointed is increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in Singapore realise that there are

handicaps and limitations. But what we are sad about

is  the approach taken by the People's Action  Party

in power. We believe it is not calculated to produce

prosperity, security and unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they condemn communal hatred and racial

hatred.  That is very good. But they do not  condemn

class hatred. They believe in class hatred. And that

is  the  sad part, because Singapore is so situated,

with limited resources, that unless and until we all

can  pull  together  and work together  without  any

hatred  of  one another, we will never  be  able  to

build together a new nation and a prosperous nation.

We  will  never  be able to produce  in  this  small

island  a  nation and a country that can survive  in

spite of all hindrances and difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to read again from what they like

to call their Bible. In page 16, paragraph 6 of "The

Tasks Ahead", their Five-Year Plan, Part I, are  the

following words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'One defence against communalism is to stress that

if  people want to improve their economic  lot  they

must  do  so by combining on a class and not  racial

basis.'



<br><br>Sir,  I am afraid that is too sectional a foundation

or  a  base  on, which to build a new, cohesive  and

united nation in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



Malaya. On that policy, Sir, the gulf between us and

the Federation will grow ever wider and wider, with,

we  all  know, possibly disastrous consequences.  We

have   to   survive.  The  population   is   rapidly

increasing.  We  must win back  the  friendship  and

confidence  of  the  Federation,  North  Borneo  and

Sarawak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, because of our flexible policy, so

flexible  that  it  becomes confusing,  people  from

Singapore are not trusted. That is most unfortunate,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On capital investment, the "P.A.P.'s Five-Year

Plan", on page 25, paragraph 3 has these words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. profoundly disagrees that the survival

of  Singapore depends on foreign capital and foreign

capitalists.'



<br><br>And  yet,  Sir, today, we do not find the Hon. the

Minister  for Finance here, because he has  gone  to

the  U  K. and to America, cap in hand, to  ask  for

foreign  capital. Sir, Singapore,  we  know,  cannot

stand  alone.  Our  economy is such  that  we  must

depend  on the friendship and co-operation of  those

outside  Singapore, of the Federation, our immediate

neighbour, and even of those far away. Sir,  we  are

not  saying that the Finance Minister is  doing  the

wrong  thing. He is doing the right thing. But  that

seems, to be contrary to the Five-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree in what they said in page 19,

paragraph 3 of their "Tasks. Ahead", Part  I,  under

the title "Our Economic Policy".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The main economic problem that faces Singapore

today  is  to provide increasing, opportunities  for

employment.'



<br><br>And a few lines below:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If a large number of young people looking, for

work  do  not get work and remain unemployed,  there

can be no peace and stability in this country. Acute

social  tensions would be generated.  The  political

situation will become explosive.'



<br><br>We  wholeheartedly agree, Sir, that that is  a  very

important problem which must be solved. But here  we

differ with them in the approach to the solution  of

this  problem.  We say that they cannot  solve  this

problem of unemployment if class hatred is still the

basis  of their political philosophy. Why not  go  a

bit  further?  Why stop only with communal  goodwill

and racial goodwill? Why not go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



further,  and  have  genuine goodwill  above  class?

Simply regard ourselves, whether we are employers or

employees,  on  the labour side or  on  the  capital

side,  as human beings. On that basis only  can  our

economy stand and prosper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is being discussed freely among the

unemployed. They say that any unemployed person  who

wants to get employment must join the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Is that so!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I hope the Minister for

Labour  and  Law  will deny that. I have  been  told

reliably  that the leaders of the Work  Brigade  are

all  P.A.P. members.  Sir,  that  is  being  freely

discussed.  If  that  is not  true,  the  Government

should  deny  it, or invite somebody  to  scrutinise

their   background.  But  that  has  been  discussed

freely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party prides itself on being a

Party  based on principles, not on opportunism.  How

is  it,  Sir,  that  after condemning  the  English-educated, now they have been praised; now they  have

been  told  that  their  products  are  more  nearly

Malayan than others. Well, I am glad that the  Party

has  changed  to  the point where it can  appreciate

these  things. Of course, some people say that  they

are  opportunists. But let us be  generous  and  say

that  they have learned to appreciate what they  did

not appreciate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same with the civil servants. They are

supposed  to  have  been spoilt under  the  previous

Government; but now we hear praises that  the  civil

servants  are most loyal and capable. I  agree  with

them.  Without  these trained civil servants,  self-government  in  Singapore  very  likely  would  have

failed.  They provide the smooth machinery, so  that

regardless of whichever Party is in power,  if  they

are  left  alone  without any  fear  and  any  undue

political  interference, we know that they  will  do

their job loyally and efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one important point which I feel

that  the Government has overlooked. To the  Malays,

religion  is most important. The Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  has  mentioned it again. And  the  Tunku,

when he delivered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



his message regarding the end of the

Emergency, was not ashamed to acknowledge his debt

to Providence. He said here, Sir, as reported in the

Sunday Times of 31st July, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I had declared my belief in the Legislative

Council three months before I went to Baling. I

thank God that my prayers and your prayers have been

answered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on our Victory Day, second only in

importance to the Day of Merdeka, we celebrate with

joy and thankfulness to Almighty God, the benevolent

and the merciful, for our success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise be to God and to those who gave their

support in faith and confidence, conscious of their

duty to bring an end to the Emergency.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were disappointed when we read in "The

Tasks Ahead" Part I, on page 12, paragraph 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We, of the P.A.P. are not fatalists. As socialists

we believe that the people, and not the stars, order

human affairs.'



<br><br>Sir, that has given the impression that the

Government does not believe that there is any value

in religion, and that it believes only in human

intelligence and human ability, unaided by a

superior wisdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we hope events have happened to make them

wiser,  because  on  National  Day  everything   was

planned   well,   humanly  speaking.   The   weather

forecasts were that it was going to be fine  weather

and yet it rained and rained and rained, longer than

the P.A.P. wise men had expected and planned for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You did not fix it, did you? You

prayed for the rain!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I hope they have learned a

lesson. I would like to quote, Sir, the immortal

words of Shakespeare. I say immortal because the

members of the' People's Action Party and I will go,

but these words will still be remembered and quoted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio

than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Where does it come from?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the Member for Mountbatten

has challenged the statement that there is political

and  economic  stability today.  But  I  think  that

challenge  need  not be answered because  the  Prime

Minister himself has answered it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heading "Finance" in col. 6 of the

Hansard,  volume 13, No. 1 of 20th  July,  1960,  it

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The atmosphere of uncertainty and hesitation in

the  field of private investment was replaced  by  a

climate  of  confidence.  Proof  of  this  was   the

substantial volume of private investment now seeking

permission to operate in Singapore. Applications for

exemption  under  the  Pioneer Industries  Ordinance

alone give a total paid-up capital of more than $101

million from 13 major concerns.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are glad that there is this climate of

confidence  as  claimed by the Government.  We  hope

that  the climate of confidence will keep on getting

better  until  the  flow  of  capital  towards   the

Federation  is  turned. But at  the  moment  anybody

going to Petaling Jaya will be so impressed that  he

comes  back to Singapore with the thought that  part

of  Singapore's  major  industries  have  gone  over

there. A Federation businessman was telling me  that

a  Japanese organisation, which had planned to build

a   steel   mill   here,  had,  after  investigating

conditions in the, Federation, changed its  mind.  I

hope, Sir, that the matter will be looked into.  Why

has this organisation changed its mind? Just to show

that  the  climate of confidence is not as yet  good

enough,  here  is what one investor said,  "We  know

that  Singapore has got better facilities,  but  how

can  we  guarantee  that the labour  situation  will

continue to be stable? So it is better that we  stay

in  the Federation where people do not stir up class

hatred  and  say that the workers must  control  the

employers or vice-versa." Sir, in the past no doubt

many  employers exploited the labour situation,  but

things  have  changed. So why  should  the  pendulum

swing from one extreme to the other?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government claims that its-policies and

actions are consistent and predictable. I am afraid,

Sir, things have happened to show that they are not

so  predictable as the Government seems to think. Or

they  are predictable to the point where the  people

cannot  predict. To give you one example, Sir.  When

students, went  abroad on Government  bursaries  or

were awarded scholarships, there was no bond stating

that  they should come back and serve Government  or

some quasi-Government organisation for  five  years.

Well,  lo  and  behold, while  they  were  still  in

foreign countries, they were told they must now sign

new   bonds.  Unless  they  signed  the  bonds   the

bursaries would be discontinued. The same thing  has

happened  to those bursary holders who  are  in  our

local  University and who have been given  bursaries

without  any strings attached. They were  told  that

they must sign bonds. Sir, when they left their  old

status  to  go  to  the  universities  on  bursaries

without  any strings attached, surely they  did  not

predict  that  halfway through  their  studies  they

would  be  made to sign bonds. If a man  sails  from

Singapore  for  London,  he  does  not  expect  that

halfway, some-where at the port of Aden, he will  be

told   of  new  conditions  which  he  must  accept.

otherwise he will be left in the lurch in  Aden.  He

never  predicted  that. Sir, I hope  the  Government

will  think  about it and ensure that what  they  do

really is a continuation of what was, undertaken  by

the   previous   Government  that  was  predictable.

unless,   of   course  there  had   been   something

disgraceful  or  underhand  that  had  happened   in

connection with the contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give you another instance, Sir. When teachers

from   aided   schools   were   given   departmental

scholarships  to  the  University  of  Malaya,  they

signed  bonds,  and  the  bonds  stated  that  after

graduation  they  could serve in any  government  or

aided  school. Sir, at the beginning of  this  year,

they  were  all told that they could  not  make  any

choice.  They  must  all go to  Government  schools.

That, Sir, was not predictable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the policy as declared says that this

Government  follows  a  consistent  and  predictable

policy.  We hope maybe these were slips and we  hope

that  they will be looked into. At least people will

believe that whatever undertaking was given would be

kept.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He is hiding something.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, on the question of

recruitment, we are told that Singapore  people  are

paid  higher salaries than those in India. Sir,  why

compare   Singapore  with  India?  If  you   compare

Singapore with England or with America, it might be

different,  or  perhaps compare Singapore  with  the

Federation.  Let  us be realistic.  Of  course,  the

Federation  is  our  nearest  neighbour.  Sir,   the

Government has wonderful plans for expansion of this

and  that  which  will  require  trained  engineers,

scientists  and doctors. But what is the  difference

in  salary scales and treatment between here and  in

the  Federation?  We have to be realistic,  Sir.  We

have  to  see that the supply depends on the demand,

and that the demand also depends on what is paid for

the  demand. Now we are faced with a situation where

we  are  unable  to  retain  trained  and  qualified

personnel.  In one school, at the end of last  year,

three  science graduates resigned and  went  to  the

Federation.  At  the beginning  of  this  year,  two

science graduates were persuaded to join a school in

Singapore.  At  the  end of  six  months,  Sir,  one

resigned  because he was offered a  better  post  in

Hong   Kong  with  a  salary  of  $200  more.   Most

unfortunate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



for Singapore! One month later, another one said  he

had  been  offered he did not apply but he had  been

offered - a  job in the Federation where,  instead  of

getting $650 per month as an Honours graduate  here,

he is there being paid $1,000 plus free quarters. So

naturally, the principal said to him, "Good luck  to

you." That is why in Singapore `we are suffering. We

are not realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the brightest feature in the speech of His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is to be found

in  col.  5, paragraph 4 of the Hansard, Volume  13,

No. 1, of 20th July, 1960, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government does not wish to give the

impression  that  there have not been  mistakes  and

shortcomings during the past year. It is aware  that

some of its measures should have been more carefully

planned and expertly executed. In some instances, it

moved  too fast and without preparing public opinion

adequately  for the changes. Some of the legislation

resulted   in  inconveniences  or  misunderstandings

which  could  have  been avoided by  a  little  more

foresight,  a  little mere consultation,  discussion

and a little more explanation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest, Sir, `with a little more -'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Brains!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> ' - tolerance, a little more

goodwill, a little less pressure.' To continue  with

the quotation, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But these are errors arising from zeal and

impatience  to get things done. In the  coming  year

the  Government will temper zeal with  understanding

and  its impatience by explaining more to the people

the need for certain courses of action.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I consider that this is the brightest feature

in  the whole speech. But it is no use just to admit

the  errors.  The  errors  must  be  rectified.  The

Government says that the next year will be a year of

construction. But what is the use of constructing on

a  foundation that has been cracked? The cracks must

be repaired, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The building will fall down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the Minister for

Education,  who  is not here, was a friend  of  mine

even before he entered politics. I find it difficult

sometimes  to say things in this Chamber because  of

our  friendly relationship. But I am here,  Sir,  to

express  the feelings of the members of  the  public

who  dare  not express these feelings on  their  own

behalf  for obvious reasons. They have asked  me  to

raise this question: "Frankly, do you not think that

the  Government's educational experiments have made

most  people  in Singapore unhappy? They  have  made

teachers  unhappy,  parents  unhappy  and  also  the

students unhappy." Sir, no doubt the Government side

will  sneer again. That is an expression of opinion.

If  they  are  still sceptical, Sir, I suggest  that

they  take  a  referendum of  opinion  among  those

categories of people. There is no question,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



Sir, that the Minister for Education is zealous  and

sincere, and that he wants to do in four years' time

what  normally should be done in 10 years. Sir, Rome

was  not built in a day, and nature has certain laws

which must be observed -
