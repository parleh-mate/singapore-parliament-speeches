<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head P (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CBA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how far has the work progressed at the Bedok

Cut Site, and when will the reservoir be built at

the Cut Site?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are being taken to clear our canals

of  filth, and what action has been taken  against

offenders  who  pollute  the  rivers,  canals  and

drains, although there is a general improvement in

the cleanliness of most rivers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



canals?  I  have  observed that Rochore  Canal  is

often  heavily polluted with rubbish and  oil  and

clearing  up operations are slow and  poor.  As  a

result, it continues to smell badly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a common sight to see a considerable amount

of  rubbish floating down the Singapore  River  to

the  sea.  Sometimes you can even see large  boxes

and  huge pieces of rubbish floating down  to  the

sea.  Why  is this important river allowed  to  be

left  like  that? This is definitely unsightly  to

our  tourists. I hope the Minister will look  into

this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps are being taken to improve the

drainage  around Newton, Kampung Java  and  Farrer

Park  areas? During the rainy season, these places

are usually flooded. Since this is a central point

between  Bukit  Timah/Thomson Road and  the  City,

office workers always have a problem during  rainy

seasons.  This problem has been going on for  many

years. Can something concrete be done about it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the excavation work at Bedok is

undertaken  by the Housing and Development  Board,

and  according to the schedule the  work  will  be

completed  by  the  end of 1975.  As  regards  the

question   of  building  a  reservoir   there,   a

feasibility  study  is  being  made  to  find  out

whether the soil can hold water. Construction of a

reservoir will depend upon the result of the study

and the soil test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear the Member for Anson say that

there  has  been  an improvement  in  the  general

cleanliness  of  our canals and rivers,  with  the

exception  of one or two. It should be so  because

we  have spent $800,000 on contract labour for the

financial  year  1973-74 to  maintain  and  desilt

canals  and rivers. In addition, we have  our  own

fleet  of  14 excavators to clean our watercourses

of  silt  and refuse. It is a slow and  unpleasant

job,  and  it  will take some time before  we  can

clean  all  our rivers. But there is  improvement.

There  will be more improvement if members of  the

public stop polluting the canals. The odour  which

the  Member  complained about  is  the  result  of

pollution.  There  is  still  a  good  number   of

irresponsible  people  who  persist  in   throwing

rubbish  into  rivers  and  canals,  though  9.800

offenders  were  taken  to  court  last  year  for

polluting our watercourses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding flooding at Newton and Kampung Java

areas,  I think there has been a great improvement

in  these  areas. The duration of  the  floods  is

shorter  now  and frequency of flooding  is  less.

This  is because Phase I of the project to improve

the Bukit Timah Canal has been completed. Phase II

is  under study. It will take quite a long time to

complete the work, and it is going to cost  a  lot

of  money.  There are other matters which  require

priority  and it will be some time before flooding

can be totally eradicated from these areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied with the

Minister's explanation but I would like to request

that   these   canals  be  kept   under   frequent

observation. The Minister cannot blame



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



the  people  for polluting the canals  because  we

cannot control them. If the people are disciplined

and  do  not  throw rubbish into  the  rivers  and

canals,  there  is  no  need to  employ  cleaners.

Anyway, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head P be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 4002.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting is not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BAA

2110.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beaches around Singapore are one of the very

few   places  where  people  can  go   to   relax.

Unfortunately, certain beaches are in a deplorable

condition.  To give an example, the beach  at  the

end  of Sembawang has not got even a single litter

bin.  In fact, the whole beach is littered. Pieces

of  glass are strewn all over the sand, and  is  a

danger to picnickers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, patches of oil are regularly found

around  this beach. Obviously they come  from  the

shipyard  which  is  just a short  distance  away.

Since  a good crowd of picnickers and swimmers  go

to  this beach, why cannot we look after the beach

and  keep it clean? Maintenance can thus be summed

up in one word "nil". Let us do something about it

so  that our citizens in that corner of the island

are not completely neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am pleased to say that the grass

cutters  have  kept the grass in  that  particular

area neat and obviously trimming has been done  so

often  that it is the reverse in the case  of  the

cemeteries at Chua Chu Kang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot

reconcile  what the Member said just now.  On  the

one  hand,  he said that on that particular  beach

"maintenance can be summed up in one word `nil' ".

But  then  he went on to say that "However,  I  am

pleased to say that the grass



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



cutters  have  kept the grass in  that  particular

area neat", so there is maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deplorable condition of the beach is because

people   are   irresponsible  or  careless.   They

continue to ignore the no-littering signs. Perhaps

the  Member  was  there when picnickers  may  have

dirtied  the  place  again immediately  after  the

cleaners  have  completed cleaning.  So  I  cannot

accept  the  statement  that  there  has  been  no

maintenance.  There  has been maintenance  but  no

amount  of maintenance can prevent what he  called

"this   deplorable  condition".  This   deplorable

condition  is  the  result of  littering  by  some

people who use it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the long-term solution lies in

educating  the  public. Until  the  public  change

their  habits,  no  amount of litter  bins,  beach

cleansing work and enforcement action can keep our

beaches completely free of litter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no litter bin in the particular beach

which  the Member mentioned because when the  tide

is  high it covers the beach. So there is no point

in  putting a litter bin only to see it float away

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the complaint of oil sludge, may I inform the

Member  for Anson that the shipyard concerned  has

its  own  facilities for reception of oil  sludge.

The  PSA  also  has  its own facilities  at  Pulau

Sebarok  for removing oil sludge from tankers  and

ships.  The  PSA has also been taking  enforcement

action  against  sea  pollution.  We  are  at  the

crossroad  between East and West, and hundreds  of

ships  pass by daily. Some of the ships  may  have

discharged their oil sludge while passing  through

without being caught. This is the price we have to

pay for being in the centre of a very busy trading

route.  But whatever can be done is being done  to

prevent pollution of our sea.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, regarding the Minister's reply about the

litter bins floating away, I would like to suggest

that the bins be fixed to long poles and then bury

these poles firmly in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



beach. In this way, the bins cannot float away.  I

am sure this can be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BCA 2110.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most probably after listening to me the

Minister for the Environment will get angry again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a very active anti-mosquito breeding

campaign.  Yet at the Chua Chu Kang  Cemetery  the

conditions  are  such  that  it  is  an  excellent

breeding  ground for mosquitoes. At the  entrances

to  the cemetery there are notices forbidding  the

use  of  flower vases on the graves.  This  is  to

avoid the collection of rain water which will then

be a breeding place for mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as you walk further you find lalang all over

the  place,  as high as the waist.  If  I  am  not

mistaken,  in  the burial ceremony of  a  Catholic

priest,  on  24th  June, 1974, a great  number  of

mourners had to fight through lalang as tall as  a

man, and thick undergrowth. To make matters worse,

there  were many muddy potholes and pools of water

all  over  the  place - ideal  for  mosquitoes  to

breed.  Such  conditions  make  it  difficult  for

anyone  to move about in a burial ceremony  or  in

paying respects to the dead. Surely, something can

be  done to improve this poor state of affairs  at

the cemeteries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are the plots for burials dug deep enough?

They  seem  to  be too shallow. A  terrible  smell

pervades  the  air because of the shallow  graves.

Are  the  graves really six feet deep or  are  the

grave diggers taking things a bit easy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has given a

poetic  description  of  the  graveyard  and   its

surroundings.  I  am  glad to  note  that  in  his

description  there  is no mention  of  his  coming

across mosquitoes in spite of the fact that he had

to make his way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



through  muddy potholes of water. This is  because

anti-mosquito measures are being actively  carried

out all the time all over Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chua Chu Kang cemetery is one of the many places

constantly  checked  for mosquito  breeding.  This

cemetery is 900 acres in extent. Only part  of  it

is  developed. Lalang and undergrowth are  cleared

at  four-weekly intervals, that is, once a  month.

However,  there may be occasions when rainfall  is

heavier  than usual, and this will cause  them  to

grow   faster  than  normal.  Hence,  the   burial

ceremony  mentioned by the Member for  Anson  must

have taken place near an undeveloped piece of land

and at a time when clearing of lalang was due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can appreciate his very imaginative

description of fighting through waist-high  lalang

and  hacking  through undergrowth, I must  however

accept  it with a pinch of salt. However,' let  me

assure the Member for Anson that instructions have

been given to my officers to see that the paths to

the graves are smooth and clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, graves are not dug six feet

deep.  They  are dug five feet deep, according  to

regulations.  The Superintendent of Cemeteries  is

there to see that this regulation is observed when

the grave diggers do their work. In addition, lime

is added to the fill to prevent smell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we can take it as a fact that public

conveniences for men and women are usually quite a

distance  away from the burial site. I believe  it

could  be  that perhaps someone had to answer  the

call of nature at about the time he was there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, on a point of clarification, if the Minister

will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the graves do actually

give  out  an  odour, especially  those  that  are

freshly  dug and burials done within  one  or  two

weeks. I can substantiate what my good Friend, the

Member for Anson, has said, regarding the odour. I

have been there several times and I know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



that  this is true. I think it is most likely that

this  is due to the condition of the soil in  that

particular area of Chua Chu Kang rather than  what

has been vividly described by the Minister as "the

call  of nature". I think it has something  to  do

with  the soil. I am not an expert, but  it  is  a

fact that some of the graves do smell.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been my

unfortunate experience during the last few  months

to  have  to attend quite a number of funerals.  I

have  always thought that I have a sensitive nose,

but I have not come across the smell that has been

described.  It could be that others  have  a  more

sensitive nose than I and the explanation given by

the  Member for Punggol is probably true.  I  have

asked  my  officers  but they cannot  confirm  it.

However,  it  is possible that since the  soil  is

loose   after  a  grave  is  dug,  the  smell   of

decomposition might seep through the soil. But  it

takes  a really keen nose to sense it. Anyway,  if

this  is  so,  we will make further investigations

and  may insist on a deeper burial in the case  of

soil of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered

the  point about lalang. As soon as lalang is cut,

it  grows again after two or three days.  To  stop

it, lalang must be uprooted and not cut, otherwise

it grows again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the smell, the explanation is this. The

lalang  is about six feet high. The grave  diggers

can  only dig three or four feet deep because  the

lalang  is very high. The grave is also  not  deep

and,  therefore,  the smell comes  out.  The  main

fault  is the lalang. The Minister should go there

and then only will he know what is going on. I  am

saying  that this is a fact. If the Minister  goes

to  that place he will then know it. It is a  long

distance away, and perhaps the Minister is  unable

to go there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>An hon Member:</B> He has no time.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> The Minister has no time. But everybody must go

there.  One  day he must go there too,  if  he  is

free. According to Hindu custom,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



the  Indians  cremate their  dead.  But  now,  our

Government  has  adopted  the  use  of   gas   for

cremation.  The  Buddhists and Christians  usually

bury  their  dead. Even among the  Hindus  too,  a

certain  group  does  not cremate  those  who  die

young. They are buried. All these matters must  be

considered.  The main thing is that I  am  telling

this  House  that the problem of  lalang  is  very

important.  Once  the lalang  is  fully  uprooted,

everything  will be all right, the  soil  will  be

very  clean. Anyway, Sir, I beg leave to  withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead RCA 8101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise two questions under this

subhead. The Hawkers Department has spent a  great

deal  of  money  on  the  construction  of  hawker

centres  to  accommodate the hawkers  in  sanitary

conditions for them to do their business,  instead

of  in  the  open  where they are exposed  to  the

elements.  The policy is good. But the design  and

construction  of hawker centres, particularly  the

quality of materials, are open to question, and  I

doubt  whether such an objective can be  achieved.

For  example, in my constituency one hawker centre

was  built  with very old building  materials.  In

other words, old materials have been used for  the

construction of a new hawker centre. As a  result,

there  are holes in the roofs and gutters and  the

pillars are very shaky. When it rains, water pours

down   through   openings   in   the   roof,   and

consequently the whole hawker centre is flooded on

rainy  days. On a sunny day the stalls  along  the

sides  of the hawker centre are completely exposed

to  the  sun. They cannot do business in the  sun.

When the hawkers want to put up tarpaulin, they do

not get the permission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the design of the stalls in the hawker

centres,  I  find that the size and space  of  the

stalls  are  becoming smaller  and  smaller.  They

cannot meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



the  requirements of the hawkers. If  the  hawkers

want  a larger wash basin or a wash tub, there  is

not enough space. So most hawkers prefer to have a

clear  empty space for a pitch than a  stall  with

all   sorts   of  amenities  that  restrict   free

movement. What I am trying to say is that if it is

the intention of the Government to help hawkers by

spending  so  much money on them  then  we  should

build   some  decent  hawker  centres  which   are

practical  and  will meet their requirements.  The

hawkers  will  then be grateful to the  Government

for putting up a very fine hawker centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister some questions concerning the Corporation

Drive  Hawker Centre I that was newly  constructed

in Jurong. When will repair and renovation be made

to  this  hawker centre? When will the leaky  roof

and  gutters be changed or repaired? I would  also

like  to ask the Minister whether a proper  awning

will  be put up on one side of this hawker  centre

so  as  to  provide shade for the stalls from  the

sun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two years ago a lot of licences were

issued  to  hawkers, that is to say, hawkers  were

put  under control by licensing. Once licences are

issued,  hawkers have to pay a licence  fee.  Pork

sellers   have  to  pay  $30  per  month,  payable

quarterly at $90 per quarter. For other  types  of

stalls,   the  fee  is  $10  per  month,   payable

quarterly.  The licensed hawkers who  ply  on  the

roadside  also have to pay a licence fee but  they

do  not  enjoy  all the privileges that  they  are

supposed  to have. For instance, they do not  have

water  supply.  Sir,  hawkers  require  water  for

cleaning and washing and to keep the place  clean.

This  is  a  reasonable  request  that  should  be

granted.  I fail to see why the Hawkers Department

has  refused to grant this reasonable request  for

water  supply. I, therefore, ask the  Minister  to

explain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Jurong has raised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



a  few  questions in regard to hawker centres,  in

particular to Taman Jurong Market I. His criticism

is  that  the design and the construction  of  the

particular centre is far from ideal. I am sure  he

with  agree  with me that human beings are  always

making  progress  and are therefore  always  faced

with  problems,  many of which have  no  solution.

That  is  to  say, human beings live  in  changing

circumstances.  So we may have taken  a  different

view  of  a  certain matter after  a  while.  This

particular market extension may be far from  ideal

because  it  was  one  of  the  first  few  to  be

constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jurong there are two markets, viz. Taman

Jurong  Market I and Market II. Between  the  two,

there is a lot of difference both in design and in

construction. The second one was built  completely

on  the basis of a new design. The first one  that

the  Member  referred to was actually a conversion

of  the  existing cooked food section. So  in  the

process  of  conversion, some old materials  might

have  been used. That is admitted. As regards roof

leaks, we have already notified the contractors to

take  the  necessary  action  for  repairs  to  be

effected or improvements to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to answer another point

that  the  Member  has raised. He  says  that  the

facilities   in  some  hawker  centres   are   not

suitable. Most of the hawker centres are meant for

cooked  food and there is a great variety of  food

stalls,  some selling drinks, some selling  cooked

food.  Different  types  of  food  stalls  require

different facilities. But in the planning of  such

facilities, we can only provide facilities to meet

the  general  requirements of  hawkers,  based  on

certain broad principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's complaint that the stall

is  too  small, I cannot see eye to eye with  him.

Changes  and  improvements are made from  time  to

time, and we find that the stall's dimensions  are

becoming  bigger  and  bigger.  For  example,  the

original  stall  measured 6 feet by  4  feet.  The

improved type is

9 feet by 7 feet which is very much bigger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government subsidises hawker centres

very  heavily. The licence fee for a  cooked  food

stall  is  only  $50 and yet  we  hear  a  lot  of

complaints and grumbles. On the other hand hawkers

who  are  not  licensed have to pay through  their

nose  for  a  very small lousy stall in  a  coffee

shop.  This stall measures only 3 feet by  4  feet

and  the  rent ranges from $100 to $300! $400  per

month.  Not only that, such stallholders in coffee

shops are subject to a lot of restrictions imposed

by  the  coffee shop owners. Quite often they  are

asked  to  quit.  But  in the case  of  Government

controlled hawker stalls, the hawkers have  a  lot

of complaints to make. If they really have so many

complaints  and grumbles, the best  advice  I  can

give  is  that they should get their  own  private

stalls   which   can   meet   their   own    ideal

requirements. This is my own personal view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards leaky roofs and hawker stalls

exposed  to  the  sun and the  elements,  we  have

several times consulted the architects responsible

for  the  design,  and a lot of  improvements  and

changes  have  since  been made.  In  cooked  food

hawker centres, there is a lot of smoke when  food

is  being  cooked.  In  a  tropical  country  like

Singapore, if the roof is completely covered  then

ventilation can be very poor and the whole  hawker

centre  will be so stuffy and hot, and it will  be

very   uncomfortable.  Then  there  will  be  more

complaints  again.  There must  be  provision  for

suitable   ventilation  and  therefore   we   have

provided  openings and holes at the sides  of  the

roofs.  So, a little bit of splash on a rainy  day

is  quite  inevitable, because the hawker  centres

are  not  completely covered and  sealed.  In  the

mornings  and afternoons when the sun  is  shining

obliquely, a certain portion of the hawker  centre

is  exposed  to  the sun. This  is  perfectly  all

right.  I  am  sure  we  cannot  have  a  complete

perfectly  designed  hawker  centre  to  meet  the

ideals of everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards hawkers whose requests have not

been  met,  I would like to say that generally  we

accommodate  their requests as far as we  possibly

can. In regard to water supply, the PUB is in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



charge, and it is not a matter for the Ministry of

the  Environment to handle alone. So we must  have

consultations to come to an arrangement with other

relevant departments or ministries. But, generally

speaking, whatever it is I am sure Members of this

House  will  agree with me that,  according  to  a

Chinese  saying, it is difficult  to  establish  a

business   from  scratch  but  it  is  even   more

difficult  to maintain it. This is a problem  that

everybody, including a government, has to face. As

the  saying goes, good advice is unpleasant to the

ear, so is good medicine bitter to the tongue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to say to the Members who

have   spoken,  that  although  they   have   made

criticisms,   some   of  them   are   constructive

suggestions with good intentions, and I would like

to thank them for all that has been said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary

for  saying  so much on how one should  behave  in

life  and  about life in general. But he  has  not

directly answered the points that I have raised. I

know  that the Parliamentary Secretary is good  in

tai-chi.  He  has admitted in his reply  that  the

particular  hawker centre that I referred  to  was

built  with  old materials, which resulted  in  so

many problems. So my question is: since it is  the

intention  of  the Government to  look  after  the

welfare  of  hawkers, why did they not  adopt  the

improved  design  and use new materials?  If  they

feel  that  a fully covered roof results  in  poor

ventilation, then they could have planned a higher

roof for the hawker centre. Why must they keep the

roof to a very low level? This is the crux of  the

problem. My question is: when will repairs be made

to  this  particular hawker centre? And no  answer

has been given yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I raised, Sir, refers to the

supply  of  water,  which is  the  basic  facility

required by hawkers. They may not ask for anything

else.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



They  pay  a monthly licence fee and all they  ask

for   is  some  water.  The  Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary  says  it is because of the  problem  of

management, etc. Those are minor  problems  which

can  be  easily solved. If there is any particular

problem  about management, I can help him to  make

arrangements to ensure that there is no wastage of

water  by any hawker. Therefore, I would  like  to

ask him again whether arrangements can be made for

water  to be supplied to licensed hawkers  on  the

streets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think the best is for me to arrange a date

with  the  Member  for Jurong for  an  on-the-spot

check  to  see how the problem can be  solved.  If

that   is  agreeable,  I  believe  he  should   be

satisfied?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's

invitation. For the moment, because of the time

factor, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $78,021,070 for Head P ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004(The same

amendment also stood in the same names of Messr Eng Siong

and Govindaswamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subhead I would like to raise the

point  about the need for a clearer definition  of

our  cultural  policy. This would  be  useful  for

various  sectors involved in cultural activity  to

orientate themselves towards. Such sectors are the

Ministry of Education, voluntary cultural  bodies,

teachers of the arts, institutions like the  Music

Department  of  the University of  Singapore,  the

People's  Association, the National Theatre,  RTS,

and even the Ministry of Culture itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural development seems to me to occupy a

rather  uncertain place in the general pattern  of

Singapore's  development  plans.  And   yet   such

development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



is  so  important for nation-building  and  giving

people a sense of community and solidarity. Here I

take  cultural development to mean development  of

the  means  and  facilities providing  access  and

participation  in relation to culture.  Presently,

what  are the rather blurred lines of policy  that

can be discerned especially according to budgetary

allocation for cultural development. We find  that

there   is  good  support  for  broadcasting   and

publicity. The rationale here is evident for  this

relates  to  communication between the  government

and  the  people.  But other  sectors  within  the

portfolio of the Ministry of Culture do not  seem,

at  least  to  me,  Sir, to be receiving  adequate

attention  in  terms  of financial  support.  Good

support  for  art, for example, had to  await  the

generosity  and  the initiative of  the  Singapore

Arts    Council.   Contributions    to    cultural

organisations   have  gone  down   suddenly   from

$110,000   to  $20,000.  In  respect  of  cultural

cooperation  even expenses related  to  the  ASEAN

Permanent  Committee on socio-cultural  activities

have been pruned slightly from $20,000 to $15,000.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of rather indifferent attention

to  aspects related to cultural development is the

question  of the low grading for the post  of  the

Director  of  the National Museum  and  inadequate

support  for  the work of the Museum  although  it

should  be  seen as a repository of  the  nation's

cultural heritage, as a fine centre of display  to

interpret effectively to the community the meaning

of  our heritage, and as a centre of activities of

a cultural, educational and recreational nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another line we can discern is that we subscribe

to the notion that culture is not for the elite as

judged from our activities like music and art  for

everyone, concert for the young people,  and  also

from  the  activities of the People's Association.

Yet  after saying these things we could still  ask

what other projections, what plans for development

do  we have, what attempts are we going to make to

bring  our  cultural tradition up to date  and  in

harmony with our needs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



aspirations Static culture is dead culture but  we

are very much alive as a people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any kind of vigorous development in the

cultural  field, money is required. To  make  rich

contributions to our culture, I am not speaking in

terms  of  money  here,  we  cannot  rely  on  the

development of amateur talent, as we have  in  the

past. We must work towards having an adequate core

of  professional artistes especially for music and

dance, and regular and organised effort has to  be

planned  for  the encouragement of the development

of talent for drama, writing and song.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any attempt at projection one has to know

clearly  what  we have at present. Indeed,  it  is

possible  to select cultural indicators and  study

them  and  make an essay of what we have presently

and  what  we  could do to improve the  situation.

These cultural indicators, apart from relating  to

the  number of books in libraries, the  number  of

radio  and television sets there are, can also  be

represented  by  percentages  of  the   population

taking  part  in cultural activities,  numbers  of

students of the arts, the proportion of the budget

allocated  to  culture and the proportion  of  the

cultural budget allocated to different aspects  of

culture,  and  so on. Culture is so  important  to

national  development that it is about  time  that

systematic modes of examination are applied to our

cultural  situation for the purposes of projection

of plans for cultural development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I endorse the views expressed by the Member

for   Katong.  The  Ministry  of  Culture  is  the

Government's agency responsible for the  promotion

of   the   arts   and  cultural  activities.   The

responsibilities  are very  great  indeed.  It  is

charged with the role of raising the level of arts

and culture, inculcation of patriotism and nation-building.  It  is  also responsible  for  bringing

about  a colourful cultural life to Singapore,  to

enrich    the   material   life   and    spiritual

requirements  of  our  people.  These   are   very

significant and heavy responsibilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much has the Ministry of Culture achieved?

Over  the  past few years the Ministry of  Culture

has  made  certain  efforts in  the  promotion  of

healthy  cultural activities. "Music for Everyone"

and  "Art  for  Everyone" are  examples  of  their

achievement. In regard to the programmes  of  RTS,

undoubtedly    there    has   been    considerable

achievement  and improvement over  the  years.  We

have  very wholesome programmes from time to time,

like  "Youth  Magazine", "Life in  Singapore"  and

various  forums and programmes for  children,  and

also  the cartoons. All these programmes are of  a

recreational  and  educational  nature.  But   the

frequency  of  such programmes is wanting,  and  I

suggest  that more programmes of this type  should

be broadcast and televised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next complaint is that locally produced

programmes are few and far between. Most  of  what

we  have  are  imported. Why should  this  be  so?

Perhaps  the Minister will say that it is  because

we  do not have sufficient local talent, and so it

is  not  possible for us to have an  abundance  of

locally produced programmes. If that is the  case,

I  would  say  that  it is not  a  very  difficult

problem  to  solve. The question  is  whether  the

Minister  has  taken positive measure  to  promote

local  talents. I am referring to the planning  of

local  TV productions. If there is a comprehensive

plan,  then  we  can systematically develop  local

talent in this direction and thereafter there will

be  no  lack  of such talent. I hope the  Minister

will,  in the coming year, take positive steps  to

promote the development of local talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often we hear the Minister stressing the

need  for healthy cultural activities and the need

to  inculcate  cultural  consciousness  so  as  to

enrich  the  life of the people.  These  are  very

correct and proper objectives, but what is said is

one thing. More important is whether such policies

are  implemented. It is only when action is  taken

that  we can have results. So I would like to  ask

the Minister these questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the Minister any concrete



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



plans  in  the  coming year for the  promotion  of

healthy cultural activities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At the moment there are quite a lot of comics

and picture books flooding the market and roadside

stalls.  I  notice  that  such  picture  books  of

fantastic  stories  of  demons  and  fairies   are

displayed for sale everywhere in Singapore.  These

take  up  a  lot  of  time of  our  young  people,

particularly those in the primary schools. Instead

of  learning their lessons, they spend their  time

reading  such fantastic stories and picture  books

which  have very adverse effects on them.  So  the

Department concerned should take immediate  action

to   ban  these  undesirable  picture  books   and

publications  so  that our children  will  not  be

exposed to the "poison".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On the question of the establishment of the

National  Symphony  Orchestra, I  remember  having

raised  this  matter last year. At that  time  the

answer  I got was that the idea was good and  that

it  would  receive proper consideration. One  year

has  passed, and I wonder whether the Minister has

made any progress in regard to the proposal to set

up  a National Symphony Orchestra. I feel that the

existence  of  a National Symphony Orchestra  will

add  to the prestige of Singapore. That would mean

that  we  would be able to develop a lot of  local

musical talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Over the past two years our cultural missions

to  Australia,  Russia  and  Indonesia  were  very

warmly  welcomed. The performances of our cultural

missions  overseas had helped the people there  to

understand us better. Cultural exchanges were also

promoted at the same time. I would therefore  like

to  ask whether there are any such plans this year

to  send more cultural missions overseas.  I  feel

that  such  missions  are  valuable  because  they

promote    better   understanding   and    greater

friendship  between Singapore  and  the  countries

visited.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, as we have been talking

so much about Singapore culture in the past, may I

know  how  much has the promotion of this  culture

achieved?   Often,  we  find  that  the   cultural

activities  of  certain  groups  have  been  given

lesser importance or even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



neglected in the multi-cultural shows. Why is this

so?  We  cannot  permit  such  things  to  go  on,

otherwise  we  will be going back  to  square  one

where  each group would be looking after  its  own

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of the various cultures was

strongly emphasised by the Culture Ministry in the

past. May I know what has happened to this policy?

Some time ago, the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for  Culture led a  cultural  troupe  to

foreign  countries  to exhibit  a  sample  of  our

culture  there. What has happened to this  troupe?

We do not seem to hear much of it now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the PAP took office in 1959, there

were  cultural  shows  organised  by  the  Culture

Ministry under the name of Aneka Ragam at  various

places. These shows were well patronised.  I  have

raised  this  matter at the last  Budget  sitting.

Nowadays  the  different types of  cultural  shows

that  we have do not attract a big crowd.  Why  is

this  so? There must be something wrong somewhere.

Probably  the  people are not  keen  to  view  the

present types of performances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what plans are being drawn up to promote

Singapore culture among our people, and how are we

going  to get our people interested in local  arts

as much as the Aneka Ragam shows?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to raise is this:

how  effective is the Singapore Arts  Council?  So

far  what has the Council done to promote arts  in

the  Republic?  May we get some information  about

the Singapore Arts Council?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also know what is the National Theatre

Trust doing to ensure that the National Theatre is

fully  utilised?  What  is  the  profit  that  the

National Theatre Trust has made in respect of  the

utilisation  of  its facilities  during  the  last

three years?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few years back the Cultural Centre at

Canning Rise was a popular centre for a number  of

variety  shows. Now we do not hear anything  about

this  Cultural  Centre. What has happened?  Is  it

still  a  hall for cultural activities, or  is  it

being converted for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



some  other use'? Or is it haunted that the people

do  not  wish to use this place? Can the  Minister

explain?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I know how many of our local instructors of

the  cultural  art have gone abroad to  learn  the

tricks of the trade so that upon their return they

can  improve the standard of our local  talent?  I

wonder whether the Minister will support this move

to   send  such  instructors  abroad  for  further

training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Katong seems to

have  taken a very mercenary view on culture.  His

argument is that if you spend so much money  on  a

certain  thing  you will get better  things  done.

Therefore, it leads him to believe that if you cut

the  money for this item on culture, then you will

get less returns in terms of cultural performance.

Unfortunately,  this is not so in  the  matter  of

culture.  The same argument leads him  to  believe

that  if  you place a person in the grade of  `A'.

`B'  or  `C', then you will get better performance

out  of  him.  I  think this again  is  not  true.

Perhaps we should leave this matter to the PSC  to

decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that cultural matters cannot be

measured by the yardstick of materialism. I  think

it  is  rather difficult to define cultural policy

to  the satisfaction of all sections of the people

in  our multi-racial society. What is regarded  as

good and refined culture by one sector may not  be

so by another. I do wish that cultural performance

of  a  society can be quantified and a measurement

found  to  indicate the number of units or  output

that culture can provide. Then it will be easy for

everybody.  It will be easy for us  to  apply  for

subsidies or more funds on the basis of the number

of  units produced, or we may impose certain  cuts

as    penalties    for    under-production.    But

unfortunately,  again cultural performance  cannot

be measured in the same way as we measure economic

performance  by  the  number of  jobs  created  or

comparing the GNP figures with other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only say that there are two important

aspects of our cultural policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



Firstly,  we  aim  to  preserve  and  develop  our

cultural heritage derived from the main streams of

the    Malay,    Chinese,   Tamil   and    Western

civilisations   towards   a   national    cultural

identity.  Secondly, we aim  to  raise  a  general

cultural  level  of our people  by  allowing  easy

access to sources of culture and education as well

as  through  promotion of aesthetic  creation  and

appreciation,  particularly among our  young.  The

evolution of a distinctive Singapore culture is  a

continuing  and  long process. How  long  it  will

take,  nobody  knows.  It may  take  a  life-time.

Nevertheless, there has been some success  in  the

cross-fertilisation of the four streams of culture

in  the last decade. This is made possible by  the

effective  use  of  the  radio,  television,   the

printing word and the mass media. As a result,  we

know  more about each other's culture. There is  a

common  sense  of destiny and identity  among  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy, therefore, is to encourage a

harmonious development of the various cultures  of

the  Republic. But in the transitional period,  it

is  necessary to raise the general cultural  level

of  our  people.  And to do this we  are  actively

promoting   cultural   activities   and   artistic

pursuits among our people, particularly the young.

Our  young  people are given free  access  to  all

forms of cultural activities, although there are a

number   of   Acts  to  protect  them   from   the

demoralising  effects  of  undesirable  forms   of

subculture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various cultural activities organised by my

Ministry and its various departments are aimed  at

inculcating  in the young a love and  appreciation

of  good  music, the fine arts and  the  aesthetic

things  in  life.  Art  and  music  are  literally

brought to the masses free or at a nominal rate so

that  cultural development could take place  on  a

national scale. As a result, there is definitely a

growing  appreciation of good music and  the  fine

arts  among our people. It is now possible for  my

Ministry  to give more active support to  original

literary and artistic productions. Our young



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



people   especially   will   be   encouraged    to

participate in these creative activities, not only

because  they  constitute more than  half  of  our

population  but  they are also more  malleable  to

change and instruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the role of culture and education as

constant  companion  in the process  of  life-long

education.  Culture  is not  just  something  that

happens. We have to educate or prepare the  people

for  it.  The Ministry of Education has helped  to

promote   aesthetic  creation   and   appreciation

through   aesthetic  education.   Similarly,   our

National  Library, besides providing the essential

reading services, has played an important role  in

raising the literary and cultural standards of our

young  people through exhibitions, concerts,  film

shows,  lectures and demonstrations. The  National

Museum and educational institutions in itself also

implement   various   cultural   and   educational

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that the funds allocated to

the  National Library and the National Museum have

all  the  time  been  on  the  increase.  For  the

National Library, the total provision in the  Main

Estimates has increased from $2.6 million  in  the

last  financial  year  to  $3.1  million  for  the

current  financial  year.  This  will  be  further

increased  to  $3.6 million in the next  financial

year.  Even provision in the Development Estimates

for  the  National Library will be increased  from

about  $0.6  million  to  $1.8  million.  For  the

National   Museum,  the  provision  in  the   Main

Estimates was increased from $2l0,000 to  $360,000

for  the current financial year. It will again  be

increased  to  $420,000 in  the  coming  financial

year.  Everyone agrees that more money  should  be

spent  on cultural development, but then the  same

applies   to   every  other  department   in   the

Government.  In  these days of  inflation,  it  is

necessary  to economise and there is no  exception

in the matter of culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants us to have more

locally  produced television programmes.  I  think

some  other  Members will be raising  this  matter

later  on  and I prefer to deal with it  when  the

time comes. But at the moment I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



have  this to say. We would like to have  as  many

locally produced programmes as possible but it  is

not possible in view of the cost of production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also worried about the comics in

the  five-foot-way stalls which the  children  are

reading.  I  do agree with him that it is  harmful

for  children to read such material, particularly

when  the comics are unhealthy in content. I would

like  to  assure the Member that the  Publications

Section  of the Ministry of Culture keeps  a  very

strict check on the import of comics. All imported

comics  must  be  declared at the various  Customs

check-points  and  have  to  be  approved  by  the

Publications Section before they can be  released.

The Section exercises very strict control on this,

but unfortunately there is always the question  of

smuggling.  I  understand that  these  undesirable

comics  have been smuggled in by bookshops through

devious  means. We would, of course, keep a  check

on this by conducting periodical surprise raids on

the bookshops, and if Members have any information

they are always welcome to pass the information to

me.  I would like to assure him that we are taking

all  possible steps to prevent them from appearing

in the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the National Symphony Orchestra, he

has raised this question many times - almost every

year. I must thank him for reminding me. We  hive

no  plans  yet  to  set up  a  National  Symphony

Orchestra. An ad hoc advisory committee comprising

several  knowledgeable persons in the music  field

was formed to advise, the Ministry on this matter.

They have put forward two proposals to my Ministry

and  also  to the Ministry of Finance.  The  first

proposal  was  a  very modest  39-piece  orchestra

which  would  require slightly  over  $1  million.

Under the second proposal the scale was reduced to

a   20-piece  string  orchestra  and  the  annual

maintenance  cost was correspondingly  reduced  by

half.  Yet  it  would still cost  half  a  million

dollars a year to maintain it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have considered both proposals and we have

decided that the cost is too prohibitive. In  this

time of inflation and recession it is not easy  to

convince  the relevant Ministry of the  intangible

benefit of having a national orchestra. Apart from

the   financial  aspect  there  are   also   other

problems,  such  as recruitment of key  musicians,

training  of  local musicians and  maintenance  of

public  interest, which require careful study.  So

we  have  decided  to keep the whole  proposal  in

view.  But I promise the Member that we are  still

keeping this proposal in mind, and in case we have

a  windfall  from somewhere and if the  public  is

ready   for  such  an  orchestra,  then  we  would

reconsider it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no plans to send the national dance

troupe  to foreign countries this year because  we

have decided that the money could well be spent in

Singapore itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Anson on the question

of Aneka Ragam shows which had been discontinued a

very long time ago. I think it is not advisable to

revive  it.  He  asked  why very  few  people  are

interested  in our cultural shows. The reason  may

well  be  that they are enjoying TV programmes  in

their  own homes. They may not be interested'  any

more  in  the open air Aneka Ragam shows.  Members

must  remember  that  Aneka Ragam  was  introduced

before  1961 when we did not have television.  The

Aneka Ragam show , was then the only form of  free

entertainment  for the people and,  therefore,  it

enjoyed popular support. But now since TV has been

brought to their homes or in the community centres

where  they  can enjoy good television programmes,

there is no reason why they should go to very  far

away places to watch the Aneka Ragam shows. .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Singapore Arts Council, the original objective was to establish an Art

Gallery   and  an  Academy  of  Arts  to  promote,

encourage and advance cultural activities. Towards

this end, about $1.1 million was raised. Obviously

this amount was not enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



for  such proposals, and it was decided to utilise

the  money to build an Art Gallery in the National

Museum.  After  that, the Singapore  Arts  Council

will again utilise the remaining fund to establish

a  Fine  Arts Library in the National Museum.  The

Singapore  Arts  Council has also given  financial

support  to various cultural bodies. For instance,

in  the  last  two years it had sent  one  or  two

cultural  troupes  to  Hong  Kong.  It  has   also

supported the Singapore Youth Orchestra, piano and

vocal  recitals and other performances. They  have

supported all these activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre is also doing its best to

promote cultural activities. The average occupancy

rate  of the National Theatre is about 15  days  a

month. The National Theatre Trust has been staging

shows  from  overseas  in order  to  increase  the

occupancy  rate. These shows not  only  helped  to

foster  a closer understanding between the  people

of  Singapore and other countries but are  also  a

source of revenue for the Trust. I must point  out

that  with  a very large stage and with a  seating

capacity   of  over  3,000  people,  the  National

Theatre can only be used by large troupes which do

not  require good acoustics. However, the National

Theatre. Trust will continue to strive for optimum

utilisation of the Theatre by various  means.  The

financial  position of the National Theatre  Trust

has  improved steadily during the last two  years.

The  Trust  incurred a deficit of $19,000  in  the

financial year 1970-71. But there was a surplus of

$37,000  in the financial year 1971-72. This  was

further  increased to $140,000  in  the  financial

year 1973-74.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cultural Centre at Canning Rise does not come

under my Ministry. It comes under the jurisdiction

of the Adult Education Board, which is a statutory

body.  I  can  assure the Member that  it  is  not

haunted.  I see that many drama groups  are  still

using  that place to stage their plays and so  on.

However,  because  of  the  very  limited  seating

capacity - it can only accommodate about 200 or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



300   persons  -  it  is,  therefore,  not   being

patronised  by  other groups which want  to  stage

shows for commercial returns.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I asked the Minister what plans he had for

the  future  development  of  cultural  policy  in

Singapore.  In  his answer, what he  was  definite

about  was  that there are no plans, for  example,

for  the  development of a symphony orchestra.  He

did  give a catalogue of the achievements and  the

present arrangements for cultural development,  in

respect  of  which we are gratified  to  see  that

there is a lot of activity going on which we  know

about. But as I have said, in the beginning of  my

address, the whole point about cultural policy  is

vague. The Minister referred to the possibility of

quantification. In December the Minister  attended

a  meeting in Indonesia in which discussions  were

carried   on   about  cultural  policy   and   the

development of the arts and culture in the region.

There   were   papers  which   referred   to   the

possibility  of  the  quantification  of  data  in

relation  to  cultural  development.  There   were

instruments which were used in places like  Soviet

Russia  and  Japan  and  they  were  thinking   of

introducing these instruments in Indonesia. So  it

is obvious that there are possibilities of finding

out  how  many people attend the dramas, how  many

people  attend  the  cultural presentations,  what

sort  of  budget there is, and what proportion  of

the total budget this represents. On the basis  of

such examination we can quantify and make plans to

see  whether in five years' time we are  one  step

ahead  or one step backwards. I do not agree  with

the Minister when he says that quantification is a

bit  dicey  because  whatever instruments  we  are

given,  even  if they are crude, are still  better

than nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister made references to me being

mercenary. I say to you, Mr Speaker. Sir, that the

Minister  knows me better than to say that.  If  I

say that our artistes should have a due return for

their  contributions, then am  I  mercenary?  Even

when  I want the artistes to have at least a  good

life   and   to  be  encouraged  to   make   their

contributions?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



We  believe  that  nothing is  for  free,  except

apparently in the cultural sphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of his reference to the Head of the

National  Museum  (I am not making  much  play  of

that),  he says it is not so much what we pay  him

as  his  contribution that is  important.  On  the

basis  of  that argument, we can go to  every  top

civil  servant  and pat him on the back  and  say,

"You know, it is not so much what we give you  but

your  contribution that is important. So why don't

you  come  down from Grade E to G?"  or  something

like  that.  So  I  do not think his  argument  is

necessarily one that holds water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of quality, maybe that is something

that we cannot measure. But, as I have said, if we

want quality, then I am afraid we have got to  pay

for  it.  History shows that where there has  been

patronage   of  the  arts,  there   has   been   a

flourishing  of  the  arts. If  you  withdraw  the

patronage, then the arts go down. If the  Minister

does  not  want to say anything, I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be

reduced by $10 in respect of subheadBAA 1109*



(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr N. Govindasamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it proper to raise a matter about the

newspapers  in  this House? I want a clarification

about   newspapers   publishing   photographs   of

incidents  such  as  a  robbery,  and  the   names

together  with  the photographs of certain  people

are  printed. These people can then be identified,

and later on they can get into trouble. I wish  to

know whether I can speak on that topic here, as  1

am in doubt about that. Anyway I am going to speak

about it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member for Anson quite sure about

speaking on it?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes. There is only one English morning newspaper

available  in town. It has dominated the newspaper

market so much so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



advertisers  have full confidence in  this  daily

paper.  I notice that more than half of the  paper

is  covered  with advertisements.' It  has  become

more  of an advertising paper than a newspaper.  I

firmly believe that this paper - we can, in  fact,

call  it  the "National Paper" -should carry  more

news  than advertisements. And when I speak  about

news,  I must emphasise that I mean news of  local

events.   It   is  agreed  that   we   must   have

advertisements  to  cover  the  rising   cost   of

newsprint.  But nevertheless, to be  fair  to  the

newsreaders,    news   items   should    have    a

proportionate space.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may reply that he has no

control in the setup of the daily paper. But  then

he  can put across his criticism. Sir, I am not  a

journalist, editor Or a newspaper writer. But I do

not  know  how far you will agree with  me.  I  am

speaking  from a layman's point of view. Sometimes

we  find  that  the  newspaper carries  news  With

pictures  which I think may not be appropriate  in

that issue. For instance, Sir, if you can remember

the  robbery and shooting incident at the  Diamond

House  in Tanglin, the newspaper coverage  of  the

incident  included the picture of a hidden  camera

in  the  shop which had recorded the robbery.  But

then  to-date, if I am not mistaken,  One  or  two

people involved in that crime are still at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is this: the next time a crime

is  being  committed, the criminals will look  for

hidden  cameras,  and  thus the  secret  is  lost.

Again,  pictures of men and women  who  had  given

information  to  the  police  or  foiled  criminal

activities had been published. This heroic gesture

may  appear  good for publicity, but is  it  worth

while?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that information by way of

photograph should be kept confidential.  Otherwise

the  aides  of  criminals may be hunting  for  the

informers  and  harm them. But, conversely,  cases

where   much   publicity  is  needed   have   been

neglected. This is because this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



daily  paper has a monopoly and it can do whatever

it likes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of cost, even if the paper were to

increase  its  price,  as it had  done  previously

because  of  the increased cost of newsprint,  the

public had no choice but to pay whatever price was

fixed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received complaints from local soccer

players that coverage of local soccer games  seems

to  have  been  neglected. We seem  to  have  more

publicity  on  foreign teams in the newpaper  than

local teams. Why is this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without publicity in the press, I believe that

there  is  nothing much that we can do to  promote

whatever  we have in mind. Therefore, I  urge  the

newspapers  to  give  greater  coverage  of  local

events.  I  say  this because, as everyone  knows,

there  is a soccer fever now in town. We  can  see

that   our   one-time  `White  Elephant   National

Stadium'  has all of a sudden become  a  place  of

prominence. Why is this so? it is because  of  the

publicity that has been given to the soccer  games

between  our national team and the Malaysian  team

that  attracted  the  crowd.  Otherwise  not  many

people  would  witness the games as was  the  case

sometime ago. Furthermore, with publicity we  find

that  our players are encouraged to perform  their

best, and that is why our national soccer team has

an  unbeaten  record of the support  of  the  home

crowd at the National Stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge that the soccer section of the

Press  should  give more publicity  to  our  local

teams  for the purpose of encouragement,  so  that

our   soccer  players  cannot  comment  that   the

coverage is biased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, posters of Members of Parliament

are normally issued after an election. But only  a

limited number of these posters are available. Why

is   there  such  a  terrible  shortage  of  these

posters?  Furthermore, there could be considerable

changes of MPs between one election and the  next.

Could  not  more posters be printed and circulated

more liberally to all departments and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



units  as  and when changes take place'?  In  this

way,  the people will get to know their MPs better

and be informed of the position they are holding m

the various ministries and departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, Sir, these posters should be issued

to  the  community centres because there had  been

cases  of  people  from  the other  constituencies

coming  to see me. When I asked them to see  their

own MPs, they said that they do not know who their

MPs are. It is most probable that one poster costs

$4,  so  if  an extra 100 posters are printed,  it

will cost only $400. As the Ministry of Culture is

spending millions and millions of dollars, I think

it  is  proper for them to distribute such posters

to  the various departments, community centres and

at  other appropriate places. I am not asking  for

the posters to be put up by the roadside. That  is

very bad.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, until recently, all these years

the  Ministry  of  Culture printed  well-presented

calendars for distribution to members of statutory

boards,  the  Citizens'  Consultative  Committees,

management   committees  and   other   civic   and

community leaders who served the Government in one

way   or   another.  These  calendars  were   also

despatched  to  our  foreign  missions   and   our

missions  were  able to distribute them  to  other

friendly  missions and friends  who  would  be  of

service  to our Republic. The calendars were  also

used in our Government offices and rooms of senior

civil  servants  who  had to use  a  calendar  for

various  reasons.  But this year  these  calendars

were not printed. As a result, the annual gift  to

friends and well-wishers has been discontinued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amount of goodwill lost cannot be

equated  to  the  amount of  money  saved  by  not

printing  these  calendars. Today  when  we  visit

Government offices and statutory boards,  we  find

all  sorts  of  calendars displayed  in  prominent

places. Some of these are pleasing to the eve, but

others  are  downright out of place,  to  say  the

least. Sir, if the cost of printing calendars  has

gone up, we could have reduced its size. We could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



also have it printed on not-so-glossy a paper, and

other  means could have been found to  reduce  the

cost.  There  is no good reason to  completely  do

away with the printing of these calendars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also note that this year the Other

Operating  Expenditure in respect of the Publicity

Division,   subhead   BAA   2220,   $306,000    is

appropriated  for  production of publications  and

diaries for sale. Is the Ministry of Culture going

into  publication of diaries for sale when it  has

no money even to print calendars?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has raised a question

to  which he himself has already replied, that is,

we  have no control over the press, and he knew it

very well. But strangely enough, many people still

believe that we in the Ministry of Culture do have

overall  power to control the press.  May  I  take

this  opportunity to say that this  is  definitely

not so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think what the Member has raised has

some  truth  in it, especially the statement  that

the  standard  of our newspaper has gone  down.  I

agree with him that the purpose of a newspaper  is

to  carry  news  and  that advertisements  in  the

newspapers  should not be of such a proportion  as

to  exceed  the news coverage. But I  presume  the

advertisements help to defray the increasing  cost

of  producing a newspaper, and especially in times

of  rising cost of newsprint. If we want  to  keep

the  price of the newspaper down, we have to  bear

with the very boring advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the Ministry of Culture is only a

permit issuing authority for the newspapers and we

have  no control over them. We have no say  as  to

what   should  or  should  not  be  put   in   the

newspapers.  If  the  newspapers  print  too  many

advertisements out of proportion to news  articles

and yet people still want to buy and read it, then

good luck to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's comment on the photographs

and headlines in the newspapers, I am sure he will

agree that this comment should be addressed to the

editor of the newspaper concerned. But may  I  add

this? Many of the points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



mentioned  by him depend on the taste, perception,

educational  background  and  experience  of   the

editors  and  journalists. But  unfortunately  the

newspapers  seem  to have lost many  of  the  good

talented  journalists, and good  replacements  are

not in sight in the foreseeable future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, journalists were trained in the

very hard and tedious way. They were recruited but

not  put to work immediately; they were called cub

reporters. They were sent to the courts  to  learn

about  court  proceedings and the process  of  the

law,  and so on. Slowly they worked their  way  up

and  then finally became editors. But this is  not

so  today. The newspapers recruit people from  the

university,   and   they  seem   to   have   great

expectations over what work they should be  doing.

After a short employment if they are sent to cover

very  simple  stories, they become  bored  and  if

there  is  a  good job such as a public  relations

officer in a hotel or a company, they would resign

immediately.  I think that is one of  the  reasons

why we find that the standard of the newspapers is

going  down very gradually. This is not  just  the

case  with the English newspaper. It also  applies

to  the  other  language newspapers,  the  Chinese

newspapers  especially. The  journalists  are  not

doing  their job well. Speeches are not edited  at

all  but  produced  in full. Of course,  many  MPs

benefited  from  this because the  speeches  which

they  wrote  are  faithfully reproduced  the  next

morning.  Whether the public wants to read  it  or

not  does not matter. So long as the speeches  can

fill  up the newspaper, they are happy. They  have

done their job. It is the same with the editors.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very sad state of affairs. But how are

we  going  to  redress it? I think readers  should

demand better newspapers or allow others to form a

company to run a newspaper. Unfortunately again it

is  not on the cards, because it costs quite a lot

of  money  just  to  set up a  company  to  run  a

newspaper. So much for the newspapers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Member for Anson has

mentioned   is   about  posters  of   Members   of

Parliament  including the Speaker  and  Ministers.

These posters are not produced by my Ministry, but

by  Parliament House. In fact, this matter  should

be raised in the House Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. When I asked this

question in the office of Parliament, they said it

should  be addressed to the Publicity Division  of

the Ministry of Culture. Now the Minister says  it

should be addressed to Parliament. Tomorrow  if  I

go  to Parliament Office, again they will say  "It

is  the Publicity Division". This is very bad. The

Culture  Ministry must take action on  this.  They

have  the  Publicity Division. They  arc  spending

more  money,  and therefore they  can  do  it.  He

should not blame it on Parliament House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I am not putting the blame on Parliament

House.  What  I  am  saying is that  we  have  not

printed  these  posters in the  past.  So  if  the

Member wants more, he should ask Parliament  House

because  they printed it. May I also add  this?  I

think  a  Member of Parliament ought to  know  his

constituents and he should get his constituents to

know him, with or without the help of posters.  If

after  having been elected as an MP and  for  some

time   the   people  still  have   difficulty   in

recognising him as an MP, then something is  wrong

somewhere.  The  MP should find  out  the  reasons

himself,  and  not blame Parliament  House  or  my

Ministry  for  the lack of posters.  I  personally

feel that this a source of embarrassment.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. The Minister said

that an MP should know his constituents. I have no

doubts about that. Every five years we go back  to

our  constituents to be elected to this House.  If

we  are  elected  and if they have any  difficulty

they will come and see us. Naturally they want  to

know the MPs. But there might be some constituents

who  do not know the MP for their constituency and

they may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



have  a  reason  to go and see him. Therefore,  we

must have posters of MPs in the community centres.

But  the  Minister is attacking the  MPs.  Do  not

blame  the  MPs.  I  am asking  the  Minister  for

something, and instead he attacks me. This is  not

a proper thing to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, it is not my intention to attack the Member.

What I am saying is that there should be a rapport

between  the MP and his constituents. If he  is  a

good  MP  then every one should know him. He  does

not  have to rely on a piece of paper to  get  his

face  across to the constituents. If he  has  done

work  for them, they should know him. Whether they

have seen his face or not is irrelevant. When  the

time comas for the next election, they will put an

X against his name.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, when people from other constituencies come

and see me, I tell them this: "Go and see

your MP." These people tell me in reply. "But I do

not  know my MP and where to find him." But  these

people  are not from my constituency. I am talking

about   people  from  other  constituencies.   The

Minister  should not attack me and say that  I  do

not know my constituents. I know them very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I am not saying that the Member for Anson does not

know  his  constituents or that they do  not  know

him.  When people from other constituencies go  to

him  and tell him that they do not know their  own

MP,  then something is wrong with their MP and not

with the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, I must take strong objection to that

inference because so many' situations could arise.

He   cannot   expect  the  MP  to  go  round   his

constituency every day: the constituents will  get

fed  up  with  him.  The  MP  does  go  round  his

constituency   during   elections   or    national

campaigns.  Between such periods  there  could  be

movements of people. There could be people  moving

from  Chua  Chu Kang into Anson for example.  Chua

Chu  Kang  residents might not  know  the  MP  for

Anson, because they, probably know only their  MP,

Mr Tang See



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



Chim. By and large the constituents

know their MPs. There could be the

odd cases where the constituents claim

they do not know their MP. So to give

the impression that the constituents do

not know their MP is wrong just because

of a few ocid cases. What is required i.s

probably posters of MPs at the community centres so that when people visit

the community centres they can have the

opportunity, particularly if they are new

residents, to see who their MP is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, to cut the

matter short, 1 think it should be the

MP's responsibility to make himself

known to his constituents. I am not saying that the MPs are not doing their

job. But 1 think MPs should be ordinary

people. Why should they want their

faces to be plastered all over the place?

If an MP has done his vrork, so be it.

The people will remember him for �he

good work that he has done. That is my

personal view. But if Members think

that having more posters will help them

in their work, then we will try to help

within our resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of calendars mentioned

by the Member for Telok Blangah, in

1973 we spent over $31,000 for the

printing of the 1974 calendars. Last

year, as a measure of economy, we had

only $5,000. This sum is obviously not

enough to print good quality calendars

worthy of distribution to Government

departments, individuals and overseas

missions, and so on. So we decided not

to issue calendars for 1975, because a

calendar of inferior quality would be

counter-productive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diaries issued by the Ministry of

Culture for use in Government and

quasi-Government departments contain

data for use in the civil service. For

example, the 1975 office diary contains

metric conversion tables, postal information, tide tables and so on. We have to

price the diaries in order to recover the

printing cost, because nothing should

be given for free. 1 do not think any

profit was made out of this. It is just a

nominal cost that we wish to recover.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I wish to

take issue with the Minister over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



first point vvhen he answered the Member for Anson, and that is over the

question of journalists. He mentioned

about Members' speeches being published in full, and so forth. What is

wrong with the MPs' speeches being

published in full, if they are good? Is

it not important that their views are

expressed? In fact, their complaint is

that they have not been given that much

publicity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of the standard of journalists, it is very difficult to

put the blame on the journalists. 1 know

this from the journalists' union, which

happens to be an affiliate of the NTUC.

Their members feel terribly disgruntled,

dissatisfied over the fact that the managements of newspapers do not encourage

their journalists to improve themselves.

Many of them want to improve them-selves professionally and their status.

But if the policy of the management is

commercially oriented, where very little

attention is given towards the development of the standard of journalists, what

can the journalists do about it? What

harm is there for the Ministry of Culture

or even the Minister himself to call up

the managing directors of the news-papers occasionally to discuss about

general opportunities for the journalists

to improve themselves and about standards of iournalism in Singapore? Are

these eflorts being made? Are the

managing directors of the various news-papers being persuaded to give the sort

of attention that they should give towards professional improvement of

journalists in Singapore? This matter

has nothing to do with control of the

press. 1 think this has not been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the managing directors and

the people who are in charge are more

concerned with the day-to-day administration and the profitability of the

newspapers. This is one of the frustrations of the journalists' union. We all

want to see an all round improvement

in the standard of our journalists, doctors and others in our society. There is

a positive way of getting things done

and there is also a very negative way of

looking at it. But 1 think the Ministry

of Culture can do something about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



If   the  Minister  were  to  exercise  a  greater

influence  on  the authorities of the  newspapers,

perhaps  they  might  be persuaded  to  show  more

interest  towards  this aspect  of  the  newspaper

operation, namely, professional improvement of the

journalists.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question of working conditions.

Like  anywhere else all over Singapore - the civil

service  and  all places of work  in  the  private

sector,  dissatisfaction  always  creeps  in   and

people get demoralised. I think we have seen  this

in  all strata of our society. We have to have the

same  approach. The people have to be made  happy,

and  if there are grievances they have got  to  he

removed.   I   can  speak  from  experience.   The

journalists'  union, as I said, is  affiliated  to

the NTUC. Its officials often come to the NTUC for

advice and guidance with regard to their problems,

and  it  is  not  just a question of  dollars  and

cents. There has also been this desire on the part

of  the journalists to want to improve themselves.

They  are  quite conscious of the need to  improve

their  professional standards. Although there  may

be black sheep among them, most of them want to be

good journalists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Not mercenary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Yes. This problem must be viewed in the correct

perspective if we want to get down to the core  of

the  problem  and  to rectify it. Otherwise  there

will  be only shadow boxing and there will be more

dissatisfaction and more malaise because  we  have

not  been  able to get to the core of the problem.

There  will be no improvement, but there  will  be

greater dissatisfaction and demoralisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first point, I think the

Member  for Moulmein most probably does  not  read

Chinese  newspapers. When I said that speeches  of

Members  are  faithfully produced in full,  I  had

actually  qualified it by mentioning  the  Chinese

newspapers. If he reads the Chinese news-papers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



he would find that they are not  properly

edited.  There  is no objection to publishing  the

speeches of MPs in full. I am not saying that they

are  printing them in full. I am saying that  they

are not doing their job - speeches are not edited,

and  whatever  written  material  is  handed  out,

whether it is a Government statement or any  other

matter, it is always faithfully produced.  But  we

do   not   find  this  situation  in   any   other

newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as a journalist, if we want to do our

job   well,  we  would  first  pick  up  the  very

interesting points in a speech and play  them  up.

But  in the case of the Chinese newspapers,  maybe

it  is  because of pressure for time or a shortage

of  manpower,  we  find that it is  always  poorly

done. I am not saying that they are producing  too

much of the MPs' speeches. Maybe the MPs feel that

they do not produce enough of their speeches,  but

that is a matter of opinion, What I want to say is

that  the  speeches should be properly edited  and

rendered  in  a  readable  form  and  not  squeeze

everything into one whole page and leave it to the

readers  to interpret. As a journalist, I  do  not

think we can tolerate this kind of reporting in  a

newspaper. But since there are only a few  Chinese

newspapers, there is very little we can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also very eloquently spoken as a

trade unionist for the Singapore National Union of

Journalists. He has asked, "What harm is there for

the  Minister  to  tell, say,  the  Straits  Times

management, to do this and that?" I think there is

a  lot  of  harm  in it. In the first  place,  why

should   I  interfere  with  the  internal  labour

dispute between the management and the union?  Why

should  I,  as the Minister in charge  of  issuing

licences   to  newspapers,  interfere   with   the

promotion  or non-promotion of a journalist  in  a

newspaper  company'? This should be  left  to  the

management and the union to sort out between them,

and if they cannot come to an agreement then there

is always the Industrial Arbitration Court to seek

redress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the points that the Member has mentioned

concern  the working conditions of the journalists

in a news-paper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



company. That is labour dispute and  it  is

not  right for me to interfere. As to the standard

and  content of the newspaper, maybe we can as MPs

raise our criticisms. But what right do we have to

interfere  with the internal dispute  between  the

management  and the union? The same question  also

applies  to any other commercial firm. What  right

does  the  Minister have in interfering  in  those

matters?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, when the journalists submit their reports to

management that should be blamed. But we  are  not

discussing  union matters here. We are  discussing

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ivan Baptist).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, news reading over the radio, through the

Broadcasting  station, is done at  various  times.

Some of the news broadcasts are outside the normal

duty hours, and as such the Broadcasting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



staff  cannot do the reading. Therefore, they  are

covered  by  part-time news readers. News  readers

need  to  have certain qualifications before  they

can be selected. Since stiff requirements are laid

down,  it  is  not  easy  to  get  part-time  news

readers.   With  the  present  set  of   part-time

readers,  however,  the  news  section  is   doing

extremely well. It would appear that these men and

women  are paid $15 and $10 per reading on TV  and

over  the  radio  respectively.  Considering   the

distance they have to travel from the bus stop  at

Thomson Road to the Broadcasting station, and  the

odd  hours that these people are required to work,

the money paid is not really commensurate with the

job  done.  It is high time that these rates  were

revised.  Otherwise, we will never  get  any  more

part-time  news  readers the next  time  vacancies

arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, touching on colour TV, last year there was a

difference of opinion in this House when this item

was debated at Budget time. Now, I understand that

since  the  introduction of colour TV  only  about

10,000  sets  were sold, and out  of  this  number

about 9,000 sets were taken up by the hotels. What

has  happened  to the general public  towards  the

purchase of colour sets? Are they adopting a wait-and-see  attitude because of the speculation  that

the  licence fee may go up together with the cost?

But  then,  a  considerable amount  of  money  and

manpower  is being allocated for this project.  It

is high time that the Minister did something about

improving the quality and increasing the frequency

of colour TV programmes. Only then can the sale of

colour TV sets be enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour TV programmes in Tamil are non-existent.

Why  is  there  such  a  discrimination?  Can  the

Minister do something to introduce colour films in

Tamil? Besides, there is no Tamil programme at all

on  Sundays  when  everyone is  resting  at  home.

Surely something can be done about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, questions had been raised by me

on  the late screening of Tamil films, which  went

on till midnight, a time that was inconvenient for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



office  workers and school children. We  are  glad

that  the  Minister had done something to  advance

the  screening times of these films.  However,  of

late, the  screening  times have  been  gradually

pushed  back,  and  this is a return  to  the  old

system.  I  would request a timely check  on  this

"relapse".  Sometimes it would appear  that  films

are  not  screened  according to  schedule.  As  a

result,  when one tunes in to a desired  programme

one finds that one has already missed some portion

of the programme.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where Tamil `request' programmes on radio

are   concerned,  the  announcer  indiscriminately

mentions every name and address. This lasts  about

five  minutes  while one request song  lasts  only

three  minutes.  In  the end, listeners  can  only

enjoy  about  five songs in a one-hour  programme.

Can something be done to remove this anomaly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again Tamil programmes on radio end at 9.00 p.m.

and  after  that  it  is well-nigh  impossible  to

listen,  in  to  some  music or  any  other  Tamil

programme.  Can the Minister look  into  this  and

ensure  that  Tamil programmes end at about  11.00

p.m.?   I   would   suggest  that  the   afternoon

programme,  which  is  not  listened  in  by  many

people, be taken off and put on the air at a later

hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring this matter up because many Tamil

listeners  have  to  switch to foreign  broadcasts

after  9.00  p.m.,  simply because  RTS  fails  to

provide  the entertainment that it is supposed  to

provide.  Listening in to foreign broadcasts  does

not promote loyalty among the local population  in

Singapore.  Furthermore, we are  losing  a  golden

opportunity   to   educate  the   Tamil   speaking

population  because those are the very hours  that

most people like to listen in to the radio.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common knowledge that

crime  is on the increase in Singapore. The  world

has  its  share of lost souls who rebelled against

established



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



patterns, social order and morality. Many of  them

resort  to militancy and violent forms of  revenge

against society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation like this our mass media,

especially  television and  radio, must  he  more

discriminating   in   their   choice   of   public

entertainment.  Films  appealing  to   the   baser

instincts  should he limited to the minimum;  i.e.

those  television programmes depicting  crime  and

violence  which  delve deeply into the  techniques

used  by  hard-boiled criminals to  commit  house-breaking, safe-busting, robbery, murder, rape  and

so  on.  Our youths can easily be misguided.  They

can  pick up a trick or two to try their  hand  at

these  anti-social activities. In  fact,  this  is

what the under-world is doing all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not being too puritanical by banning all

these   undesirable  films,  some  of  which   are

enjoying  an  unprecedented  popularity  in  other

parts  of the world, some restraint must be  shown

in  its  choice  and  frequency.  The  mother  and

sweetheart  image  of  our  women  is  also  being

destroyed  by  depressing films and advertisements

on  television.  The accent should  be  on  better

educational films to widen the mental horizons  of

our  people,  whilst also providing entertainment.

The  choice of good, clean entertainment  is  very

wide indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point raised by the Member

for Anson regarding the fees paid to RTS part-time

news  readers  on  radio and  television  is  very

pertinent.  This has been a matter of  concern  to

the  Department of Broadcasting in recent  months.

However,  no immediate increase in fees  has  been

possible  so far because the sum budgeted  for  is

not  enough. But in the coming financial  year  we

have asked for additional funds. A revised rate of

fees  has  already been proposed and, if approved,

then  the  revised  rates of  fees  for  the  news

readers,  i.e, the increased rates,  will  be  put

into effect in, the coming financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding colour TV project, Members were

informed during the debate on this subject in last

year's Budget that as most of the equipment at the

televi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



sion  station was over ten years old and  due  for

replacement, it was, therefore, economically sound

to  introduce colour television. It may be pointed

out  that  compared with last year's  prices,  the

cost of some professional television equipment has

increased  this year by about 25%. In last  year's

Budget  debate,  it  was  also  stated  that  only

overseas   films,  programmes   and   some   local

documentary  films, totalling one  to  two  hours'

broadcast time, would be telecast daily in  colour

with  the introduction of colour television,. This

was  effected on 1st August last year. The  colour

television programme now averages four hours daily

on  weekdays  and six hours on Saturdays,  Sundays

and  public  holidays.  In terms  of  the  overall

weekly   output,  colour  programmes  now  average

almost  31%. In addition, in spite of the lack  of

full  switching facilities and trained  personnel,

RTS undertook outside broadcast by telecasting the

National Day parade, the opening of Parliament and

the  Chingay procession in February this year.  It

also  telecast  live and in colour the  World  Cup

soccer  final and the opening of the Asian,  Games

in Teheran via satellite last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sale of colour TV sets, I think it

is a matter of opinion whether the volume of sales

of colour TV sets is poor or otherwise. Statistics

show  that  as  at 31st January, 1975,  there  are

about  11,738  sets licensed for  colour  TV.  The

licences  for colour TV are issued by  the  Inland

Revenue  Department. I do not know how the  Member

got  his  figures when he said that out of  10,000

sets  sold,  9,000 were bought by  the  hotels.  I

think  it is completely untrue because the figures

I  have  here  show that the issue  of  colour  TV

licences  averages about 1,200 per month.  In  the

month  of  January this year, out of  a  total  of

1,300  licences  issued,  only  15  licences  were

issued  to the hotels; and in February  out  of  a

total  of 1,637 licences, none was issued  to  any

hotel. I do not think it is true to say that 9,000

sets had been taken up by hotels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the increase of hours of colour TV

programmes  the  sale of colour  TV  sets  may  be

pushed further.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



When   the  present  switching  system  has   been

converted to colour in about two months' time,  it

is  planned to telecast in colour the news  and  a

few  local programmes, apart from documentary.  It

takes  time to train people and we have about  200

technical   staff   to   train   for   this   very

sophisticated piece of technology. It is very time

consuming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not say that there is no colour programme

in  Tamil.  But  I agree that it  is  not  enough.

Colour  programmes in Tamil are very limited.  The

average screening time for a Tamil film is about 2

1/2  hours, and so it is very difficult to fit  it

into  any standard television time slots, in order

to  make the programmes interesting to all sectors

of  the population, the programmes in Tamil  would

have to be allotted in a proportionate way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also mentioned about the

punctuality of the programme. We have taken  every

step to see that the daily programmes are telecast

at the times published in the press. Sometimes due

to  unforeseen factors, as for instance, the  time

needed  to  cover  the Parliamentary  report,  the

actual  length could not be determined. Therefore,

in  such an event subsequent programmes have to be

telecast at times later than scheduled. But it  is

not  true  to say that the programmes are  put  on

earlier  than scheduled. It may be later than  the

scheduled  time  because of the earlier  programme

being a bit longer than expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding the query on, the Tamil "request"

programme  on  radio, it is the  practice  of  RTS

announcers not to mention more than 10  names  for

each  request.  For special "request"  programmes,

such  as those relating to festive occasions  like

Christmas,  Deepavali, Han Raya  and  Chinese  New

Year,  more  names  need to be  mentioned  because

there are more requests. But in a normal broadcast

of  such  a  programme, this is not done.  In  the

allocation  of air time, the size of the  audience

has  to  be taken into consideration, as has  been

the   case   for  many  years.  Our  schedule   of

programmes in the afternoon takes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



into consideration programmes for

housewives, youths and students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has

spoken on filnis depicting violence and

very undesirable elements in TV programmes. May � say that imported TV

programmes for screening in Singapore

are subject to very careful vetting. In  1974, 26 films were banned because of

violent themes and detailed depiction

of crime.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason 80 to 100 censorship cuts are made every year. For this

year, up to February, four films havc

been banned and 23 censorship cuts

made on grounds of crime and violence. Apart from this stringent censorship, the

number of police and detective dramas

scheduled is regulated. Of the 225 programmes in a week, an average of only

six such programmes are scheduled, and

these are not telecast every day of the

week. For instance, no mystery or

detective programme is currently being

telecast on Mondays and Tuesday. Programmes featuring ]aw enforcement

officers and crime investigators comprise, in fact, only 5.7% of �TS output.

94.3% of transmission time is occupied

by other categories of programmes.

Even for this small percentage of police

and detective dramas depicting violence

and the details of criminal activities,

detailed scenes on crime and so on are

censored. Programmes which are finally

shown dramatise law enforcement and

substantiate the saying, "Crime does not

pay."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the more popular imported

programmes telecast by RTS are also

subscribed to by 50 or more countries

and in many different languages. There

is a concern, in some quarters as regards

the possible effects these programmes

may have on vievvers. Studies on the

effects of violence and crime on television have been made, but as yet there

has been no conclusive evidence that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



correlates the rise in crime rates with

television programming. In view of the

constraints already enforced, as regards

crime and violence in television programming, it is felt that at present it is

not necessary to have any change on

the present format of programming.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am raising a point under this

head, which I moved just before the technical

breakdown to forestall, if possible, a poor

measure that might be introduced in respect of

the National Library. In the last year or so,

there have been 15 resignations of young library

officers from the library service. Apart from

there having to be a reason why these young

officers have been so soon disillusioned with the

library service, there is also the problem of

work in the library service being affected. The

library service has been successful in evoking a

good response especially from our younger

citizens, and in popularising the habit of

reading. Yet if one scrutinises the list of

popular titles produced by the National Library

over the past year or so, one cannot help getting

the impression that the purpose why a book is

borrowed is a very material and instrumental one

indeed. In the nonfiction section, for example,

Shakespearean tragedy, electrical engineering

principles, strength of materials, biology of

functional approach, are titles that one comes

across again and again apart from the extreme

popularity of books on Lee Kuan Yew. Further work

has to be done obviously by the library to

encourage the habit of reading for the sake of

interest in reading, not interest in passing

examinations and doing well in the General Paper

at `A' levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of needs and in the midst of

dissatisfactions that seem to prevail, an

additional irritant may be added to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



the  situation. There has recently been undertaken

a   review  of  the  operations  of  the  National

Library. I do not know what the qualifications are

of  those who are involved in this review but some

of  the  proposals have aroused severe  criticisms

from senior library staff. One of the proposals, I

believe,  had it that it was possible to create  a

good  professional library officer out of  library

assistants   who   only  needed   an   `0'   level

qualification to become library assistants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope wiser counsels will eventually prevail and

the  situation  at the National Library  not  made

worse. If the Ministry of Finance wants to have  a

look, their officials should have a thorough  look

at the National Library and see it as performing a

totality  of  functions  related  to  the   better

cultural  development of our people. The  Minister

has himself in a speech about a month ago - and  I

am  speaking about the Minister for Culture now  - recognised  the onerous burdens and many  problems

concerning librarians as a result of the knowledge

explosion.  Let  us help our librarians  do  their

work better, not hinder them in the attainment  of

their professional objectives.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed welcome to see

branch  libraries  set  up  in  many  new  housing

estates.  But  it  would appear that  in  all  the

libraries the provision of reading mystery,  books

and  journals, especially those pertaining to work

of  the  various  Ministries, is most  inadequate.

Recently  some soil test experts were  looking  in

the  Queenstown Branch Library for books like Soil

Testing  by  William  Lamb, and  Soil  Testing  by

Tezaki, in connection with their experiments,  but

none was available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in the National Library a great number

of  Tamil books are not available. Can the Library

take steps to supply adequate reading material?



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, first, the Member for Katong. He was doubtful

of  the  Library Service scheme that we introduced

to train librarians with `0' levels. May I correct

him by saying that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



we  are  not really training librarians. They  are

called library assistants, not librarians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are doing our best to maintain the present

high  standard of librarianship and we  would  not

like  to  see  it  lowered. All  recruits  to  the

Government   Library  Service  are  graduates   of

recognised universities. Those who do not have the

additional  professional  library  qualifications,

when   first  recruited  into  the  service,   are

encouraged to obtain these qualifications by means

of  study  at overseas library schools, either  on

scholarship or on no pay leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new scheme that he spoke about is for the

training   of   library   assistants,   and    not

librarians, who would have GCE `0' level passes in

at  least  five subjects. These library assistants

will  work  under the supervision of  professional

librarians in the carrying out of the more routine

work   in  Government  libraries,  such   as   the

registration of readers, the loan of books, and so

on.  In this way, the professional librarians will

then  be  able  to devote their time 10  reference

information and bibliographical services, as  well

as   the   promotion  of  reading,   which   their

specialised  professional training and educational

background  have  enabled them to  undertake.  Far

from  lowering  the standard of librarianship,  we

are  actually  trying to take away the  burden  of

this  routine work of the professional librarians,

and  we hope that this service scheme is going  to

work  towards  giving  a  better  service  to  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson complained about certain

books   not  being  available  in  the  Queenstown

Library. May I say that the books he mentioned are

of  a very specialised category. If any specialist

wants  reference books on a certain subject  I  am

sure  he would not go to a branch library, because

it  is meant to serve the general readership in  a

satellite  town.  If the soil  test  experts,  for

instance, want access to specialised books,  there

are many methods by which we can get for them. The

branch  library  staff would normally  refer  such

enquiries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



to the National Library in Stamford Road where the

collection of books is much wider. There are  also

other  libraries in the universities  and  various

Ministries,  which  have a very  well  coordinated

system. If a certain book cannot be found  in  the

National   Library,   the  librarian   will   make

enquiries  for  the  public whether  the  book  is

available in another library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Tamil books in the National Library, I

think  we  have quite a number of them.  The  only

fault is that we do not have enough, because there

are  not enough publications in Tamil. The  Member

for Anson knows where these Tamil books come from.

They  are not published in Singapore. Only a  very

limited  quantity  can  be obtained  from  Madras,

India, and so on. The number of Tamil books in the

National  Library comes to about  61,000  volumes.

This  is about 8% of the total book collection  in

1974, and this corresponds with the proportion  of

Indian population in Singapore, which is about 7%.

And  if only the Tamil reading population is taken

into  count, then the percentage would  be  lower.

The National Library makes every attempt to supply

reading  material for its Tamil readers,  but  the

number  of  publications in Tamil  is  very  small

compared  to the publication in the other official

languages.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister referred to the percentage of

the  Tamil  population. If  we  are  to  take  the

percentage  of the reading population as  a  basis

for  calculation,  then the  libraries  must  also

carry the same percentage of books. However,  even

the 5% of the Tamil reading population can read 8%

of  the  books that are available. So the Minister

should  not  make  a comparison on  the  basis  of

population.  The books are needed in the  library,

so  that people can go and read them and get  some

knowledge about Tamil. I think Tamil is one of the

oldest  languages. So the Minister must  find  out

what books are not there and he must try to supply

those  books.  If the Ministry has  no  funds,  he

should say, "We have no money." That is all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am very reassured by what the Minister has

said  regarding the matter I raised.  May  I  take

this  opportunity to congratulate the Ministry  of

Culture  for  the  very  good  work  the  National

Library  is doing and, with that, I take leave  to

withdraw this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead FAA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned about the inadequate

support  for the National Museum and I would  like

to  expand on this. I have already talked  of  the

importance  of  the  National  Museum  in  nation-building  and its activities being geared  towards

nation-building.  May  I  express  the  hope  that

encouragement would be given to the expansion  and

further development of these activities with  more

facilities provided by Government. Admittedly, the

measures  taken  to modernise the National  Museum

have  included  the provision of an  art  gallery.

Most  of  the money in any case has come from  the

Arts  Council.  The  measures have  also  included

galleries  and rooms for the display  of  the  art

collection  of  the University  of  Singapore  and

rooms for art exhibitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these physical amenities are coming up,

the  necessary staff to implement the plans of the

National  Museum have not been forthcoming.  There

are  only  two curators, one for art and  one  for

anthropology. While the curator of art  will  take

charge   of  the  art  gallery,  the  curator   of

anthropology will be responsible for  a  vast  and

bewildering  range  of  subjects  extending   from

prehistory  through ethnology to present  history.

It  would  require a genius indeed  to  devote  an

adequate amount of time to so many disciplines, to

such an expanse of knowledge, and excel in all  of

them.  For  a start, there should be an additional

post  of curator of history. There should also  be

an official placed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



in  charge  of  public education if  the  National

Museum  is  to  be  a centre for  social  Contact,

cultural agitation and creative' activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I will admit that allocations for certain

subheads  in  relation  to the  Museum  have  been

increased. For example, there is $30,000 allocated

for the acquisition of museum exhibits; but really

this  is peanuts. I am not suggesting that  we  go

out and purchase something like the Mona Lisa, but

we  need to put vitality into the work of the  art

gallery  which  will have lasting  effect  on  the

cultural  development of our young people  and  on

future  generations; we shall have to be a  little

more  generous, Or we shall have to put  out  best

foot forward in trying to stimulate the generosity

of potentially wealthy patrons of the art.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, for many years the National Museum has the

unenviable reputation of being a quiet and  mystic

place,   stuffed  with  dead  animals  and   other

objects.  With  the  transfer  of  the  zoological

components  of  the  exhibits  to  the   Singapore

Science Centre in 1972, we have taken the decision

to  modernise the museum and to have it  renovated

so  that it may become an educational and cultural

institution devoted to the technology, history and

arts  of  Singapore  and other  countries  in  the

region.  The three basic functions of  the  museum

are   first,  as  a  repository  of  the  nation's

cultural  heritage. Secondly,  a  fine  centre  of

display  so  that  its  exhibits  may  be   better

understood and appreciated. Thirdly, it serves  as

a  centre of activities in order that museum-going

may   be  an  enriching  personal  experience   of

educational benefit, cultural value,  and  fun  to

everyone concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this, the National Museum has

recently gone into two projects, which the  Member

for  Katong has made some mention of it. The first

project  is to convert part of the Museum building

into  a  modern art gallery. This is made possible

by the contribution of the Singapore Arts Council.

The Government also have a subsidy of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



$100,000 in it. The renovation work, I hope,  will

be  completed  by the end of May this, year.  The

second   project  is  to  renovate   three   small

galleries at a cost of $355,000 by the end of this

year. This is to provide latest display facilities

to  do  justice  to the art collection,  which  is

being   transferred   from   the   University   of

Singapore,  to be relocated and displayed  at  the

National  Museum. After being left alone for  many

years,  these  new projects will  stir  life  back

again in the National Museum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last financial year, even with

comparatively limited resources, eight or nine art

exhibitions had been organised, four of which were

international exhibitions. There were  many  other

exhibitions for students, young people and so  on.

We recognise the need to expand the service in the

National  Museum, and there is Government  support

for this renovation.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member has- described the funds

provided for the acquisition of museum exhibits as

"peanuts", I do not think so because comparing  it

with  the past provisions, there has been a  great

increase. For instance, in 1973 we had only $3,000

for  the  acquisition of museum exhibits,  and  in

1974  this was increased to $30,000, and for  1975

it  is  again $30,000. Compared to other projects,

this  may  be a very small sum but it is  a  great

improvement  over  the  previous  years'  figures.

There is, of course, a need for more to be done by

the   National  Museum  in  the  years  to   come,

especially the staffing problem, and I agree  that

we should look into this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, it is obvious

that  the Minister and I see not only eye  to  eye

but  almost word for word, judging from  the  fact

that  the Minister has used the words which I have

also  used  previously about the National  Museum.

Obviously, we have been reading the same material,

and with that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ivan Baptist -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (b) of  subhead AAA 3020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Association has undoubtedly

contributed   towards  community  development   in

Singapore. However, there are certain shortcomings

that must be remedied if community centres are  to

serve  more  fruitfully the  civic,  cultural  and

other  needs  of the community they  serve.  While

community  centres are sufficiently well  equipped

and provide reasonably good facilities, others are

not  so  fortunately placed. In densely  populated

housing   estates   where   the   residents    are

predominantly in the lower income group, the  need

to  have  proper  facilities  is  relatively  more

important.  .it  is  in  such  areas   that   more

attention  should be paid to develop  a  sense  of

community consciousness and cohesion. It is in  my

view    vitally   important   for   the   People's

Association to, coordinate with the HDB and  other

authorities  concerned  that  in  future   housing

development programme adequate provision  is  made

for the building of community centres as well.  It

would  perhaps  be  preferable  to  have  standard

designs   for  community  centres  so  that   some

facilities exist in all community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the People's Association's policy

pertaining to the allocation of funds,  there  are

some   disturbing  inconsistencies.  The   general

policy is that the People's Association will match

its  contribution  on  a dollar-for-dollar  basis,

that  is  to  say, if the community centres  raise

$100,000  the People's Association will contribute

an   equivalent  amount,  subject  to  a   maximum

contribution of $300,000 where no community centre

exists in the constituency,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



and  a  maximum  of $150,000 where a  constituency

which has already a centre wishes to rebuild it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, this seems reasonable but the

rub  is  that  some constituencies which  have  no

permanent centres are housed temporarily in rented

HDB  flats and are insufficiently and inadequately

equipped.    They    are   temporary    make-shift

arrangements, and it is inequitable to allocate  a

maximum of only $150,000 in such cases. It is  not

right  to  treat them on the same basis  as  those

which  already  have permanent community  centres.

They should logically be allocated the maximum  of

$300,000  to  enable them to put  up  a  permanent

building.  However, I would consider it reasonable

to  expect a permanent community centre  to  raise

the   necessary  funds  in  order   to   introduce

facilities additional to those already provided.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I notice there is an amendment* on the same subhead standing in the name of Mr Lee Yiok Seng.

Would Mr Lee like to speak on it now?



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 3020.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that in this year's

Estimates   the   provision   for   the   People's

Association has been increased considerably, it is

my  hope that the increased provision will further

develop the activities of the People's Association

for the benefit of the people in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the annual staff

turnover in the People's Association has been very

high.  Resignations  are gradually  mounting,  and

they  come  to  more than 10% of the total  staff.

This   is   detrimental  to  the  development   of

activities in the community centres. The staff  of

the  People's Association are properly trained and

the  great  number of resignations causes  serious

staff  shortages  in certain  cases.  One  of  the

reasons for such resignations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



may  be  due to pressure of work. Some members  of

the  staff  have to work from morning  until  very

late at night, about 11.00 p.m, or 12.00 midnight.

They  are  physically fatigued at the end  of  the

day's  work,  and this may result  in  a  loss  of

interest  in  their work. Due to the  shortage  of

staff  certain activities in the community centres

are  losing  ground.  There  is  also  a  lack  of

planning of activities. As a result, the community

centres  have  not  been able  to  play  the  role

expected of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the staff are fully occupied in

their  work,  particularly those attached  to  the

headquarters  of  the People's  Association.  They

have  so much to do that they do not have any time

for  the  management  committees  of  the  various

community  centres. Therefore, there  is  lack  of

understanding between the headquarters' staff  and

the  members of the management committees. In this

regard  I  feel that there is plenty of  room  for

improvement; otherwise the community centres  will

not be able to lend full effect to its functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this, I would like to ask the

Minister whether he has any plans to increase  the

staff of the People's Association to meet the need

for  greater  activity in the  community  centres.

Secondly,  I  would also like to ask  whether  any

study is being made on the massive resignations of

the staff.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I would like to support the suggestions and

recommendations put forward by the Member for Boon

Teck  regarding  the policy on the maximum  amount

allotted to the building of a community centre.  I

share   his   view   that  the   existing   policy

discriminates   the  amount   allocated   to   the

constituencies.  It  creates discrimination  among

constituencies,  because some  constituencies  for

some  good  reason  are  able  to  build,  through

donations, a community centre varying perhaps from

$4  million to $1 million. Compare this with other

constituencies which, through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



no  fault  of  their  own  and  facing  particular

constituency  problems are unable  to  collect  an

amount   to  build  even  a  reasonable  community

centre.  I think the Member for Henderson will  be

speaking on this subject on more or less the  same

lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to support that this policy requires

re-examination.  I  would like  to  support  that,

irrespective  of  the nature of the  constituency,

the  maximum  of  $300,000 be given  so  that  any

constituency  can  at least put  up  a  reasonable

structure  with reasonable facilities. Failure  to

understand   the  thinking  of  the   constituency

problems  reflects the non-practical  approach  of

the  People's  Association.  I  would,  therefore,

strongly  suggest that the Minister  for  Culture,

who  is  also the Deputy Chairman of the  People's

Association seriously look into this question.

Chai  and Haji Mohd. Ariff in respect of  Head  0,

subhead AAA 8301, "Grants to Community Centres".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jek, since Members have been speaking on this

subject, I suggest that we might as well  call  on

these  two Members to speak, after which  you  may

then answer them together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you

for your suggestion; otherwise I might not have  a

chance  to  speak  on  a  matter  of  considerable

importance.  The People's Association  have  under

its  charge over 170 community centres.  Some  are

situated in the kampung areas where the population

is  small.  The  People's Association,  therefore,

thinks that they do not play an important function

and have closed them down. These rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



community centres are very small with very  simple

facilities.   Their   structures   are    somewhat

dilapidated and in need of repair and renovations.

However, the People's Association does not want to

provide the money. The community leaders in charge

of  community  centres situated in crowded  areas,

therefore,  decided to take the responsibility  of

extending or improving their community centres.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a community centre is affected by urban

renewal, it will have to be rebuilt. Sometimes  in

this  changing age, to meet the development  needs

of  the  locality concerned, the community leaders

would  like  to  expand  or rebuild  the  existing

community centres or even to build new and  better

ones.  According  to  newspaper  reports,  in  the

recent  past many constituencies wanted  to  build

new  community  centres or to  rebuild  or  extend

existing community centres. I can mention at least

ten   such   constituencies:  Anson,  Boon   Teck,

Havelock,  Jalan  Besar, Kampung  Chai  Chee,  Kim

Keat,  Kreta Ayer, Tanjong Pagar, Tiong Bahru  and

Toa Payoh constituencies. According to what I have

learnt, they need building funds varying with  the

different  types  of  structure  required  in  the

various constituencies. The funds needed vary from

$1/2  million  to  more than $1  million, but  my

conservative  estimate is that  the  total  amount

required to rebuild all these 10 community centres

would come to more than S5 million, which is not a

small  sum  of money. A few days ago the  Minister

for Finance said that $4 million in tax concession

was  a  large  sum of money. I would say  that  $5

million  for rebuilding only 10 community  centres

is  indeed a large sum of money, not to  think  of

the   other   community  centres   outside   these

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all these need fund raising. But how

many Members of Parliament have the experience  of

raising  funds?  some  Ministers  also  have   the

experience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



of  raising  funds. There are three  very  popular

methods. The first method is to publish a  special

publication  and to canvass for advertisements  so

that  copies  of  these  thick  publications  will

become  commercial propaganda manuals. The  second

method  is  to organise variety concerts featuring

star singers comprising chits and lassies from the

four corners of the world, who would be invited to

go  on  the  platform of the National  Theatre  to

chirp and chirr out "I love you deep down to  your

bones"  type of songs. The third method is to  set

up  a  grand  feast among the philanthropists  and

enthusiasts  who  would be asked  to  bring  their

friends  to  glut with rich and delicious  dishes.

Such a function would leave a residue of funds for

the  building  of  community  centres.  I  am  not

against  all  these methods. But  I  say  that  if

community  leaders are forced to do  such  things,

this  will become a social vogue, a hot fad and  a

social  force,  then  the situation  needs  to  be

reviewed.  Why?  If  the  Budget  Section  of  the

Finance Ministry ignores the reasonable request of

the People's Association for funds, and if the  PA

officials in charge of financial matters would not

adjust the present policy as what the Members  for

River  Valley and Boon Teck have just  said,  then

undoubtedly the trend will be towards the adoption

of  these  three methods as the social vogue.  The

situation  will  arise when many  people  will  be

canvassing  for  advertisements; everywhere  there

will  be  people looking for powdered  faces  with

twisting  waists;  and everywhere  there  will  be

people glutting and gluttonising on rich food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, in the light of the President's

speech in this House, all this is contrary to  and

not  in keeping with the spirit of diligence, hard

work  and  self discipline which we are trying  to

promote  for  the cause of nation  building.  This

social  vogue is a contradiction and  a  chord  of

disharmony. It will also have unfavourable effects

on  our economic, cultural and social structure in

the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to make two very

important suggestions to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Culture. I hope he will give  special

consideration  to  them  or  convey  them  to  the

People's   Association  for  more  study.   First,

develop  the function of the Development  Planning

Committee   of   the  People's  Association,   the

chairman of the committee being the Chief  Planner

who  is  a  professional man. Our colleagues  have

also  suggested that there should be some  liaison

between the People's Association and the HDB, with

which the Chief Planner is closely associated. The

Member for Kim Keat is also on this Committee.  He

is a city planer himself. The Development Planning

Committee should be able initially to project  the

future plans for the type of community centres  to

be  built according to the needs of the urban  and

rural population; i.e, whether they should be of a

certain  size  or type necessary  to  meet  future

needs. This careful planning should not envisage a

grand and luxurious building with facilities  that

are not actually used, because it would be a waste

of  money.  This is important. I do  not  think  a

community centre should have air-conditioning from

the  kitchen  to the hall, which may appear  grand

but not practical. To me it is a waste of money to

have  such  a luxurious community centre.  If  the

Minister wants to build such a community centre in

my constituency, I will say "no thank you" to him.

I  was saying that the committee in charge shou1d

plan  well as to where, when and how to set  up  a

community  centre  in  a particular  locality.  It

should  be up to the committee concerned to decide

whether  its  members should be  professionals  in

this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kampung Eunos Community

Centre   was  built  with  the  efforts   of   the

management committee of the Centre. Members of the

committee have worked hard day and night,  in  the

sun  or  rain, to raise funds from philanthropists

to  build the Community Centre with facilities  to

serve the residents of Kampung Eunos so that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



can   spend   their   leisure  time   in   various

activities,  as  is  the  case  with  many   other

community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as has been said by my colleagues, the

Member  for  Boon  Teck and the Member  for  River

Valley, it is true that there is discrimination in

the allocation of grants to constituencies for the

construction  of  community  centres.  It  is  not

surprising  that  constituencies in  urban  areas,

particularly    the   Ministers'   constituencies,

receive generous donations from philanthropists in

their constituencies, lf $130,000 is collected  in

a  rural constituency ten times that amount can be

collected  in  an  urban  constituency.  But   for

Kampung Kembangan constituency, I am sure everyone

knows how difficult it is to raise $130,000 needed

to build a community centre to serve the residents

of Kampung Eunos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the management committee submitted its

application  to  the  Director  of  the   People's

Association for grants, the reply was  that  there

was no provision to build a community centre there

and  that they themselves must raise funds if they

wished  to  build  a  community  centre  in  their

constituency.  When they asked for  permission  to

organise donation draws, the reply was that it was

the  policy  of  the People's Association  not  to

permit   the  management  committee  to   organise

donation  draws. Is this not dampening the  spirit

of  the management committee? But surprisingly, as

has  been  explained by my colleague  earlier  on,

some  constituencies have been  given  dollar-for-dollar  grants for their community centre building

fund.  In  addition, permission was also given  to

organise donation draws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, with the management committee's

continuous  effort  and dedication  to  serve  the

community, the Kampung Eunos Community Centre  was

constructed  at  a cost of about $130,000  without

donation  of even a single cent from the  People's

Association. However, there are still many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



in-adequacies.   It   needs  more   facilities   like

badminton courts, basketball courts, sepak  takraw

courts, classrooms and raising the backyard of the

community  centre.  In  addition  they   need   to

organise courses and other activities. Letters  of

appeal were sent by the management committee about

two  months  ago for donations but there  was  not

even   an  acknowledgement,  let  alone  a  reply.

Subsequently,  the management committee  expressed

its  desire  to make an appointment  to  meet  the

Director  or  the Deputy Director of the  People's

Association  to  discuss the  problem  of  Kampung

Eunos  Community  Centre. But  their  request  was

turned down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many problems which cause concern to

the    management   committee   because   of   the

indifferent  attitude  of  the  officers  of   the

People's Association. The management committees of

community  centres  consist of voluntary  workers.

The officers of the People's Association should be

very  careful  and  diplomatic when  dealing  with

members  of the management committees of community

centres.  The  ideal  is to  maintain  a  dialogue

between   the   People's   Association   and   the

management  committees. The  People's  Association

should  not content itself with giving  orders  to

the management committees through its supervisors,

without   advising  how  best  to  implement   its

instructions. I hope the Minister for Culture will

ensure  that  officers of the People's Association

are  responsive to the suggestions and  complaints

of  the  management committees. Otherwise we  will

lose  valuable  volunteers  who  are  prepared  to

dedicate themselves to the community.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the policy of the People's

Association    is    to    encourage     community

participation and involvement in the building of a

community  centre.  If  the community  can  afford

better facilities for their people, then they will

build  a  better centre. If not, then  they  would

have a standard-type community centre. There is no

discrimination in this. Because of this, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



People's  Association  has  been  encouraging  the

community leaders in the management committees and

so  on  to collect funds for the building of their

centres.  This  has been going on  for  many  many

years, and they find that this works very well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time the People's Association has

found  it  necessary to upgrade the facilities  in

the  community  centres to meet the rising  demand

and  expectations  of the people.  Therefore,  the

subsidy  from the Government has to be  increased.

The  Ministry  of  Finance,  therefore,  has  been

persuaded  to  increase the quantum of  Government

subsidy. This matter has been reviewed towards the

end  of  1973  and  we  have  worked  out  certain

criteria  for the grant for building of  community

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck is under the wrong

impression that every constituency will  be  given

an  amount  of  $300,000 for  the  building  of  a

community  centre. I am afraid  this  is  not  so.

According to the new criteria which we have worked

out with the Ministry of Finance, for key centres,

the  maximum Government subsidy is $150,000  on  a

dollar-for-dollar  basis.  For   urban   community

centres,  the maximum Government subsidy  is  only

$100,000  on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For  rural

community  centres, the maximum  subsidy  is  only

$60,000 on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This  upward

revision   of   Government   subsidies   for   the

construction of community centres took effect only

in the last quarter of 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy of $300,000 is given only to two

constituencies, namely, Henderson and  Toa  Payoh.

They  were  given this very special  consideration

because they were newly created constituencies and

they  were  without a single community centre.  In

view of the inflation in building costs and so on,

the Ministry of Finance has decided on an outright

grant of $300,000 for the first centre in each  of

these two constituencies. But then, this does  not

include  the  cost of land which  has  got  to  be

acquired. And, of course, the land cost would come

to quite a lot more, which we have not worked out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, Members will appreciate the difficulty

of  building community centres. It is not possible

in  every instance to give an outright grant of  a

certain amount of money for a centre. This has  to

be  measured  by  the  number  of  people  in  the

constituency and whether or not there  is  already

an  existing centre in the constituency.  So  this

grant  by the Ministry of Finance is very limited,

and  therefore  we will have to  utilise  it  very

wisely.  It  is not possible really to give  every

constituency   $300,000  to   build   a   $300,000

community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with Members when they say that

there  is  discrimination in the  distribution  of

funds. As I have already stated just now, we  give

a fixed sum for the building of community centres.

A maximum has to be fixed, otherwise there will be

no  end  to  it. But above this maximum amount  of

Government subsidy, if the community leaders,  and

the  people in that area can support or can afford

to  pay  more for better facilities, then  by  all

means  they  can raise their own funds.  Otherwise

they  will  have  to be satisfied with  the  fixed

amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not very certain of the suggestion made

by  the Member for Henderson. He seems to be  very

critical  of  the  way community  leaders  collect

funds. Of course, they are trying their best. They

may  meet with a lot of difficulties but they  are

trying  their  best  to  collect  funds  to  build

community  centres, It may be in  the  form  of  a

variety   show.  It  may  be  in   the   form   of

advertisements. But it is carried out in the  good

spirit of fund raising. Apart from that, I am  not

very certain of what his suggestion is. I think he

is  suggesting that we should build  more  centres

but  he  also objects to the collection  of  money

from the public. I am not very certain what he was

saying.  But  I must say that his constituency  of

Henderson  is getting very special attention  from

the  People's Association. With $300,000,  he  can

build a very good centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is not how much money we

should spend on a community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



centre. I agree with him that we should not

have  luxurious centres with air-conditioned rooms

for   the  committee  members,  and  so  on.   The

important  thing is, what kind of  activities  are

introduced into the centre, and how well  can  the

centre  be  used.  I  will just  give  Members  an

example.  My  community centre in  Queenstown  was

built  more than 10 years ago. I do not  know  how

much  it  cost us. It should be about  $20,000  to

$30,000.  But  it  is  a  place  with  a  lot   of

activities  going on. We have the Girl  Pipers,  a

photographic   section  with  a  dark   room,   an

orchestra, and many other activities too. I  think

it is how well we make use of the place. It is not

how much money can be spent on the centre. Members

should  bear this in mind. If the centre is  fully

utilised,  then  I do not think  that  the  amount

provided by the Government is made inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the number of resignations by the

staff of the People's Association, I think this is

not  confined  only  to the People's  Association.

Many  Government departments are facing  the  same

problem. The People's Association is no exception.

What  I  want to point out is that the  number  of

resignations is not so serious as the  Member  for

Bukit  Panjang  wanted  us  to  believe.  For  the

information of the Member, resignation figures  of

the full-time staff of the People's Association in

the last three years are as follows:



<pre>

       Year        Resignations

       1972            119

       1973             92

       1974             77

</pre>



For the same period, the total full-time staff  of

the  People's  Association averaged  about  1,200.

Therefore, in terms of percentage, the  number  of

resignations has shown a downward trend from about

10%  in  1972 to about 6.5% in 1974. I  must  also

point  out that the majority of those who resigned

are Division III officers. So this does not affect

the  working of the People's Association.  We  are

trying our best and, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



fact,  it  is the standing policy of the  People's

Association to improve the general performance  of

Divisions  II  and  111 officers.  The  Organising

Secretaries  and Assistant Organising  Secretaries

are  sent  for  training  in  the  National  Youth

Leadership Training Institute. On completion, they

are put to better use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many reasons for the resignations.

Sometimes it may be because of the nature  of  the

work and of the irregular working hours, and maybe

the  salary is not as attractive as those  offered

by  the  commercial firms outside. In  general,  I

would   say   that   to  work  in   the   People's

Association,  especially the field workers,  there

must  be  a  sense of dedication and  a  sense  of

sacrifice.  They should not expect normal  regular

working hours like office clerks. However, what we

have  done  is this. We have asked the  Management

Services  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to

conduct  a  comprehensive  survey  of  the  entire

organisational structure and other related matters

of  the  People's  Association,  with  a  view  to

improving the terms and conditions of service  and

to    provide   better   prospects   for    career

advancement.  Once this is done, I  hope  that  we

will  be  able  to further reduce  the  number  of

resignations.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampung Kembangan has raised a

point  concerning  his community  centre.  He  was

saying that when his management, committee of  the

Kampung   Eunos   Community   Centre   asked   for

permission to run a Lucky Draw to raise funds,  it

was  turned  down whereas other community  centres

were  allowed to do so. I think he was  under  the

impression   that   his   community   centre   was

discriminated against. Before 1973 the  policy  of

the  People's Association was not to encourage the

holding  of  lucky draws by community centres  for

the  purpose of raising funds. But as a result  of

intensified development programmes, people  wanted

more  money  and we had to yield to  this  demand.

Therefore, after 1973, we allowed certain  centres

to hold lucky draws. The request from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



Kampung Kembangan Community Centre was made before

1973, and therefore it was not allowed. This is  a

matter  of  policy  and  not  discrimination.  The

request just came in too early. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the request to stage

an exposition in Gay World and said that there was

not  even an acknowledgment letter. My information

is  that  the  People's Association  had  actually

replied to the Member's request on the 29th April,

1974, advising him not to hold the exposition.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Suradi:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. My management

committee sent a letter to the Deputy Director  of

the People's Association two months ago asking for

financial assistance to build a basket-ball  court

and  to raise the backyard of the community centre

and  up  till now there has been no acknowledgment

to that letter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Let us deal one question at a time. The Member

was saying that he requested permission to hold an

exposition and this was ignored. This is  not  the

case  because  my  information is  that  they  had

actually replied.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Suradi:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I did not say that

we had asked for permission to hold an exposition.

What I said was that two months ago the management

committee sent a letter to the Deputy Director  of

the  People's  Association  asking  for  financial

assistance  to build a basket-ball  court  and  to

raise the backyard of the community centre and  up

till now there has been no acknowledgment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I think that is because all requests for

funds  usually  go to the Board of Management  for

decision, and this Board sits once a month.  Maybe

they  are  now in the process of replying  to  his

letter. Did I hear the Member say something  about

the holding of an exposition, in Gay World?



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Suradi:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b>In that case, I would not want to go further into it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, 1 would like to clarify certain points. The

Minister for Culture said just now that he had the

impression that I am opposed to donations. I would

like to say that I do not oppose because donations

are  given  every  year  in  connection  with  the

activities of community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I touched on was the building of community

centres.  I have even given figures to  show  that

the  funds  required in each case  range  from  $�

million  to  more than $1 million. If a  community

centre  wants  to  raise funds  -  in  fact,  many

community centres want to do so

-  there are other organisations too that want  to

raise funds. What is he going to do about it?  All

I  am saying is that the Development Committee  of

the People's Association should decide on the type

and  size  of  the community centre to  be  built,

whether  it should be square or round and  matters

relating thereto, After the decision is made,  the

People's  Association must be  consistent  in  the

policy. They should not later argue that because a

certain  constituency is a Minister's constituency

they  should give it priority over a Backbencher's

constitiency.  What I am trying  to  say  is  that

personal  considerations should not be allowed  to

influence priority. This is important. Of  course,

flexibility could be allowed because of  financial

position.  But, there must be some consistency  in

the policy to carry the job through to the finish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that - Sir, allow me another

minute - in my constituency although I may  get  a

moderate  community centre with a $300,000  grant,

last year's planning for our community centre  was

a  budget  of  about $600,000 and the  Development

Committee of the People's Association had  decided

to  approve  it. However, the People's Association

finally  told  us that since there were  no  funds

available we would not have a new community centre

and  whether we would be satisfied with a  smaller

one.  I  must  stress the point that the  People's

Association must be consistent. There  should  not

be   any   variation  merely  because  of  certain

personal   or  financial  relationship  with   the

Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



of  Finance so that the People's Association could

suddenly  change its mind, thus causing  delay  in

social    development.   How   is   the   People's

Association  going  to promote youth  movement  in

this  way? I hope the Minister will kindly  convey

my   opinion  to  the  People's  Association  that

development planning must be consistently  carried

out.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Suradi:</b> Sir, just now the Minister for `Culture said that

the  Board of the People's Association meets  only

once  a month. The letter I was talking about  was

sent  to the People's Association two months  ago.

At   least   it   should  have  the  courtesy   to

acknowledge receipt of the letter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister for Culture has not answered

most  of my questions. First, I would like to know

from  the Minister whether priority will be  given

to  the building of a community centre in an  area

where  the majority of residents are in the  lower

income   group.   Secondly,  does   the   People's

Association  consider it good to have  a  standard

type  of community centre, as recommended by them?

This  has been pointed out by the Minister and  so

do  most  of  my colleagues. The minimum  cost  is

$500,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The price might go up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Yes, the price might go up. Thirdly, I am sure

that  in my prepared speech I did not say that  in

areas  where  there are no community centres  they

can  claim a maximum of $300,000. I said  "subject

to a maximum of $300,000."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two situations involving community

centres in the constituencies. One is where you do

not  have  a  community centre at all. Another  is

where  the  community  centre  occupies  a  rented

premises.  I  told the Director  of  the  People's

Association that if this was the case I had better

close  my  community centre, which premises  is  a

rented one,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



for  six  months,  and could I then  claim  for  a

maximum grant? I should say that what we ought  to

be  interested  in  is not  to  ask  for  a  grand

community centre with air-conditioning and so  on,

but  a  community  centre which provides  all  the

necessary  facilities as in  any  other  community

centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure I did not mention that the question of

a  dollar-for-dollar donation is no  good.  I  say

this is encouraging, and I am prepared to go along

with   this  idea.  I  am  sure  all  Members   of

Parliament  accept that this  is  a  good  way  to

develop    civic    consciousness    among     our

constituents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now I heard the Minister for Culture

saying  that  the  People's Association  does  not

discriminate against the various constituencies. I

was  not happy to hear that. Originally I  had  no

intention to talk on this topic as I thought  that

the People's Association is a piece of rotten wood

that  cannot be used for carving, and there is  no

remedy  to  it.  But, after having heard  what  my

colleagues    had   said   about   the    People's

Association,  I have got to stand  up  to  support

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency there is a small-sized

community centre, the Bartley Community Centre. In

1970  when  the community centre was set  up,  the

place  was  already dilapidated. The  planks  were

about to collapse. So we decided to raise funds to

rebuild  it.  After  a  certain  amount  had  been

raised,  we  heard nothing more from the  People's

Association.  We  then  asked  for  permission  to

"tender",  but there was no news. Five years  have

already  passed. But still I did not want to  talk

about  it, because I want to see how long  is  the

People's Association going to delay this matter. I

believe that if the Bartley Community Centre  were

in a Minister's constituency, then if a centre was

asked for by tomorrow, it would already have  been

built by yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, may I reply to the Member for Henderson.

There   is   actually  at  present  a  Development

Committee looking into the facilities for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



community centres in all the constituencies.  This

Development Committee has the discretion to decide

whether  or  not priority should  be  given  to  a

centre.  That  is always the case in the  People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise here that there is no

discrimination in the building of a centre  or  in

attending    to   the   work   of   the    various

constituencies. For example, the community centres

which  are now under construction are: the  Jurong

New  Town  Community Centre, the Sennett Community

Centre, and the Joo Chiat Community Centre.  I  do

not  know  whether  any one of these  falls  in  a

constituency where the Member of Parliament  is  a

Minister.  I  do not think Jurong is a  Minister's

constituency.  So are Sennett and  Joo  Chiat.  So

neither  has  priority been given to  any  one  of

these  constituencies. This is not because the  MP

of  that  area  is a Minister but because  of  the

urgency  and  the decision made by the Development

Committee. It could be that funds have  been  made

available  by  the  hard  work  of  the  community

leaders  in  that  area.  So  the  allegation   of

favouritism  or  discrimination  has  no   grounds

really.  If  there  is  discrimination,  then  the

glaring  example  should be  seen  in  Queenstown,

where  I am the MP. But anyone can have a look  at

the Queenstown Community Centre to see whether any

priority  or  favouritism has been given  to  that

centre.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck has asked me to clarify

certain  points.  First, whether any  priority  is

given. I think we do, but not according to whether

the MP is a Minister but according to whether that

area  has a centre or not. For instance,  we  have

given priority to Henderson and Toa Payoh. In  the

case  of Henderson, we have even gone out  of  our

way  to  increase the subsidy, but the MP  or  the

people there do not seem to like the design and so

there  has been some disagreement. Therefore,  the

project has been held up. We had an argument  with

the Ministry of Finance and finally we managed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



secure  more money for Henderson. We got  $300,000

and the People's Association was also prepared  to

dig  out from its savings another $100,000 to  add

to  the  building cost of the Henderson  community

centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question which the Member asked is

whether  or  not  it  is a good  idea  to  have  a

standard type community centre. I personally think

that  it  may not be a good idea to have the  same

type of community centre in every constituency. We

should  allow some free-play of design,  since  we

have  so  many architects. In this way,  we  could

find   the,   best  possible  solution   for   our

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know about the delay in the building of

a community centre in Paya Lebar, but I presume it

must  be a small rural type of centre. It  is  our

policy  to  discourage the rural type of community

centres. With better communication and so  on,  it

is a good idea for community centres to pool their

resources  in order to build a good centre  rather

than  to  spread  them out in too many  areas  and

build a sub-standard type of centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister

to  clarify  this point. The Member for  Henderson

should  be  happy to receive $300,Q00. The  Member

for  Toa Payoh will also be getting $300,000. Boon

Teck  is  also a new constituency, and it  is  the

smallest of all the 65 constituencies. It has only

one road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No need for a community centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Yes, no need for a community

centre. Perhaps my constituents can share the  use

of   the  community  centre  at  Toa  Payoh.  But,

nevertheless, my constituents feel that there is a

need for a community centre because more than  75%

of them live in one-room flats. A community centre

will  not  only  provide the social  and  cultural

activities for the lower income group but it  will

also  be used by students to study there. I  think

this  is  more urgent and the Minister for Culture

should  convince  the  Minister  for  Finance   to

increase the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



sum   of  $300,000,  which  I  consider  is   very

unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is if there is no discrimination,

why  is  Boon  Teck  constituency  given  $150,000

against Henderson's $400,000? I am sure the Member

for  Kim  Keat  will support me, but unfortunately

lie  is  in the People's Association and he cannot

stand up to support me. Boon Teck constituency has

a   community  centre  housed  in  a  rented  shop

premises which has been converted into a temporary

community  centre. May I request the  Minister  to

enlighten me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I think we would leave this request for

consideration. It may be that the constituency  is

so  small  that  it  is  unrealistic  to  have   a

community centre there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is unfair for

the  Minister  to say this. I have  consulted  the

Director  of the People's Association and  I  have

pointed out to him that Boon Teck constituency  is

in urgent need of a community centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, there are a number of reasons why a

community centre is not built in Boon Teck, it may

be  that  land is not available. It  may  be  that

money  is also not available. There arc also other

reasons, but I can assure the Member that  if  the

right combination of reasons is found and if there

is  a  good case we would, of course, support  his

request to build a community centre at Boon Teck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister to enlighten me on

one point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Phey, I do not think we can prolong the debate

any  longer.  Would  you  like  to  withdraw  your

amendment or shall I put it to the vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I am very unhappy. But in view of the

lengthy explanation, though unsatisfactory, I  beg

leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 3030.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that under this subhead we are

making  a contribution to the Malaysian Branch  of

the  Royal Asiatic Society as well as to the Royal

Asiatic  Society. Firstly, I wish to inquire  what

this Society is all about, and secondly, why do we

contribute  to the main body which  is  the  Royal

Asiatic Society and then contribute again  to  the

Malaysian Branch of the Society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Royal Asiatic Society and the Malaysian

Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society are both  well

established societies. The former was  founded  in

1823   in   London  for  the  study  of   History,

Sociology,  Institutions, Customs,  Languages  and

Arts of Asia, the so-called oriental studies.  The

Malaysian  Branch, which was first  known  as  the

Straits Branch, came into existence in 1878 as  an

affiliate to the parent body in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of these societies is to increase

and  diffuse  knowledge concerning the territories

of  Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Both societies

publish  journals which are internationally  known

and  highly regarded. Contributions are being made

to  the Societies to help defray the printing cost

of  publication  because of our  interest  in  the

study  and  research on our region.  Our  National

Museum and the National Library receive copies  of

these publications free of charge.
