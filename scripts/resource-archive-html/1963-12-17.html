contained in Paper Cmd. 29 of 1963. We will  now  deal

respect of which amendments stand in the Order  Paper.

Head 33 - Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 33 be reduced

by the whole sum in respect of subhead 34.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Finance this.

In 1963 there was a provision of $30 million. I do not

know  why  there is a need for a further provision  of

$200  million in these present Estimates. I would also

like to know what is the purpose of this $200 million.

Also,  to  what extent has the present amount  already

been used by the Government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Deputy   Speaker,  Sir,  the  Member  has  asked   for

information as to why it is necessary to transfer this

large  sum of money from the Consolidated Fund to  the

Development Fund. This is a fairly reasonable  request

for  information, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. So I  shall

try  to  enlighten  him.  There  are  two  main  funds

operated   by  the  Government.  The  first   is   the

Consolidated  Fund.  This is the  Fund  in  which  all

revenues of the State are kept. From this Consolidated

Fund  all payments of Government Departments are  paid

out:   running   of  Ministries,  for  staff,   public

services,  and  all the other items of expenditure  in

the  Main  Estimates which we passed  the  day  before

yesterday.  That is the Consolidated  Fund.  In  other

words,  it  is  a fund which deals with the  operating

expenses  of  the  Government and  keeps  the  current

revenues of the Government. In other words, it is  our

current account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fund is the Development Fund. All the

projects   for  capital  expenditure,  such   as   the

Development  Estimates  which  this  Assembly   passed

yesterday,  are paid out of monies of the  Development

Fund.  The Development Fund gets its income from three

principal sources. The first is loans which  we  raise

each year in Singapore. The second is the interest  on

the earnings of the Development Fund. The third source

comes  from allocations from the Consolidated Fund  to

the Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



Fund.  As  Members will know, each year sums of  money

are  transferred  from the Consolidated  Fund  to  the

Development  Fund. The purpose of  this  item  in  the

Supplementary Estimates is to transfer this amount  of

money,  namely,  $200 million, from  the  Consolidated

Fund  to the Development Fund to meet expenditures  in

the  State's development plan. So the short answer  as

to  what the money is going to be used for is that  it

will  be  used to pay for expenditure on the  projects

which this Assembly approved yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why is it $200 million? If the Member will read

the  notes attached to this subhead, he will find this

in  the  last  sentence:  "The Consolidated  Fund  now

stands  at  $288 million which is much  in  excess  of

normal requirements...." Normally  we  want something like $60 million  in  the

Consolidated  Fund.  That  is  quite  ample  to   meet

Government's expenditure in its day-to-day operations.

But the Consolidated Fund has stood at this very large

figure  as  a  result  of  surpluses  accumulated   in

previous  years.  It is necessary  to  transfer  these

surpluses  in  a lump sum now. Members will  recollect

that  in  1961,  we made a transfer  of  $80  million.

Today,  with a transfer of $200 million, we will  have

transferred $280 million of previous years'  surpluses

into the Development Fund. In 1959 we transferred  $20

million  from the Consolidated Fund to the Development

Fund,   and  from  1960  to  1963  in  each  year   we

transferred  $30 million. So the total  of  all  these

monies  transferred from the Consolidated Fund to  the

Development  Fund  stands  at  something   like   $420

million. This is the surplus which we have referred to

every  now  and then. Obviously there is no  point  in

letting the money remain in the Consolidated Fund.  In

fact,  the Barisan Sosialis have always asked  in  the

previous Assembly why we do not spend this money.  Now

when we are transferring this money to the Development

Fund,  they  say, "Why do you want to do  this?"  They

cannot have it both ways. I hope I have explained  the

matter clearly to the Member for Choa Chu Kang. He was

urging   me  yesterday  to  spend  this  money.   This

exercise, among other things, will have the effect  of

obliging him. I hope I have made the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



position clear. There is no catch in it. I can see him

frowning. His brain is physically working! But  if  it

is still not clear to him, I will be only too happy to

explain   further  the  working  of   this   financial

arrangement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If $200 million

is  to  be allocated to the Development Fund, I  would

like to know how much of it has already been used, and

to what purpose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Since the money has not been

transferred  to  the  Development Fund,  obviously  we

cannot use it. You have got to put the money into  the

Development  Fund  before you can  touch  it.  So  the

answer is that none of it has so far been used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked, "How will it be used?" Only

yesterday  we  had  a  long and sometimes  acrimonious

debate  on  how  to  spend money on development.  This

money  is  to  meet the expenditure which  this  House

approved  yesterday. I hope I have made myself  clear.

But  he  looks  puzzled. Perhaps if he  wants  further

clarification,  I  am  prepared  to  go  outside   the

Chamber,  get down with a pencil and paper,  and  make

everything  more crystal clear than could possibly  be

the  case  when  one talks to each  other  across  the

Table.



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Does the Member

for Choa Chu Kang wish to withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $200,000,000 for Head 33 ordered to stand

part of the Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for

1963.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 36-



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced

by the whole sum in respect of subhead 62.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $450,000 is now being asked for additional

expenditure on the National Theatre. We heard that the

theatre opened on 31st August this year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



when  the South-East Asia Cultural Festival was  held.

How  is  it  that there is a further need of $450,000?

Does  it  mean that this money will be spent  on  neon

lights and decorations of P.A.P. signs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I  am  indeed surprised at the question asked  by  the

Member  for  Thomson.  It is unusually  short.  It  is

customary  for the Barisan and the pro-Communist  boys

to  be  very  interested in cultural activities.  They

consider   it   a   means  to  disseminate   Communist

propaganda and to indoctrinate the young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Theatre project was approved at a

total cost of $2.2 million. The cost was worked out by

the  architects  as  well as the  former  Director  of

Public Works. Government's contribution is the balance

between  the total cost of $2.2 million and the  total

sum  of  donations including interest derived thereon.

The  total amount of donations, inclusive of interest,

if  the  Opposition Member is interested to  know,  is

$856,279.04 as at 16th December, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has touched on the delay of

construction  of  this National Theatre.  We  have  to

appreciate  the following facts. Piling  work  on  the

National  Theatre was completed in October last  year.

Work  on  the  building  contract  commenced  on  24th

October,  1962.  The  original  target  date  for  the

completion  was 31st May, 1963, which meant  that  the

steel contractor had to finish the steel work by  15th

May, 1963. The technical difficulties involved in  the

steel work prevented the target date from being met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another reason for the delay. The late

completion of the level structural drawings  was  due,

in a large measure, to the necessity of making careful

calculations to ensure a safer cantilever.  It  should

be noted that the contractor's efforts to complete the

work quickly are reflected in the fact that during the

period  23rd October, 1962, to 7th August,  1963,  the

building  contractor spent approximately  $118,000  by

way of overtime wages. And also during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



the  period 7th March, 1963, to 20th July,  1963,  the

steel contractor spent approximately $38,000 by way of

overtime  wages. The work had to be rushed as  it  was

necessary  to  have the main building and  stage  roof

ready before the South-East Asia Cultural Festival  in

which the Member for Thomson is so interested. I shall

enlighten him on this later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Festival was held from 8th August, 1963, to 15th

August,  1963. All this work for the Cultural Festival

was completed in time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it should also be noted that the National

Theatre is architecturally unique in South-East  Asia,

perhaps in the whole of Asia. Nowhere in Asia  can  we

find  a cantilever thrust jutting out 150 feet without

any  supporting columns. In a project of this  nature,

undue speed in construction is not desirable. In fact,

it is dangerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Assembly is now requested to pass this

further  contribution of $450,000 made to the National

Theatre Trust. We recall that on 24th July, 1963,  the

previous  Assembly  passed  a  first  contribution  of

$500,000  to the National Theatre Trust. This request,

therefore, is the second payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member should also note that a further payment

will  have to be made in accordance with what has been

agreed in respect of Government's contribution to  the

Trust as mentioned earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the information of this Assembly, the

National Theatre Trust was established by an Ordinance

No. 61 of 1961 on 19th November, 1960. The Chairman of

the Trust is Mr Lee Khoon Choy. The other members are

Inche   Zubir  Said,  Mr  Ng  Aik  Huan,   Mr   Paul

Abisheganaden, Madam Liu Hsue Ying, Mr K. P. Bhaskar,

Mr Liao Sung Yang, Mr Liew Yung Ho, Mr Wee Kim Wee,

Mr  Ang Hock Lam, and the Permanent Secretary to  the

Minister for Culture. All these are voluntary members.

The object of the Board is to manage, on behalf of the

Minister  for Culture, the National Theatre and  other

theatrical institutions placed under its management by

the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson probably would be interested

to  know  something about our South-East Asia Cultural

Festival, which I earlier promised to enlighten.  Sir,

the  first South-East Asia Cultural Festival which  we

in Singapore had the distinction of staging took place

from  8th August, 1963, to 15th August, 1963. It  cost

the   Government  about  $311,500.  This  is  only   a

provisional figure as the accounts have not  yet  been

finalised, but it is more or less accurate.  The  gate

receipts  amounted to $52,671.03, of which  $45,220.83

was  collected  at the National Theatre and  $7,450.20

was collected at the Victoria Theatre. The net cost to

Government was, therefore, approximately $258,829. The

gate  receipts would have been much more but  for  the

complimentary tickets issued to the artistes and other

guests of participant countries. The tickets were sold

at  $5, $3, $2, and $1 at the National Theatre and  $3

and  $1  at  the  Victoria Theatre. The  participating

member-countries  were  Cambodia,  the  Federation  of

Malaya,   Hong   Kong,  India,  Laos,  Pakistan,   the

Philippines,  Sabah,  Singapore,  South  Vietnam,  and

Thailand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Thomson may be interested to

know that his former colleague or former adviser,  the

former  strong  man in the S.A.T.U. group,  the  pro-Communist  group  of  unions,  was  one  of  the  keen

supporters  of the National Theatre. He contributed  a

lot to the National Theatre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Theatre was intended to be a small

one, but because of the tremendous enthusiasm shown

by  the  donors and well-wishers, we had to reconsider

our  plan. The structures have to be reconsidered  and

our  National  Theatre is now a  sizable  one.  I  can

promise  the  Member for Thomson that it will  not  be

used for staging any songs which they are now teaching

the  small children in the kindergarten classes in the

rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, we

all  know that the National Theatre was opened on  the

31st August this year. Yet the Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



Secretary has said that it has not yet been completed.

He  has also referred to the Communist activities  and

Barisan disturbances. I expect him to talk in  such  a

trend - accusing the Communists of interfering with the

work  so  that  the Theatre could not be completed  in

time. But fortunately he did not talk in this manner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Order. The Member

should   refrain   from   crude  and   unparliamentary

language. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, it

is  only meant to describe him adjectivally. But since

you have ruled it as improper, I withdraw.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They claim that the Theatre is the most beautiful

and  the grandest in the whole of South-East Asia.  We

would  like  to ask whether the Government  have  been

misusing   public  funds  by  allocating   a   further

provision of $450,000. The National Theatre may appear

to  be grand and beautiful on the outside, but it  may

not  be so in actual fact. If you put some zinc sheets

and  have  them  painted, they too can  appear  to  be

pretty from the outside. But what we want is something

concrete, real, and valuable and not something that is

beautiful  superficially.  Perhaps  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  has  been  travelling all  over  South-East

Asia.  That  is why he finds the National  Theatre  in

Singapore  to  be the most beautiful in the  whole  of

this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the provision of $450,000, the sum of

$2.2  million  has already been used on  the  National

Theatre. Has it not been a waste? Perhaps you can  say

the  National Theatre appears superficially to be very

beautiful. But it might be too extravagant an item  of

expenditure to spend $2.2 million just on this sort of

National  Theatre.  What  we  want  is  not  the  most

beautiful  National  Theatre in South-East  Asia,  but

something  that is of practical use and value  to  the

people. Moreover, we would like to know whether  there

has been any waste or misuse of public money. It might

be possible that because the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



Culture  wanted  to meet the completion  date  of  the

National Theatre, a certain wastage of money  or  some

irregularities might have taken place. We do not know.

Perhaps  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  concerned  can

enlighten  us  on  this,  instead  of  talking   about

Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like  to clarify certain  points.  The

Member for Thomson has said the Government wasted this

money,  which was public money. We used the  money  to

build the National Theatre. The money, of course, came

from the people. But it is for the good of the people.

How  can he say that this is a waste of money when  we

are  not  using it for ourselves? The National Theatre

has  been  built from the contributions of members  of

the  public. Whenever there is a $100 donation, we too

contribute  an agreed amount at the ratio of  1:1.  So

how  can he say that this is a waste? The building  of

the  National Theatre has been initiated by the public

themselves,  and  for their own  use.  From  what  the

Member  for Thomson has mentioned just now, it appears

that  he might be qualified to be an associate  member

of  the Architects Association of Singapore. He  talks

about whether the National Theatre was a waste or  not

and  whether it was beautiful or not from the outside.

He  makes  all  these  comments as  though  he  was  a

qualified architect. I think the Member for Jalan Kayu

is  more concerned with the style and structure of pig

sties  and  chicken sheds. He might well be conversant

with  this  subject. But he and the  people  over  the

other  side might not be so well conversant  with  the

true  architecture of the National Theatre.  They  are

not experts in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre is a very big construction job

and  much effort has been put in to build it.  So  all

sorts of details must be taken into consideration. The

second  reason for the delay in the completion of  the

National  Theatre is that the public's enthusiasm  and

zeal has made it possible for the original plan to  be

modified and altered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Thomson has asked whether

the  National  Theatre  would  be  safe  or  would  it

collapse. I can assure him that if he were to  go  and

look  at  the National Theatre, the ceiling would  not

collapse on his head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the possible malpractices committed by the

contractor,  the  Government are very  cautious  about

this  and  pay  very much attention to it.  If  he  is

interested,   I  will  ask  the  P.W.D. engineer   to

accompany  him  to  the  work  site  to  inspect   the

construction work. He can see whether there have  been

malpractices committed by the contractor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the past few days, the Barisan

Sosialis  Members have been always finding fault  with

every  plan  and  suggestion made by  the  Government.

Their motive and objectives are to sabotage and not to

make any constructive criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Member for Thomson has criticised

the  construction work of the National Theatre. He has

also accused us of having misused the $2.2 million. We

know  that the National Theatre building campaign  was

launched  in  1959  during Loyalty Week  and  that  it

received  the  enthusiasm and support of  the  public.

Even the Barisan Sosialis and the S.A.T.U. unions also

gave  enthusiatic support to it. This National Theatre

has a very great historical significance to the people

of  Singapore.  In the past, the colonial  regime  was

never  able  to put up such a theatre. If the  Barisan

Sosialis had been elected to power, they too would not

have  been  able to put up such a theatre.  But  today

when   the   people   are   awakening   to   political

consciousness, the Barisan Sosialis will never be in a

position  to come to power. The National Theatre  will

be  able to fuse the cultures of the various races  in

Malaysia. Those who have come to Singapore from abroad

will  know  that  the National Theatre  plays  a  very

important role in creating a Malaysian culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  did not intend to speak further on this.  But

perhaps they have not been listening to what I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



said.  They  were dreaming. They were  shouting  anti-Communist slogans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was merely asking whether there has been a waste

of  money in building this National Theatre.  It  does

not  mean  that I am opposed to the building  of  this

National  Theatre.  What I want to  know  is:  in  the

course of construction was there any waste in order to

speed up and have it completed on the 31st August?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, they should

have round-the-clock work. Were there any malpractices

or  irregularities during the course of  construction?

That is what I want to know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> For a stupid question there is

always  a stupid answer. The Member did not know  what

he was asking for. If he is interested to know whether

the Government are throwing money away, the answer  is

simple  - N-o-  no.  Sir,  we  are  not  the  kind   of

government that throw our money away by putting it  in

an  unprofitable investment. We calculate and consider

every  item  of expenditure and we cut the expenditure

to  the bone. There is no waste. The answer is no.  It

is simple. I think what the Barisan Members are really

sore  at is that they cannot turn the National Theatre

into a red star theatre, where they can have Communist

culture, the harvest dance, very inspiring songs  from

China,  probably  some songs from Indonesia  and  some

inspiration from Aidit of Indonesia. I think  this  is

what  the  Barisan Sosialis Members are sore  at  with

this  National  Theatre. Because they know  that  they

cannot make use of the National Theatre for their  own

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I

can  give  a  straightforward answer to  the  question

posed  by  the  Member for Thomson. Though  I  am  not

connected with the building of the National Theatre, I

will try to answer his question. He asks whether there

has been wastage in public and Government funds in the

building of the National Theatre. The answer is no. He

asks why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



should  there be work round the clock? The  answer  is

probably  this.  In coming to a contractual  agreement

with  the  contractor, there is always a deadline  and

probably the contractor finds that he cannot make  the

deadline, therefore he has to do work round the clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another worry of his is, why should we spend more

than  $2  million  on the National  Theatre?  Sir,  in

Singapore we build for a useful purpose; we  build  in

order  that it can be of practical use for our people.

But,  at the same time, we want to build and see  that

we  should be proud of whatever we build. The National

Theatre is something which one should be proud of,  if

one  embarks  on that venture. As a loyal  citizen  of

this  State  and of Malaysia, I think  one  should  be

willing  to  spend a bit more money on a project  like

the  National Theatre, so that we can embellish  it  a

little  bit more, have better fittings here and there,

so  that when visitors come to Singapore, we can  say,

"Look,  this is our National Theatre. It is about  the

best in the Far East."

<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, when the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister for Culture and the Back-benchers talk  about

the   National  Theatre  they  raise  the   bogey   of

Communism. The P.A.P. are very anxious to make use  of

the  National Theatre for their own party purposes and

when   we   raise  this  question  they  become   very

sensitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building of the National Theatre is a good

thing, more so because it has received the support  of

the  people. But after its completion, will the  Party

in  power - as  they have stated - be  able  to  promote

Malaysian culture? [Interruption] During the last  few

years,  the  P.A.P. have monopolised the promotion  of

different   cultures   and  they   have   banned   the

publication  of cultural magazines which were  opposed

to  them.  Books  that  really  reflect  the  people's

consciousness  in dances, poetry and songs  have  also

been  banned  by  the Government for their  own  party

purposes. It is doubtful whether they are really  able

to  foster Malayan culture. If they carry on  in  this

way, Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



will  become  a  cultural desert because  the  dances,

poetry and songs which really reflect the people's way

of   life  are  discouraged  and  suppressed  by   the

Government.  Therefore,  the standard  of  culture  in

Singapore  cannot be raised any further. The  building

of   a  so-called  new  culture  is  another  form  of

deception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope the P.A.P. will change their attitude of

monopolising the promotion of culture and will  really

encourage   the  promotion  of  cultures   which   are

beneficial  to  the  people of  Singapore  and  Malaya

- cultures which truly represent the way of life of the

people  - and  not encourage the promotion  of  foreign

cultures such as American culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I just do not understand why

every  time we talk about Communism, the Barisan stand

up  without hesitation to defend it. If they  are  not

Communists, why do they defend it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, what really makes them feel

sore  is  that  they cannot make use of  the  National

Theatre  as  they made use of the Dramatic Society  in

Nanyang  University to disseminate Communist  culture.

But  if  we  were to give them a chance to stage  some

dances  of  Mao  Tse-tung and his gang  or  of  Aidit,

probably  the  Member for Jurong would  agree  and  he

would donate a few dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is alleged that the National Theatre is

intended to serve as a tool for the P.A.P. This is  an

utter  insult not only to the people of Singapore  who

contributed so willingly towards the National  Theatre

fund  but also to the countries which participated  in

the South-East Asia Festival - Cambodia, the Federation

of  Malaya,  Hong Kong, India, Ceylon,  Pakistan,  the

Philippines,  Sabah,  Singapore,  South  Vietnam   and

Thailand, not Jakarta and China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years, we have done much to

promote  Malaysian culture - may I emphasise, Malaysian

culture  - and I can assure the Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis  that we have also done very,  very  much  to

curb Communist culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of publications that were banned

they  consider are not Communist-inspired and  I  will

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I would like to say a few more words.  I

was  very  pleased  to hear a Member  of  the  Barisan

supporting certain projects like the National Theatre.

I have two questions to ask him. First, why did he not

say "Malaysian" culture but "Malayan" culture? Second,

is  it  not  a fact that Malaysian culture is  now  in

existence? Its existence has been recognised  even  by

Russia,  though Indonesia still refuses  to  recognise

it.  On  this question, I would like to ask  him  what

types  of songs and poetry really reflect the people's

way  of life. We say that this cannot be judged  by  a

group  of politicians but by the broad masses - by  the

majority of the people and not by a minority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, the last Member who spoke on this question did so

in the hope that the reactionary groups in Malaya, the

United  Kingdom  or  in the United States  of  America

might give him a title like "anti-Communist doctor  or

hero". Culture is a thing that belongs to the majority

of the people and not only to the ruling class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what magazines, journals and literature have

been banned, I believe the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for  Culture himself should  know  more

about  them. He cannot deceive the people. He  can  go

through the records to find out the facts.

medals  from  Soekarno  and  Aidit  for  being   their

spokesmen in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to answer the question on the banning of

publications. We are confident that each and every one

of  those  publications that we ban is not  desirable,

and that it is not in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



interest   of  the  people  of  Singapore  for   these

publications  to  be circulated.  If  the  Member  for

Jurong  is interested, I would like him to give  me  a

list of the books, poems or songs which he thinks  are

good  for  the  people of Singapore and  then  I  will

consider  the matter. As far as we are concerned,  all

the  books, poems and songs that we ban are not in the

interest  of the people of Singapore for  them  to  be

circulated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy   Speaker,  Sir,  just  now  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture has again raised

the  Communist bogey. I think it is better for him not

to  distort the facts. It he wants to debate Communism

- he  can  do  so outside the Assembly with anybody  he

likes.  He  should not repeatedly raise the  Communist

bogey  in  this  Assembly.  While  we  are  discussing

affairs   concerning  the  people  of  Singapore,   he

introduces the Communist bogey again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for Culture asked us to deny

whether we are Communists. I say that we do not oppose

the  banning  of  Communist literature.  But  can  the

P.A.P. say  that  the dances, literature,  poems  and

songs  that  really reflect the way  of  life  of  the

people  of  Singapore are Communist-inspired? Why  were

some of those people connected with them banished? The

criterion on whether a song or literature is Communist-

inspired or not depends on the judgment of the  people

and not on the decision of the P.A.P. oligarchy or  by

Mr Lee Khoon Choy alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the ruling clique, how many

they not say "Malaysia" but "Malaya and Singapore"? If

they consider themselves citizens of Malaysia but they

refuse to say "Malaysia", it means that they are anti-Malaysia  like Indonesia, which refuses  to  recognise

the existence of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia. It is, therefore, clear that they are agents

of  the P.K.I. because they refuse to acknowledge that

Malaysia is an accomplished fact.

spent  the  whole  time talking on Communism  with  no

reference at all to culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since they are so interested in defending

themselves, I will just put forward a simple  question

for  them to answer. The people of Singapore have  yet

to  know  whether they are Communists, pro-Communists,

anti-Communists or non-Communists like the P.A.P.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by the whole sum in respect of subhead 4.



<br><br>The  Government  is  asking for a  provision  of  $1.5

million  for  the People's Association.  I  feel  this

provision  will  be  a  waste  of  public  money.  The

provision for community centres in 1963 is $2 million.

We  must  make  careful  use of  our  meagre  national

revenue. But, as a matter of fact, the motive  of  the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



Government in making use of this money in this  matter

is  to win support for party purposes. I would like to

cite an example. If we approve this additional sum  of

$1.5  million,  then  the total  amount  for  1963  in

respect of community centres will be $3.5 million. How

much  then  is  intended to be spent on hospitals  and

other   services?  We  can  clearly  see   from   this

comparison that, in spite of the P.A.P.'s slogans  and

publicity   that   community  centres,   clinics   and

veterinary  stations are important and useful  to  the

people, they are in fact spending less money on  these

useful  services. The Government are in fact  spending

more money on community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that more and more community

centres  are being built without any principle.  There

is no justification for them. The main reason why they

are  built is that the Prime Minister is going to tour

the rural areas. Many community centres seem to go  up

in  those  areas where the Prime Minister is going  to

make  a  visit. But are these community centres  still

open  today? Many of them are closed now. What is  the

use  of spending such money on community centres? They

serve  no  practical purpose. Many  of  the  community

centres were built in the rural areas during the  time

when  the Prime Minister made his tour of those areas.

They  did this to show what the Government have  done.

Hence they would welcome the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government are going to use this $3.5

million. But will it benefit the people living in  the

rural areas? No. This money is really going to be used

for   the  benefit  of  P.A.P. supporters  and  their

lackeys.  They  would be given jobs in  the  community

centres as a kind of reward for their support  of  the

P.A.P.  At  the same time many people working  in  the

community centres are receiving double wages.  On  the

one  hand, they are being paid as members of the staff

of community centres. On the other hand, they are also

being  paid  for  being  inoculators  in  the  Primary

Production  Unit in the rural areas. This is  not  the

proper way to spend public money.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also see that there is an allocation of $2.3

million for next year which will be spent on community

centres. This is a big sum of money. If the Government

want  to  use the money for the benefit of the people,

it  should  not  be  done  by  way  of  building  more

community centres. We should examine and consider  the

needs  of  the  people. We should  find  out  what  is

important  to  the people. We should see  what  useful

services  can be provided for the people in  order  to

help them in their livelihood, especially those living

in the rural areas. Many people in the rural areas who

rear pigs and poultry have to borrow money in order to

keep  going. They are thus being exploited  by  money-lenders and middlemen by having to pay a high rate  of

interest.  They have no bargaining power in all  these

negotiations   and   transactions.   They   have    no

alternative.  Everything is being  controlled  by  the

middlemen  and  money-lenders. If the  Government  are

really  interested  in  the  welfare  of  the  people,

especially those in the rural areas, then they  should

see  to it that the farmers get reasonable prices  for

their  agricultural products. Why are  the  Government

not prepared to give loans to the farmers? They should

have done this to help the farmers in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to help the farmers is to build co-

operative  societies. This will help the  people.  The

P.A.P. have talked about this a few years ago. But  up

to  now we have not seen any co-operative societies to

help  the farmers. If the Government are keen to  help

the farmers, they should do something to help increase

the   productivity   of  the  farmers   and   maintain

reasonable  prices of their products. They should  not

build  community centres for the people just for show.

These  community  centres have no practical  value  at

all. In fact, when we look round we can see that there

are  only  P.A.P. members who are being  employed  as

staff for these community centres. This is yet another

instance which shows that the P.A.P. is making use  of

public  money to build community centres in  order  to

further  the  interests of the Party.  These  are  the

reasons why I move this amendment.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for

Choa  Chu Kang has raised a few questions just now.  I

have  explained  the position. The  question  concerns

community  centres which are likely to  be  built.  He

says that community centres are not a necessity to the

people.  We have discussed this question at length  in

the last few days. But they still want to show in this

Assembly  that there is no need for community  centres

in  this  State. As a matter of fact, these  community

centres are now becoming more popular to the people in

the rural areas, and even in the towns. The amount  of

$1½  million  in  the Estimates is necessary  for  the

building  of  community  centres  this  year.  It   is

Government's  policy to build more  community  centres

and  to give more facilities to residents in the rural

areas.  This  decision was taken at the end  of  1962.

This  provision  for community centres is,  therefore,

entered  in the Supplementary Estimates for 1963.  The

programme  for the building of community  centres  has

already  been  approved. According to this  programme,

the  number of standard type community centres  to  be

built  in  the  rural areas will be 101. Six  standard

type  community centres have so far been built in  the

rural  areas.  They  are  in a  resettlement  area  in

Jurong,  Woodlands,  Nee Soon,  Kranji,  and  Princess

Elizabeth Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain what happened last Saturday

at  the Kranji Community Centre when it was officially

opened  by  the  Political  Secretary  to  the   Prime

Minister, Mr Lee Khoon Choy. A number of people  have

told  me of this incident. In fact, one of the  people

that  night said that a few days before the  community

centre  was opened, a number of people went  round  to

the  villages and intimidated the residents. They said

that if the people were to attend the official opening

of  the  community centre, they would be attacked  and

beaten  up. They made this threat, Mr Deputy Speaker,

so  that  the  people  would not attend  the  official

opening  of  the community centre. We  know  from  the

debate  in this Assembly who have opposed the  opening

of community centres. They comprise the people sitting

in front of me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



They even go so far as to prevent people from going to

the  community  centres. It is in a  community  centre

that  people  can see and talk with one another.  They

can  mix  freely among themselves. In this  way,  they

will  be  able to understand one another and  live  in

peace in this country. The reason why they are opposed

to  community  centres is that  they  are  afraid  the

centres  will become popular with the people. That  is

why   they  send  their  men  into  the  villages   to

intimidate  the  people not to  attend  the  community

centre at Kranji.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to return to the subject of the provision of $1.5

million  for  the building of community  centres.  The

cost  of  building  the  six standard  type  community

centres  is  $250,000. Those in the rural  areas  cost

$6,000  each. Altogether, they cost $846,000. Personal

emoluments for all these come to $210,000.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment amounts to $242,000 and expenses in

connection   with  the  community  centres   such   as

electricity  supply,  magazines  and  newspapers,  and

other  equipment, amount to $220,000.  Altogether,  it

amounts to $1,500,000. From this expenditure,  it  can

be  seen  that  the Government have not wasted  public

money.  Every  item of expenditure has been  accounted

for.  The  community  centre is a place  where  people

gather  to  enjoy  the facilities provided  for  their

benefit  and welfare. Why must we build standard  type

community  centres,  which number  six  in  the  rural

areas?  The  reason is that such centres  can  provide

more  service  to the people in larger areas  such  as

Kranji  and  Jurong.  They  can  also  serve  as   the

headquarters of other community centres in  the  rural

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other points have been raised by the Member for

Choa  Chu Kang. He has said that members of the P.A.P.

are  employed in community centres. There is no  truth

in  this  statement.  Mr Deputy Speaker,  anyone  can

apply  for  work  in  community  centres  through  the

People's Association. In the People's Association,  we

have  a  Committee  to consider all applications.  The

Committee  takes into consideration the qualifications

and experience of the applicants. Those with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



good  experience  and  who are  likely  to  make  good

officers are accepted because they will then  be  able

to give good service to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days ago, the subject of community centres came

up  for debate in this Assembly. I said then that they

provide  poultry inoculation service in  the  daytime.

They  also  provide useful services to farmers,  shop-

keepers  and  hawkers, and services such  as  for  the

payment  of  licence  fees.  In  general,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  they  are open all day up to 11  o'clock  at

night  to  provide  useful services.  There  are  also

kindergarten  classes  provided  in  these   community

centres  which are run on proper lines, and  not  like

those  which  propagate anti-Malaysia feelings.  These

classes  are provided for the welfare and  benefit  of

the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for

Social  Affairs  says that because  community  centres

provide  more  and better services to the  public,  it

means  that the Barisan are afraid and therefore raise

objections. If community centres can really serve  the

people well, we will give our support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has said just now that in the past the

P.A.P. have made use of community centres  as  P.A.P.

organisations to further their own interests. What  we

are  concerned  with  is the people's  interest.  Past

events  have  shown that the P.A.P. have  ignored  the

rights  of  the people. Therefore, it is only  natural

that  their  Party branches have been avoided  by  the

people.  So  the P.A.P. have to make use of  community

centres to carry out their party activities. If  I  am

not  mistaken,  in  the past, community  centres  were

known as association centres. Then later, the People's

Association did not hold meetings for quite some time.

The members of the Association were appointed by Mr --- -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. The Member is

<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister for Social Affairs

<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): After two or three

years, the Council of the People's Association did not

hold any meetings. I do not know whether the community

centres   are  run  by  the  P.A.P. or  the  People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which we are not very clear about is

this.  Not  long ago, the P.A.P. sacked many employees

of  the  People's Association working in the community

centres.  Their  dismissal was not  discussed  by  the

Council  of  the  People's  Association,  but  it  was

approved.  As a matter of fact, the action  was  taken

under the direction of the Minister. Why did they want

to  do such a thing? Does it mean that those dismissed

could not really serve the people? No. The crux of the

problem was that they could not agree with some of the

policies of the P.A.P. which tried to make use of  and

control  the  People's Association and  the  community

centres.  That was the reason why they were dismissed.

This  is another example of the P.A.P.'s intention  to

make  use  of  community centres for their  own  party

ends.

P.A.P. to  form  the government. If the  people  were

fools  or if they knew that the community centres  are

used by the Party, surely they would not have gone  to

the centres to enjoy the facilities provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote what the ex-Member for Choa

Chu Kang said in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



Assembly before. It is from the Hansard, Vol. 12,  No.

11 [col. 739, 13th May, 1960], in which he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is urgent need for low-cost community centres

in  the rural areas so that the rural people can  make

use  of  and  enjoy the facilities provided  by  these

centres.'



The  other  Members  of the then Legislative  Assembly

also  fully  supported the construction  of  community

centres. But now these Members have come to oppose the

building of these community centres, saying that  they

are not of any use to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision of $371,900 is required for expenditure

in  connection with the Singapore Legislative Assembly

General  Elections, 1963. I would like to  advance  my

reasons  for  opposing  this  provision.  Perhaps  the

Government side will be excited and infuriated when  I

have exposed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last general elections the Tunku said

that   the   campaigning  period  of  nine  days   was

unreasonable.  The second reason is that  some  voters

could not locate their polling stations. Was there any

mystery behind all this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that before polling day, there

were  many  illegal posters. Why did the  P.A.P. keep

silent  about these illegal posters? I would  like  to

ask  whether something was done by the Minister  about

these illegal posters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth reason is that Lee Kuan Yew at a radio

forum, in the Press and everywhere ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Members are not supposed to

voting  for the P.A.P. through intimidation,  threats,

coercion,  smears, and all sorts of tactics.  That  is

another reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth reason is that the election agents of the

various  Parties  were not allowed  to  accompany  the

ballot  boxes.  Perhaps there  might  have  been  some

manipulation or other irregularities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth point is why mass arrests were carried out

atmosphere, without being disturbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh point is, I would like to ask the

Government   in  power:  Why  did  they  deprive   the

citizenship of those citizens who did not support  the

P.A.P. thus  affecting the result of  the  elections?

Many  people  who were not satisfied with  the  P.A.P.

regime  were thus disabled in their election  campaign

because  many  of  them had been  arrested  and  their

citizenship had also been ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not see how the question

of  citizenship comes into this question. So will  the

Member  for  Tampines  continue without  referring  to

that? He may proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

these  few  points that I have raised are  my  reasons

which  go  to  show why there should  not  be  such  a

provision  for $371,900. If the Deputy Speaker  is  of

the opinion that I should not raise those points, then

I  will now mention two further points which are  more

important. These two points have enabled the P.A.P. to

continue with their dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth point is that the P.A.P. have been using

all  the propaganda machinery such as T.V., the Radio,

the  Press  for their own ends, as a result  of  which

they were elected again to be the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is that all those who did not support

P.A.P. policies and were in disagreement  with  them,

including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



publications,  literature, the  Press  and  views  and

opinions, were banned, curbed or restricted, resulting

in the P.A.P. coming to power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister can give us a reply to these points.

I will be glad to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

after seeing the tactics shown by the Member for  Tampines,

he reminds me of the boy who cries over  spilt

milk.  They know that the elections are over  and  the

questions raised by the Member are old questions which

have  been  mentioned in this Assembly. He  says  that

nine  days  were not enough to carry out the  election

campaign.  They  have ideas, but we also  have  ideas.

What we know is that three months before the elections

they had already stuck up posters in all the villages.

We  came  to know of this when our candidates went  to

the  villages. The posters were already up.  If  there

were  people  who  had  more time  to  carry  out  the

campaign, then they were the people. But what  to  do?

The  people have made their decision. They  know  that

the  P.A.P. are honest and have not done anything  to

damage  their  interests. Therefore, the  people  have

elected  us  once again to rule the State for  another

five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that a number of voters could not cast

their  votes  because they did not  know  the  polling

stations.  In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker,  we  all  know

that  before the elections were held, the voters  were

asked  to  check  their  names  and  their  respective

polling stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of elections, Mr Deputy Speaker, we

do  not  want to do things which are not good.  We  do

things according to the law of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Member has mentioned is about

posters. I do not understand what he means by posters.

I hope he could give me the explanation once again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says that the Prime Minister held a forum

over  the  radio and television. He accuses the  Prime

Minister  of  issuing threats so that the people  were

afraid  to  vote  for  the other Parties.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  in  these forums the leaders of the  Barisan

Sosialis also took



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



part   and  they  gave  their  own  explanations   and

statements.  But  because their explanations  were  no

longer  of value to the people, therefore, the  people

could  not  care less for them. It was not because  of

threats as stated by the Member for Tampines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that election agents were not allowed to

accompany  the  ballot boxes to the counting  centres.

But  I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that at every polling

station after the votes were cast, the box was  sealed

by the officers because it was feared that these boxes

might  be  opened and the ballot papers  damaged.  The

Barisan Sosialis agents themselves saw that the  seals

were  not  broken. Therefore, there was no opportunity

for  the Government, as has been accused by the Member

for Tampines, to damage the ballot papers and boxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to reply to the question of citizenship

because it has no connection with this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the P.A.P.'s use of propaganda through the use

of  television  and radio, I have already  replied  to

this.  Not  only did the P.A.P. leaders take  part  in

these forums and radio talks before the elections, but

the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis also took part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to those who had been arrested before the

elections,   this   had   not   been   done    without

consideration. Mr Deputy Speaker, these  leaders  had

been  working  against the security of  this  country.

That  is  why  they were arrested. If  they  had  been

sincere and honest leaders working for the benefit  of

the country, they would not have been arrested.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Government Back-benchers are always interrupting our speeches. This is

a fact.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



During  the  election  campaign, the  Government  also

tried   to  prevent  us  from  printing  our  campaign

material.  The period was too short for the Opposition

to   prepare  them.  The  Government  obstructed   and

prevented  us  from printing our propaganda  material.

The   period   given   to  the  Opposition   for   the

electioneering campaign was too short. Even the Tunku,

whom  they respect so much, and who is a close  friend

of the M.C.A., was of the same opinion. The Tunku said

that  he had never heard of such a short period  given

to  an  electioneering campaign. With  regard  to  the

general election, the conditions were unfavourable  to

the Opposition Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government also denied us the opportunity

for   any   publicity.  Thus,  through   intimidation,

coercion  and  suppression, the P.A.P. have  come  to

power  again. They are now in a position  to  ask  for

more funds to carry out their own intentions again. I,

therefore,  say  that it is most undemocratic  on  the

part  of  the  P.A.P. to have resorted to intimidation

and coercion of the people. The Government may now  be

elated  that they have won the elections, and that  we

have  lost  the elections. But I should say  that,  in

spite  of their suppression and intimidation and  even

under  their  white terror, the people still  gave  us

200,000 odd votes. They should not think that all  the

people supported them when they came to office.  There

is  80  per cent support for them. But they  must  not

forget that even Ngo Dinh Diem anti Madam Ngo received

99.9  per cent of votes of the people who voted  them.

Yet  they  were notorious throughout the  world.  They

were the two people who suppressed the people of South

Vietnam. What is there for the P.A.P. to boast  about?

If the P.A.P. think they wish to emulate Ngo Dinh Diem

and  Madam Ngo, then I am afraid their future will  he

just  the same as theirs. They will meet with the same

fate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for Paya

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



history  of Singapore elections or for that matter  in

any part of the world. If he is not purposely ignoring

the fact, then he should admit his ignorance. Even  in

England the period given for the election campaign was

nine  days.  This  is  a common thing  in  the  United

said  that  because of the short period of  nine  days

given,   they  could  not  carry  out  their  election

campaign to the fullest extent. He also mentioned  the

Tunku.  But  the  period  for  campaigning  that   was

enforced  in the last election was in accordance  with

the  rules and regulations of the Legislative Assembly

Elections  Ordinance. They should  themselves  analyse

by $10 in respect of subhead 10 (3) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree to the provision of this sum for this

item.  I  would like the Minister to answer  me  these

questions.  When  the  Prime Minister  visited  Changi

constituency  on 19th May, 1963, he said  that  merger

would  be carried out according to the terms envisaged

in  the  White  Paper on merger. He said nobody  could

alter that. But I would like to ask here whether  this

provision   has  been  agreed  to  by  the   Singapore

Government.  Who has changed the terms  of  the  White

Paper on merger? Another question I would like to  ask

is  whether this expenditure was incurred before  16th

September, 1963.

no  connection between this expenditure and the  terms

of  the  White  Paper on merger. This expenditure  was

incurred at the beginning of 1963.



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is there any other Member who wishes

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

I  feel  that  the  answer given by  the  Minister  is

entirely  irrelevant.  In  actual  fact,  he  has  not

replied  to  my  question. He merely  said  that  this

expenditure was incurred at the beginning of 1963.  He

did  not  say whether the expenditure on the  Military

Forces was before or after 16th September, 1963. If he

said  that the sum was incurred before 16th September,

1963, then I say the Government was right in doing so.

But  the Government have no right to do so after  16th

September,  1963. The Minister said that  the  British

Forces stationed in Singapore are meant to protect us.

Since there are British Forces here to protect us, why

should there be a need for a Singapore Military Force?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong) (In</b>

<b>Mandarin):</b> Does the Member for Bukit Panjang mean that

when  the  British Forces go away, then the Indonesian

Forces  would move in? So that it is his intention  to

see  that the British Forces would leave and  also  to

dissolve our own Military Forces. This would then be a

convenient   situation   for  the   Indonesian   fifth

columnists or even their Army to come in. I feel  that

his  hostility  towards the British  Forces  and  even

towards our own Military Forces is uncalled for.  They

should  have regard for the defence of the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I cannot understand is their question

on   the  allowances  for  housing  accommodation   to

personnel  of  the Singapore Military  Forces.  Before

Malaysia  Day, this expenditure would be  incurred  by

the Singapore Government. This sum of money which was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



expended   was   handed  over  to  the   Housing   and

Development Board. So in the end the money is still in

Singapore.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he mean that we should not maintain a force

such as the Singapore Military Forces just because the

British  Forces are here to defend Singapore  from  an

attack  by  the  Barisan's friends? Do they  hope  the

Indonesians would invade by the front door or the back

door?  No  matter how they propagandise  to  fool  the

people, the people will not listen to them in the end.

They can also talk of Ngo Dinh Diem and Madam Ngo Dinh

Nhu. If we were like Ngo Dinh Diem, then we would  not

see  them  any  more in this House.  They  might  even

expect an accident any time they walk on the road. But

now  some  of  them  are  at liberty  to  walk  around

Singapore  in safety. This shows that if we were  like

Ngo Dinh Diem, they would not have this liberty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their speeches only go to show that they have been

defeated  in all respects and are not able to persuade

the people into believing them. There is only one hope

for  them,  that is, when Indonesia sends  her  troops

into  Singapore to frustrate the will  of  the  people

here. Therefore, through military might and force they

hope  in  the end that their friends in gaol  will  be

released  and  eventually ride over the heads  of  the

people.  [Interruption] You who  sit  opposite  cannot

release  your  friends even if  you  should  form  the

government  because  this  is  a  matter  within   the

jurisdiction of the Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has been shouting that the

P.A.P. have  sold out the interests of the  Left-wing

movement.  I ask him: who has sold out whom?  Actually

they  are the traitors. In the past Assembly when some

of  them were Ministers they had signed pledges.  Some

of  them  who now sit here were in the P.A.P. and  we

were  blinded for a time. That is why the  Member  for

the people who have betrayed the Left-wing movement.

to  see  them and all of them had signed a  pledge  to

support  our political platform and policies  and  the

principle  of independence through merger.  There  was

only one among them who did not betray us, and that is

Mr  Devan Nair. The rest of them betrayed us in spite

of their pledges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask them: how many of them were not former

P.A.P. members? The Member for Jalan Kayu was an  ex-

member  of the P.A.P. There are others. At the moment,

I  am  unable to check up P.A.P. records,  but  it  is

likely that many of them in this House had been P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government are asking provision for $408,000 as

$408,000  be used for compensation to be paid  to  the

settlers  in the Toa Payoh area which will be  cleared

for development purposes? In tabling this amendment  I

do  not want to oppose this provision. I just want the

Government  to  tell  me. The  Minister  for  National

Development has said the compensation rate is not just

and  the  Government is prepared to alter the rate.  I

note  the  provisions under other items are very  big.

But this item of compensation for the resettled people

is   very  small.  The  Government  should  take  into

consideration  their  interests  so  that   they   can

resettle  in  other lands and start a  new  livelihood

again. Especially the dwellers in the Toa Payoh  area.

In  the past, the Government have been trying to solve

the  housing  shortage  problem and  their  livelihood

problem,  but  now we do not condemn the  Government's

effort  in  this field, since the Government  want  to

resettle  them  in  other areas. But  the  problem  of

20,000 people who have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>

Government  should  take  a responsible  attitude.  In

resettling  the dwellers in the Toa Payoh area  before

the  scheme starts, I hope the Government will  modify

the  compensation rate and announce it to the  people,

and  also to announce how the resettlement schemes are

going  to  be  carried out, because there are  various

economic  activities in the Toa Payoh area. There  are

farmers,    shopkeepers,   handicraft   workers    and

horticulturists. Their economic activities are diverse

in  nature.  If  the  Government  pay  them  the  same

compensation  rate,  then it  will  create  a  lot  of

problems. The Government's attitude should be flexible

and  not  adhere strictly to the laws and regulations,

and  pay $200 as compensation to the florists and  the

horticulturists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Government should consider the

problem that if these people are resettled on a  piece

of  land  which is not fertile, the Government  should

think  of other ways to help them. They should provide

alternative  employment.  The  compensation  must   be

adequate  in  order  to ensure  that  they  can  start

afresh. I do not intend to elaborate on the conditions

of  compensation.  Before they start resettling  these

people,  they  should improve the  resettlement  area,

that is, that a supply of water should be provided for

those  areas and that the Government should  see  that

the  land  should be suitable for farming. In  certain

resettlement areas the soil is so poor that the farmer

cannot  cultivate anything. Therefore, the area chosen

for  resettlement  must be fertile  and  suitable  for

farming so as to enable the farmers to carry on  their

farming  activities. I would just  like  to  ask  this

question  and I hope the Government would  give  me  a

satisfactory reply.

Barisan  Members have instigated the settlers  in  Toa

Payoh  not  to co-operate with the Government  in  the

resettlement  scheme. When the project  was  launched,

they    unreasonably   obstructed   the   Government's

resettlement plan. The Government plan to develop  Toa

Payoh.  This  will be carried Out in  several  stages.

Then   the   pro-Communist  elements  instigated   the

residents not to co-operate with the Government and to

refuse  the  Government's  compensation  terms.  Their

motive is to obstruct the Government's plan to develop

Toa  Payoh into a satellite town. Everybody knows that

the  Toa  Payoh  plan  is to  make  it  into  a  first

satellite town comprising about 600 acres of land  and

250,000  people  who can be accommodated  there.  This

plan cannot be stopped just because of the instigation

and  the activities of the pro-Communist Barisan.  The

Government will bring better livelihood for the people

of  Singapore.  They  also have a  plan  to  meet  the

demands  of  the  people  in the  face  of  the  rapid

increase of population in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I do

not  like  the  Parliamentary Secretary  who,  in  the

course   of  his  speech,  mentioned  again  Communist

instigation.  What I said was that if  the  Government

had  given them adequate compensation, then who  would

not  want  to  remove? Who wants to stay in  an  attap

house  and  not want to move into a modern  structure?

You  think  they  do  not want to move  into  an  air-conditioned house but prefer to stay in a  dirty  hut?

The  question is that these people do not have  money.

They  cannot remove because the compensation given  by

the Government is not reasonable. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for  National Development has also  told  us

that  the  Government want to revise the  compensation

rate,  which  shows  that the  rate  as  in  force  is

unreasonable.  So the question is not whether  anybody

had  instigated any of the settlers. The  question  is

the equity of compensation. For instance, if you force

hawkers to some site very far away, it will amount  to

unemployment  to  these hawkers who cannot  ply  their

trade  in  the  areas  they are to  settle.  Have  the

Government   considered  this   problem?   Have   they

considered  all  this?  For  instance,  if  bean-curd

makers  are resettled in areas which are not  suitable

for their trade, their livelihood will be affected. So

I  hope the Government can pay more attention and give

more  consideration to this aspect. I hope  they  will

announce  their plans and their compensation  rate  to

the  people  in  order to enable the  people  to  know

whether  the  compensation rate and other  things  are

reasonable.  Because in the past many people  had  the

impression  that the Government had deceived  them  by

being  told  that they could go to certain  Government

departments to get their compensation, but  when  they

returned they found their houses had been pulled  down

by  demolition  squads  and riot  squads.  So  if  the

Government can enlighten these people as to  the  rate

of compensation, they will be satisfied. Nobody can be

instigated ---

<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  was talking about the Government's policy in regard

to  the  resettlement and enforced removal of settlers

and  squatters.  The  Government are  not  adopting  a

policy of an enlightened and democratic government but

a policy which is not befitting a good government. For

instance,  Government officers went round to  ask  the

settlers concerned to move out to some other areas  or

else  they  would  be  moved  out  by  force.  As   an

inducement, they said that the Government  would  give

each  of  them a certain sum of money to help them  to

move  out,  but  in  the  end  nothing  happened.  The

promises  were not kept by them. This is not  the  way

the  Government  should carry out  their  resettlement

policy. The settlers did not mean to just stay on  the

land.  There is the question of compensation  for  the

loss  of their livelihood. If the Government want them

to  remove  from certain areas, they should take  into

consideration  the loss of their livelihood.  On  this

question,  the Government have been playing  politics.

If  they had been defeated in the last election,  then

during the last stages of their rule, they would  have

behaved worse than at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some farmers refused to remove, the Government

used riot squad vans, police, demolition personnel and

bulldozers  to  forcibly  evict  them.  Why  did   the

Government take such inhuman action against the people

concerned? Why did they adopt such forceful and brutal

means to bulldoze through the houses and the vegetable

plots of the farmers concerned? This goes to show that

the  Government have not been quite proper in the  way

they   dealt   with  the  farmers.   The   Toa   Payoh

resettlement scheme involves the livelihood  of  about

20,000  people. The Government should  also  think  in

terms  of  their  economic well-being and  livelihood.

Because  of  the limited vegetable plots  and  limited

area  for  growing agricultural produce in Toa  Payoh,

the farmers can fetch higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



prices for their produce, but by asking them to remove

to  some  other  outlying areas,  the  Government  are

causing  them to suffer a loss. The Government  should

also  see  that  the areas allocated to the  resettled

farmers are suitable for agricultural purposes.  Also,

when  these  people are resettled in  outlying  areas,

they wilt have to spend more money on transportation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have been telling the public that

they  intend to help the farmers increase  their  farm

produce and lower their costs of production. They also

say  that they will develop the rural areas. I do  not

say  that this is not good, but they should, first  of

all,  pay  more  attention to the  livelihood  of  the

farmers and the people concerned and not make  this  a

political propaganda issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the Government-benchers gone round to see these

areas  for  themselves? If they have a  conscience,  I

think they will shed tears when they see the miserable

living  conditions  of those settlers  who  have  been

asked  to  move out, because members of the demolition

squad have even used parangs and other tools in a cold-blooded  way.  The  Government have  not  paid  enough

attention to the difficulties and economic problems of

the farmers and the rate of compensation. On the other

hand, they have forced the removal of farmers and they

brand  those who do not want to be evicted as trouble-makers.  If they resort to force and brutality without

any  consideration for human rights and other  things,

then  these people who are forced to leave their farms

and  homesteads  will naturally show their  anger  and

hatred.  So  I  hope in respect of their  resettlement

scheme  the Government will announce in advance  their

plans  as to the parts of Singapore that will be  used

as  resettlement  areas and the  sites  that  will  be

acquired.  They  should  also  publish  the  rate   of

compensation and other relevant details  in  order  to

help the people concerned to enable them to understand

and  comply with the Government's plans, so that  they

will be resettled ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member is repeating himself.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Choa Chu Kang get

on  to  some  other arguments? He has said four  times

there.  We have ten minutes more on this item. Can  he

go on to something new?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have only a few questions to ask. The point I  have just

mentioned  is,  firstly, the  Government  should announce

their plans and secondly, the removal of  the squatters

should  be  effected  only  after   careful consideration,

taking into account the housing problem

and  the  rate of compensation. The Government  should

use  money  where  it is properly needed  and  not  on

community centres, etc.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I tried

to be fair to the Member. When I first made my answer,

I  tried to clarify briefly. It appears to me that the

Member  for  Choa  Chu Kang who  has  asked  that  the

question  of  resettlement  should  not  be  used   as

political  propaganda, has himself  embarked  on  that

line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the allegations are that we forcibly evicted these people and broke up their homes. I had no opportunity to speak the other day on a similar matter. He alleges that the police and bulldozers wrecked the houses and that the Malays came out with their parangs. This is a communal matter. He

brought in the Malays as well, alleging that they came

out  with  their parangs. It is very irresponsible  of

the  Member to say this. If anything untoward were  to

take  place  as  a  result of what he  has  said,  the

responsibility  for  it should rest  squarely  on  his

shoulders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of resettlement of those persons who are staying in Toa Payoh and who are involved in this scheme I have to say this. If it had not been for the activities of the Country People's Association who are pro-Barisan and pro-Communists, the resettlement scheme could have been carried out

peacefully. But because of the whispering campaign and

rumours



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



spread  by  members of the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

Country  People's Association among those persons  who

are  involved in the resettlement scheme, these people

remain adamant. Also, because they are forced by these

irresponsible   people  they   have   to   stay   put.

[Interruption] Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask him to withdraw

the word "lie" which he has used just now - "bohong" in

Malay.  I  demand  that  he withdraw  that  word,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I say that it is unparliamentary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been stated in this House that the Ministry of National Development will reconsider the question of payment of compensation to the people involved in resettlement, but if the matter is repeated over and over again, it merely shows that the Members opposite want to exploit this situation

for political purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in charge of matters pertaining to land including resettlement. We do not go and destroy illegal houses while the occupants are away. In fact, we give them two years' notice, and the hon. Member opposite knows it well. It is only after this period that we go about demolishing illegal

houses - and that also after having given them a number

of notices to vacate.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this unfair? Is this what you say that we are

using  forceful methods? If it is alleged  that  these

houses were demolished white the occupants were  away,

this is completely untrue. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as

I  know,  with  regard  to most  of  the  resettlement

schemes  carried  out because of Government  projects,

the  Government usually offer alternative sites  after

serious  consideration. In fact,  facilities  too  are

provided,  such as water supply, roads,  etc.  Do  you

know  that  the resettlement of a family  involves  an

expenditure of about $8,000? The expenditure  incurred

by Government to purchase land amounts to about $4,000

to  $5,000. And then to lay on water supply, to lay on

roads, etc. Do the members of the Barisan Sosialis not

see  all  this? If only they will see and be  true  to

themselves, then they will appreciate this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the policy of this Government is against the

interest of the people, I believe the Government would

never  be  able to win the elections by  obtaining  37

seats.  The  people have been cheated  twice  already.

They  cannot be cheated a third time. The words  which

have  been uttered by the hon. Member opposite  should

not be repeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have spoken in a parliamentary manner without wanting to involve matters which are irrelevant, but the Member for Choa Chu Kang still brings up matters which have been repeated in this House while the Minister for National Development was dealing with the matter of resettlement. The theme is

the  same and the person bringing up the matter is the

same.  Only  the date is different. Is  there  nothing

more  profitable for us to discuss here than to repeat

the  same thing over and over again? Even if they say

these  are constructive arguments, they have  ulterior

motives. In an indirect way, what they say will defeat

the good that the Government are trying to bring about

for the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, therefore, I say  it

is  only those whose vision is blurred who cannot  see

clearly. It is only those who have defective ears  who

cannot  hear  the  good  that is  being  done  by  the

Government. It is only people who are indifferent  who

cannot  understand and appreciate what  good  we  have

done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, the

Minister  for  Finance  desires  that  I  should  give

details  with  regard to my dissatisfaction  with  the

P.U.B. Let me now give you certain facts. In the first

place, I wish to bring your attention to the supply of

electricity.  We can see that in the Katong  area  and

Tanglin area, where rich people live, there are street

lights in the roads and the small lanes, and there  is

an  adequate  supply of electricity available  to  the

residents  there. But, on the other  hand,  in  places

such  as my own constituency and Changi 7 m.s.,  there

is  one  area  still solely occupied by Europeans  and

this  place  is  adequately supplied with  electricity

because it is a place for the rich people. But in slum

areas  the situation is entirely different and  cannot

compare  favourably  to areas  occupied  by  the  rich

people.  Although  we do not deny  the  fact  that  we

should  supply  electricity to  the  rich,  we  cannot

deprive  similar facilities to the poor. In  the  area

that  I  have in mind, there is not an adequate supply

of electricity and installation of street lights. This

is a contrast to those places occupied by European and

rich people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give you another example. At 6¾ up to 8¾ m.s.

Tampines  Road,  there  is  an  inadequate  supply  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> I would ask Members to refrain from

any  comments when the Minister for Finance is on  the

or comments from others. Mr Poh, we have only got ten

minutes more. Have you made all your points, or do you

want to give some more examples? I think you have made

your  point,  that in some places there is electricity

and  in others there is none. There is no need  to  go

into some more examples. Can you proceed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, I am

giving  you all these details in order to satisfy  the

Minister  for  Finance who has  asked  me  to  provide

details  to  show my dissatisfaction. There  are  many

other places with which I am not satisfied, but I just

give you enough examples to show my dissatisfaction. I

do not want to proceed further with my examples.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Tampines  - I do not know how his mind works - it  is  a

one-track mind, discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Mr Minister, I do not want any

comments on how the mind of the Member for Tanglin  or

the Member for Tampines works. If you have anything to

say  on this particular subject, I will listen to you.

But  if  you are merely commenting on Members  of  the

Opposition, I am not prepared to allow you to go on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. The

Member says that in the poor areas - the squatter areas

- there is no street lighting. Before we can put up any

street lighting under the Local Government Integration

Ordinance, I think, it is stated that the streets must

be  made up to certain specifications. Now, the  areas

he has mentioned where there is street lighting, these

streets   are   made  up  to  certain  specifications,

specifications acceptable to the City Council, to  the

Public  Utilities  Board,  and  therefore  the  street

lights are installed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is another point. The reason why we do not

allow  unauthorised houses to be put up is  that  they

are put up in a disorderly manner and it is impossible

for us to lay streets which are worthy of our city and

which   are,   shall  I  say,  acceptable   means   of

communication. It is not a question of whether that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



area  is  poor or whether that area is rich. It  is  a

question of which area is well planned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, I have

never  talked about houses or unauthorised structures.

I  am  just complaining that in the areas occupied  by

the  rich  men, even in small lanes there  are  street

lights; whereas in places occupied by the poor people,

whose  occupants  far outnumber the  rich  in  certain

areas, there is no provision of street lamps. That  is

my  dissatisfaction which I am raising to show to  the

Minister  for  Finance at his request. But  all  of  a

sudden  you  have an Acting Minister for  Finance  who

talks about houses and unauthorised buildings.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> About street lights the Member

must  remember that the building of street lights  has

been  going on for perhaps 150 years, and not all  the

street  lights in Singapore today were  built  in  the

last  4½  years under the P.A.P. Government. True,  in

the past there was preference for Europeans, we do not

deny  that  - during colonial times - and I  agree  this

happened. So, what does the Member want us to do? Pull

down the streetlights in Tanglin? Surely not. No,  the

way to do it is to make sure that electricity goes  to

places  which were neglected in the past. At  present,

the  Government  have worked out an  emergency  scheme

whereby electricity can be conveyed to villages  which

formerly had no hope of getting electricity.  The  way

of  doing it is not to maintain the high standards  of

electric mains in the rural areas, where they have  to

dig  ditches and have underground cables, but to  have

electric cables on poles. An extensive system has been

worked  out  and planned, and the scheme will  be  put

into  operation. For all I know, it might have already

started in certain areas, but certainly the money  for

the  extension of electricity supply to  villages  has

been  approved.  And, of course, this thing  has  been

going  on for the last 4 years. But surely the  Member

for Tampines does not expect very much to be done in 4

years - one and a half centuries of colonial neglect to

be set right by the P.A.P. in 4 years. I mean, that is

being completely unreasonable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, perhaps for the record, I should say just what

this  $12.5  million  is for.  This  year  the  Public

Utilities Board, that is the Gas Department, the Water

Department  and the Electricity Department engages  in

capital  construction projects to a  very  substantial

amount, something like $50 to $60 million a year,  and

that is excluding major capital undertakings like  the

Pasir Panjang Power Station or the Johore River Scheme

or the Scudai River Scheme. These development projects

will  be  the  extension of water  mains,  electricity

mains, gas lights, the installation of substations and

so  on and so forth. For a lot of the capital for such

extension works, the departments themselves were  able

to  meet from their current revenue surpluses. It  was

because of the major undertakings that the P.U.B. are

now  having  in  hand - that is, the power  station  in

Pasir  Panjang,  which will eventually cost  something

like  $70 to $80 million, the Johore River Scheme  and

the  Scudai Scheme - that they find that they will  not

be able to meet the demands of both the major projects

as  well  as their normal expansion projects. That  is

why  they  have to come to the Government  for  loans.

These  loans  are on fairly reasonable  terms  for  20

years  at  5¾ per cent simple interest, and they  will

help  the P.U.B. to bring about just the services that

the Member for Tampines wants, that is, electricity to

the villages, water mains wherever it is possible. But

we have to remember this, that it is also not possible

to provide electricity or water to each and every home

in  Singapore. Supposing a group of 3 families at  the

end  far away from the main lines, I mean just to  run

the  lines  there will cost such a substantial  amount

that  it  would  be subsidising these 3 families.  But

where  there are compact settlements of 100 homes,  50

homes, it will not be long before most of these  rural

areas  will be provided with electricity.  I  hope  my

explanation satisfies the Member for Tampines.

can range over the whole of the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  as well as over the amendment.  Other

than the mover of the original motion, that is to say,

the  Prime  Minister,  the Members  who  have  already

spoken  on  this debate will not be allowed  to  speak

once  again. Those who have as yet not spoken will  be

given  a chance to speak. When last we adjourned  this

debate, the Member for Jalan Kayu had the Floor.  Will

he  indicate whether he wishes to carry on or  whether

he had finished his speech then?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, for the past one week the debate in this

House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



has  revealed several matters and facts. I  will  talk

about these facts. The first fact is to show that  the

reactionaries in Singapore and Malaya have been led by

the  nose by the British, who imposed Malaysia on  the

people  here, resulting in difficulties and hardships.

All these can be seen from the evasive attitude of the

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fact is that the P.A.P. resort to dirty

tactics. They are opportunists and they dare not  face

realities  brought about by Malaysia. They are  making

use  of propaganda and other tactics to put the  blame

on the Barisan Sosialis. This is a very low tactic and

is despicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third fact is that the Prime Minister is

dreaming  of  the P.A.P. being able to  supersede  the

M.C.A. in the Federation. This can be seen  from  his

speeches when he came back from London. When  he  came

back  from London, he said that it was only the P.A.P.

who  could  fight the Communists. It is very  low  and

mean  of  them to appease the British and curry  their

favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that this House is full of foul

words.  Every  now and then they talk about  Communist

bogeys.  Even their Back-benchers indulge in such  low

tactics.   The  P.A.P. dare  not  face  the   Central

Parliament. Therefore, they have to resort to the  use

of  the Communist bogey. We hope the Ministers and the

Party  in power will be calm in their attitude and  to

discuss with us how to urge the Central Government  to

resolve   the   differences  between   Indonesia   and

Malaysia.  They  should not play  party  politics  and

bring  hardship on the people of Singapore. These  are

the  characteristics of the debate  in  the  past  few

days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about what the Prime Minister has

said.  In  moving his motion, the Prime  Minister  has

said that when the Yang di-Pertuan Negara came to this

House  to deliver his speech there was no gun  salute.

That  means  that the power has been  shifted  to  the

Federation. It is not the shifting of the  power,  but

the sell-out of our power.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore are very concerned about

this  power. They are not concerned about the question

whether there should be a gun salute when the Yang di-Pertuan Negara comes to this House. What the people in

Singapore  are  concerned about is  their  citizenship

problem;  whether there is equality on  the  issue  of

citizenship,  whether  there  is  equality  in   their

political  rights, whether their present problems  and

their  livelihood can be solved or not. These are  the

questions which our people are concerned about. But we

find  that  the Government Ministers and  their  Back-benchers dare not face stark realities. Their speeches

tend  to evade the fundamental problems affecting  the

people's  livelihood. Instead, they use all  sorts  of

epithets to cover up their sell-out of the interest of

the  people  of  Singapore. And they try  to  describe

Singapore as a paradise in South-East Asia. I want  to

reiterate what I have said in the past. That is,  what

we  have said and done is right. They are motivated by

our  desire to look after the interests of the people.

We  have  said  that  Malaysia was  brought  about  by

colonialism  and imperialism to replace the  so-called

divide-and-rule  policy of the past  colonial  regime.

This  divide-and-rule  policy can  be  seen  in  other

territories as well. We are able to see that Singapore

has  been  going backwards, retrogressing, politically

and  constitutionally. Mr Speaker, in  the  past  the

people of Singapore made great sacrifices to secure  a

semi  self-governing  status  for  Singapore.  If  the

Government  could  be  united  with  the  people   and

continue  with  this  kind of  struggle  in  order  to

achieve  full internal self-government, then it  would

be very good But, regrettably, after the establishment

of  Malaysia,  the  ruling  clique  in  Singapore  has

collaborated   with   the   Central   Government    in

surrendering  all  the  rights and  interests  to  the

Central Government, thereby resulting in the people of

Singapore   losing  equality  in  the   economic   and

political  fields and other rights. In  the  past  the

Prime Minister told us that we would get equality  and

a  fair chance in respect of citizenship rights. Since

the citizens from the Federation of Malaya could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



come to Singapore, we should also be allowed to go  to

Malaya  to  take  part  in all  sorts  of  activities.

Otherwise it would be a kind of sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the present situation, Singapore's

position is one that is being ruled. We are losing our

natural rights, and in the end Singapore will become a

colony  of  the Federation. At present  we  have  only

obligations and duties. We have no rights  in  return.

We  have  the obligation to pay taxes but we  have  no

right  to  receive  anything out of these  taxes.  The

Ministers  and  Government  Back-benchers  have  never

dared to mention this question. According to the Prime

Minister,  we  have stepped into a new  phase  in  our

history in achieving independence through merger  with

Malaya.  This kind of phrase has been used to  deceive

the  people.  It  is used as a kind of  propaganda  to

deceive the people. Malaysia has been brought about by

the  British  in collaboration with the Federation  of

Malaya.  It was also abetted by the P.A.P. Government.

Malaysia  has  been  brought about through  the  joint

efforts  of the three Parties. They even went  to  the

extent  of resorting to force to bring about Malaysia.

They  arrested anti-Malaysian nationals  in  order  to

achieve their purpose. Now that these people in  Sabah

and Sarawak have been arrested, they have now come  to

Singapore  to arrest these people. The Prime  Minister

should  admit these facts. They talk about the  United

Nations   Investigation  Commission  to   the   Borneo

territories to inquire into the wishes of  the  people

in  regard to the establishment of Malaysia. In  fact,

they were only sent there after the Malaysia plan  had

been  conceived and even carried out.  If  the  result

showed  that  the people did not agree to  merger  and

Malaysia, then what would be their next step? We  know

their  tactics.  Ngo  Dinh Diem could  remain  as  the

President even though the majority of the people hated

him.  So this does not show that if you have a certain

amount  of  votes you have the support of the  people,

because  the Government has control over the  election

machinery. It does not show that if you are  in  power

you  have the support of the people. It does not  also

mean that the results of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



the  U.N. Investigation Commission have reflected the

true wishes of the people there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the series of incidents consequent upon

the  establishment of Malaysia go to explain  why  the

British  and the P.A.P. wanted to bring about Malaysia

as quickly as possible. Their motive was clear to all.

There are many reasons for them to do so. I will  just

mention  a  few evil things that they have done.  Many

members  of  our  Party have been arrested.  Even  our

Assemblymen have been arrested. These are some of  the

evils  that they have done in collaboration  with  the

colonialists and reactionaries. Some are forced to  go

into  hiding.  I  believe that if Government  were  to

bring  them to open court for a trial, they would  not

run away. They have smeared us as rioters in the past.

Yet  we  did not run away. These people who  have  now

been  arrested are innocent. If you were to set  up  a

court  and  bring them to open trial, would  they  run

away?  I  believe they would not run away. They  would

come out courageously to face the trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain civic organisations have been banned by the

Government on the pretext that they are pro-Communist.

This  is  also another deception. The real  reason  is

that  these  bodies  are actually  looking  after  the

interests  of  the  people. They  are  in  very  close

contact with them. Their relationship with the  people

is  very  good since they are furthering the interests

of  the  people. Since you are anti-people and jealous

of  their good relationship with the people, you  have

no other alternative but to ban these organisations in

order  that  you  might  gain  something  out  of  the

situation. [Interruption]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following these arrests, the P.A.P. Government

launched other arrests such as the arrests of  Nanyang

University  students and other people. They  are  thus

causing panic among them in order to achieve their aim

of  destroying Chinese education. They  also  want  to

bring  about  a  general reign  of  terror  among  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step was to take action against the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore because he

was not so obedient to the P.A.P. We can see this very

clearly from the newspapers. Mr Tan Lark Sye, who has

been  supporting Nanyang University with all his might

and  wealth,  was deprived of his citizenship  by  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So no matter how

much  the  Prime Minister and the Ministers may  evade

their responsibilities and put the blame



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



on  the  Central  Government, they cannot  escape  the

results  of  their responsibilities and  actions.  All

these have been brought about by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the

fancies  of  our Singapore Prime Minister  who  dreams

about  becoming  the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  From

his  speeches recently we could see that he  had  been

indulging in souring up the good relationship  between

the  M.C.A. (Malaya) and U.M.N.O. in order to  achieve

his   purpose  of  becoming  the  Prime  Minister   of

Malaysia.  We  and  even the Tunku himself  could  see

through his intrigues. The Tunku is not a fool. We can

make  an  assessment of the political development  and

the  situation in Singapore and Malaya. His hopes  can

never   materialise,  because,  first  of   all,   the

interests of M.C.A. (Malaya) and U.M.N.O. leaders  are

closely related. The Prime Minister cannot achieve his

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that some of these P.A.P.

Assemblymen have come from U.M.N.O. Before the  P.A.P.

was  a political power, the U.M.N.O. and the Singapore

People's Alliance had had an agreement between them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of

order. This does not relate to the present debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate on the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's  Speech  is  very wide.  It  covers  so  much

ground.  It  is difficult to say what is  relevant  or

irrelevant. But on this particular matter, I rule that

the  Member  for Jalan Kayu is being relevant.  Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Even the Tunku can

remember  these  facts and they cannot be  obliterated

and  denied. The Singapore Prime Minister's  fancy  to

become  the  Prime Minister of Malaysia is really  his

own  personal fantasy, because at the moment  all  the

rights  and  powers  of the people  of  Singapore  are

already in the hands of the Federation. The people  of

Singapore have been deprived of every right and power.

Unless  the  Prime Minister can stay in the Federation

for about ten years to get citizenship papers from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



the  Federal Government, he has no chance  of  seizing

power  and becoming the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  I

would like to tell you this fact. His fancy will  lead

him nowhere. In the end he will get nothing.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Jalan Kayu has

repeated  three times that the Prime Minister  desires

to become the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Can we go on

to  something  else? He is repeating himself  here.  I

think  he  has  made his point clear.  Please  do  not

repeat but get on to some other matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was

trying  to persuade the Prime Minister not to  indulge

in  fantasy by enumerating facts and events and I  was

putting forward my arguments for his benefit.  If  the

P.A.P. have  a  brother party in  the  Federation  of

Malaya  like  the Socialist Front, then perhaps  there

can  be a political future for them in the Federation.

But  since  the  Socialist  Front  and  those  in  the

socialist camp have kicked them out and have condemned

them  as  stooges of neo-colonialists, they  therefore

cannot achieve their ultimate aim of seizing power  in

the  Federation. The most important thing is that  the

British  have now found that the Tunku is more capable

of looking after British interests in this part of the

world  than  the P.A.P., otherwise they might  have  a

chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me now touch on some of the

utterances  made  by  the  Minister  for  Labour.

The Minister  for  Labour has been rather  unique  in

his speeches in the last few days ---

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not debating the Minister

for  Labour or what the Minister has said for the last

three  days.  We  are  debating  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech and the amendment to the speech.  Can

the  Member  leave the Minister for Labour  alone  and

what  he has said in this Assembly? Otherwise we  will

go on to that. I have tried before to prevent personal

attacks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  because the Minister for Labour had attacked

us  after we moved this amendment. So I am just  going

to  deal with several points in his speech to show his

hooliganism. The Minister for Labour appears to  be  a

good  candidate for Assistant Anti-Communist  Minister

of  the Ministry of Culture. His speeches are full  of

grandmother's talk. And in this respect he is  similar

to the Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I greatly suspect that because the Minister for Labour has been successful in this respect, he has been able to become a Minister. This is very welcome to and appreciated by the British, because the present Minister for Labour has learnt well from the Minister for Culture in calling others

Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> On a point of order. The

Member  should not be talking about the  Minister  for

Labour,  but  he has been for the last  two  or  three

minutes  talking  about the Minister  for  Labour  and

nothing else.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are not discussing the Minister for

Culture  or the Minister for Labour. I appreciate  the

Minister  for  Labour has spoken on this  debate.  The

Member   for  Jalan  Kayu  may,  if  he  likes,   make

references to what the Minister has said in his speech

on   this   debate,  but  otherwise  please  make   no

references. So he is not in order in attacking. Can we

get on to the subject matter of the debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Perhaps we

may be of some assistance to the Member for Jalan Kayu

if  a  short  adjournment is  given  so  that  he  can

rearrange  the paragraphs, otherwise he will  have  to

proceed according to what was planned for him.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. Please

proceed, Mr Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

here is a newspaper of the 10th of December. Here  you

have a full coverage of the speech by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister for Labour on this page and on the other

page  [Indicating]. So I am going to quote, if I  want

to  quote from the newspapers, it will take a  lot  of

time,  but I do not desire to do so, i have  to  point

out   here,  Mr  Speaker,  that  "Communist"  is   an

expression which has been used by the reactionary  and

colonial  elements against patriots of  countries  all

over   the  world.  For  example,  the  British,   the

Federation,  the  P.A.P.,  in  order  to  take  action

against  the  national patriots in this  part  of  the

world,   have  resorted  to  the  adoption   of   this

expression.  Without  using  this  tactic,  they  just

cannot  do  anything against the Barisan Sosialis.  If

they  want to have an open trial against us,  then  we

will  be acquitted and discharged. Those found  guilty

will be the P.A.P. - guilty of treason and treachery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you some more facts, Mr Speaker. I was

talking  about Ngo Dinh Diem, who called the nuns  and

the monks in South Vietnam Communists. Before Lee Kuan

Yew  became the Prime Minister, he was also  called  a

Communist.  You can refer to the back  copies  of  the

newspapers.  So let me tell you the use of "Communist"

against  political opponents is the best  method  ever

available.  As  I  have said last week,  Mr  Speaker,

Communists  existed in the past. As  far  as  I  know,

there are no Communists now. The Communists came  into

existence  against  the Fascists of  the  Japanese  in

Singapore  and Malaya. They took up arms  against  the

Japanese  and  later  on against the  British  in  the

national  interest. Now there are no more  Communists.

But  the Barisan Sosialis, which is a legitimate Party

registered according to the law, has also been branded

Communist.  It is a pity that they have to  resort  to

this   means  of  calling  their  political  opponents

Communists. This only goes to show their inability and

incompetency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour said last week that Singapore was a paradise on earth. His talk was full of exaggeration. He described life in Singapore as happy and gay. I give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



you one illustration. When he has gained the favour of

the  Prime Minister, of course, his life is happy  and

gay.  Why? Because he gets a salary of $2,500 a  month

as  a  Minister  and  he  gets another  $500  a  month

allowance and he has a car.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> On a point of order. The Minister

for  Labour is getting $2,500 a month salary. What  has

that  got  to  do  with  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Jalan Kayu seems

persistently to want to attack the Minister for Labour

in  spite of my ruling. Please forget the Minister for

Labour. Let us get on with the debate. Otherwise there

will  be further attacks from this side and we  go  on

and on forever. Mr Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am just basing my talk on the facts related to  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. His speech is full of

smears against the Barisan Sosialis. Now, if we cannot

explain  away  their  points,  that  will  amount   to

admitting  that the Barisan Sosialis is to  be  blamed

for  the confrontation. So, in order to show that they

are  trying to indulge in humbug propaganda to deceive

the  people,  I wish that you will give me  sufficient

time, Mr Speaker, to explain the position clearly  in

order  that the people of Singapore will not be misled

by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister said in his speech, Singapore is a

paradise  on earth comparable to New York in  America,

and  he  says  that  Singapore  is  the  New  York  of

Malaysia.  If  you can say, according to  facts,  that

Singapore is the New York of Malaysia, then we will be

very  happy.  Then they try to compare Singapore  with

Indonesia  and  say that Indonesia is a hundred  times

worse  off  than Singapore, but this is  entirely  the

business  of Indonesia. Of course, we wish to  have  a

happier life. We have a chair, we want to have a sofa,

that  is  a natural desire. The people want to improve

their  livelihood from time to time. That goes without

saying. So I am just trying to say that if you want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



to  get the salary of the Minister as the basis to say

that  Singapore is a paradise, of course, it is  true,

but true only to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other question I wish to ask the

Minister for Labour. Why has he seen fit to evade  the

mention of workers who have to work under the hot  and

burning sun year in and year out? Why has he failed to

mention the fact that these labourers and workers  are

unable  to  earn enough to keep their  body  and  soul

together, that they are unable to have a decent  life?

Now, why has he failed to mention all these facts?  He

should  have mentioned taxi-drivers and trishaw riders

as the basis in saying whether Singapore is a paradise

on  earth  or  not. There is mounting unemployment  in

Singapore.  Students who have passed out  from  school

will go and join the ranks of unemployed labour. There

are  many graduates from the secondary schools who are

still  unemployed after years of graduation. Are these

not facts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope that those people, particularly the Minister for Labour, who say that Singapore is a paradise on earth will go round Singapore Island and see the large number of beggars and shoe-shine boys in the city of Singapore. They have only to sit down in Chinatown and then their legs will be pulled by these

shoe-shine  boys. Now, why should they  do  this,  why

should  they behave in this manner? They do so because

they  are  forced by circumstances, because  of  their

miserable  life. Are these not facts? If the Ministers

do  not  believe in what I say, they  can  go  to  the

People's Park for some time; then they will agree with

me. If they appreciate these facts, then they will not

dare  to indulge in the nonsense that Singapore  is  a

paradise on earth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they also stand up, on the other hand, and say

that Singapore has not sold out Chinese education. Our

colleagues  have already mentioned certain  points  in

this  regard,  but I wish to add to their  views.  The

Minister for Labour drew an analogy by saying that the

neighbouring countries were trying to destroy  Chinese

education and that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



were quite successful. But it is a pity that he should

have  drawn an analogy on this basis. If he is  right,

then there is no point for the people to struggle  for

a better life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to tell you now that the situation

regarding  education is not as he said. He  said  that

the  teachers are getting good salaries, the  students

are  well dressed and well fed. But there is one point

which  he  forgot, that is, the security of employment

of some teachers. If they do not get the favour of the

Party  or  the  principal, then  their  jobs  will  be

insecure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another point. There are many parents

who  wish  to send their children to aided schools  in

Chinese,  but the vacancies are all taken up.  So  the

only  thing  that  they can do is  to  go  to  English

schools. Is this not the way by which they take action

to destroy Chinese education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talk about the outlet of the Chinese school

students.  They are not fairly treated in  so  far  as

employment is concerned. The Senior III graduates even

find  it  difficult  to get jobs as  teachers  in  the

Chinese schools. This also shows that this is the best

way to force children not to go to Chinese schools, to

narrow  down their outlet in order to divert  children

to English schools in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to mention that the Minister for Labour

is  full  of the colonialistic outlook in his  speech.

There is one paragraph here in which he says that  the

amendment moved by the Barisan Sosialis, to  urge  the

P.A.P. to get the Central Government to negotiate with

Indonesia, is a means by which we wish to have foreign

interference in our local affairs. He goes on  to  say

that  if  we  should  abolish  all  British  bases  in

Singapore  tomorrow, then we will become an Indonesian

colony. This is what he has said.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it appears

that  the Barisan Sosialis are not debating the speech

of  His Excellency but the speech by the Minister  for

Labour.  It  appears to me that he is being irrelevant

to the speech by His Excellency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is relevant to reply to or make

comments  on the speeches of Members on the debate  in

question,  provided,  as I have  said,  there  are  no

personal attacks. Please proceed, Mr Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

perhaps  the Back-benchers of the Government have  not

heard  what the Ministers have said and they have  not

even read the newspapers about what they have said. If

they had, they would know that the Ministers' speeches

dealt with the amendment. But I will forget about them

now and go back to the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I wish to say that the speech made by the

Minister for Labour was purely in defence of the  rule

of  the  British  colonialists,  because  the  British

colonialists have no locus standi in this Chamber, and

so  the  Minister for Labour has come up to  speak  in

defence  of  the British colonialists. He becomes  the

mouthpiece of the British colonial masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past they were very fond of using such

expressions as "anti-national elements" and  the  rest

of  it.  I  think  it  is more appropriate  that  such

phrases  should be used on the P.A.P. Members.  It  is

they  who  are  anti-national, they who are  loyal  to

foreign forces and powers, it is not we in the Barisan

Sosialis who are so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few points to draw your attention to, Mr

Speaker.  For  example, the Minister for  Labour  said

that  the  people of Singapore will have no chance  of

getting  independence  if we  should  drive  away  the

British  because Indonesia is a big power.  So  if  we

should  drive  the British away, the Indonesians  will

come  in  and  then we will have no chance  to  become

independent. In other words, you must either be  ruled

by  the  British or by the Indonesians. That is  their

argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say Malaysia will bring prosperity. Now this is

again  another  humbug. I will put it  the  other  way

round. Malaysia brings neo-colonialism in this part of

the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour said also that the British have got bases in Singapore for well over a hundred years. True, nobody can ever deny it. I agree that the British have got bases in Singapore for well over a hundred years, but I must ask - in all these years, what have the British bases in Singapore done? Are

they here against possible Indonesian aggression? No.

Indonesia  became  independent only  during  the  last

decade. Did the British make use of military power  in

Singapore to exploit us, economically and politically?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the last point that I raise will be of interest to the Minister for Culture. I hope that the P.A.P. will try some means to resolve these differences between Malaysia and Indonesia and improve the trade relationship between the two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, why did the Indonesians want to

carry out confrontation? According to the Government's

report the Indonesians suffer more than we do. I  have

some doubts whether this is wholly a political matter.

Why  does  Indonesia want to oppose Malaysia?  Is  it

because  the first front-line is S.E.A.T.O.,  and  the

second   front-line  is  Malaysia  which   serves   to

safeguard political and economic interests? If  it  is

so, then we have to review the question of Malaysia in

the context of South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are countries which want to keep their

neutrality, the U.S.A. is trying to safeguard  British

and  U.S. imperialist interests. If they cannot  do

so, then they will remove Ngo Dinh Diem and company so

as  to  suppress the people. Now, when  they  fail  in

these  objectives, is this not what they want to carry

out  in this part of the world, by using Malaysia  for

their   purpose?  We  should  kick  out  the   British

imperialists.  We do not want them to protect  us.  We

can  look  after  ourselves. If we  are  peaceful  and

sincere in our negotiations with Indonesia, I dare say

they  will  not  carry on with confrontation,  because

they suffer more than we do by it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Indonesians have much

experience in getting rid of imperialists.  The  Dutch

were making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



use  of  West  Irian  to sabotage Indonesia  and  were

trying  to  undermine the social order  in  Indonesia.

That  is  why  Indonesia is afraid  that  the  foreign

powers are trying to make use of Malaysia to undermine

the security of Indonesia. If this is so, then we must

try   to  bring  about  negotiations  to  resolve  the

differences.  They  should  not  indulge  in   abusive

arguments which are not worthy of themselves.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I withdraw what I

have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Address of Thanks moved by our Prime Minister on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech on behalf of our Government on Friday, the 29th of November, 1963. Furthermore, it is my most sincere hope that this House unanimously express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Members, in the course of their

speeches,  have  made countless repetitions  of  false

allegations   against   the  People's   Action   Party

Government.  Their speeches were more or less  similar

and  sometimes identical in many respects, so much  so

that we on the Government benches wondered whether the

Barisan  Sosialis speakers were attempting to out-read

one  another. However, these repetitions only revealed

that  they  have  nothing concrete to say  apart  from

glorifying   Indonesia,  and  that  they   are   still

consoling  themselves and nursing their  wounds  which

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



suffered  at their unbelievable and miserable  defeats

in the general elections last September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Members have tried vigorously

to shift the blame on to the P.A.P. Government for the

unemployment  and  the Indonesian confrontation  which

has  resulted in an 8.7 per cent drop in our  economy.

It  is  actually the Barisan Sosialis who  are  to  be

responsible for these external threats. No one in  his

proper  senses  can  forget  or  deny  that  Indonesia

supported Malaysia when it was first brought  up.  But

when  Indonesia  saw  that anti-nationalist  and  pro-Communist elements both in Singapore and Sarawak  were

opposed to Malaysia, they were led into believing that

Malaysia  would  fail  and could  easily  be  crushed.

Consequently  they  mounted  a  confrontation   policy

against Malaysia. All these were brought about through

the instigations of the Communist Barisan Sosialis; as

a  result  of which trade relations between  Indonesia

and Singapore were severed, thereby causing a drop  of

8.7  per  cent in our State's economy and rendering  a

few thousand workers jobless. Our Government, however,

took   the   unprecedented  step  together  with   the

employers  concerned  to  pay  a  two-third's   salary

compensation  for six months for each worker  affected

so  as to enable the worker to look for another job in

the meantime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new nation, Malaysia today has to face both

external threats and pressures. But if Malaysia is  to

survive  and flourish, then I say it is the  paramount

duty of every citizen in Malaysia to be ever loyal  to

our  nation. In fact, the Indonesian confrontation has

done us a great service in further uniting the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy, Mr Speaker, Sir, when I observed

Barisan   Sosialis  Members  taking  their  oaths   of

allegiance on 22nd October, 1963, but today I am sadly

mistaken. Why is this so? Because it grieves me to see

that on the one hand they swear allegiance and collect

their  $500 monthly allowance as Assemblymen,  but  on

the other hand they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



condemn Malaysia as a British-inspired neo-colonialist

concept imposed on the people. But can the ten million

people  in  Malaya, Singapore, Borneo and  Sarawak  be

wrong  in wanting to have Malaysia? After taking their

oaths, the Barisan Sosialis Members have never at  any

time admitted that Malaysia exists. They only talk  of

Singapore  and Malaya. Let me once again  remind  them

that  anyone  who  actively aids and abets  aggression

against his own nation is a traitor and for that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Punggol has bud

occasion  to remember that I stopped the Minister  for

Culture  from  calling  the  Opposition  traitors.  So

please refrain from doing the same thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I put it this

way:  let me once again remind them that any  man  who

actively  aids  and abets aggression against  his  own

nation   will  be  severely  punished.  The  Communist

Barisan  Sosialis Members opposite have  not  answered

our  questions put to them. I therefore challenge them

to  answer the questions again. (a)  On whose side  are

they  - on  the side of Malaysia or Indonesia?  (b)   Do

they  want  things to get better between Malaysia  and

Indonesia, or do they want them to get worse? And  (c)

What   they   have  said  over  the   past   week   on

confrontation  and  loss of Indonesian  trade,  is  it

going to make things better or worse for Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the education policy of the State, the Member for

Jurong  alleged  that  our  Government  is  trying  to

destroy  Chinese education and culture, and asked  why

there is such a marked difference in the proportion of

students  in  the  four  streams  of  education.   The

allegations  are  absolutely not true.  In  fact,  our

Government is trying to raise the standard of  Chinese

education  in Singapore; also it is a fact universally

acknowledged  that  equal treatment  of  education  is

accorded to the four streams of education in Singapore

- namely,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



Malay, Tamil, Chinese and English. There is also  free

universal education for six years in primary  schools.

There  is  a  marked difference in the  proportion  of

students  in  the four language streams because  every

parent in Singapore has a right to choose the type  of

education he wishes his child to pursue, and for  that

matter  they  are frightened by the agitation  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis in Chinese schools, such as  strikes

by  students and examination boycotts. Every year more

than  40,000 children are registered for education  in

primary  schools  in the various language  media, and

every registered child has a place in school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is clear proof that the P.A.P. Government gives equal treatment in education. In the P.A.P. 1963 Election Manifesto, it was proposed to implement free secondary education as from 1964, but this proposal has to be postponed due to the setback in the State's economy as a result of

Indonesian confrontation, which the Barisan  Sosialis

proudly  claimed  in  their  Party  paper  that   they

started.  Who are to be blamed for all this? Yes,  the

Barisan Sosialis of course, for this!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not trying to paint a rosy picture about the PAP. Government's past achievements, for they are all evident; but I have to state the

naked  facts in answer to some of the wild  and  empty

accusations levelled at our Government by the  Barisan

Sosialis Members. It is also not our habit to  glorify

our success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rural areas are not forgotten. Rural development projects are taking place in almost every rural constituency. Kampong electrification schemes and street lighting are carried out. More public standpipes are installed; better kampong roads

are  constructed; bridges spanning canals and  streams

and  many  other social amenities are now extended  to

the  rural  folks.  All  these  developments  are  not

brought  about out of thin air as the Barisan Sosialis

have   claimed,   but  by  careful   calculation   and

intelligent planning on the part of the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I once

again  urge that for Malaysia to survive and flourish,

we must be solidly united and ever loyal to the people

of  Malaysia - not as the Barisan Sosialis are  to  the

Indonesian  Communists.  We must  be  ever  alert  and

continue to carry on the relentless struggle and check

against  infiltration into schools, trade unions,  old

boys'  associations and other civic  organisations  by

the  Communist united front cadres. We must not  allow

ourselves  to  believe  that all important  activities

beyond  our  control have now been shifted  from  this

Chamber to the Federal Parliament in Kuala Lumpur, and

that  we  can sit back and relax; but we must  persist

vigorously  in our constant and unyielding efforts  to

bring  about  a  prosperous  society  through  careful

planning   of  the  political,  social  and   economic

policies.  Only  in this way can we win  the  ultimate

battle for democracy in Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I have said, I notice that only two

Opposition Members have not spoken. I do not want  the

position  to arise where all Members of the Opposition

have  spoken  and  we will then have  only  Government

Members  to speak on and on. So for this reason  I  am

letting Mr Rajaratnam take the Floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first

business session of our Assembly and it is an occasion

when   every  Party  - the  Government  and  Opposition

Parties  - sets the course for the next few  years  and

for  the  future. So, I would like, as I said sometime

ago,  to give in all sincerity and without any sarcasm

on my part - the Opposition some friendly advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, listening to them with regard to this

amendment,  I have a distinct feeling that  they  have

not   thought  out  the  consequences  to   themselves

collectively and individually if they were to vote for

this  amendment,  which they have been  instructed  to

bring  into  this  Chamber. So I propose  to  convince

them, so far as it is possible for me to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



do  so,  that  by voting for this amendment  they  are

going  to  be trapped into a course of action  fraught

with  a  greater  danger than what their  predecessors

encountered.  I  hope  that for  their  own  good  and

welfare,  they  will  give more serious  consideration

than  their predecessors did to our prognosis of  what

is in store for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 23rd November, 1961, when merger was

discussed  for  the first time, and  when  we  on  the

Government  side gave our reasons why we thought  that

the  Communist  and Barisan Sosialis  effort  to  halt

Malaysia  would fail and end in disaster,  there  were

many  Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen then who  laughed.

May  I quote, Sir, the concluding portion of my speech

which I made on 23rd November, 1961? It is in Hansard,

Vol. 15, No. 7, cols. 547 and 548:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Anyway, it is my contention that the Barisan

Sosialis  have miscalculated for the reasons  which  I

have  indicated.  Today  in this  debate  it  will  be

possible  for the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis  to

dismiss  them  as  fairy tales. They can  dismiss  our

contention  today  ..... that the Barisan  Sosialis  is

fighting the M.C.P. battle against Malayan nationalism

as  a fairy tale. But there will come a time very soon

when  merger is finally realised and the M.C.P. gives

the  signal to launch a do-or-die offensive. [This was

said,  Sir,  two years ago] ... When that time  comes,

the battle lines will be clearly drawn. There will  be

no  equivocation then, because there will  be  no  no-man's-land.  There  will  only  be  a  thin  red  line

dividing  the forces of Malayan nationalism  from  the

anti-nationalist forces.



<br><br>I said then:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When this battle comes, there will be no rescue

parties,  because all the contestants will be  in  the

battle-field taking position on this or that  side  of

the line.'



<br><br>This  prognosis was made two years ago. At  that  time

the Barisan Sosialis laughed it off as P.A.P. bravado.

They  then  jeered  back  and  claimed  that,  on  the

contrary,  it was the P.A.P. who would be washed  away

by  the  wrath of the masses. At that time, they  were

flushed with the victory which they obtained at  Anson

by  the betrayal of one of their own colleagues. I may

in  passing say that this act of political betrayal by

the Communists has been thrice avenged. The Member for

Kampong Kapor, whom they stabbed in the back, has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



been  returned to this Assembly! We have also regained

the  seat that we lost in Anson! And finally, the  man

whom  the Communists put into power at Anson  has  not

only lost his seat, but also his deposit!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time in November 1961, the Communists

were  so  confident of their strength that our warning

of why they could not halt merger was disregarded. May

I, Sir, make one last quotation from the prediction  I

made  then?  I also prophesied in the speech  which  I

made  two  years ago that some people in  the  Barisan

Sosialis and - I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... can opt out of the battle in the nick of time,

provided  they  get their timing right. I  understand,

Sir,  that  some people are already passing  the  word

around  that they may cease being students of politics

to take up law or medicine abroad.'



<br><br>Well, Sir, that has come to pass.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Minister get back to the

debate?  He  has spoken on his previous  announcements

and  on  two gentlemen. Unless he can satisfy me  that

all that is relevant, I think he should press on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, what I would like to say is

this.   Once  again,  the  same  decision  that  their

colleagues made in November 1961 will have to be  made

today  by  the seven Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen  and

their   friends  outside  this  Chamber.  It   is   my

contention   that  being  anti-Malaysia  before   16th

September  of  this year is something  different  from

being  anti-Malaysia  after 16th  September.  This  is

because,   to  use  a  Marxist  term,   there   is   a

"qualitative"  difference between being  anti-Malaysia

before 16th September of this year and today. I  think

it  is necessary for them to understand that, because,

as  I shall try to show, this adventure that they  are

embarking upon is one that involves great risk. Before

16th  September, opposition to Malaysia was  at  least

superficially  an internal political  struggle.  There

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



a  legitimate difference of opinion between Malaysians

as  to  whether Malaysia should be set up and  whether

Malaysia  and merger had the approval of  the  people.

Therefore,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  could  have   then

claimed   that  in  campaigning  against  merger   and

Malaysia during the referendum and during the  general

election, they were engaged in a perfectly legitimate,

constitutional, and possibly patriotic  struggle.  And

the  price of defeat then, Sir, was at best a loss  of

political  face  and of seats. But today,  as  I  have

said, there is a qualitative change. Malaysia has been

set  up  with the consent of the vast majority of  the

people.  This fact has been endorsed not only  by  the

elections in Singapore, Sabah and Borneo, but also  by

a  U.N. survey team. What is more important, Sir,  is

that  Malaysia has been accepted internationally as  a

political reality. Despite the intense lobbying by the

Indonesians  in the United Nations, the vast  majority

of the 113 nations who compose the United Nations have

accepted Malaysia as an independent political  entity.

Hon. Members opposite also know that the Russians, the

Communist countries - everybody - voted for Malaysia  to

share  a seat in the Internal Security Council of  the

United  Nations.  This is a very  important  position.

Malaysia    shares    the    seat    with    Communist

Czechoslovakia. Therefore, internationally Malaysia is

accepted  as  an independent nation. All these  people

who say that it is a neo-colonialist plot are ignorant

because  the  113 members of the United  Nations  know

that,  by the rules of the United Nations, no country,

except  an independent country, can be accepted  as  a

member. In passing, Sir, may I also observe that  when

our  Ambassador in Washington sent out invitations  to

celebrate  Malaysia Duty, many East European Communist

countries attended the function to celebrate  Malaysia

Day?  Therefore, Malaysia is accepted  nationally  and

internationally.   It  is  a  political   entity,   an

independent State. May I also point out that the eight

Barisan  Sosialis Members took the oath of  allegiance

to Malaysia? So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



everybody  has  accepted  that  constitutionally   and

legally  Malaysia is a State. Therefore, in persisting

in  their anti-Malaysia struggle, the Barisan Sosialis

are now dedicated to the destruction of an established

Malaysian  State,  a State to which  they  have  sworn

loyalty,  and  which the vast majority  of  Malaysians

support,  and  which is now recognised by  the  United

Nations.  That  is one qualitative difference  in  the

anti-Malaysia   struggle   before   and   after   16th

September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Barisan Sosialis will carefully follow my

next step of the argument because literally - Sir, I am

not talking metaphorically - it is a matter of life and

death  to  them  if they do not know the  distinction.

They  may  accept or reject the essence of my  speech,

but  they  do  so at their peril. If they  persist  in

their   anti-Malaysia  struggle  today,   the   stakes

involved  are pretty high. The stakes are not Assembly

seats  or  loss  of  political face,  but  the  stakes

involved  this  time  are not only  their  patriotism,

their loyalty to the country and its people, but  also

their lives. To put it bluntly, Sir, the anti-Malaysia

line  today,  i.e. after 16th  September,  must  lead

logically and inevitably to acts of treason. "Treason"

is  not used in the rhetorical sense of the word, Sir,

but  in  its legal and constitutional sense.  I  would

like  to read the relevant portion on offences against

the State. It is the Penal Code (Cap. 121):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whoever wages war against the Queen [this now means

the State of Malaysia] or attempts to wage such war or

abets  the  waging of such war shall be punished  with

death,  or with imprisonment for life, and shall  also

be liable to a fine.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not being frivolous about this. For the

first  time  I do not want to taunt them unnecessarily

because  this is a serious step they are contemplating

- today  or tomorrow, when they have to vote  on  their

own amendment. I shall try to convince them that it is

a  trap  or a noose set around their necks by the  men

who manipulate them. Sir, my thesis today is this:  to

fight or to try to overthrow Malaysia is logically  to

involve themselves in an act of treason;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



the Barisan Sosialis must become a party to treason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who direct the Barisan Sosialis - I am not

interested in the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen because

they  have been talking all sorts of frivolous things,

but  the people who really run them - have analysed the

situation  and have decided that the Barisan  Sosialis

and  the Communists of Malaya cannot capture power  in

Malaysia either by violence or by constitutional means

within  the  foreseeable future. Here is  evidence  of

that, Sir; as you know, the M.C.P. were engaged in  an

armed  revolution for eight or nine years, and failed.

And  they have admitted this failure. In fact, I would

refer the Barisan Sosialis not to my thesis but  to  a

statement called Ends and Means of Socialism which Mr

Fong  Swee  Suan and Mr Lim Ching Siong among  others

signed.  These two gentlemen, together with Mr  Devan

Nair and Mr Puthucheary, and others, showed logically

why  it  would  be  impossible within the  foreseeable

future for the M.C.P. to capture power by violence  in

Malaya and Malaysia. This is even more important,  Sir - Chin  Peng  at the Baling Talks admitted  that  much.

When  the  Tunku  put a point-blank question  to  Chin

Peng,  "Do you, Mr Chin Peng, regard me as a  British

stooge?", the reply of Chin Peng as contained  in  the

White  Paper was, "No, Tunku. I regard you as a leader

of Malayan nationalism." This is the biggest admission

by  the  leader of the armed revolt, a  man  far  more

intelligent and far more dedicated than any  of  these

gentlemen - that the Malayan armed revolt  had  failed.

[Laughter] Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu is laughing.

I  ask  him  to read the memorandum contained  in  The

Battle  for Merger, which is an analysis by Lim  Ching

Siong.  It  is a very important and a very intelligent

analysis  - why  it  is  impossible  for  the   Malayan

Communist  Party ever to capture power  in  Malaya  by

violence. So, Sir, armed violence is out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent elections and the referendum we have

proved  another  point  - that  the  Communists  cannot

capture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



power  by constitutional means in Malaysia. So  it  is

out - the M.C.P. cannot capture power by violence or by

constitutional means. The referendum has shown it: the

recent elections have shown it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then becomes the role of the Barisan Sosialis

and  the  Communists  in Malaya? They  cannot  capture

power  by constitutional means or by violent means  So

what  is their role? That brings me to the third  step

of  my  argument - that the Communists and the  Barisan

Sosialis  can  capture power only by  aid  of  foreign

arms. This, Sir, again is not a wild allegation on  my

part.  I  say that the role that has been allotted  to

them  by  their  masters, who  are  manipulating  them

either  here or in Indonesia, is the role of Quislings

or  Wang  Ching-wei.  It is not because  these  people

relish that situation but because they have no choice.

The  only  way the Communists can survive  is  at  the

point  of  foreign bayonets. In fact,  Sir,  the  real

leaders  who write their speeches which are  delivered

here  by  their representatives knew as  far  back  as

January  1962  before confrontation started  - and  the

Barisan  Sosialis  are  aware  of  this  - that   armed

intervention  must  take place in order  to  break  up

Malaysia.  Many  of  us will remember,  Sir,  that  in

January  1962  the Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. Mr Lim Ching Siong, held a mass rally  long

before  confrontation came into the picture. He  said,

"We realise that the moment is coming when we too will

receive  the  support and help of  other  peace-loving

people  to  free us from colonial domination."  Where?

You can look around, Sir. Obviously it is not America,

not  Britain,  not China as it is too  far  away,  not

Russia. Which country is the peace-loving country?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Across the Indonesian Ocean.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Indonesia. In 1962, Sir, which is

over  a  year ago, the Barisan Sosialis, or  at  least

those  who  manipulate  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   were

preparing for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



the time when foreign bayonets must save the situation

and  continue  the anti-Malaysia struggle.  Again,  in

April  1963, that was before the old Assembly went  to

the  polls, there was a debate here when Dr Lee  Siew

Choh,  who always reads other people's speeches, ended

his   speech  in  this  Assembly  with  the  following

warning.  He had lost the referendum and he knew  what

was coming; his masters knew what was coming. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the last door to constitutional struggle is

closed  to the people, then there can remain  hut  one

final answer, i.e. the British and the P.A.P. rein  in

their  horses on the brink of the precipice  and  turn

back before it is too late.'



<br><br>What  was  he  saying? He said that if  Malaysia  went

through, that meant the constitutional battle was lost

and  there  must be other means. What means?  Dr  Lee

Siew  Choh is not going to lead violence. He is a good

chess  player, I am told, and a bad rugger player.  He

cannot lead violence. Who then? Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I could give other quotations. Therefore, Sir,

today  this is their course - the course of treason  is

inevitable. This amendment, Sir. All right, these were

mistakes  of  the  past. This is  the  first  business

session of the Assembly. And this amendment. What does

it  prove?  Does  it  prove  that  the  Barisan  have

changed, and realised, from their mistake, that it was

a  folly to fight Malaysia? No, Sir. Here is the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's speech and an amendment  is  put.

When a Party puts an amendment, it means that that  is

the  subject which it holds most dear. They  say  that

they   are   Malaysians,  shedding  tears  about   the

suffering   of  the  people,  about  housing,   roads,

electricity  and  kampong  people.  But  what  is  the

amendment  they  have  put  here?  Is  it  related  to

housing,  roads, houses for the people, sufferings  of

the  poor?  It  is an amendment that  relates  to  the

problems  of Indonesia. Let me read how it is  worded,

the  way in which it is worded. I do not think  it  is

worded  by  them.  I will tell them why  it  has  been

worded in this way. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` "; but this Assembly regrets that the Government

in helping to impose Malaysia...." '.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody believes that Malaysia has been imposed.

There was a referendum and an election. But this is an

Indonesian argument. It is being put here because this

amendment is going to be reported in Indonesia to give

the impression to the Indonesian people that there  is

agitation  and a fight against Malaysia, and therefore

they  can  sustain  their anti-Malaysia  agitation  in

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, time is short. They must think why

they  have  been forced to bring this amendment  here.

Why have they been forced? They know the amendment  is

going  to  be defeated. So why do they bring  it?  The

amendment will bring them into greater disrepute.  The

people   will  know  that  this  is  a  pro-Indonesian

amendment.  It will not be of great advantage  to  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  I will tell you  why,  Sir.  Their

masters, knowing full well that the course of the anti-Malaysia  struggle  must  lead  to  acts  of  treason,

carrying  penalties which I have  read  out,  want  to

ensure that these friends of theirs do not wriggle out

when  the  moment of danger comes. Once  these  people

have   publicly  committed  themselves  to  this  pro-Indonesian  amendment, there is no  retreat.  That  is

what they want. They are helping to put a noose around

their own necks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I conclude by a little quotation from The

Revolutionary  Catechism which  has  been  praised  by

Lenin and which constitutes part of the organisational

style  of  Communism?  One of the  first  things  they

should  note,  Sir,  is a piece  of  advice  from  the

Revolutionary Catechism:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All real revolutionaries should have second and

third  string  revolutionaries  under  their  command,

i.e.,  they must be able to control those who are  not

yet  completely initiated. These lower members of  the

revolutionary    order   should   be    regarded    as

revolutionary capital placed at their disposal. When a

comrade  is in danger it may be necessary to determine

whether he is expendable.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after listing the various categories of people

who   should  be  expended,  they  mention  the  fifth

category which should be of great interest to them:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fifth category of expendable people consists of

compromisers,    doctrinaires,    conspirators     and

revolutionaries. Those who orate away at  meetings  or

on paper, they must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



constantly driven into ambiguous positions. They  must

be  compelled  out into the open and assume  real  and

dangerous tasks. The majority of these will disappear,

but    of    the   rest,   we   shall   make   genuine

revolutionaries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what is happening to them, Sir, the moment

they  approve this amendment publicly. They know  very

well  it  is  going  to  be  defeated.  But  they  are

committed.  The  noose is round their  necks.  Treason

carries the death penalty. Sir, what the confrontation

---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is repeating himself

now.  He  talks  about treason. He has said  it  about

three  times. He talks about their putting  the  noose

around their necks. Can we wind up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it took two years for the

former  Barisan Sosialis to realise what we  said  was

true.  This time, I can assure them, it will not  take

two years. It may be a matter of months before what  I

say here will come true. I am prepared to stand by it.

I  am prepared to quote it to the Gentlemen who may be

here  or  who  may not be here, but I can assure  them

that this prediction will come true, not in two years'

time,  but in the course of the next few months.  What

do  we  read  in the newspapers? Confrontation  means

Indonesian terrorists going to Sabah to blow up things

- sabotage.  We have read of Indonesian bombers  flying

over  Sabah  territory with the bomb doors open.  This

time  there were no bombs. I read in the papers  today

(this  is  the final quotation) Soekarno  saying  that

they must solve their economic problems (it is in  the

Malayan Times today) within three months, which  means

that   economic  confrontation  obviously  is  hitting

Indonesia  so  hard that he has given instructions  to

end  the crisis in 90 days, i.e., three months. So  if

they   do  not  end  their  crisis  in  three  months,

confrontation can mean anything. But what it will mean

to  the honourable Members opposite is something which

I  hope  they  will  take into serious  consideration,

whether by voting for this amendment they are going to

set  the  course to disaster - where the price is  very

high - or whether, as I have said, they can opt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



out. Sir, the best time to jump off a moving train  is

when it has started to move, not when it is travelling

at  60  m.p.h. Today the train is moving at 5  m.p.h.;

tomorrow at 10 mph.; and then it is time to get off. I

can  only quote them the banner which I saw in a  film

called  On  the Beach, it says, "There is still  time,

brother." Well, I say, "There is still time, comrade."

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This great burden

burden is greater than what it is on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



the  shoulders of the Federation people. As  has  been

admitted,  the burden on Singapore, brought  about  by

the  Indonesian  confrontation  policy,  can  only  he

solved  by the Central Government. That being  so,  we

are  clear that the repercussions of confrontation act

differently on Singapore and the Federation. So, since

the  final  say  lies  with  the  Federation,  we,  as

representatives of the people of Singapore,  have  the

duty to urge the Central Government ---
