Prime Minister, in view of the impending break  up

of the Alsagoff Trust, which includes the Alsagoff

Estate,  what  steps will the Government  take  to

ensure the protection of the tenants of the Estate

against eviction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime</b>

<b>Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by

the Prime Minister to reply to the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alsagoff Estate is a private Estate and the

Government  has  no information on  any  impending

hypothetical situation.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  has

further information, could he enlighten us on this

matter?  Could the Government use its  legislative

power  under  the  Land Acquisition  Ordinance  to

purchase the Estate, divide it into lots and later

on sell the lots to the present tenants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Sir, I require further notice

of  that  question. All I can say is that it  does

not  seem  likely that the situation of  wholesale

eviction of the tenants will arise. Like the other

tenants, in Singapore, the Control of Rent  Ordinance will afford them some protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been 1,174 applications since June

1959.  There  have  been  no  allocations  and  no

rejections.  The basis of future allocations  will

be according to a points system under which regard

is  taken  of income, size of family and  existing

living  conditions.  Seventy-seven  lots  are  now

available and will be allocated in March or  April

in accordance with the points system.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  require a definite reply from the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Prime Minister as to whether  or

not  the  rejected applicants who have paid  their

deposits will be given further consideration  when

applications are invited again.

long  will  English be retained  as  the  official

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It is at present

impossible  for the Government to say whether,  or

when, Malay will be the only official language  of

the  State  of Singapore. Until Malay  has  become

sufficiently understood and adequately mastered by

the civil service and political leaders, it is not

practical  to  talk of Malay as the only  official

language. In these matters, we shall closely watch

and  learn from the progress and experience of the

Government of the Federation of Malaya.

ambiguous. Could I receive a definite reply as  to

why  it  is  impossible  for  the  Government   to

language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I have

when  not so long ago he criticised the Government

for strengthening the law against motor vehicle of

fences  because he was so worried in case his  car

might be confiscated by Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures being taken and which will continue

to  be taken are the detention and supervision  of

criminals   under  the  Criminal  Law   (Temporary

Provisions)   Ordinance,   the   more    intensive

application  of  the  various  Ordinances   passed

recently,   the  maximum  use  of  Police   mobile

murders and crimes of passion.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Minister  for  Education  what  is  the  estimated

expenditure  on  free  education  for  Malays   in

secondary  schools  in  1960,  and  whether   free

education includes the provision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



textbooks and exemption from payment of  fees  for

extra-curricular activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an

estimated  number of 4,700 Malay pupils  attending

post  primary and secondary schools in the English

and   Malay  streams  in  Singapore.  Since   free

secondary  education for Malays will be restricted

to  those who are either born in Singapore or  are

children of Singapore citizens, not all the  4,700

Malay  pupils  will  qualify  for  free  secondary

education.  But  on the basis of 4,000,  say,  the

total  estimated loss in revenue for remission  of

school fees would be in the region of $150,000 per

annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free secondary education scheme for Malays

will not include free textbooks nor exemption from

payment  of  fees for extra-curricular activities.

The   present  free  textbook  loan  scheme   will

continue  to operate in accordance with the  means

test applicable to all children, that is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the family income is below $150 per

month,  and  two  or  three  children   are

attending school, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if the family income is less than $200 per

month,  and  four  or more children  attend

school.

<br><br>

The  total  1960 vote for the free  textbook  loan

scheme  is  $150,000,  of  which  $50,000  is  for

secondary  schools. According to 1959  experience,

this  sum  should be adequate for 1960. Should  it

prove inadequate during the course of the year, an

application for supplementary vote will be made as

usual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the remission of miscellaneous fees

for  extra-curricular activities,  the  discretion

will  continue  to be exercised by  principals  of

schools.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Will  the  Minister inform the House whether  this

figure  of  $150,000 for the textbook loan  scheme

includes  provision  for all  school  children  in

secondary  schools, or is it meant only for  Malay

students in secondary schools?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stated

that  the  total 1960 vote for the  free  textbook

loan  scheme  is  $150,000, of  which  $50,000  is

applicable to secondary schools and is  meant  for

all   secondary  schools,  not  necessarily  Malay

pupils.  I  would  further add  that  there  is  a

special quota for Malay pupils, in that they get a

double  quota - that  is,  if  the  enrolment  in  a

certain school deserves a book loan of $300,  that

school  would have its loan increased to  $600  if

its  pupils  are composed entirely  of  Malays.  A

double  quota is especially made for Malay  pupils

in our schools.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to provide for the

registration  and  control of all  mutual  benefit

organisations as defined in clause 2 of the  Bill.

A  number  of  such organisations are  at  present

registered under the Business Names Ordinance, the

Companies  Ordinance  or the Societies  Ordinance,

but  it is proposed that in future all such mutual

benefit  organisations should be registered  under

the provisions of the new Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing mutual benefit organisations which are

registered  under the Business Names Ordinance  or

the  Companies Ordinance are required to apply for

registration under the new Ordinance within thirty

days   of  the  coming  into  operation  of   this

Ordinance,   while  mutual  benefit  organisations

registered or exempted from registration under the

Societies  Ordinance  are required  to  apply  for

registration  under the new Ordinance  within  one

year  of the date of coming into operation of this

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this difference is that, while it

is   possible   to  have  some  control   of   the

organisations concerned if they are registered  or

exempted  under the Societies Ordinance,  no  such

control  is  possible if they have been registered

under   the  Business  Names  Ordinance   or   the

Companies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is necessary for me to

elaborate  on  the reasons and the  need  for  the

registration  and control of such  mutual  benefit

organisations. Unless strict control  is  kept  on

the  activities of such organisations, there is  a

possibility  of  persons  being  cheated  of   the

moneys, which they have saved for their old age or

for the benefit of their dependants. In the United

Kingdom,  the  activities of similar organisations

are  controlled by the Friendly Societies Act, and

in  the Federation there are special provisions in

the Societies Ordinance to deal with death benefit

societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal provisions of the Bill are dealt

with in the Explanatory Statement of the Bill, and

I  feel  it is unnecessary for me to elaborate  on

them. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



provisions  of  the Bill are, to a  large  extent,

based  on those of the Friendly Societies  Act  of

the  United  Kingdom, though some  provisions  are

taken from the Federation Societies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is complementary to the Societies

(Amendment) Bill and, in order that the provisions

of  the Bill can be examined in detail, I propose,

when  the Bill is read a Second time, to move that

it be referred to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

to   have   unified  administration  in  Singapore

instead  of two parallel administrations,  namely,

Central Government and Local Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the absorption by the

Central  Government of the City  Council  and  the

Rural  Board, which was to be replaced by District

Councils, and the integration of the various Local

Government bodies with the various departments  of

of these Local Government bodies, the need for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour Regulations, 1959,

were presented to the Legislative Assembly on  the

29th August, 1959. These regulations were made  to

require  employers  of workmen to  keep  registers

showing  particulars  regarding  their  employees,

such  as wages and allowances due during each wage

period  and details of holidays, annual leave  and

sick leave. They have not as yet been approved  by
