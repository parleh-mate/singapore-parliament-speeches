<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  is the total amount of  payroll  tax

that   has  been  collected  since  the   tax   was

introduced  up to the latest convenient  date;  and

whether the moneys collected in the form of payroll

tax  will  be used to introduce a social  insurance

scheme  to fulfil the Government's promise  to  the

working people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually the Government has

never  made  any  promise  to  introduce  a  social

insurance  scheme.  What  was  mentioned   was   an

unemployment insurance scheme which is a small part

of social insurance. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



amount  of payroll tax since it was introduced  was

as follows:

<pre>

               1965  -  $  7.3 million

               1966  -     9.6 million

               1967  -	  10.0 million

               1968  -	  11.0 million

               1969  -    13.1 million

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has studied the question of

unemployment insurance and has sought  advice  from

the  International Labour Organisation. The  I.L.O.

sent an expert, Mr E. D. Tsoucatos, and he was  in

Singapore  from  September 1967 to  February  1968.

Briefly,  the  findings  of  this  expert  are   as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) an Unemployment Benefit Scheme alone cannot

make  any substantial contribution towards  the

solution  of  problems created by  unemployment

in  the country. An Unemployment Insurance Scheme in Singapore can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



only  supplement  other measures  to  reduce

unemployment,  to  provide  more  employment

opportunities  and  to intensify  vocational

training;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) any unemployment insurance scheme should be

financed  by  the  contributions  both  from

workers and employers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the scheme should be designed in such a way

that  it  would be self-supporting, covering

financial administrative expenses  from  the

workers' and employers' contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to abandon for the

time  being  the  introduction of  an  unemployment

insurance    scheme   based    on    payroll    tax

contributions. There are several reasons for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as I said before, the introduction of an

unemployment   insurance   scheme   would   require

contributions not only from the employer, which  he

is  now doing under the payroll tax, but also  from

the   employee.   In   view   of   the   additional

contributions which both employer and employee  are

making   in  the  enhanced  rate  to  the   Central

Provident  Fund,  this is not the right  moment  to

impose further exactions on employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's view is that in the

circumstances facing the Republic in the  last  few

years,  it  would  be better to solve  problems  of

unemployment and other social problems  related  to

it  through  an accelerated programme  of  economic

expansion  rather  than by arranging  transfers  of

incomes  from those who are well off to  those  who

are unfortunate to lose their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government to use

payroll  tax  contributions  to  offset  additional

liabilities which employers incur when they  employ

discharged  national servicemen who are  called  up

for  their  annual  training exercises.  This  will

remove any handicaps which national servicemen  may

encounter in their  efforts to find employment.

is  to  provide an increase in the number of stalls

ground  floor as the cement floor cannot  withstand

severe  wear  and  tear, and  introduce  a  closed-drainage system as the present open-drainage system

is not very satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board is also

building  another single-storey cooked-food  centre

adjoining the present two-storey hawker centre at a

cost  of  about $200,000 to provide 40  cooked-food

stalls.  This  is part of the Board's programme  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall make good use of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, just before the adjournment

last Friday, I was talking about students being too

busy  to  study because they have to take  part  in

extra-curricular activities in order  to  get  more

marks. Sir, students almost have to attend a  full-day  session every day, so much so that  when  they

reach   home   they   are  practically   exhausted.

Consequently,  the  standard of  their  lessons  in

school has dropped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to mention is that the

grading  of  marks  for  participating  in   extra-curricular activities is rather odd, and gives  the

impression  of  being unfair to the  students.  For

instance,  in  certain extra-curricular  activities

there is no representative from --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The time is up. Mr Ong Pang Boon, do you wish to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



to  say  in  respect of extra-curricular activities

and the manner in which such activities are graded,

I  wish to inform him that the problem is in  fact,

being  constantly reviewed. Right now a new  scheme

is  being devised and the Singapore Teachers' Union

and  the principals are being consulted. Therefore,

if the Member has any strong views on the manner in

which extra-curricular activities should be graded,

I  am sure he can put them forward through his  own

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, the Member for Delta mentioned the

provision   of  facilities  for  the  training   of

kindergarten  teachers in Singapore.  Kindergartens

in  Singapore  may  be  broadly  divided  into  two

groups - those   which  are  run  by   the   People's

Association,  a  quasi-government  body,  and   the

private  kindergartens. Teachers  in  kindergartens

run  by  the  People's Association  have  undergone

intensive courses in kindergarten methods.  As  for

the private kindergartens, the position varies from

one  institution to another. While  the  registered

private  kindergartens have a sprinkling of trained

teachers,  the  unregistered private kindergartens,

which  are  in the vast majority, do not  have  any

trained staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last eight years, kindergartens have

mushroomed  all over Singapore. Whether  they  were

motivated  politically or for  private  gain,  they

reflected a rising standard of living of the people

and  an awareness of the advantages of a pre-school

education   in  our  highly  competitive   society.

Furthermore, for those Asian parents who  have  not

lost  their roots in their own society and culture,

there   is   a   certain   sanctity   attached   to

scholarship.  Any form of learning is intrinsically

good and is rarely questioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation quickly lent itself to exploitation

by  profiteers  and unscrupulous political  parties

like   the   Barisan   Sosialis.   Some   of    the

kindergartens,  because  of  the  lack  of  trained

staff,  offered  children a very poor  standard  of

education  and the results were sometimes  counter-productive  in the manner described by  the  Member

for Delta. On



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



the  other hand, in the kindergartens organised  by

the  Barisan  Sosialis,  the  children  were  given

indoctrination  in  Communist ideology.  While  the

Government  was  not  in  a  position  to   finance

universal  free  kindergarten education,  it  could

improve   the  situation  by  organising   training

facilities  for  the  large  number  of   untrained

kindergarten  teachers. And when a  large  pool  of

trained  kindergarten teachers was  available,  the

Government could introduce measures to require  all

kindergartens to employ only trained teachers. With

this  in  view, in June 1966, my Ministry officials

were  instructed  to  explore  the  feasibility  of

conducting  professional courses  for  kindergarten

teachers.  Owing  to financial stringency  at  that

time  and  also  because of staffing problems,  the

proposal  did  not get started.  In  1967,  it  was

decided  that the Ministry and the Adult  Education

Board  should jointly organise the training  course

whereby   the   Ministry  would  look   after   the

professional aspects of the course while the  Adult

Education  Board  would provide the  administrative

machinery  to  run  the course. However,  for  some

inexplicable  reasons,  the  course  did  not   get

started  until  May 1969 when the first  in-service

course  in  English for 60 teachers  in  registered

kindergartens was started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1969, the People's

Association  ran  379  kindergartens   for   12,000

children.   There  were  also  registered   private

kindergartens with a total of 175 classes for 5,000

children.  The  unregistered private  kindergartens

run  by  the P.A.P., the Barisan Sosialis, churches

and  other private individuals probably catered for

another 20,000 children. In relation to the need in

both the registered and unregistered kindergartens,

the  training  facilities offered  at  present  are

grossly inadequate to meet the situation. The Adult

Education  Board  is aware of the situation  and  I

understand that it has decided to introduce a basic

kindergarten course in the middle of this year  for

untrained   kindergarten  teachers  who   are   not

attached   to   Government,   quasi-Government   or

registered kindergartens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of abolishing

post allowances was again raised by the Member  for

Telok  Blangah last Friday. As I pointed out in  my

reply  to  the  same question in  the  last  Budget

debate, my Ministry had made detailed proposals  to

the Harvey Salaries Commission for the abolition of

post  allowances and the institution of  a  unified

salary  structure  which  would  include  promotion

scales  for the entire education service.  However,

in  its Report, the Salaries Commission recommended

the  continuance of the existing practice of paying

post  allowances on promotion but recommended  that

the    Ministry's   proposals   warranted   serious

consideration.  I  understand  that  the  Teachers'

Union  has  since  written to the Finance  Ministry

seeking  an interview to thrash out this and  other

related  problems. The Finance Ministry  has  again

referred the matter to my Ministry. It is now  left

with  the  Teachers' Union to start  the  rigmarole

once  again.  My views on this question  are  quite

clear. As the Member for Telok Blangah is aware, in

the  new  promotion posts created in the  Technical

Education Department, for instance, principals  and

vice-principals   of  vocational   institutes   and

industrial  training centres,  there  are  no  post

allowances attached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the proposal to have an assistant

principal  in  place  of  a  senior  assistant   in

schools, I am afraid no progress has been made. The

Member for Telok Blangah, I am sure, is not unaware

of the fact that in all salary matters and creation

of new posts, more than one Ministry is involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah complained that

primary  school teachers have to attend courses  in

health  education and that such courses  have  been

conducted  by  unqualified teachers.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  it has been felt for some time that the  best

way  to  inculcate sound health habits is to  begin

with the young children in schools. It is with this

in view that a refresher course in health education

is  being organised for primary school teachers  to

bring them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



up  to  date in respect of health matters  so  that

they  will  be  in a better position  to  stimulate

greater health consciousness among school children.

The  lectures  are delivered by teachers  who  have

previously attended an intensive course on  general

and  dental health education. However, in  view  of

the  large  number  involved and  the  shortage  of

doctors   qualified  to  teach  the  subject,   the

Ministry has to make do with such teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Member for Telok Blangah and the Member

for  Jurong touched on the duties of Inspectors  of

Schools.  Briefly, it is the duty of inspectors  to

improve the quality of teaching in all our schools.

To  achieve this, they visit teachers in schools to

offer  advice and assistance when necessary.  After

observing  the teachers, they generally hold  short

discussions  with them to stimulate new  ideas  and

approaches  to  effective  teaching,  the  use   of

teaching  aids,  up-to-date  information  on   such

matters,  methodology and problems arising  out  of

their  work.  The inspectors are also  required  to

assess  the  work of teachers who have  to  satisfy

certain service requirements from time to time; for

example,  crossing efficiency bars or  confirmation

in  the  service. However, as the Member for  Telok

Blangah has pointed out, the Inspectorate staff has

not been increased over the years while the student

enrolment  has gone up. As a result, the inspectors

of   Schools   cannot  devote  as  much   time   to

professional  and service matters as  they  should.

This  has  led to the allegation by the Member  for

Jurong that the inspectors were feared rather  than

respected by the teachers. I believe that with  the

general improvement in the quality of teaching  and

as  our  inspectors gain in experience and possibly

with  some additions to the inspectorate  staff,  a

better  relationship  between  the  inspectors  and

teachers can be achieved.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to congratulate the

Ministry  of  Education on having at last  realised

the need to abolish post allowances. Sir, they have

started off with technical schools. Having



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



done  so, I do not see why promotion posts in other

schools still carry post allowances. I realise that

this  is not just a matter between the Ministry  of

Education  and  the  Singapore Teachers'  Union.  I

realise  that  the Treasury is also involved.  Sir,

you have just heard that the Teachers' Union, after

having had a bash at the Ministry of Education, has

had  a  bash at the Treasury. What has the Treasury

done?  It  has  referred the  matter  back  to  the

Ministry of Education. Sir, we cannot just kick the

ball  about. It is about time that the Ministry  of

Education and the Treasury decided to rectify  this

anomaly which the Minister for Education knows  has

been  in  existence for the last 20 years. Now  the

ball  is  at the foot of the Ministry of Education.

And  it  says that it is waiting for the  Teachers'

Union   to   make   representations   again.   Sir,

representations have been made over and over again.

How  much longer are we to wait? The same questions

were  raised  by  my  colleague,  the  Member   for

Punggol,  during the debate on the 1967  Estimates.

Are  we  going to wait for next year for  the  same

problem  to crop up? Sir, on the question  of  post

allowances   and   also   allowances   for   senior

assistants,  I  urge the Ministry of  Education  to

pursue actively these matters in the course of this

year. And I hope I will not have reason to speak on

this  again  when we meet next year to  debate  the

Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N. Govindasamy, I am sure the Minister has

taken note of what you have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I hope so, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, are you withdrawing your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I withdraw my amendment,

I  wish  to  say  a  few words.  The  Minister  for

Education  has  said that, in view of  the  present

financial  position, it is not possible to  conduct

training courses for kindergarten



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



teachers  at  present. Sir, with the  help  of  the

Teachers'   Training  College  and  the   Technical

Education Department, perhaps some training courses

can  be arranged for kindergarten teachers.  As  we

all  know  that children are the future pillars  of

our  society,  they should be well  educated  while

they  are young. For instance, if we plant  a  tree

and  we  do  not  give  it  enough  nourishment  or

fertiliser, it will not live up to expectations. In

the  end,  whatever effort and energy we  spend  on

cultivating it will be lost. Therefore, if we  want

to have good fruits, we must have good trees. It is

necessary   to  provide  the  trees   with   enough

fertiliser   during  the  early  stages.   If   the

Government thinks that there is not enough money to

conduct training courses for kindergarten teachers,

then   perhaps   it  can  take  other   alternative

measures.  For instance, kindergarten teachers  can

pay for the training which is organised for them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sure the Minister would love to answer Madam

Chan's questions!



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my criticism was that the

course  for  the training of kindergarten  teachers

had  not started earlier and expanded to the  scale

that  I  would like to see it expanded. In fact,  I

shall be pursuing quite energetically this question

of  training kindergarten teachers in the next  few

months.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Teong Eng Siong, Mr Ang Nam Piau, Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon, Mr J. F. Conceicao and Mr P. Selvadurai)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last ten years there has

been  tremendous  progress in  the  development  of

education in the Republic, and many kinds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



of  reform have been carried out. However, the same

cannot be said about educational research. There is

a  distinct  lack  of advance in this  field.  This

aspect  has  been neglected. Is it  right  that  we

should  neglect  it? I think we  should  give  more

thought to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1968, there was a seminar on education

which  was  attended by teachers from all  schools.

There  was  a  suggestion to set up an  educational

research   centre.  This  was   accepted   at   the

preliminary  meeting  of  the  seminar,   and   was

subsequently   submitted  to   the   Ministry   for

consideration. However, no one is in a position  to

know what is the outcome of this suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, there was a suggestion in this

House  in May 1968 that every encouragement  should

be  given to set up an educational research centre.

The  reason why I am touching on this point is that

I  feel  that  research in education plays  a  very

important  role in the development of our  national

education.  Let  us take a look at our  educational

development.  We have carried out many  educational

reforms. Many of them are novel in nature, but this

does  not  mean that all of them are  good.  I  had

occasion   to   read  an  article  on   educational

research.  Sir,  permit me  to  quote  one  or  two

sentences   from  this  particular  article.   This

article says that we have a fine set of educational

theory,  but  we  lack  systematic  and  scientific

research  in  education. Advancement  in  education

must  be  matched  by  advancement  in  educational

research.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Which publication are you referring to, Mr Tay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am referring to an article in a booklet published

by the T.T.C.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is this booklet with you? Do you have the

particulars of the book; for example, the  year  of

publication  and  the volume number,  so  that  the

Minister can refer to it later



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): At present I do not have this publication with me,

but if the Minister requires it, I will give it  to

him later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the two sentences that I quoted

just  now  were  in  regard to  the  importance  of

research  in  education.  My  main  point   is   to

emphasise that research in education should also be

carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the educational reforms which have

been  carried  out.  For  example,  the  system  of

integrated  schools,  the teaching  of  Civics  and

History  in  Chinese in English  Schools,  and  the

teaching  of  Mathematics and  Science in  English  in

Chinese    schools.   All   these   are   important

educational  reforms.  They not  only  reflect  our

educational policy, but they are also part  of  our

national   policy.  They  go  to  prove  that   our

educational objectives are ideal, but they  do  not

prove that we have rational and scientific research

in education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to make certain

criticisms  of  the policy of teaching  Mathematics

and  Science through the use of English in  Chinese

schools. What is the objective of this reform? When

defining  the  objective of bilingualism  some  two

years  ago, the Minister for Education stated  that

we  have  been trying to carry out the teaching  of

Mathematics  and Science in English in  non-English

schools, and the result of this experiment has been

very  encouraging. This is but a start towards  the

objectives   that  we  have  for  our   educational

reforms.  Our  belief is that, apart from  teaching

the second language as a subject, and using it as a

medium  of instruction to teach other subjects,  it

will  help  in  better progress  in  mastering  the

language.  No  doubt, the Research  and  Statistics

Unit  in the Ministry of Education has conducted  a

survey into the teaching of Mathematics and Science

in  Government Chinese Primary schools  in  Primary

one  and two classes. As the Minister has said, the

result   of   this   experiment   has   been   very

encouraging.  However, the report  of  this  survey

has now been shelved and kept as a highly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



confidential document. Ordinary people are not in a

position to know what its contents are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I may be ignorant of matters

pertaining to education, but why is it that such  a

survey,   which   has  a  grave  bearing   on   our

educational  reform,  should  select  only  certain

Government schools for this experiment? I  ask  the

Minister   these  questions.  How  many  Government

schools  were selected for such a survey, and  what

was  the  number  of  Primary one  and  two  pupils

involved in it? Were the conclusions of this survey

applied    to   all   Chinese   Primary    schools?

Furthermore, the statement is made that in addition

to   teaching  the  second  language  as  a  second

language,  if  it  is  also used  as  a  medium  of

instruction to teach other subjects, it will result

in  better progress in mastering the language. This

means  that if we use the second language to  teach

other  subjects, it will help our pupils to acquire

knowledge of the second language in a shorter time.

This is only a hypothetical assumption. There is no

evidence  to  show that this is the result  of  the

experiment.  In  my view, the printed  language  is

only a tool, and the ability to use any language is

the ability to manipulate a skill. Let us call it a

"printed  language". On the other  hand,  from  the

point of view of teaching Mathematics, mathematical

symbols  are also a kind of tool. Let  us  call  it

"mathematical language". The question is  this:  is

it  true  that  the  teaching of Mathematics  in  a

certain language will result in a better mastery of

that  language?  I think this question  merits  our

detailed  study.  The teaching of  Mathematics  and

Science  through  the  use of  English  in  Chinese

schools is already an accomplished fact. I have  no

intention  to reopen here the debate on the  merits

and  demerits of this policy, but certain questions

arise.   We   have  carried  out  many  educational

reforms, and we must be courageous enough to  admit

that  not  all  of  them have been successful.  Our

vocational  schools are examples of the failure  of

one  of  our reforms. We should not embark  upon  a

reform in haste without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



taking into consideration all the relevant factors.

More  important, it is not enough just to  have  an

educational  ideology. It must be complemented  and

supported  by  scientific, rational and  systematic

research  into education, otherwise  the  time  and

money  spent will be wasted. It will be not a  boon

but  a  bane to our educational system.  To  embark

upon reforms in education is, I feel, a question of

principle, but how these reforms are to be  carried

out  and what results they will bring is a question

of  detail. I believe there are people who share my

sentiments that educational reforms must be matched

and supported by educational research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I be allowed to pose three questions?

Firstly,  since the Government has  carried  out  a

survey into the teaching of Mathematics and Science

in  English in Government Chinese Primary  schools,

are  the  conclusions of this experiment valid  for

all Chinese Primary schools?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is there a need to reassess the policy

of  teaching Mathematics and Science in the English

language in Chinese schools? Thirdly, what are  the

prospects   of  setting  up  a  National  Education

Research Centre?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, everyone knows that we

practise  equality  in  all  the  four  streams  of

education.  In the last few years, we  have  placed

emphasis  on  technical  education  so  that   more

technical  personnel  can be trained  to  meet  the

requirements of our industrialisation programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk on vocational and

technical  education. There are limited  places  in

the  institutes for technical education.  According

to  statistics, the enrolment this  year  is  about

8,000  students. However, the institutes  are  only

able  to  absorb  about 1,000 students,  and  about

7,000  students are unable to get places  in  these

institutes.  Can the Minister inform  me  how  many

places are available in the technical institutes?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we require a great number of technical

personnel  at  this  time,  we  must  set  up  more

technical  schools  so that  we  will  be  able  to

produce in the shortest possible time the necessary

technical  personnel that we need. I  remember  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education   saying  that  about  35,000   technical

personnel  will be trained in two or  three  years.

But  if  we can only enrol about 1,000 students  at

present, the training of 35,000 technical personnel

will  take  about  30  years.  By  that  time,  our

factories will have closed down, or we will have to

recruit more and more technicians from abroad. This

is  a  matter of crucial importance, and I  do  not

know  if  the  Minister has any new  plans  on  the

training of technical personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is the special classes conducted

by   the   Adult  Education  Board.  These  special

classes,  of  course, are commendable because  they

are able to cater for the thousands of students who

are not able to go to secondary schools. Their ages

range from 14 to 15, and the Government has set  up

these  classes so as to give them certain technical

training  to enable them to acquire certain  skills

which will be useful to them when they go on to the

labour market. However, what is regrettable is that

these  classes  are  mostly concentrated  in  urban

schools.  In many schools in the rural  areas,  for

example,  in  Sembawang and Nee Soon, such  classes

have  not  been  set  up. It  is,  therefore,  very

inconvenient for those who live in the rural  areas

to  attend  these  classes in  the  city,  and  the

expenses  incurred on transport will  be  an  extra

burden on their parents. I would like to plead  for

those  students  who live in the rural  areas,  and

urge  the Ministry of Education to consider setting

up such special classes in the rural areas in order

to cope with the demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is about food stalls in school

tuckshops.  I  have received many  complaints  from

stallholders  who are licensed to  sell  food  and

drinks  to school children. One complaint  is  that

the rental is too high. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



example,  a stall selling sweets at 5 cents  or  10

cents  has  to pay a monthly rent of  $20  to  $30.

Their  profit  is very small, and  with  such  high

rentals,  it  is  impossible for  them  to  earn  a

livelihood.  I  hope  the  Minister  will  consider

reducing the rentals for such stalls. We know  that

most of these stallholders are former recipients of

public   assistance   from   the   Social   Welfare

Department.  The rule is that if they are  given  a

stall  licence,  they will not receive  any  public

assistance. Having set up a stall in a school tuckshop,  they have to make a certain amount of profit

in  order  to support their families. Therefore,  I

hope the Ministry will consider their hardship  and

be sympathetic to their case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint of the stallholders is about

the  change  in  regulations. For example,  take  a

stall  that  sells fried mee. It happens  that  the

school  principal is changed. The  stall-holder  is

told  that he can sell only fried mee and  not  mee

soup.  I hope that such regulations are not changed

every  now  and  then so that no  inconvenience  is

caused to the stallholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that I would like the Minister to

clarify  is  the question of setting up  a  Chinese

language study centre. I remember this question was

also  raised in the debate on the last Budget.  The

Minister  then agreed, in principle, to  set  up  a

Chinese language study centre. Today, after a lapse

of  one year, can he tell us what are the plans for

setting up this centre, and what progress has  been

made?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister   whether  last  year  his  Ministry   has

received  complaints from principals,  parents, or

members  of  the  public about the inefficiency  of

English  teachers in Chinese schools. These English

teachers  often  adopt  an unco-operative  attitude

towards the principal. They also physically  punish

the  students without the consent of the principal.

They also often make applications for transfer back

to  English  schools. If there are, in  fact,  such

complaints, I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



to  ask the Minister what steps he proposes to take

against these irresponsible English teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only one question to

ask of the Minister for Education. I notice that in

the  provision  for  salaries of  secondary  school

principals, the salary scale for the principals  of

Raffles  Institution and Raffles Girls'  School  is

higher   than   that  for  the  other   54   school

principals.  If these 54 principals carry  out  the

same  work  as  that of the principals  of  Raffles

Institution and Raffles Girls' School,  why  is  it

necessary  to  have a difference  in  their  salary

scales?  Does  the  Government propose  to  convert

these two schools into junior colleges?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to one of

the  topics  which the Member for  Paya  Lebar  has

brought up in his comments on this subhead. It  is

the  policy  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  that

Mathematics and Science should be taught in English

in  non-English medium schools, and that Civics and

History  should be taught, for example, in English-medium schools, in the second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this policy of bilingualism. For that

reason,  Sir,  I would like to know  if  there  are

enough   teachers   able  to  teach   Science   and

Mathematics   in  English  in  non-English   medium

schools. Further, I hope that every effort is being

made to improve the quality of English used in non-English medium schools so that pupils may not be at

a  disadvantage  in their study of Mathematics  and

Science.  In addition, I hope there will be  enough

teachers trained in History and Civics who will  be

able to teach these subjects in the second language

in English-medium schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fear that teachers teaching the

subjects  would  be  language teachers  instead  of

teachers  who  are  adequately  equipped   with   a

knowledge  of  History  and Civics,  and  that  the

emphasis  would  be  on language teaching  although

this is a laudable aim, rather than on the teaching

of Civics and History.

<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Sir, which I would like

to  raise.  I have some matters to bring  up  under

subhead  1111,  for  which I  have  an  amendment

standing  in  my name. This topic of  research  has

already  been touched upon by the Member  for  Paya

Lebar,  and with your permission, may I also  touch

on it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting will also be speaking on subhead

1111.  I think we had better wait until we come  to

that subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I will leave the decision to you,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister for

Education will consider two points which I am going

to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in answer to a question in this House on

the  9th of this month, the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister for Education said  that  he  was

aware  of  the  inconvenience  experienced  by  the

parents of students when they were asked to produce

certain  documents  at  the  commencement  of  each

school  year. These documents are necessary because

class   teachers  are  required  to  fill  in   the

attendance  register  many details  concerning  the

students  and their parents or guardians. There  is

also  a standing instruction that there must be  no

eraser  marks  in the register, and no  unnecessary

cancellation of words wrongly written.  Filling  in

the  entries in the attendance register is  one  of

the  factors whereby school inspectors  assess  the

teachers'  efficiency. Consequently,  the  teachers

cannot  help  but check all the relevant  documents

meticulously  before they enter the particulars  in

the  attendance register. Teachers, therefore,  have

to  spend a lot of time and energy in order to  get

the  register accurate and up to date. However,  if

it  really serves some practical purpose, there  is

nothing  to  be  said about it. But,  as  the  name

implies, the attendance register is mainly used for

recording  the students' attendance.  The  detailed

particulars of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



the  students  and their parents  which  have  been

entered  in  the register at so much  sacrifice  of

time  and energy are seldom, if ever, used.  Should

the  occasion arise when such information is really

necessary, it can easily be found in the  students'

school  record  cards. May I ask the  Minister  for

Education whether the attendance register now being

used  by all schools in Singapore can be simplified

and  made more practical? If this can be done,  the

parents will not have to produce the same documents

for  checking year after year. Teachers  will  also

not  have to waste too much time in filling up  the

attendance register which, except for recording the

students' attendance, is not being fully  made  use

of.  I  wonder  what the Minister  thinks  of  this

proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, teachers from the different

language  media  have  their own  unions.  However,

these  unions do not count for much in the eyes  of

the   officials  of  the  Ministry  of   Education.

Whenever  there  is  any  proposed  change  in  the

curriculum  or  some innovation in the  educational

system   itself,  the  teachers'  unions  have   no

opportunity to express their views. If there is any

reform  in  the educational system,  they  are  not

notified.  Needless to say, whenever there  is  any

educational  function organised by the Ministry  of

Education, they are not invited. It should be noted

that   teachers  have  direct  contact   with   the

students. Their study problems and practical  needs

are  better known to the teachers. If the teachers'

unions are consulted whenever there is a change  in

the  educational system, I believe they can make  a

valuable  contribution. Unfortunately, it  is  only

when  something  is  amiss  that  the  Ministry  of

Education  will consult the teachers'  unions,  and

perhaps  make  them share part of  the  blame.  For

instance,  last  year,  the Ministry  of  Education

devised a teacher's record book which proved to  be

impracticable. As a result, the Ministry convened a

conference of teachers' unions at the beginning of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



the  year to consider the matter. In the end, a new

teacher's  record  book suitable  for  use  by  the

teachers was devised. Sir, usually it is only  when

things are in a mess that the Ministry will consult

the teachers' unions and ask them to help clear  it

up.  I  hope the staff in the Ministry of Education

will  pay  more respect to the teachers' unions  of

all the language media.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar has

touched  on the question of bilingualism in schools

and  the use of the second language as a medium  of

instruction  in certain subjects. He  says  further

that  proper consideration should be given to  this

matter  before its implementation. The question  of

bilingualism  has  been taxing the  minds  of  many

people for a long time. Ours is a multi-racial  and

multi-lingual society. Everybody is  aware  of  the

importance of knowing more than one language in our

society.  The Member for Paya Lebar probably  comes

from  a  Chinese school and I am sure he  is  aware

that English has always been the second language in

the  Chinese schools for the last 30 or  40  years.

From  his  personal experience, I am sure  he  will

agree  with me that it has been a complete failure.

Most  of  the  graduates from the Chinese  schools,

probably with a few exceptions, have not been  able

to   make   use   of   English,   particularly   in

conversation, although they have been  studying  it

as  a  second language for more than ten  years  in

school.   Obviously   this  situation   cannot   be

perpetuated and something drastic has  to  be  done

quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience and also from observations made,

it  has  been  found that if a second  language  is

learnt  while at an early age, it will  not  be  as

difficult to master as when one begins to study  it

at, say, after the primary stage. If the Member for

Paya  Lebar  will remember, Professor Haliday, who

was  a  linguist, came to Singapore last  year  and

gave  a  few  lectures  at the  Teachers'  Training

College.  He  made  the  point  that  to  master  a

language well, one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



has  to start at a very young age in fact, as early

as possible. It was for this reason and the need to

make  some drastic changes that we have decided  to

introduce   a  second  language  as  a  medium   of

instruction  in  certain subjects  in  the  Primary

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingualism in schools is being implemented in

gradual  stages  as  far as academic  subjects  are

concerned.   For   instance,   the   teaching    of

Mathematics  in  non-English  schools  through  the

medium  of  English began in 1968 for  Primary  one

classes  in  all  the  Government  Chinese  Primary

schools  and  some aided schools as  well.  It  was

extended to Primary II in 1969 and Primary  III  in

1970. History taught through the medium of a second

language  was  introduced  in  the  English  medium

schools early this year in Primary III and will  be

extended  to  the higher classes by yearly  stages.

This  gradual  implementation of  the  scheme  will

obviate  undue hardship on the part of  pupils  and

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the adequacy of teachers for

implementing   the   bilingual  education   policy,

several  in-service courses have been organised  to

train second-language teachers. An English language

course   for   non-English   medium   teachers   of

Mathematics and Science has also been conducted. In

addition,  seminars on the teaching of Civics  have

been  held  and one on the teaching of  History  is

being organised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary school teachers are normally non-specialists who have been trained to teach a

variety of subjects. As language teachers are  also

general  teachers,  they are able  to  teach  other

Primary school subjects as well as language.  Those

who  have additional training in the teaching of  a

second  language are not necessarily  incapable  of

teaching  such subjects as History or Civics  which

do  not  need specialised knowledge at the  Primary

school  level.  However,  when  it  comes  to   the

Secondary  school level, History will be taught  in

the  second language by teachers with the necessary

background.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly there is room for improvement, and

bilingualism  in  schools is no  exception.  Active

measures have been and are being taken to meet  any

anticipated  difficulty and  to  remedy  any  known

deficiency  so that bilingualism will be  achieved.

These measures include the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective evaluation of the curricula,

textbooks and methods of teaching. Several  schools

have  been chosen as experimental schools to devise

improved  methods of teaching Mathematics,  Science

and English where English is the second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee has been formed to make a careful

study of the content and vocabulary of the textbook

in  History  for  Primary schools as  well  as  the

difficulties encountered by teachers and pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Director of Research was appointed early last

year,  and  one of her duties is to look  into  all

these   questions,  quite  apart  from  educational

research. She has gathered around her half a  dozen

educationists who have had training in research and

methodology.  I am sure that in the course  of  the

next few years some positive results will come  out

of it.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has mentioned just now

that  our vocational institutions could enrol  only

about  1,000  students and that it  would  possibly

take more than 30 years before we could achieve the

target of 35,000 technical personnel a year.  I  do

not  know where he got his information from.  I  am

sure he has been misinformed. The Ministry proposes

to   recruit  3,000  to  4,000  students  for   the

industrial  courses  this  year.  The   intake   of

students   will  be  undertaken  in   four   phases

annually. We have recruited about 1,000 students in

February  and have already advertised  to  take  in

another 1,000 in May 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also mentioned that

there are no special classes organised by the Adult

Education Board in his constituency. Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir,  the Adult Education Board  conducts

special classes for Primary Six leavers in the  day

time in the following centres:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim Keat Vocational School Centre;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountbatten Vocational School Centre;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bukit Batok Vocational School Centre;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parry Avenue Vocational School Centre; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai Sing Dewasa Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special classes in the rural areas are now

conducted  during  the day by the  Board  in  Parry

Avenue  and Bukit Batok Vocational School  Centres.

The  Board's Parry Avenue Vocational School  Centre

caters  for students in the Yio Chu Kang,  Punggol,

Sembawang  and  Tampines  areas.  The  Bukit  Batok

Vocational School Centre caters for students in the

Jurong, Choa Chu Kang and Upper Bukit Timah  areas.

So  it  is not true to say that the Board  has  not

organised  special classes for Primary Six  leavers

in  the  rural  areas. However, the Board  will  be

prepared  to conduct these special classes  in  any

other rural areas provided facilities are available

and  student  numbers warrant the opening  of  such

classes.  If the Member for Sembawang can gather  a

sufficient  number of Primary Six  leavers  in  his

constituency to one particular centre,  I  am  sure

the  Adult Education Board will be only too pleased

to  look  into the feasibility of starting a  class

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tuck-shops in schools, the rental includes

public  utility  charges for  water  and  lighting.

These  charges have now gone up as a result of  the

10  per  cent  tax  and,  therefore,  there  is  no

likelihood of lowering the rental of school stalls.

The   conditions  of  selling  are  laid  down   in

individual tuck-shop agreements signed by the stall-holders at the beginning of the year or at the time

when  they take up the stalls. All cases of varying

of  conditions  of selling are sympathetically  and

carefully  considered and decided by  the  school's

tuck-shop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



committees of the respective schools in  the  first

instance.  Should  the  stall-holder  feel  unhappy

about   the   decision  of  the  school   tuck-shop

committee, he can appeal to the Tuck-shop  Standing

Committee  of the Ministry of Education. His  whole

case  will then be carefully reviewed by the  Tuck-shop Standing Committee and I am sure in most cases

the decision will be a reasonable one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has complained that

certain second-language teachers are unco-operative

and  inflict  corporal punishment on  the  students

with  a view to getting themselves transferred back

to  the  English medium schools. I am  quite  aware

that  there  are second-language teachers  who  are

unhappy  in Chinese medium schools. I think  it  is

understandable, because the Chinese medium  schools

are a new environment and probably quite strange to

the  English language teacher. Until now, they have

only one subject to teach, and that is English.  As

such,  their  duties  become  very  monotonous  and

onerous. However, with the introduction of  English

as the medium of instruction in certain subjects in

non-English  schools, I am sure the second-language

teachers  will now no longer find their  duties  so

monotonous. If the Member for Thomson can bring  up

instances   of   teachers  who  have   administered

corporal  punishment  with the  motive  of  getting

themselves transferred, I am sure we will deal with

them  quite  firmly. For his information,  corporal

punishment  is  prohibited.  Only  principals   are

vested  with the authority to administer it.  If  a

teacher is found guilty of administering it without

the permission of the principal concerned, far from

getting himself transferred to English schools,  he

may find himself out of a job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Tiong Bahru's question,

the  posts of Principal of Raffles Institution  and

Principal    of   Raffles   Girls'   School    have

traditionally   been   superscale    posts    among

Government English schools. The two schools,  which

have a long and outstanding record of achievements,

are generally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



accepted as being among the premier schools in  the

Republic. As the number of promotion posts  in  the

education service is small compared to the strength

of the service, it is desirable to retain these two

superscale  posts  as  senior promotion  posts  for

members  of this service. There is no intention  of

converting these two schools into junior  colleges.

The current thinking is that we should build half a

dozen  or  more junior colleges to absorb all  pre-university   students  now  studying   in   various

secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. In replying to

my  colleague,  the  Member  of  Tiong  Bahru,  the

Minister  for  Education said that because  Raffles

Institution  and Raffles Girls' School are  premier

schools,  it is necessary to retain the two  super-scale  posts  of Principals. But can  the  Minister

safely  say  in this House that these  two  schools

have  been producing top students during  the  last

few  decades,  thereby warranting the retention  of

these two superscale posts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I can only presume that it is so. Last week,

when the School Certificate results were announced,

I  think Raffles Institution again topped the  list

for all secondary schools in Singapore by producing

the best results.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Not necessarily the best results!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That is quite true. But I think one should take

the   performance   of  the   whole   school   into

consideration and not individual students.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in that case, is the Minister aware that

there  are some schools which have defeated Raffles

Institution  and  Raffles  Girls'  School  in   the

Cambridge  School Certificate results in  the  past

few  decades?  Under  such  circumstances,  can  he

reconsider  his  statement  that  since  these  two

schools  are  premier schools, it is  necessary  to

retain the two superscale posts of Principals?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they were premier schools in

the  past. Whether they will continue to be premier

schools in the future remains to be seen. I suppose

if the position changes for the worse and these two

schools  no longer produce good results, I am  sure

the position will be reviewed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, can the Minister say whether these two

schools  take  the cream of passes in  the  Primary

School Leaving Examination?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the Minister answers, I

have to join in the debate. Perhaps I may not agree

with my colleague, the Member for Punggol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first allow me to get one point of

clarification from the Minister? Does he mean  that

the Principals of these two schools are holders  of

superscale posts because their schools produce good

results?  If so, then I think the whole  system  is

wrong. Sir, are we going to classify our principals

according to the results that their schools produce

or   on  the  calibre  of  the  principal  of   any

particular  school? I will agree with the  Minister

if  he  says  that  we  should  continue  with  the

tradition  of having superscale posts of Principals

for  our  two premier schools and not just  because

they produce good results. At the same time, Sir, I

was  quite happy when I heard the Minister say that

there   are  very  few  superscale  posts  in   the

education  service  and therefore  we  must  retain

these  two posts. If that is the case, is  there  a

possibility of creating more superscale posts?  The

student  enrolment has increased and I think  there

is  a  need  for  creating more super-scale  posts,

thereby enhancing the promotion prospects of  those

in the education service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, as I have said just now, the current

thinking is to build more junior colleges. Possibly

we  need half a dozen or even more junior colleges.

The  post  of  principals of these junior  colleges

will  be superscale posts, and I am sure the Member

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the superscale posts are held

by officers who deserve the posts. Whether they are

in  charge  of  secondary schools  or  whether  the

schools  are  premier schools,  promotion  actually

depends  very much upon the quality of the officers

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the Minister has not

replied  to  my  question on the setting  up  of  a

Chinese Language Research Centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the establishment of a Chinese

Language  Centre  has been under consideration  for

some time now. A committee was appointed early last

year  to  look  into this problem. I think  it  has

finished its deliberations and a draft constitution

has  been drawn up. It is now awaiting the approval

of the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has not replied to my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not seen the attendance

books  kept  by the form masters in schools.  I  am

afraid   I   am  not  able  to  answer  him   quite

categorically whether such attendance books need be

kept.  Obviously,  there  is  a  need  for  keeping

attendance  books,  but  whether  they  should   be

simplified  further is a moot point. I  shall  look

into the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Teachers' Union's complaint that they

have  been  ignored and not consulted in all  major

innovations   by  the  Ministry  of  Education,   I

sympathize  with  the Member  for  Jurong  in  this

respect.  The  blame partly probably  lies  at  the

doorstep  of  the Teachers' Union  for  not  making

themselves more active in educational matters,  and

I  think there is a singular lack of interest among

the teachers in their own union.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

Minister's reply, I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since its implementation

of   in-service  courses,  the  Teachers'  Training

College  has  been very energetic and  vigorous  in

carrying  them  out.  In 1969 alone,  it  conducted

about  50  courses which included arts and  crafts,

Audio  and  Visual Aid education, Chinese language,

English   language,   Geography,   History,   Malay

language, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Science and Career Guidance. The courses  are

numerous.  This  is  a  good  sign,  because  these

courses  enable qualified teachers to keep  abreast

of  the  latest trend in education,  and  to  widen

their  professional knowledge.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

there  may be certain people who question the  need

for  these courses. They may well say, even without

attending them, it does not mean that teachers will

not  improve  their  professional  skills.  By  and

large,  this  is  not impossible. However,  without

attending such courses it is not easy to do  so.  I

think  it  is  my duty to go into this  in  greater

detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trainee teacher is directly influenced by his

lecturers and the kind of textbooks which  he  uses

at the Teachers' Training College. In the course of

his  training,  certain  concepts  and  values   on

education and methodology are formed. However, when

he   leaves  the  T.T.C. and  joins  the  teaching

service, he may be confronted with a principal  who

may  require another teaching method. He  may  also

have to face an inspector of schools who wants  him

to   teach   in   a  different  way.   Under   such

circumstances, it is well nigh impossible  for  him

to please two masters. What worries him perpetually

is how to please his superior officers so as not to

get into trouble. However, if he attends in-service

courses, he will be provided with an opportunity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



to rethink and to reappraise certain problems on

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teachers' Training College should not regard

in-service  courses as merely an  appendage.  These

courses  must  form an important  link  in  teacher

education.  The  ideal  teacher  education  at  the

Teachers'  Training College should not be  confined

only  to trainee teachers. Those teachers who  have

qualified  also need to be trained.  The  Teachers'

Training  College should reassess the contents  and

syllabuses of the in-service courses and to  replan

the  whole  courses so that they form an  essential

part  of  teacher  education  and  not  as  a  mere

appendage. Education is a life-long process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me to raise another

question,  namely, the building  at  the  Teachers'

Training College. A year before, the Minister  said

that we --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, are you on the right subhead?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am talking -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Subhead 1020 refers to "Inspectors of Schools".

Will you please confine yourself to"Inspectors of

Schools"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I was mistaken. I would like to

touch on school inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959 when the People's Action Party, on the

mandate  of the people of Singapore, took over  the

government  of the country, thereby ending  British

colonial  rule  which lasted over a hundred  years,

our  achievements  in the field of  education  have

been  impressive and outstanding. In  the  process,

there  have  been  a large number  of  reforms  and

revisions in our educational system, but what I  do

not understand is that in the reforms over the last

ten  years, we have overlooked the use of the  term

"official" which, in Chinese, relates to inspectors

of  schools. The term "official" in Chinese  has  a

very   strong  flavour  of  feudalism  and  British

colonialism.  It  is  not  surprising   that   some

principals are at a complete loss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



when  they are confronted with these Inspectors  of

Schools. Similarly, it is not surprising that  many

teachers  break  into a cold sweat  when  they  are

confronted by these school inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a teacher myself. I have

often   heard   complaints   about   these   school

inspectors from my colleagues. I want to  emphasise

that  there  are  only  some  inspectors  who   are

unhelpful.  These inspectors more often  scold  and

reprimand the teachers than offer them guidance and

assistance.  In other words, when they  come  round

and  supervise the teaching of teachers, they  only

reprimand  the teachers but they do not offer  them

any  advice  on how to improve and get rid  of  the

defects  in  the method of teaching. If  they  only

indulge  in reprimanding and scolding the  teachers

and  not offering them any kind of assistance, then

how  do  we  expect them to carry out our excellent

educational policy?



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we require of our Inspectors of Schools is

just  a more courteous attitude. The assistance  of

inspectors  who  can offer advice and  guidance  on

teaching methods will be useful to the teachers who

can  thereby improve their teaching. From this,  we

can  then raise the standard of efficiency  of  our

teachers  so  that they can better  carry  out  the

excellent educational policy of our country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar

complains that we are still using the colonial term

"inspectors",  and  that they  are  not  fulfilling

their   role.  I  have  outlined  the   duties   of

inspectors  only a few minutes ago, and  I  do  not

wish  to  repeat  them. There is  no  advantage  in

changing  the term "inspector" to some other  name,

as  the  duties of the inspectors remain unchanged.

The  Ministry of Education is not the only Ministry

to  use this term, which has been used in the  last

half  century. In the Police Force,  this  term  is

still being used and no one seems to complain  that

"Inspector of Police" is a colonial term and should

be changed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what is important is that the

relationship  between teacher and inspector  should

be  improved.  The  inspector should  be  respected

rather than feared. With the general improvement in

the quality of teaching and, as I have said, as our

inspectors  gain experience, a better  relationship

could  be  achieved. The Member for Paya  Lebar  is

aware  that inspectors are drawn from the rank  and

file  of the teaching service. Therefore, one would

expect   that   teachers,  on  being  promoted   to

inspectors,  would  be  very sympathetic  to  their

former colleagues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that other

Ministries  also use the term "inspector".  Let  me

say  that in the teaching service, although we call

them  "inspectors", we do not regard them as  such.

In  Chinese, the word "official" has been left out.

I  hope that as educators of the young, we will not

continue  to  use this term, which has  a  colonial

flavour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Member for Paya Lebar

seriously  believe  that  if  we  change  the  term

"inspector"  to, let us say, "adviser",  the  whole

teacher/inspector relationship will change?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I believe this is possible. First, the term

"official" or "bureaucrat" in Chinese could be used

for the person who inspects schools. If you analyse

the  word "inspector" in Chinese, he is a  man  who

thinks that his duty is only to inspect and not  to

do  anything else. If the Minister is agreeable,  I

should  say  that  this  officer  should  not  only

inspect but also guide the teachers, and so do more

than  just  inspect the schools. By doing  this,  I

think  we can improve the relationship between  the

inspectors and the teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not true that inspectors

do not offer advice to teachers in respect of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



professional   matters.  I   do   not   think   the

relationship can be improved if the designation  is

changed, as suggested by the Member, which is  Hsih

Tau Yen. The position will remain the same, because

the inspector has to perform the same duties.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, do you wish to withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not satisfied with the Minister's

explanation, and I am not withdrawing my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1111*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the Ministry of

Education   on   establishing  the   Research   and

Statistics Unit, thus creating the post of Director

of Research. I remember having spoken in this House

on   a   previous  occasion  on  this  subject   of

educational  research. I then mentioned  that  this

research    unit    should   be   independent    of

administrative control by civil servants who do not

belong  to  it. I would now like to ask, therefore,

what  is the degree of independence that this  unit

enjoys; to what extent can it decide on priorities;

and  on what basis are its priorities decided  with

regard to research? I would also like to ask,  Sir,

what  is the scope of research that has indeed been

decided upon?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that adequate funds will be available for

this Research Unit for the proper implementation of

its  functions,  and  that it will  enjoy  a  happy

relationship   with  other  bodies  interested   in

research,  like the Teachers' Training College  and

the University of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one matter to which I feel

this  Research Unit should give some attention.  We

in   Singapore   have  constantly  emphasised   the

importance of our human resources. In fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



some  reference has been made to the mild  derision

with  which  our intention to start  industries  in

Jurong  was  greeted.  But  we  have  succeeded  in

establishing  these industries at  Jurong,  and  we

have also succeeded in other enterprises because of

the  quality  of our human resources. Since  we  do

give  such emphasis to our human resources, perhaps

some  instrument could be devised by this  Research

Unit, or the matter could be gone into, whereby the

detection of specially intelligent people among  us

will be made much easier. And having detected those

who  are specially intelligent, we could give  them

special  attention in school so that their  talents

could be nurtured for the benefit of our society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Education has

spoken  to  some extent on the setting  up  of  the

Research  and  Statistics Unit in his  Ministry.  I

wonder  if he can throw some light on the  function

of  this  unit.  All  I  could  get  from  him  was

something pertaining to methodology and other forms

of  research,  and  that  in  a  few  years'  time,

according to him, we might get the results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the unit will play an important role

in  shaping  the  type of educational  system  that

Singapore  ought  to  have  in  relation   to   the

conditions we are in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has been in office for the past

11  years, and it has seen some changes, though not

very  drastic.  The  educational  policy  today  is

different from that in the colonial days.  In  this

respect, will this Research and Statistics Unit  do

research into our educational system so that in the

not   too  distant  future  we  will  be  able   to

streamline and trim off all the rough edges, so  to

speak, and formulate the proper type of educational

system that we need?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I venture to suggest to the Minister

that   this   unit  take  into  consideration   the

principles  of  education, the  syllabuses  in  the

primary   schools,  the  academic   and   technical

secondary schools, and in the technical institutes,

and also the extra-curricular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



activities  that students are required to  take  up

during  their  leisure hours? I think these  extra-curricular   activities  are  being   pursued   too

vigorously,  so much so that the students  have  to

spend more time in the field than in their studies.

My question is this: has the Minister realised that

the   heavy  emphasis  placed  on  extra-curricular

activities  has resulted in our having one  of  the

lowest  Cambridge  School  Certificate  examination

results  for  last year? Only a  few  days  ago  we

learned that there was a total of about 51 per cent

passes    in   last   year's   School   Certificate

Examination. Therefore, this Research Unit  has  an

important part to play, and I hope the Minister can

enlighten  this  House on the exact  role  it  will

play.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> I wish to thank Members for their very kind words

about  the Research and Statistics Unit, and  their

appreciation of the important role this unit has to

play in the development of our educational system.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise for the fact that the work of

the  Research  Unit  has not  been  made  known  to

Members.  The reason is that it was formed  only  a

year  ago.  I have a list here showing some  20  or

more duties it is performing. Looking at it, we can

see  that  it includes the analysis of the  Chinese

Secondary  IV  examination results, the  vocational

aspirations  of  school  leavers,  the   study   of

curriculum and so on. The Research Unit also serves

as  the  secretariat to the manpower group which  I

have  formed recently; it co-ordinates the work  of

some  half a dozen organisations involving manpower

data  collection and study. It is also involved  in

the  carrying  out of tests for the channelling  of

Secondary II students to Technical III classes  and

so  on. It is also concerned with the study of  the

professional aspects of the teaching of the  second

languages, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the specific question raised by the Member

for Katong, I can assure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



him  that  this unit enjoys a very good  degree  of

independence.  It is responsible  to  the  Minister

directly   through  me,  and  it  does   not   have

interference from any of the administrators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of spotting of talent, I must

admit  that this has been the preoccupation of  all

educationists for centuries throughout the world. I

can  assure  Members that we are  also  preoccupied

with  this particular problem. I cannot agree  more

with the Member

for Punggol - unfortunately he is not here -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> - that the Research Unit has

a  very  important  role to  play  in  shaping  our

educational system. In fact, one of the tasks which

this  Research Unit is undertaking  is  to  make  a

manpower  study of the shipbuilding  and  repairing

industry, the electronics industry, the examination

and analysis of the existing programme on technical

education and training, and to make recommendations

for  the long-term requirements of Singapore. These

are  some  of  the many duties which  the  unit  is

carrying out now.

completed its work?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the reports will be

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I shall be very short. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1131.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote is in respect of extracurricular

activities.  As  the name implies, extra-curricular

activities  should  be carried out  outside  normal

school  hours.  However, as far  as  I  know,  many

students  take  part  in  these  activities  during

school   hours,  especially  those  who  join   the

uniformed  groups  like the  Cadet  Corps  and  the

Police  Cadet Corps. This is a very serious problem

because   it  affects  the  work  of  the  students

concerned. They will find it difficult to cope with

class  lessons  as  well  as with  extra-curricular

activities during school hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra-curricular activities are compulsory in

schools. However, a student can attend to one thing

only  at the expense of the other. That is,  if  he

takes part in extra-curricular activities, he  will

do  badly  in his lessons. The standard  of  school

work  of  many  students has dropped  considerably.

Last  year I had occasion to mention this point  to

the  Minister, but the same position still  obtains

today.  Will  the Minister assure this  House  that

extra-curricular activities will  only  be  carried

out outside normal school hours?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, extra-curricular activities are

mainly conducted outside the school time-table. But

there  are times when it is not possible to do  so,

especially  when particular schools are  chosen  to

take  part  in  a  youth festival or  the  national

parade.  In  such cases, students will have  to  go

through  many  rehearsals. To do so outside  school

hours  may  not be possible at times. Occasionally,

they  are  sent to the Teachers' Training  College,

then  people will know that they are being  trained

as  teachers.  If  they come from the  Universities

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0801 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you yourself and the Minister for Communications will





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



agree  that we are faced with many serious problems

in  the field of communications, in particular, the

traffic   congestion  and  the  number  of  traffic

accidents. We know that traffic congestion and road

accidents   are   problems  which   confront   many

countries. Since we are faced with these  problems,

we should think of some schemes to resolve them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make two suggestions to relieve the

traffic  congestion. First, we should do away  with

parking  lots on the streets in the city  area.  If

you  widen  the streets, the traffic can flow  more

freely.  This  will reduce traffic congestion  and,

from  the  Government's viewpoint, this  is  better

than  taking  20 cents per hour from motorists  for

parking in the city area. The levy of this fee will

not   help  the  flow  of  traffic.  Secondly,  the

building  of  more public highways  is  a  pressing

problem. We should undertake this task straightaway

and  not  wait until several years later, otherwise

it will complicate matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics on accidents, there are

about 200 deaths on the road every year. This is  a

very  serious  problem. I have two  suggestions  to

reduce  the number of traffic accidents. First,  we

should promote more campaigns on road courtesy  and

give   them  wide  publicity.  For  instance,   the

Political  Secretary attached to  the  Ministry  of

Defence is quite reckless in his driving. He should

set  a  good example. We should ask all drivers  to

abide   by   the  traffic  rules  and  drive   more

carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Political Secretary, I will now

touch upon the question of old and shabby cars. The

engines   of   these  cars  are   not   functioning

efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Communications can take

measures to reduce the number of such cars  because

they  emit  obnoxious  fumes  which  endanger   our

health.  Furthermore, these cars cause many traffic

accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether he

will consider issuing more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



taxi  licences. According to statistics, there  are

about   14,000   drivers  who   have   taxi-driving

licences,  but  there are only  3,800  taxis.  From

these  figures, we can see that there is a shortage

of  taxis.  Therefore,  I hope  the  Minister  will

seriously consider issuing new licences for  taxis,

as   this   can   help  resolve  the  question   of

unemployment to a certain extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Transport Advisory Board was set up last

year.   Can   the  Minister  say   what   are   the

recommendations   of   this   Board?    How    many

recommendations have been implemented, and what are

the recommendations that have not been implemented?

What    are   the   Minister's   views   on   these

recommendations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to bring up the question of

old  bicycles.  Sir,  we often  see  people  riding

bicycles which are 20 or 30 years old. Some of them

are  without  lamps, some without  brakes,and  some

have   worn-out  parts.  Accidents  have   occurred

because  of ineffective brakes. Therefore,  I  hope

the Minister will look into this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one or two years ago, buses

were  provided for workers who live in the  eastern

part  of  Singapore  and who  work  in  the  Jurong

industrial  estate. Sir, this bus  service  is  not

available now. At that time, the demand for workers

was  not so great. With the rapid increase  in  the

number  of industries in Jurong and as workers  are

in   great  demand  now,  can  the  Minister   make

arrangements  with bus companies  in  Singapore  to

start an express bus service at centralised pick-up

points, say, from 6 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. and from 4.30

p.m. to  6.30 p.m. staggered every half  an  hour?

This  bus service will greatly help workers  living

in the eastern part of the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since I have put in an amendment* on the main Head, I would like to say something now.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that the plans to ease traffic

congestion should be co-ordinated with the plans to

redevelop our city. The Minister for Communications

has said that the traffic problem in Singapore is

acute. I would like to know whether there are new

proposals to resolve the traffic problem in our

small island of 225 square miles. In this

connection, can the Minister say whether there is a

plan to construct subways to solve part of our

traffic problem? Some countries have this system

for commuters to go from one place to another and

this may be a means to ease traffic congestion in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up bus stations and

parking  lots. The number of vehicles is increasing

and the Minister for Finance says that it is due to

our  prosperity and that the living standard of our

people has gone up. More and more of our people are

using motor-cars not as a means of transport but as

a  means  of  showing off, thereby causing  traffic

congestion  on the road. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether he will consider another proposal

for  easing  traffic congestion,  and  that  is  to

prevent  all  private cars from entering  the  city

within  a  three-mile radius. Workers can get  into

the city area only by public buses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong, you have only one minute to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to try to reply in one minute

to the comments of the three Members of Parliament,

I  think,  is  a  little  difficult,  but  I  shall

endeavour  to do so. First of all, the  Member  for

Sembawang, when speaking about traffic congestion,

suggested that we should do away with car parks and

build more public highways. These are matters which

come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



within  the  purview of my colleague, the  Minister

for National Development. I shall convey to him the

Member  for  Sembawang's suggestion for doing  away

with  car  parks and thereby doing  away  with  the

revenue from car parks. On the suggestion to  build

more  public highways, I think this is  already  in

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of reducing traffic accidents, we

entirely  agree  with the Member's suggestion  that

drivers should show more road courtesy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the dangers of having many old vehicles

either breaking down on the road or emitting fumes,

and  also causing accidents, this problem is  being

looked  into. In fact, this is one of the  subjects

touched  upon  by the Transport Advisory  Board  in

their  second interim report which I received early

this month and which is now under consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise the question of whether or not we should

issue  more  taxi licences. This is coming  up  for

consideration and I am not in a position as yet  to

give an answer to Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the suggestion of the Member

for  Changi  to  have  express buses  running  from

various city centres to and from Jurong is  a  good

one.  This will be given serious consideration.  In

fact,  I will appreciate it if the Member can  give

me  specific  proposals so that the matter  can  be

followed up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I presume this provision is for utility

services  for  the Marine quarters in Pulau  Brani.

These  quarters  for Division IV employees  of  the

Marine Department are quite new and can be utilised

for  many more years to come. But there is a defect

in  their construction. Under the building by-laws,

I believe it is required that the toilet facilities

in  a  building  should be at a specified  distance

away  from  the  kitchen.  But  the  type  that  is

provided  in  these quarters is not  in  conformity

with the building by-laws. I hope the Minister will

not  say that this is a matter for the Ministry  of

National  Development, because these  quarters  are

meant  for the Marine Department. As such, if these

quarters  have modern sanitation, then  it  is  all

right.  Furthermore, because of the bucket  system,

nobody  uses the toilet facilities. I would suggest

that   sufficient  toilet  facilities   should   be

provided  for  these quarters. I hope the  Minister

will   take   up  this  matter  with   the   proper

authorities  so  that these quarters  are  provided

with toilet facilities.

been  assistants to him and who have performed  the

duties   of   this   particular  post   in   acting

capacities.  By not filling this post substantively

since   the  beginning  of  1969,  does  the  Civil

Aviation  Department expect to fill this post  with

an expatriate? If so, is there not a possibility of

avoiding   the  filling  of  this  post   with   an

expatriate  but  with a local man who  can  perform

this duty?

indeed  very well informed of the staffing position

true that this post of Airport Traffic Officer fell

vacant on the 1st January, 1969, and in response

to  the invitation to fill the post, there were  15

applications and 11 were short-listed for interview

by  the Public Service Commission in August of last

year;  but,  unfortunately, none of the  candidates

was   considered   suitable  to   fill   the   post

permanently. At the moment, it is being temporarily

filled  in an officiating capacity. I suppose  that

in  due  course  of  time  there  will  be  another

promotion  exercise, and I can  assure  the  Member

that  no expatriate officer will be considered  for

this  post.  If  any  of  our  local  officers   is

considered  fit  to fill it, I think  the  decision

will then be taken at the appropriate time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first impression a tourist gets of

Singapore  is the smartness and efficiency  of  the

airport  personnel.  The Immigration  and  Customs

officers  do give such an impression to  passengers

using the airport. By and large, the airport police

are   also   doing  a  good  job, but   there   is

increasingly   the   sight  of  airport   policemen

slouching sloppily here and there. These  few  lazy

policemen mar the good work done by the others. Can

we  not  have  more  discipline and  responsibility

drilled into them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry to hear from the Member for Havelock

that  he considers our airport police to be  rather

sloppy; that they slouch and are sleepy looking. If

that is the real impression given, I can assure him

that  the  officer-in-charge of the airport  police

will  be asked to put matters right. May I say that

there  has also been a change in the person who  is

now  in  charge of the airport police. The previous

incumbent  has  left.  He  went  on  retirement  in

September  1969. So I think it is about  time  that

the new officer on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



secondment for two years from the Police  Force  to

the  airport,  exercised  discipline  and  put  our

airport police in the same frame of mind as that of

the rest of the police in the Republic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this provision for Good Conduct Allowance

was  brought  up  by my colleague, the  Member  for

Serangoon Gardens, during the last Budget  session.

When he brought this matter up he submitted, and  I

quote  (Hansard Vol. 28 No. 6 dated 17-12-68,  col.

500):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... that constables, security officers or whatever

personnel are entitled to this allowance  would  be

expected to show good conduct. I do not think there

should  be incentives for them to show good conduct

and receive monetary benefit for so showing.'



<br><br>I  cannot  put  the  case more concisely  than  the

Member  for  Serangoon Gardens who belongs  to  the

legal profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in his reply agreed with the

Member  for  Serangoon  Gardens,  and  stated  that

allowances   of  this  nature  were  possibly   not

necessary,  and  it  was also noted  that  no  such

payment  was  ever  made.  I  also  see  that  such

allowances  are  provided for in  the  Ministry  of

Interior and Defence. When are we going to do  away

with  the  payment of allowances for good  conduct?

This  seems  ridiculous, especially  when  monetary

incentives  are  offered to our  guardians  of  the

peace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have referred to the relevant

Hansard  and  there  were  statements  about   good

conduct allowances, etc. At that date there were no

payments,  but  I  understand  these  good  conduct

allowances   are   payable  to   police   officers,

including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



detectives,  between  the  ranks  of  sergeant  and

constable. Furthermore, since these allowances  are

pensionable,  the question needs to  be  gone  into

deeper before they can be withdrawn. Therefore,  so

long as they are still payable under the scheme  of

service, I am afraid we will have to meet the bill.

May I say that since I last spoke in Parliament, it

has  been  discovered that 72 of the rank and  file

are, in fact, eligible for this allowance, and many

of  them  are eligible for it retrospectively  from

1st  July,  1966. Therefore, there is  a  huge  sum

payable  by  the  end of this month,  amounting  to

$9,240.  Treasury approval has been given for  this

payment to be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a shocking revelation

that  even  back-payment is being made. I  am  just

wondering  if the Member for Serangoon Gardens  has

not  done a disservice by revealing to people  that

there are such allowances payable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I think I

have  to  make  a reply. It would appear  that  the

officer-in-charge of the airport police  was  under

the  impression  that it was in his  discretion  to

make  this payment and he decided he would not make

any   payment.  But  they  are  entitled  to   this

allowance  if they are generally of good behaviour,

etc, for three years, and they are eligible for  a

second allowance after another three years, and  so

on  and  so forth. This is part of their scheme  of

service. Unless it is agreed between the Government

and  the  Police  Force  that  this  allowance   be

scrapped,  I  am afraid we will have  to  meet  the

bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should be the last person to

say,  "Do  not  pay the workers for what  they  are

doing."  However, I do feel that a review  of  this

issue  must be made, because it sounds funny paying

good  conduct allowance to people who are  expected

to  show  good  conduct! However, in  view  of  the

Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0803 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3009.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved so as to get further

information from the Minister. This year's estimate

for this subhead exceeds the last estimates for  15

months   by   over   $12,000.  According   to   the

explanatory statement, it provides for the purchase

of one large trolley and ten small trolleys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my frequent visits to the airport I have

noticed the shortage of porters, especially  during

peak  hours.  I  have also noticed  that  in  other

international airports small trolleys are  provided

for  the  passengers' use. When there is a shortage

of  porters,  passengers can use these trolleys  to

clear   their   baggage  themselves  without   much

inconvenience.  I  would, therefore,  suggest  that

more small trolleys be provided for the passengers'

benefit. Can the Minister tell us if the ten  small

trolleys  to be purchased are for the  use  of  the

passengers?   If  not,  can  he   look   into   the

possibility  of purchasing more small trolleys  for

passengers' use?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am afraid the Member for Telok Blangah has

caught  me in his query whether the small  trolleys

are  really  for the use of individual  passengers,

just as in the supermarkets you shop around with  a

little trolley in which to put your purchases.  All

I  can  say  is that we do have something  like  37

small baggage trolleys. I presume they can be  used

by passengers if they want to, but, on the whole, I

would  say  that  this  large  allocation  of  over

$20,000  is the result of the National Productivity

Centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



having  been asked by the Minister for  Finance  to

look  into the question of complaints about  delays

in  the handling of luggage, which we received last

year from the Member for Havelock and others. As  a

result  of  this study by the National Productivity

Centre,  18 additional men were employed  and  four

large   baggage  trolleys  and  one  tractor   were

recommended.  This was part of the  purchase  which

formed  the  estimate under this subhead  3009.  If

these small baggage trolleys are not for passengers

to  use,  I  will  pass this recommendation  to  my

Director of Civil Aviation to follow up.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do feel that until very

recently  there was a need for these small trolleys

to  get baggage out of the clearance lounge to  the

taxi  stand,  and as the Minister has  promised  to

follow this up, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise some questions on the

General Post Office. The General Post Office was

built in 1928 when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



population  of  Singapore  was  less  than  half  a

million.  Today  the population is  more  than  two

million.  The  space  in certain  sections  of  the

General  Post Office for receiving and  despatching

of  letters remains the same. It is said that these

sections  are  now very congested and  dusty.  Even

some of the sorting frames are the same frames that

were  originally put up in 1928. In  the  basement,

the  parcel room, backroom and stores are the  same

rooms used since 1928.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if the Minister would make

surprise  checks  - not to tell  the  head  of  the

department  that he was going there,  as  otherwise

everything  would be made clean -- at these  places

in  order  to  see for himself the  actual  working

conditions of the postal staff. Does he know  about

that? Does he know how difficult it is for them  to

work there? If he wants them to work very hard,  he

should  see  that  there is proper ventilation  and

adequate  space for them to sort out  the  letters,

and  to put them into bags and so on. He must  give

them the space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there is a provision of $33,000 in the

Development Estimates for an extension - I  do  not

know  what  is the extension - of the General  Post

Office.  But I think the Minister should look  into

the  matter  and make improvements to  the  General

Post  Office,  especially for the  benefit  of  the

staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last Budget sitting I did

raise the question of provision of a full range  of

postal  facilities for the residents in Toa  Payoh.

The  Minister for Communications then said that  it

was anticipated that the Postal Services Department

would  be able to provide such services during  the

latter part of 1969. The number of residents in Toa

Payoh  has  now  nearly  doubled,  and  many  light

industries are being set up in the estate.  Two  of

them are already in operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, will the Minister indicate when

the Postal Services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



Department  will be able to provide such facilities

to the general public in Toa Payoh?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   share  the  sentiments  expressed  by  my   two

colleagues. What I wish to touch on is the delivery

services not only in Punggol Constituency but  also

in  the  other rural constituencies.  In  order  to

establish that there is a need to provide more  and

better  and  faster delivery services,  I  have  to

explain   my  points  by  means  of  a  couple   of

illustrations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first illustration concerns letters that are

to  be  delivered from Paya Lebar  Post  Office  to

areas in Upper Serangoon, Tampines, and Punggol.  I

have  received complaints that notices of  meetings

sent  out  by  my Citizens' Consultative  Committee

Secretary  were  not delivered  until  a  few  days

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second illustration - there was a time when

one  or two postmen went up to one of the community

centres  with  a  pile  of letters  and  asked  the

community centre staff to deliver them. When I  was

told  of  it,  I  said  no.  The  function  of  the

community  centre and its staff is not  to  deliver

letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third illustration, Sir, is in regard to a

case which I received of a national serviceman  who

was registered for national service in 1967 but was

not  called  up until last year. His complaint  was

that  he  had  not received any enlistment  notice.

Whether enlistment notices were sent to him or not,

I  am  not  in  a position to say. On  the  2nd  of

January  1970,  I  wrote to the  Postmaster-General

asking  for an explanation. To my surprise,  all  I

got  was a little blue card dated 5th January 1970,

acknowledging receipt of my communication. He  gave

me a reference number, and to date, Sir, I have not

received  any further reply. I tried  to  find  out

what  had been done in this respect, but all I  was

told  was that a reply had, in fact, been  sent  to

me. When I asked the Department whether it would be

possible for me to get a copy of their reply  since

I had not received one, they said that they were in

no position to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this state of affairs really surprises

me  because  I have a high regard for  the  Postal

Services Department which has managed to cope  with

the  ever-increasing volume of work - handling  and

delivering letters, parcels, etc.

with  a  good degree of efficiency. Then,  Sir,  to

borrow  the  saying, the last  straw  came.  I  was

surprised  to  hear, over the radio, of  complaints

from residents in Choa Chu Kang Constituency - Sir,

I am not for one moment speaking for the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang who is now absent - that in  places

like  Choa Chu Kang, letters were not delivered  in

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Communications will

consider  my  comments with  a  view  to  providing

either more postmen

or



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Motor-cycles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Motor-cycles, yes. The question of motor-cycles

just came to my mind. In Punggol there is only  one

delivery, and the old motor-cycle used for delivery

broke  down and a replacement, I believe, was  sent

for.  Unfortunately the new motor-cycle also  broke

down.  Sir, with these remarks, I hope the Minister

will care to look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to put forward

this point: in my constituency of Delta, the postal

services are inadequate. As all Members know, Delta

is  one  of  the constituencies where  mobility  is

highest, i.e., a lot of people move about. In  1962

the  ratio  was one to three or one  to  four.  The

postal  services in my constituency have not  shown

any   improvement   since   1962.   The   Citizens'

Consultative Committee has on many occasions  asked

me  why  the  postal services have not improved.  I

have requested for more pillar boxes or the opening

of  more post offices, but these requests have  not

been  acceded  to. The Committee has  made  several

representations to the Director of Postal Services,

and  has  also  written  to the  Minister  and  the

Postmaster-General for more pillar  boxes  or  post

offices. If the Postal Department thinks that my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



constituency is too small for a postal branch to be

set  up,  then I would like to mention that  in  my

neighbouring  constituencies, i.e., Bukit  Ho  Swee

and  Tiong  Bahru, there is also a  great  deal  of

population movement. With this population  movement

from  1962  up  to now, the ratio is still  one  to

four.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 10 years the number of people in

these  constituencies  who have  made  use  of  the

postal  services is not big. But with the  increase

of  literacy of our population, our postal services

have  to bear a greater burden because more  people

know  how to read and write, especially the younger

set.  Of  course, in the past some people  did  not

have   much   of  an  education,  and   when   they

communicated their love to one another, they did so

verbally. But nowadays they can write, and so  they

can  express  their  love  through  correspondence.

Therefore, they have placed a greater burden on the

Postal Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason is the increase in cultural

activities,  which  has  also  contributed  to  the

burden of the Postal Department. For instance, many

programmes  over  Television  Singapore,  such   as

public  forums  and games, require  correspondence.

This  has  resulted in a greater volume of  letters

being delivered. As an example, the Chinese Chamber

of  Commerce  organises a public essay competition.

All the entries have to rely on the postal services

to be delivered. Therefore, we know that the burden

on the Postal Department is greater nowadays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in the past people made use

of  other  channels  of  communication,  e.g, oral

communication.  But  nowadays,  because  of   urban

renewal  development,  more  and  more  people  are

scattered  over a wider area, and this necessitates

correspondence through the post.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more people are making use of the postal

services  to  send  messages  from  one  place   to

another.   Therefore,   with   the   increase    in

population, there is a greater volume of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



correspondence. It has been said that in  the  past

the  number  of people who made use of  the  postal

services  was  only 30 per cent of the  population,

but now probably 80 per cent of our people make use

of  them.  If our postal services remain  in  their

present state, of course, there will be an increase

in  inconvenience.  The  inconvenience  is  brought

about in two ways. First, more and more people will

become  discontented. Secondly,  the  postal  staff

will  also become discontented as a result  of  the

heavy  load  of work. We often say that the  postal

service  staff lose their temper whenever they  are

overworked  and  have to bear too great  a  burden.

With  a  bigger crowd queueing up every  day,  they

find  it difficult to cope up with their work. This

is one of the reasons why they lose their temper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will improve the postal

services  in  the  three  constituencies   I   have

mentioned. For example, in Queenstown a post office

was  built  to provide for the needs of the  people

there. I think they are rather privileged. They can

get  whatever  they  want. But  we  in  the  poorer

constituencies cannot get what we want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full sympathy with the

Member for Anson. He feels strongly about the  fact

that the General Post Office building was built  as

long ago as 1928. It is now more than 40 years old.

Conditions in that building may not be as  good  as

in the many new public buildings, some of which are

even air-conditioned. Of course, personally I would

like  to  see  a  new General Post Office  building

being  built  somewhere on the water front.  It  is

true that it is possible that certain parts of  the

building, for instance, the basement, may not be as

good as what one would like them to be. However,  I

shall  make  surprise checks at  the  General  Post

Office  in compliance with the Member's request.  I

want to say that things in the General Post Office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



will  not  always be the same. As and when  we  are

able to get sites, we will remove the stores branch

which is at present in the basement. I understand a

site has been allotted somewhere in Tannery Lane. I

think  provision  has  been  made  in  the  1970-71

Estimates.  There  will, therefore,  be  additional

accommodation at the General Post Office to  handle

the mail, and conditions should improve as a result

of this additional accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Toa Payoh, here again it is our intention

to provide more facilities in this new town. But  I

hope  the  Member will appreciate that building  in

Toa  Payoh  is largely in the hands of the  Housing

and  Development Board. I think the Member is aware

that  the  planning  of the  town  centre  was  not

completed  until the latter part of last year.  The

Housing  and Development Board made a statement  in

the   newspapers  as  follows.  I  will  read  this

statement which I assume is the official reply:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The construction of a town centre is expected to

start next year [which is 1970].

It is normal practice for the Board to start on the

development of the residential sector first and  to

incorporate a town centre only when the township is

three-quarters developed in order that there should

be  a  sufficient  population to support  the  town

centre.'



<br><br>Our  post  office is part of this town centre.  So,

much  as  we  would  like to  provide  full  postal

services  for  Toa Payoh, the building  of  a  post

office  in the town centre is in the hands  of  the

Housing and Development Board. When they are ready,

we will provide the facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Punggol, I am sorry to

hear  that the delivery of mail in the rural  areas

is  not  quite up to expectations. I  think  if  in

Singapore  we are able to provide even  one  proper

daily  service  in the rural areas,  we  have  done

reasonably  well. We do know that there  are  other

countries  which may be more affluent, but  if  you

post a letter there, probably that is the last time

you  will see it. It never gets delivered  at  all.

However,  we  cannot  excuse  Singapore  of   being

indifferent. We expect letters, when posted, to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



delivered in due time. As stated by the Member  for

Punggol,  it  is  possible  sometimes  for  letters

calling  for meetings to have been posted  but  not

delivered until after the event has taken place. It

can  happen. After all, millions of postal articles

are being posted and delivered at any one time.  If

you allow for .001 per cent of something happening,

then  it  might be that something has  happened  to

that  particular letter. Of course, there  are  the

usual  difficulties of incorrect  addresses  or  no

addresses  at  all and so on. There could  be  such

difficulties. But if, as stated by the  Member,  he

has taken issue with the Postmaster-General and all

that  he had received was just a post-card  to  say

that  the matter was receiving attention -this  was

way back in January and now it is almost the end of

March - I would like to say that in anticipation of

the  complaint  from  the Member,  I  did  ask  the

Postmaster-General whether there was  any  specific

complaint  from the Member. I was told  that  there

was such a complaint. I said, "Please let me have a

copy  of  the  complaint and  the  reply  from  our

department." Mr Speaker, Sir, to my horror  I  was

told  that  there was no copy of the  complaint.  I

asked   how  that  could  be  possible.  I   would,

therefore, appreciate it if, after the meeting, the

Member  would  be good enough to let me  have  that

particular reference so that I could follow  up  to

see  which  particular officer had dealt  with  the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Can the Minister say which is the particular

officer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That is why I want the evidence. I will go right

down to the bottom of this matter to assure Members

that  it is being pursued, especially since it came

from  a  Member  of  Parliament. Even  an  ordinary

complaint  from  a  member of the  public  must  be

looked into carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Perhaps the motor-cycle went out of order! It can

happen to a car or even an aeroplane!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to reply to the Member for

Delta  about  the inadequacy of postal services  in

Delta  Constituency.  I must  say,  Sir,  that  the

Member  is,  in fact, very lucky. In the  whole  of

Singapore  there  are about 41  post  offices.  She

already  has not only one post office, but quite  a

number  of  post offices close to her constituency.

The   Alexandra   Post   Office   is   inside   her

constituency,  and there are the Tiong  Bahru  Post

Office  and  the  Queenstown Post  Office.  She  is

quarrelling  about  Queenstown  being  a   favoured

constituency. I do not know why. A new non-delivery

post  office is scheduled to be built at Chin  Swee

Road  towards  the end of 1970. I  hope  that  will

satisfy her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice there is a provision of nearly half

a  million  dollars  under  this  subhead  for  the

payment  of daily-rated staff. I suppose the  money

is  required for the cutting of grass. We have many

receiving stations where the lalang which grows  in

the compounds is a couple of feet high. I would  be

grateful if the Minister for Communications  could

explain  the  provision of this large sum  for  the

payment of daily-rated staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the

Member  for  Punggol that this large  provision  of

nearly half a million dollars for daily rated staff

is  not only for cutting grass. If he will look  at

the  bottom of the page in the estimates,  he  will

see  note (ii) which reads: "Includes provision for

one  House Foreman and four Carpenters." If he will

look further up note (1) says: "Provision for daily

rated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



staff now shown separately under Subhead 2024."  If

he  looks at subhead 2008, he will see "Maintenance

of  Compounds and Buildings"; against subhead  2009

there  is  "Maintenance of Telecommunications"  and

against  subhead  2010  there  is  "Maintenance  of

Vehicles".  In the previous year's estimates,  that

is,  for  the  15  months from 1969  to  1970,  the

provision  for  daily-rated staff was  included  in

this  large  item of nearly a million dollars.  But

for the 12 months for this year's estimates, half a

million  dollars was extracted from this  provision

and made into a separate subhead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the position is as follows. For the

year  1969-70, there are as many as 200 daily-rated

staff. Then we have 56 Cable and Wireless staff who

have  been absorbed into Government service, making

a total of 256. For this year, there is an increase

of only two lorry drivers. In all, there is a total

of 258 daily-rated staff. There is no provision for

any  grass cutters here. All I can say is that  out

of  the  258  daily-rated  staff,  107  are  office

cleaners, labourers, store assistants, etc.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only wish to remind the Minister that it

was  during  the debate in December  1968  that  he

first   indicated  that  he  was   giving   serious

consideration   to  a  proposal   for   making   it

compulsory for all vehicles which are more than ten

years old to be subjected to a roadworthiness test.

Fifteen  months have gone by and we have not  heard

anything  further.  I  am just  wondering  what  is

holding up the implementation of the proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, I would also like to ask the Minister

how  effective the Transport Advisory Board  is  in

helping  us  solve  the  all-important  subject  of

public transport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been encouraging the

people of Singapore to keep Singapore clean so that

we can have a healthy environment and better health

for  the  people. But I have seen many cars,  buses

and lorries in the streets of Singapore letting out

dirty and poisonous fumes from their exhaust pipes.

These  dirty  and poisonous fumes not only  pollute

the air but they are also endangering the health of

the  people of Singapore. We must put a stop to it,

and the sooner the better. I understand that action

has  been taken against the offenders but there are

still  too  many  vehicles letting  out  dirty  and

poisonous fumes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I request stronger action should be taken

against  the offenders and heavier fines should  be

imposed on them. Perhaps an effective system  can

be adopted by empowering the Traffic Police to deal

with  offenders on the spot. I would  suggest  that

the fines be paid by the owners of the vehicles and

not  by  the  drivers, because the owners  must  be

responsible for their vehicles. If the emission  of

dirty  and poisonous fumes is due to the negligence

of the drivers, then it is up to the owners to deal

with   them.   I  hope  the  Minister   will   give

consideration  to my proposal and take  strong  and

immediate action against the offenders for  letting

out dirty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



and  poisonous fumes from their vehicles.  We  must

not  allow them to pollute the air and endanger the

health of the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the increase in the tempo

of  our industrialisation programme, more and  more

goods  are being transported by road. It is not  an

uncommon sight to see small vehicles carrying large

loads  and big vehicles carrying loads twice  their

length. Vehicles which are not designed for certain

types  of  haulage are used indiscriminately  along

our  roads, thereby posing a grave danger to  other

road users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have witnessed three incidents along the

roads  in  Singapore. One incident was along  Jalan

Ahmad Ibrahim. A lorry, stacked high with crates of

knocked-down  units of motorcar  spare  parts,  was

negotiating  a  bend when half  a  dozen  of  these

crates  fell on to the road. Fortunately,  my  car,

which was following behind, was quite some distance

away.  In another instance at Queenstown Circus,  a

lorry,   carrying  goods  which  were  inadequately

secured,  was negotiating the circus when  part  of

the load fell off the vehicle. In this instance, my

car  was  also  following behind,  but  fortunately

nothing untoward happened. In the third instance, a

lorry,  carrying  a lot of steel  rods  which  were

twice the length of the lorry itself, was going  up

a  steep  incline when suddenly the  front  of  the

lorry upended and all the steel rods fell on to the

road.  As I said, I wonder whether the Registry  of

Vehicles  has any regulations preventing owners  of

lorries  from  stacking their vehicles  with  goods

that are two or three times as high as the lorry or

goods that are twice the length of the lorry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a common practice for transport

contractors  to  make  the  maximum  use  of  their

vehicles. For instance, if the lorry is licensed to

carry  three  tons,  they will stack  goods  in  it

weighing about three tons. Imagine empty oil  drums

and  rattan loaded into the lorry and their  height

is two or three times that of the lorry. This can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



create  a  very dangerous situation for other  road

users. I hope the Minister for Communications  will

take  notice of such undesirable practices and stop

them from being continued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the bus services in Singapore, we all

know  that  the  Singapore Traction Company  has  a

virtual monopoly of city routes. Since it is unable

to  provide  an efficient and frequent service  for

bus  users,  I  wonder whether  the  Minister  will

consider  other alternative measures like  allowing

other bus companies to ply these routes until  such

time  as  the  S.T.C. can improve  their  services.

There   are  also  frequent  break-downs   of   the

Company's  buses.  In Toa Payoh, this  Company  has

more  than half a dozen bus services running.  This

gives  the false impression that it is providing  a

proper service to the people. But the truth of  the

matter  is that only a minimum number of buses  are

being used. Can the Minister for Communications look

into  this  matter  and  try  to  improve  the  bus

services in the new town?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, stories of rudeness and cheating by taxi

drivers are rampant and are frequently in print  in

the  local newspapers. Some taxi drivers  are  even

reported   to   have  threatened  passengers   with

assault.  I have heard that some top civil servants

and  a Parliamentary Secretary were threatened with

assault and abuse. Of course, these rude, dishonest

and belligerent taxi drivers are in a minority. But

they  are  enough to give Singapore a bad  name  to

visitors,  and if unchecked, may also  force  local

passengers  to  avoid taking taxis. There  must  be

stricter supervision of these taxi drivers and more

energetic  action should be taken on complaints  by

passengers. Recently, there was a campaign to  have

cleaner  taxis. There should also be a campaign  to

have  honest  and polite taxi drivers. Furthermore,

when it rains, it is impossible to get a taxi. So I

hope  when  the findings of the Transport  Advisory

Board  are  to  hand,  the Minister  will  consider

whether there is a need to issue more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



taxi   licences.  Also  will  he  state  how   many

complaints  have  been received against  rude  taxi

drivers from 1968 to the latest available date  and

what action has been taken against them?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one small point -and one would

have thought that it was a fairly obvious point! In

spite  of the fact that we have introduced  one-way

traffic along most of Singapore's roads, it is  not

difficult  to find buses, lorries and  even  motor-cars travelling abreast of one another at about 20

miles per hour and preventing other road users from

going through. It occurred to me quite a number  of

times, and I would have thought that it would  have

occurred  to  most people, that this problem  could

have  been  easily  solved by the  introduction  of

lanes  on  the left-hand side of the road for  slow

traffic and lanes on the middle and right-hand side

of  the  road for faster traffic. I wonder if  this

plan can be achieved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have heard just now that

there  are about 200 deaths on the road every year.

Perhaps  the  Minister for Health and the  Minister

for Communications seldom go to the hospital to see

how  many  road  accidents occur in  Singapore.  We

realise  that  most  of these fatal  cases  involve

motor-cyclists.   Recently,   the   Minister    for

Communications ordered all motor-cyclists  to  wear

crash  helmets but they were not ordered to put  on

iron gloves and iron boots. Of course, the head  is

important and must be protected, but the  arms  and

the   limbs  are  also  very  important.  Can  the

Minister  not  see  that it is also  necessary  for

motor-cyclists to wear iron gloves and boots? If  a

youth  becomes  crippled in  an  accident  for  not

having  iron  gloves or boots on, then perhaps  the

Minister will have to see to the consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point that I want to bring up.

When  an  "L" driver takes his test, he  should  be

asked to pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



careful  attention  to  the  fundamental  rules  of

driving.  Some "L" motor-cyclists go at a  terrific

speed. At times, they drive recklessly, swerving to

the  left and to the right. They look like shooting

arrows  flying  past. I myself have witnessed  them

cutting across the paths of other vehicles in  one-way  streets.  I am worried about the children  and

old  folks  on  the  road.  These  reckless  motor-cyclists are really a menace to these people.  They

are not aware of this, particularly the young motor-cyclists  who  have their girl friends  as  pillion

riders.  They want to show off and they are  liable

to  skid on slippery roads. Therefore, the Minister

for Communications should advise motor-cyclists  to

be  more  careful  when driving  on  newly-metalled

roads  and  sandy  stretches  on  rainy  days  when

certain  stretches of the roads are  dangerous  for

driving.  Driving testers should also inform  them,

during  the  test,  that when  they  are  about  to

negotiate a corner and they cannot see anything  in

front,  they should not speed and they  should  not

overtake  the vehicles in front. They  should  pass

all these tests before licences are issued to them.

Sir,   I   hope  the  Minister  will  consider   my

suggestions  regarding testing for "L" drivers  and

motor-cyclists.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime in the middle of

Registrar  of  Vehicles  to  have  their   licences

renewed.  They  had a document stating  that  their

licences  were expiring sometime in the  middle  of

February. However, they were told that all licences

were valid only up to the end of January because of

the  introduction  of computers.  In  other  words,

although  a  driver actually had his licence  valid

till about the 15th February, he was told that,  in

actual fact, his licence had expired at the end  of

January. These licence holders were also told  that

the  Registrar of Vehicles wrote to them  informing

them of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



introduction  of  computers,  and,  as  a   result,

licences  were only valid till the end of  January.

Therefore, not renewing their licences at  the  end

of  January was an offence and, although  they  had

lost  some days as a result of the introduction  of

computerisation, they had to pay a fine. This is  a

little  incongruous because they had an  authorised

licence  which  stated, "Your licence  expires  on,

say,  18th  February"; yet when they  went  to  the

Registry of Vehicles on the 15th February  to  have

their  licences renewed, they were told that  their

licences had, in actual fact, expired at the end of

January  because of computerisation. I  think  this

practice  is  wrong  as  they  were  still  holding

licences  valid up to the middle of February.  Even

if  with the introduction of computerisation, their

licences  should have been renewed on the  31st  of

January, I feel they should not have been fined for

late renewal. Sir, I hope the Minister will find it

possible to comment on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to answer

the  query from the Member for Jalan Kayu.  I  will

take his second question first. As to how effective

the Transport Advisory Board is, I wish to say that

I  consider it to be of great value to me,  because

it  does  help to get opinion outside  of  official

quarters,  as a good number of the members  on  the

Advisory Board are not in Government service.  They

are  people who are prepared to express an  opinion

on   a   difficult  subject,  that  of  traffic   in

Singapore.  I  have  seen to it,  too,  that  my

Parliamentary  Secretary be the  Chairman  of  this

Board.  So,  in my opinion, the Transport  Advisory

Board is doing a good service and I want to say how

much  I  appreciate  its good  work.  Most  of  its

recommendations  have  been  accepted.  The  second

interim report has come to me early this month  and

it  is under study. I can, I think, divulge some of

its  main  recommendations, but I will not disclose

the details. The recommendations cover the subjects

of  ordinary  taxis, school taxis (the  SCH  cars),

school buses, and the age limit of public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



service    vehicles.    These    are    the    main

recommendations, and as soon as I am in a  position

to  form  an  opinion on them, they  will  be  made

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that I have given an undertaking to look

into  the matter of checking old cars on the roads.

However,  I have found it better not to confine  my

study  of the problem only to old private vehicles,

but  to all other types of vehicles as well. I have

therefore  withheld action, and as  indicated  just

now,  the Transport Advisory Board has made certain

recommendations on the age limit of public  service

vehicles. So when I do come to a decision on public

service  vehicles, I will at the same time  make  a

decision   on   private  cars.  I  hope   that   my

explanation will satisfy the Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the comments by the Member for Bukit

Ho Swee on air pollution, the smoky exhaust  from

cars,  taxis, buses, lorries and so on, I  want  to

say  that action has been taken in recent years  on

these matters. I would like to say that the Traffic

Police  compounded as many as 7,353 cases in  1969;

that is to say, when a traffic policeman notices  a

car  emitting  smoke  from its  exhaust  pipe,  the

driver is given a ticket and is asked to report  to

the  police station where he is allowed to compound

his  offence for $20. There were 7,353  such  cases

last  year.  In addition, last year  we  called  up

8,800  vehicles for a check-up of their exhaust  at

the  Registrar  of Vehicles' office. Therefore,  in

total,  about 16,000 vehicles were pulled up.  They

were mainly diesel-operated cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that it is the intention of

my  Ministry  to  conduct a  campaign  against  air

pollution   very  soon.  There  will  be   stronger

measures  taken against cars with smoky exhaust  be

they private cars, lorries, taxis, buses and so on.

When  the campaign is to be set in motion, we  will

give  adequate  notice  to  the  public  before  we

proceed  to  take  stronger  action  against  smoky

vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the comments of the Member for Toa

Payoh on overloading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



of    vehicles   as   a   result   of   our   rapid

industrialisation, with lorries  overloading  goods

and  building materials, I think there is something

up  the  sleeve of my colleague, the  Minister  for

Defence, to deal with this matter. His very  active

Traffic   Police  does  go  round   ticketing   the

offenders. I am sure they will continue to keep  up

with  their  good  work to book them  so  that  the

recalcitrants  will  not  find  it  profitable   to

overload their lorries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the inability of the Singapore

Traction Company to provide an adequate service for

Toa Payoh, I would like to say that, in my opinion,

there  are  not  enough buses  to  serve  Singapore

today.  There are, in all, only about  1,500  buses

owned  by  the S.T.C. and the other 11 Chinese  bus

companies to provide a public transport service for

Singapore.  We  are  looking into  this  matter  of

inadequate buses for public transport. In fact,  we

are  getting  the Singapore Traction Company's  co-operation  to  permit the Chinese bus companies  to

operate bus services along certain routes for which

it  is unable to provide an adequate service. There

is  closer co-ordination now than in the past among

the  12 bus companies. I am confident that given  a

little bit more time and discussion, we may be able

to co-ordinate the bus services of Singapore and to

improve  them  in due course. Certain  matters  are

under discussion and I think it would not be proper

for me to reveal them here at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the comments of the Member for Havelock

on rudeness and cheating by taxi drivers, he has, I

think, partly answered the criticism by saying that

only  some of the taxi drivers are bad. As  in  any

stratum  of society, there are always the good  and

the  bad.  So  I think it is not fair  to  pinpoint

them, especially as the Member for Changi wants  to

know  who  these rude taxi drivers are, because  he

has  to  defend his drivers as well.  There  is  no

doubt that we are taking action on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



these  complaints. Most times complainants are  not

prepared to furnish particulars. That is why it  is

difficult to follow up on such complaints.  But  if

after  investigation we do find  they  are  genuine

complaints, we will either suspend the taxi  driver

concerned  from driving for one week or longer,  or

even  cancel  his licence if it is  necessary.  The

Member has asked for the number of complaints  from

1968.  Details will probably take some time  to  be

forthcoming, but I hope he will be satisfied  if  I

send  him the figures later by post for his follow-up  and  criticism. However, I can assure him  that

when  we  get complaints, we do follow up, provided

the   complaints  lodged  give  all  the  necessary

particulars, and not complaints stating merely that

there is an overcharge and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Bukit Panjang who

suggested the marking out of slow and fast  traffic

lanes, I think this is a very good suggestion which

I  am  sure the Transport Advisory Board will  give

due consideration. We have the Officer-in-Charge of

the Traffic Police on the Transport Advisory Board.

So a matter like this will receive due attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the Member for Ulu Pandan. I cannot

see  how,  after  advising motor-cyclists  to  wear

crash  helmets to save their skulls, the Member  is

suggesting  that they should also wear iron  gloves

to  save  them  from breaking their arms.  That  is

something  which  I  think  cannot  be  taken   too

seriously.  He  also  suggests lecturing  to  young

people  who  ride motor-cycles. It  is  unfortunate

that   young   people  will  always  do   something

reckless, and they have to pay the price for  their

recklessness. We can only advise them  as  best  we

can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah talks about driving

licences  which actually expired in mid-month  but,

because  of computerisation, had been valid  up  to

the  end  of the preceding month only, so that  the

holders of these licences lost out by two or  three

weeks.  As  a  result, they  were  fined  for  not

renewing their licences in time. However,  even  if

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



were  fined, it was only $3. I think they had  been

given  one  full year's notice of this change,  and

such a thing happens once in a lifetime. Perhaps we

can  just  forget  about it. It is  all  over  now.

Because of computerisation, some people would stand

to gain something, while others would stand to lose

something.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of

Madam  Chan  Choy  Siong  -

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2012.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I just want to seek

elucidation  from  the  Minister  why  there  is  a

provision of $4,000 for Highway Code Tests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, Highway Code tests

were  done orally. But because of the large  number

of  people being kept waiting to take their driving

tests,  which  include the Highway  Code  test,  we

decided to institute a written test. It is like  an

examination  paper  where  everything  is  done  in

writing.  In  an  oral  test the  tester  can  take

probably 10 or 20 candidates per day, but a written

test  can perhaps take 400 candidates per day.  The

applicant's  paper is marked, and he either  passes

or  fails the examination. So this money really  is

to  pay for the stationery and a small fee, like an

examiner's fee, for the people who mark the papers.

I think this expenditure is really worth while.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 11 months from April 1969 to February

1970  since  we started this written  Highway  Code

test,  there were 10,632 candidates, of whom  7,642

passed,  or nearly 72 per cent. In this  way,  less

people  are  kept  waiting in the queue  for  their

driving tests. It is our opinion that this  sum  of

$4,000 will be well spent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's satisfactory

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,280,090 for Head 0807 ordered to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0901 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Estimates for this year take the

greatest  part  of our expenditure, totalling  $320

million. We know that the Government provides  this

large sum because of practical needs. I would  like

to  raise  three questions. First, whether national

service  has  affected highly  qualified  technical

personnel.   Second,  whether   the   Minister   is

considering  national  service  for  women.  Third,

whether  we  have adequate measures to counter  the

entry of illegal immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question we know that national

service   has  been  very  successful   since   its

introduction. As a young country we have managed to

achieve  a  great deal in respect  of  our  defence

within a short period of time. This is commendable.

We  know  that  in order to build  up  our  defence

forces,  we  have to adopt a strict policy  on  the

implementation of national service. For the good of

the country, this policy is beyond reproach. But as

a  result  of the strict implementation of national

service,  a  number of problems  have  arisen.  For

example,  certain  engineering  students   in   the

University have been called up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



for national service. This has caused a shortage of

engineers in Government and statutory boards,  such

as the Economic Development Board, and also in some

factories. Let me quote an example. There were  two

mechanical engineering graduates from New  Zealand,

one  a Malaysian citizen, and the other a Singapore

citizen.  The  Malaysian citizen was  very  quickly

appointed by the Government. On the other hand, the

Singapore   citizen,  who  is  also  a   mechanical

engineer,  was called up for national  service.  Is

this not a show of favouritism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that it is the duty of a citizen to

undergo national service, but when we suffer from a

severe shortage of engineers who are needed for the

development of our economy and industry, we  should

make  good  use of the talent of our  graduates  in

this field, so that they can play a greater part in

contributing towards the building of our country. I

think  the Minister will agree with me that  it  is

equally important to develop our industries and our

economy. If we can do so without affecting national

service,  I would like to ask him if he  will  give

special    consideration   to   these   engineering

graduates  who are called up for national  service.

For example, perhaps we can devise some arrangement

whereby  we  could  put them on part-time  national

service.  I  do  not know what the Minister  thinks

about this suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in regard to national service

by  our women. I remember during the debate on  the

last  Budget,  I  asked  the Minister  whether  the

Government was considering drafting our women  into

national  service. The Minister's  reply  then  was

that  this was a very good suggestion, but  because

we  did  not have enough instructors, the plan  was

temporarily postponed and he would reconsider it at

a  later stage. But now after a lapse of about  two

years,  I  think  we  have  a  greater  number   of

instructors. Therefore, the time has come for us to

consider the implementation of national service for

our women.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons for putting forward this

suggestion  are  twofold.  First,  we  believe   in

equality  of the sexes, and, therefore,  our  women

should   also  shoulder  their  responsibility   of

protecting  our  country. Duty  and  responsibility

come  together. Second, it is necessary for  us  to

ensure  that, in the utilisation of our  resources,

we  will not meet with a lop-sided situation,  that

is,  concentrating on one aspect and neglecting the

other. Our female citizens should do their part  in

national  service.  All  our  youths  have  to   do

national  service, and therefore they are  hampered

or  restricted. Some of them cannot go for  further

studies. If we allow this situation to carry on, we

will  find  that  our youths, as  compared  to  our

girls,  will  suffer. Our women will be  graduates,

scholars or doctors of philosophy, and the majority

of  our  men  will  be just ordinary  citizens  and

soldiers  and not distinguished professionals.  Our

society  will be lopsided in favour of  the  women,

and there will be no equality of the sexes. I think

all  Members  of Parliament will not like  this  to

happen, because if it did, then perhaps there would

be   more   lady  Members  than  male  Members   of

Parliament.



The  purpose  of  nation  building  is  to  have  a

society where both sexes are equal. We do not  like

to  see a reversal of the situation where they  are

not  equal.  So  we should deal with this  question

very carefully. I think the girls will support  the

idea  of drafting them for national service.  There

are  many  countries in the world which  have  done

this.  For  example,  Israel has  already  inducted

women into national service. And we can learn  from

them how to induct our girls into national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that I would like to raise is

this.  Not very long ago we amended our immigration

laws  to  help us deal with the question of illegal

immigrants. Since then, have we had better  control

over illegal immigrants?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang was

very  kind  when  he  said  that  women  should  do

national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



service and so play their part. His logic is  this: if  the  women should survive, then the  men  would

have no place to go to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody is concerned with the question of

defence. When the British Government announced  its

accelerated  withdrawal by the end of  1971,  i.e.,

all the British armed forces stationed in Singapore

will  be  fully withdrawn by the end of  1971,  our

Government  started to carry out effective  schemes

in advance to prepare for such a situation.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every young man in our country will then become

patriotic.  He will be concerned about the  welfare

of  the  people. Our youths will have  a  sense  of

patriotism and take up military training. Within  a

short  time  we have managed to build up  a  strong

defence  force,  consisting  of  brave  and  strong

soldiers who will defend our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether we have

plans to replace all the military personnel as well

as  all  the  military equipment  which  are  being

withdrawn  by the British. In other words,  can  we

take  over  the  role played by  the  British?  Our

original   defence  planning  was  based   on   the

assumption that the British armed forces  would  be

withdrawn in 1971 or 1972. Our defence forces might

be able to replace the British armed forces by that

date. But as they are to be withdrawn earlier  than

anticipated, do we have enough trained men to  fill

the  vacuum  left  by them? Can  the  Minister  say

whether  we  can replace the British  armed  forces

with our own forces when they finally withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the Government has been quite

successful  in its efforts to build  up  our  armed

forces.  However, as the Member for  Sembawang  has

mentioned  just  now,  as  a  result  of   national

service,  there  is a shortage of skilled  manpower

and   this  is  having  an  effect  on  our  nation

building.  Will the Minister, therefore,  introduce

some changes in the regulations governing national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



service? National service can be introduced in  the

schools.  The  youths of Singapore  should  undergo

national service earlier, preferably when they  are

still  in  the  Primary schools. They should  begin

their national service training in Primary V or VI.

They  can  receive  military training  and  acquire

knowledge  of military affairs at this  stage,  and

when they go to the Secondary schools they can then

receive   regular   military  training,   including

training  in the handling of weapons. In this  way,

they will have undergone some military training and

have  acquired a knowledge of how to  use  military

equipment by the time they leave school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also said just now

that both males and females should undergo national

service.  If we can introduce some changes  in  our

national service regulations according to what  has

been  suggested, then both males and  females  will

undergo national service at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are many uniformed groups in

the  schools,  e.g., the School Cadet Corps.  These

groups  have done some military training and gained

some knowledge of the use of military equipment. In

view  of  this, it is not impossible  to  introduce

some changes in our national service regulations on

the  lines suggested. At the same time, we can also

solve the problem of the shortage of highly skilled

manpower  and technical personnel which has  arisen

as  a result of national service. A great number of

technical  personnel  have  been  called   up   for

national   service.  This  shortage  of   technical

personnel  is hampering our efforts to develop  our

economy.  If we can build up our defence forces  on

the  lines suggested, we can perhaps reduce the sum

provided for defence expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, in order to meet the situation

brought  about by the accelerated British  military

withdrawal, national service was implemented  as  a

matter  of course. But we have reached a saturation

point  in this respect. Perhaps we should introduce

some changes in our national service regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring another matter to the

attention  of the Minister for Defence.  Under  the

present national service regulations, every citizen

on  reaching 21 years of age will have to report to

the  Kallang Manpower Base for registration. May  I

ask  the Minister whether or not it is true that  a

certain  number  of  rich  men's  sons  have   been

exempted  from national service? I have heard  some

people  say  that the sons of poor people  have  to

undergo national service and that the sons of  rich

people  can  escape it. We should treat all  people

alike. We should perhaps make a public announcement

that that is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerns the Immigration

Department. If Mr Speaker thinks that the topic on

immigration  can  be postponed  until  we  come  to

debate  it, then I will wait. But I am afraid  that

when  the time comes, there will not be enough time

to discuss it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were talking on education, I had many

points  to raise, but I had gone through only  half

of  my  questions  when the Moment of  interruption

came.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member should wait until we come to the

debate on immigration before speaking on it.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will then wait until we come to the debate on

immigration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I wish to ask the Minister is

this.  When the Japanese invaded Singapore, a great

number  of our people bravely undertook the defence

of  our country and some sacrificed their lives. At

that  time they joined what was known as the  Civil

Defence  Corps.  Many of them were  killed  by  the

Japanese  in  the course of defending our  country,

leaving  behind them widows and orphans  and  other

dependants. All the dependants of the victims  were

compensated according to the regulations in  force.

The  Government  has all this time  been  paying  a

fixed rate of allowances to the widows and orphans.

I  wish to ask a question which was also brought up

in  this  House last week but not pursued in  great

detail. I wish to talk on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



this matter in greater detail now. These dependants

were to receive their allowances on the 27th day of

the  Chinese  calendar month preceding the  Chinese

New  Year. At that time traffic congestion  was  at

its  worst.  As  usual, these people  went  to  the

second floor of Fullerton Building to collect their

allowances.  The staff there told  them  that  from

then onwards their allowances were to be cut almost

in  half.  For example, if they were receiving  $45

before, they would receive only $19.50 on that day.

They  did  not tell the dependants when to  collect

the  balance of the money. They only told  them  to

collect it at the Ministry of Defence. Some of them

then went to the M.I.D., the same afternoon. When they

reached the M.I.D., it was almost closing time. The

staff there told them that they could not make  any

payment  as it was closing time and requested  them

to  come again the following day. The following day

was   the   28th  day,  according  to  the  Chinese

calendar,  and the traffic congestion was terrible.

These people had to pay about $3 in taxi fare.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad that you have

allowed me to speak, because I wish to touch on the

question of national service. Sir, we all know that

in  1971,  the  British will be  withdrawing  their

armed   forces   east  of  Suez,  including   those

stationed  in Singapore. Therefore, the defence  of

Singapore  will be our responsibility. In  building

up  our  defences, our Government has  started  its

planning  and  implementation of national  service.

This  is,  of  course, beyond  our  criticism.  The

concept   of  national  service  has  now  received

widespread  support of the majority of our  people.

But   we  must  be  cautious  in  implementing  the

technical  details so that our progress  in  nation

building is not affected. We must also ensure  that

the livelihood of our people is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



affected. If we can bear in mind these points  when

implementing the policy, then I am sure the  people

will be willing to go through all sorts of hardship

and suffering for the sake of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Minister for Defence announced that

students    who   have   completed   pre-university

education  and who are 18 years old  will  have  to

register  for  national service and  will  have  to

undergo  national service for three years. I  would

like to know whether careful consideration has been

given to the implementation of this policy. I think

hasty  implementation will  lead  to  a  number  of

undesirable  consequences. In the first  place,  it

will  have  a  bad effect on the education  of  our

youths.  Although  the  education  policy  of   our

Government   now  places  emphasis   on   technical

education,  we  should  not  overlook  the  general

education  policy  of our country,  i.e.,  primary,

secondary  and tertiary education. Furthermore,  if

all  H.S.C. holders are conscripted, the  enrolment

at  our  institutions of higher  learning  will  be

drastically   reduced.  And  as  the   Member   for

Sembawang  has  mentioned, these institutions  will

have only female students. In Singapore, university

education  is  quite a common affair. Every  parent

would  like  his or her boy to receive a university

education.  Our  country,  which  depends  on   the

utilisation of human resources, should try to  make

use  of  the talents of our youths. If we  make  it

compulsory  for  all  H.S.C. holders  to   undergo

national  service for three years and if  they  are

admitted  to  the Universities after  this  period,

they  will have forgotten a great deal of what they

have learnt in school unless the M.I.D. can arrange

for  them to attend academic courses when they  are

undergoing national service. It is only in this way

that  the  general education policy of our  country

will not be affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five institutions of higher learning in

our country which have trained and educated many of

our citizens over the decades. If we implement this

new  regulation, then these institutions will  find

that  their enrolment will be reduced. And in  time

to come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



we  will find that the professional people who  are

required  by  our  country  will  be  predominantly

females.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the adverse effect on the

physique  and minds of the students. We  know  that

pre-university students at the most  are  about  18

years  old.  Some  of them are not fully  developed

physically  and are immature. With  only  a  Higher

School  Certificate, it is difficult  for  them  to

compete  in  our society which is full of  talented

and  capable  people. If they cannot  pursue  their

university education, then our country will lose  a

lot  of talent. Therefore, I hope the Minister will

reconsider  the  policy to conscript pre-university

students.  Personally, I feel  that  pre-university

students  who  are  not going for  further  studies

should  be enlisted. However, if they achieve  good

results    in   the   Higher   School   Certificate

examinations  and if they want  to  go  on  to  the

Universities,  the  M.I.D, should  defer  enlisting

them   until  such  time  as  they  complete  their

university  education. In this way,  they  will  be

better qualified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Defence made a

press  statement on 24th January this year  on  the

policy  of  enlisting our youths who have completed

their Higher School Certificate education for full-time national service if they are above the age  of

18  years.  This is not a wise move from the  socio

economic  and  academic points  of  view.  If  this

policy of enlistment is implemented, it will create

a   very   serious  gap  of  discontinuity  between

secondary  and university education.  Further,  the

pace  of industrialisation and economic development

of  our  Republic will be slowed down for  lack  of

graduates  and  professionals to man the  essential

posts  in the various fields. Sir, we must remember

that only a small percentage of our youths who have

completed pre-university education are accepted for

admission into our institutions of higher learning.

If  we  introduce  full-time  national  service  in

between pre-university and university education and

against the will of the pre-university boys who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



are  keen on higher studies, it is likely to  cause

dissatisfaction among them and their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, after two or three years' full-time

national  service,  our  boys  will  find  it  very

difficult,  if  not impossible, to  continue  their

studies  in  the  institutions of higher  learning.

Further,  this new policy of enlistment can  dampen

the  secondary school boys' spirit and interest  in

study,  because they know very well that they  will

be  called  up  upon the completion of  their  pre-university education.



This new policy also appears to be incompatible

with our drive for greater economic growth for

which we require more and more qualified personnel

in the various fields. What is more important is

that if our supply of professionals cannot keep up

with the increasing demand, we may have to turn to

foreign countries for our needs. This is happening

now and we certainly do not wish to see the

situation worsen. I contend that the new policy of

enlistment of Higher School Certificate holders is

not consistent with our present policy of self-reliance and will prove to be detrimental to the

economy of our country in the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Defence said in his press

statement  that  arrangements  would  be  made  for

H.S.C. holders  to attend academic courses  during

their  full-time national service. He further  said

that  there  would  be plans  for  those  who  have

attained  commissioned  officers'  rank,  and  have

achieved  good results in the academic courses  provided  by  the Singapore Armed Forces during  their

three  years  of training, to be considered  for  a

credit  of  one  academic year  in  their  accepted

course  of  study. This, of course, is a very  very

good  arrangement,  but  I  doubt  whether  it   is

practical to implement. Sir, military training is a

full-time  course by itself and the  trainees  will

find  little  time for study after  long  hours  of

usually strenuous physical training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, probably you are aware that in some

advanced  countries  there is  a  military  academy

which  offers its graduates commissioned  officers'

rank  as  well  as  academic degrees,  usually  the

Bachelor of Science degree. Until we can afford  to

have  such  a  military  academy,  we  have  to  be

satisfied with our own system of national  service.

If we do have such a military academy, I am sure it

needs  no  compulsion at all to call our youths  to

join  the  academy for their military  training  as

well  as for academic degrees. But, for the moment,

let us not deprive the universities of the cream of

our youths who are so badly needed for the training

of  qualified  personnel for our country.  I  would

therefore  urge  the Minister for  Defence  not  to

implement the new policy of enlisting Higher School

Certificate holders for full-time national  service

until   they   have   completed  their   university

education.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not intend to speak, but

as  this is a matter touching on defence, which  is

extremely  important, I have to vent  my  feelings.

Yesterday  I  said that because defence expenditure

is  too great - of course, I am not objecting  to

the  provision  for national defence  -  we  should

think  of  some  better methods  to  reduce  it.  I

suggest that national service should start  in  our

schools.  Why  should  the  Minister  for   Defence

conscript youths after they leave school?  This  is

not quite a good method. So we should change it and

arrange  for national service for boys  while  they

are  at school. In other words, give them some sort

of  military training while they are in school.  In

this way, we can save a lot of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a small country, and we are a member of a

five-nation defence pact. I am against  this  five-nation defence pact. What kind of strength will  it

have?  I  am  afraid that one day our Minister  for

Defence  may have to be our Commander-in-Chief  and

lead  the  army in defence of our country.  But  we

have only a small army and it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



be  wiped out in one battle. There will be no  more

males  left. Singapore will then become  a  women's

country.  Some  outsiders will have to  be  brought

into Singapore to marry the females. This is not  a

favourable  situation. What kind of  a  five-nation

defence  grouping do we have? What kind of  defence

can we have?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to hold a big defence exercise in

the  coming  month, but this will be  held  outside

Singapore!  People will die laughing at this  joke.

If  you want to hold a defence exercise, you should

hold  it in your own country. How are you going  to

have  a defence exercise if it is held in a foreign

territory? People may think that you are  going  to

invade their country. The defence exercise is going

to be held on the 1st of April. The Communists will

consider   this  defence  exercise  as  aiming   at

committing aggression against some other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we have this five-nation joint defence

pact?  Britain and Australia will ask us to be  the

vanguard  and  they  will  just  queue  up  behind.

Therefore, we will be the first to be killed.  When

that  happens, what will happen to our country?  Is

our  Minister  for Defence willing  to  become  our

Commander-in-Chief? If he is daring enough, then we

will  carry on with the defence exercise.  If  not,

let us abandon

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to take up

the   three   points  raised  by  the  Member   for

Sembawang.  The  first  is a question.  He  wonders

whether  national  service will  affect  industrial

progress.  I  think it must be made very  clear  to

Members that the shortage in skilled manpower would

still  exist if we had not started building up  the

armed  forces. I agree that national  service  does

aggravate  the shortage, but it is only  temporary.

The   effect  that  national  service  has  on  the

shortage of skilled labour is very slight,  because

a  man will be doing national service for only  two

or  three  years, depending upon whether he  is  an

officer or a private. At the end of his national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



service,   he  will  be  discharged  with   skills

acquired in the armed forces. In other words, he is

available  to  the labour market.  Therefore,  what

national  service  has done is to  withhold  labour

from  the  labour market for a period of  only  two

years  or  three years. It is a temporary  shortage

and the effect is not, as the Member for Paya Lebar

implies,  an  adverse one. In fact, it is  possible

that when a Singapore citizen is conscripted at  18

years  of age for national service, he has no skill

at  all.  He  will  acquire some skill  during  his

training.  In other words, he is being trained,  so

that  by  the  time he is discharged from  national

service,  he  will be a semi-skilled or  a  skilled

worker.  I  think this point must be made perfectly

clear  - that the shortage of skilled labour  would

have been there even if we had no conscription. The

shortage, on account of national service,  is  only

temporary.   It  is  a  delay, in  making   labour

available  to  the private sector. I hope  this  is

clear to Back-benchers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Sembawang must realise

that    the    success   we   have   achieved    in

industrialisation, apart from other factors  -  the

infrastructure  that  we  have  built,   the   good

investment  climate, the skills and energy  of  our

workers  -  is  also due to the fact  that  we  are

building up our own defence. We are becoming  self-reliant. We are taking steps to make ourselves self-

reliant, but I would not say that, by ourselves, we

would be in a position to defend ourselves. I would

say  that  we are taking steps, and because  it  is

seen  and  known that we are taking steps,  we  are

contributing  towards the security of this  region.

Therefore,  it  is  not all in  vain  that  we  are

building up our armed forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second proposition of the Member for

Sembawang  is  that we should consider conscripting

the  fair sex. I did say that we would consider it.

In fact, I have considered it. I am a bit surprised

that the usually gallant Member for Sembawang feels

that  women  should not play a more important  role

than   they  are  playing  in  Parliament.  If   he

subscribes to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



principle that there should be equality between men

and  women, I think he should welcome the fair sex

here.  If they have the capacity and ability, there

is  no  reason  why this Parliament should  not  be

dominated by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says conscription of the males would give the

females  certain advantages. I do not believe  this

is so, because there are many other jobs for males.

As  far  as I can see, nature ordains that  certain

jobs are best done by females and there are certain

jobs  best done by males. In other words, by virtue

of their sex, there is already an ordained role for

each  sex,  and there are certain jobs which  women

cannot do as well as men, no matter how loudly they

protest that they are equal! Therefore, the absence

in  certain  areas of work of the males  for  three

years  will not in any way give women an advantage.

The  Member  also  says that if  we  conscript  the

males,  then  in  certain jobs the  women  will  be

ahead. They have the advantage of an earlier start.

I  do not think he has taken into consideration the

fact that some time in the lives of women they  get

married,  give birth, and rear children. Therefore,

the  fact  that they are females and do give  birth

does  have  an  in-built  disadvantage  as  regards

competing with men in work. So I do not think  that

the  conscription of men into national service does

give women any advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also asked whether the

Immigration  (Amendment) Bill has had any  results.

We have not implemented this Bill yet because it is

awaiting  the President's Assent, and therefore  it

is  too  early for me to forecast what the  results

will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Delta; I think there is

a  misconception in what she said about our role in

defence  when the British leave. We can  never,  by

any  stretch  of the imagination, fill  the  vacuum

left by the accelerated British withdrawal. On  our

own,  we  can never play the role which the British

has played here. From the numerical and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



financial points of view, it is impossible  for  us

to  fill  that vacuum. The sooner we realise  that,

the better it is for us. We hope we will be able to

contribute together with those nations of like mind

in  this  area,  towards preserving the  peace  and

stability  which all of us desire. The  Member  for

Delta  suggests  that we can start  training  young

students  in  school. It is not  possible  because,

first  and foremost, they are too young. Physically

they  will  not  be  able  to  stand  the  rigorous

training  that  is  required in our  armed  forces.

Secondly,  as  I  have so often repeated,  time  is

needed  to  train  an effective  army.  The  Member

reminds us of the heroes who sacrificed their lives

during  the Japanese invasion. Here is an excellent

example  of people who went to war partly  trained.

They were annihilated in no time. We would not like

to  be  placed in such a position if and  when  the

occasion  arises. It is my duty and  responsibility

to  see  that all those who go through training  in

the  armed forces have the capacity and ability  to

defend Singapore if the time comes. Therefore,  the

Member's  proposition that we should give  military

training to school children is out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan says that we will save

money  by  giving military training to children  in

school.  I do not understand how that can be  done.

For the information of Members, the money spent  is

not  so much on training as on the weapons that  we

have  to buy. That takes up most of the money spent

in the M.I.D.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I correct the Member for Delta on this point?

All Singapore male citizens on attaining the age of

18  and  not 21 years have to report to the Central

Manpower  Base  for national service.  As  for  her

allegation that the sons of rich people  have  been

able  to get away with national service. I say that

is  utter  rubbish. I would like to know  who  they

are.  I  have heard of this, and have asked  people

who  mentioned it, to me, "Give me their names, and

I will find out how they escaped the dragnet." This

allegation is utter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



rubbish,  because  it is our  policy  to  see  that

everyone is treated equally, regardless of  whether

the  boy's father is a multi-millionaire or a  poor

man.  It is essential for the success of our scheme

that no one is treated differently from the others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to her unfinished comment on the trouble

in  paying  pensioners,  which  arose  out  of  the

reorganisation  of  the office concerned,  I  agree

with  her that this was largely because not  enough

forethought  was  given  by  the  officers  to  the

problem.   The  change  took  place   at   a   very

unfortunate  period, i.e., just before the  Chinese

New  Year.  This is an eye-opener  to  some  of  my

officers,  and  they will now  have  to  take  into

consideration  certain factors which normally  they

will  not  take into consideration. This will  make

them  more careful in future when implementing  any

change of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter raised by the Member for Paya

Lebar, I say that this is a very old story. We must

understand  that because we are now an  independent

country,  the  present generation  of  Singaporeans

must  be  resigned  to the fact and  they  must  be

willing,  and must understand - that they  have  to

spend  a  part of their lives in training  for  the

defence  of their country. Once that is understood,

once  that is expected of them, a Singaporean  will

feel  proud  that he has the opportunity  that  was

denied  to  earlier  generations  to  protect   and

shoulder  arms  for his country. By then  all  this

little  talk  about inconvenience or hardship  will

disappear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> This point must be understood: if you want to be

a  worthwhile Singaporean, and if you  want  to  be

proud of your country, it is time you accepted  the

fact that you have to assign a portion of your life

to  the  defence of your country. We  have  thought

very long over this question: what is the best time

to  call  up these people? We have had conscription

for   slightly  more  than  two  years.  From   our

experience and from the experience of those whom we

know, we find that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



age  of  18  is  the  best age  to  conscript  our

youths.  This is the time when we can inculcate  in

them   a   sense   of   loyalty,  leadership,   and

dedication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have drafted graduates from the Universities

too,  but  the amount of trouble that we  had  from

them is not commensurate with their number. When we

first  conscripted  them  sometime  in  1968,   the

Chinese  Chamber of Commerce sent a  deputation  to

see me to give reasons why the graduates should not

be  conscripted. As a counter to their argument,  I

asked,   "When   do  you  think  they   should   be

conscripted?" They said, "Eighteen years  of  age."

And  18  is  the  age when they pass  their  Higher

School Certificate. So when I made the announcement

some time ago that we would conscript youths at  18

years  of  age, there was a hue and cry  from  this

group.  And I said, "Give me your reasons why  they

should not be conscripted." But up till today  they

have  neither come to see me nor have they sent  in

anything  in  writing.  And  I  am  still  waiting.

Because if they did come to me, what they could say

would  be  contrary to what they had  said  in  the

first  place. So there you are - a portion  of  the

time  of the young male citizens of Singapore  must

be  spent in serving the country and to be  trained

for  service to the country. It is up  to  us,  who

have worked and thought long over this question, to

decide what is the best age for national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the allegation that, after

national service of three years when they enrol for

the  University  they will forget  what  they  have

learnt before. That is utter rubbish too. There are

a  large  number of people including  some  Members

here,  who have had their education interrupted  by

the war. And we are not the only ones; millions  of

people  in other countries have had their education

interrupted  by the Second World War.  Yet  because

they  had  the will to pursue higher studies,  they

managed  to graduate from the University. Half  the

Cabinet  members  here  have  had  their  education

interrupted by the war. In fact, I would  say  that

after two or three years in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



army, our boys will be more mature, more sober  and

much  steadier  when they join the University,  and

the  University  will be a much  better  place  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the argument that the University will be

empty  -  I  do not like to use the word  "rubbish"

again, but I am afraid I cannot find a better  word

to describe this nonsense - I think the Members who

advance this argument have not read what I said.  I

said that among the 18-year olds, those who can win

scholarships  will  be allowed  to  continue  their

studies  in  the University. And among  the  H.S.C.

students  there is quite a large number - about  700

to  800 - who will not have attained the age of  18

years when they pass the H.S.C. These students will

be  allowed  to go into the University to  continue

their  studies. So your Universities  will  not  be

empty, but will be filled with them. Moreover,  the

holding  back  of these 18-year olds  in  the  pre-University classes for higher studies will be  only

for  three  years, after which they will  come  out

from  the  armed forces. All this misconception  of

national service has arisen largely because it  has

just  been  implemented. There must be a  time  for

these boys to fulfil their obligations, after which

they  will be churned out in the usual way. So,  in

actual fact, everything considered, there is only a

withholding of three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who join the University at the age of

18  or  those who have the option to join  after  a

period of time because they have passed their  pre-University examination before reaching the  age  of

18,  national  service  and service  in  the  armed

forces   is  a  new  obligation.  But  after   this

experience,  I can guarantee Members that  in  five

years'  time,  they  will say, "We  wished  we  had

joined  the Armed Forces at the age of 18 and  then

proceeded on to the University." Mark my  words!  I

may not be here in five to ten years' time, but the

majority of you will be here to witness it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that partly also answers the queries

raised by the Member for Mountbatten. I did mention

the word



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



"self-reliance", but I do not know how he  took  it

to  mean.  To me, self-reliance means you  rely  on

your  own self for everything. We have got to  rely

on our own selves for the defence of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether it is possible to give

academic  tuition to pre-University students  while

they  are  doing their national service  for  three

years  is being gone into by the staff of both  the

Ministry of Science and Technology and my Ministry.

I  think there is a possibility of doing it, and we

are  exploring every available avenue to give  pre-University   national  servicemen  some   sort   of

academic  training so that they can qualify  for  a

year's credit when they join the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Ulu Pandan, his argument on

our defence capability is fantastic. I am not proud

of  him,  either  as a Singapore citizen  or  as  a

Member  of Parliament. What he has suggested  is  a

cowardly  way out - that because we are too  small,

therefore,  we cannot stand up against  anybody.  I

say  this:  if we have the determination,  we  will

stand  up  against  the  biggest  country  in  this

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I asked just now was whether or not the

joint  exercise  that  is to  be  held  in  another

territory  will  be  construed  as  some  kind   of

invasion. The Minister has not replied to  that.  I

do not know what he is talking about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the mere fact that we are

taking  part  in  a  joint exercise  with  friendly

countries in this region means that they realise we

have  a contribution to make towards the peace  and

stability  of this region. They do not consider  us

to  be an enemy. They consider us to be a protector

of  democracy in this region. That is  why  we  are

participating  in  this joint exercise  with  other

countries  -the Five Powers - in foreign territory.

We are welcomed there, because we can contribute to

the  peace  and  stability of South-east  Asia,  in

which all countries in this region are interested.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not satisfied with the reply given by

the  Minister. If war breaks out, will he dare  to

say  the same thing about the defence of peace and

security?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is our duty to see that no enemy catches us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  I would like to clarify certain points.  The

Minister  has  spoken generally  on  youths  doing

national  service.  I do not think  he  understood

fully  what  I  said. What I said was  that  these

youths  should  be allowed to proceed  with  their

university  or college education before  they  are

recruited  for  national service. He  now  demands

that  they  do  national service after  they  have

completed their secondary education. Does  he  not

know that the two kinds of national service, full-time  and part-time, are the same ultimately?  Why

did  he say that it is not correct to allow  these

students  to  finish  their  university  education

before doing national service? They would still be

patriotic citizens of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned three years' training. I gave

examples,  but what the Minister can only  say  is

that  some  of them will be able to continue  with

their higher education after three years' national

service.
