<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the actions of the picketers

in  obstructing, intimidating, or otherwise  forcefully

preventing students from taking their examinations, and

in  response to an appeal from parents of students  who

wish  to  take these examinations that they  and  their

children  should be afforded Police protection,  hereby

resolves  that  this House supports any action  by  the

Police  to  protect  students  wishing  to  take  their

examinations to ensure that they are not intimidated or

injured,  and that the students and their  parents  who

accompany  them are given free passage and access  into

and out of all examination halls.



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  you  will  recollect  that  last

Thursday,  the  House condemned the illegal  action  of

hooligans  who  tried to prevent me from attending  the

Assembly. However, as representatives of the people, we

should  be equally concerned for the safety of hundreds

of  parents  and  their children who  are  still  being

forcibly prevented from entering the examination  rooms

to take their examinations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday last, with your kind permission, Sir, I

read  out  a  joint  petition from a  large  number  of

parents  urging  me to bring to the attention  of  this

House  the  fact that they would like police protection

extended to parents and students, so that their  safety

could  be  ensured in the exercise of their  right  and

freedom to take the Government examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has so far refrained from using the

police in order, to avoid a clash between the innocent

and misguided students and the police, which is what

the sinister men who are manipulating these children

really want. The behind-the-scenes organisers of this

boycott are working to bring about a clash between

parents and picketing school children -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> - in the hope of sparking off

violent  emotions.  If a clash should  in  fact  occur,

these  evil  men  could then accuse the  Government  of

using  the  Police Force against innocent students  and

they  could  then mount an anti-Government campaign  to

overthrow the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had, Sir, on several occasions explained these

sinister motives to representatives of parents who came

to   request   for  police  protection  following   the

intimidatory  and rough tactics used by  the  picketers

last  week. But the intimidatory methods and force used

by  pickets during the past week have become so intense

that  the  parents  have decided to  send  in  a  joint

petition  urging me to get this House to  sanction  the

use of police to protect them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed any further, I would like to

emphasise  the word "protection". What the parents  and

students  are asking for is police protection  and  not

police  suppression, as the Barisan Sosialis had eerily

and  deliberately twisted and distorted  in  the  Press

statement  which appeared in the Press on 1st December.

Let  us  see  how the Barisan Sosialis had twisted  the

meaning of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



motion to incite the feelings of the people against the

Government. This is an extract of the Press statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now, the People's Action Party is in a hurry to use

the  police  to suppress the growing tide of discontent

and  the Legislative Assembly cannot be responsible for

the  inability and evil acts of the P.A.P.  Government.

The Barisan Sosialis is strongly against any attempt to

use the police force with reason to deal with students.

We  have seen enough of the violent acts of the Lim Yew

Hock Government against the students.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an extract of the statement. Since Thursday

last,  there  has  been  a deliberate  attempt  by  the

sinister men behind the scenes to whip up a feeling  of

hatred  and hostility against the Government, not  only

among   parents,  but  also  among  people  in  densely

populated   areas.  Inflammatory  slogans  which   were

entirely  unfounded, such as, "Special Agents  Beat  up

Students" and "Students' Blood Does Not Flow  In  Vain"

were  painted  in red on street walls,  cinemas,  lamp-posts  and  other strategica1ly glaring spots,  with  a

view to inciting the feelings of the people against the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the weekend, with the cooperation of the

diligent  staff of the Ministry of Education,  we  have

made  a thorough check of the actual number of students

who  have  taken examinations and those that  have  not

taken.  We have facts, figures and names to prove  that

of  the 3,171 candidates, only 927 have not taken their

examinations.  Of  these 927, we have  good  reason  to

believe  that many would have sat for the examinations,

but  for  the  intimidatory methods used by  picketers.

With  the  kind co-operation of the postal authorities,

we  have sent out urgent letters, signed personally  by

the  Minister  for  Education, to parents  of  the  927

candidates,  appealing to them to bring their  children

to  sit for the supplementary examinations which  began

this morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Sir, 240 candidates who were prevented

last  week  from taking their examinations  by  pickets

have turned up for the supplementary examinations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



A  large  number  of  parents  rang  up  the

Ministry  to  complain again that their  children  were

still  prevented  from entering the examination  rooms.

There  are  still human chains outside the  examination

centres. Similar methods of intimidation are being used

by  the  pickets. The parents have emphasised in  their

petition to me that in a democratic country like  ours,

the people should have the democratic right and freedom

to sit for an examination. When such freedom and rights

are  interfered  with  by  uninvited  intimidation  and

force,  it  is the duty of the Government to  see  that

such rights are upheld and the parents protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the parents are asking for, Sir, is police

protection  and not police suppression, as  twisted  by

the  Barisan  Sosialis. If the picketers had  from  the

beginning   adopted  peaceful  methods  of   persuasion

instead   of  the  type  of  hooliganism  as  we   have

witnessed,  then  this  motion  would  not  have   been

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Press reports, Sir, the picketers claim

that 2,000 so-called parents attended a meeting at  the

Chinese   High  School  yesterday  and  passed  certain

resolutions  supporting  the  picketers.  One  of   the

resolutions  sounds rather mysterious and no  doubt  it

was  coined in such terms as to mislead the people.  It

reads:  "Determined  to oppose using  of  military  and

police against students who use peaceful persuasion  to

picket  and  determined to request  the  Government  to

withdraw its motion on December the 4th to condemn  the

picketers."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will have seen the Straits Times of 30th

November  with  a  picture  on  the  front  page,   and

everybody  in the city knows whether this  is  peaceful

persuasion or this is intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, who are these so-called parents? So far,

according to official figures, only 927 candidates have

not  taken  examinations last week, and of  these,  240

have   sat  for  the  supplementary  examinations  this

morning,  leaving barely 600 candidates  who  have  not

taken examinations. Of these 600, many have rung up to

say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



that  they  could not get into examination rooms.  Even

taking for granted that there are 600 picketers, surely

600  picketers cannot have 2,000 parents. We  challenge

the  picketers to publish the names of these  so-called

parents and the names of their children who they  claim

are   candidates  of  the  Government   Secondary   IV

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our side, Sir, we are prepared and ready to publish

the names of candidates who have taken the examinations

and  those  who have not taken them so that the  public

will not be confused and misled into believing that the

action  of  the  picketers has got the support  of  the

majority of parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the resolution which I have just mentioned - that

is  the  slogan by the so-called parents at the Chinese

High School - gave the impression that the Government had

used  the  military  and  the police  against  innocent

students.  This, I say, is most mischievous. The  whole

city  knows  and, in fact, in many cases the Government

has  been blamed for not doing its duty to maintain law

and  order.  Nobody, except in the imagination  of  the

agitators, has seen any military truck or any police in

action against the students during the last week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have stressed over and over again that it is

not  the intention of the Government to use the  Police

Force against students. As long as the real non-student

organisers  of  this  dangerous campaign  believe  that

there  are Members of this House ready to condone  this

picketing,  and,  what  is  more  important,  ready  to

exploit the strong emotions that could be aroused as  a

result  of  clashes between children and police,  these

non-student  organisers will egg the  picketers  on  to

more desperate acts of provocation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the elected representatives of this House - both

Government and Opposition - make it quite clear that they

are  on  the side of law and order, that no Assemblyman

will  be  prepared to exploit a situation arising  when

the police give such assistance as may be necessary  to

parents  and  students in the exercise of their  lawful

rights, then I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



am  certain  that  the non-student organisers  of  this

picketing and the picketers themselves will not  embark

on  acts  of recklessness. They will not do so  because

they will then know that behind the lawful exercise  of

police  authority there is, the sanction  of  not  only

parents   and   students  but  also  of   the   elected

representatives of the people without regard  to  party

conflicts  and bribery. For in this case,  we  are  not

dealing with an educational issue but with an explosive

situation  which, if badly handled, could  plunge  this

whole  city  into violence and disorder. In this  case,

the  organisers  of this boycott are working  to  bring

about  a clash between the police and picketing  school

children  in the hope of sparking off violent emotions.

But  there is a clear indication, Sir, that if and when

police  protection  has to be enforced  it  would  have

behind  it the backing of the public, students, parents

and  all  our Assemblymen, then the organisers of  this

dangerous and cowardly campaign would know that if they

do  anything foolish they would have the full force  of

public  opinion at every level against them  and  these

agitators  would themselves have to face the  anger  of

the people and take the full consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Sir, we ask every Member of this

House  to make it clear that where police authority  is

lawfully and justly used as in this case, it would have

the endorsement o, all Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some

three or four days ago, I had occasion to speak in this

House  about matters appertaining to the present motion

before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I for one cannot understand how the

problem  of  education  and  any  disagreement  in   an

educational system which the State has arrived at after

due  and proper consultations with persons who are able

to  advise the Government on these matters, should have

now turned out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



into  the issue which it has. -If the issue before  the

country  is whether Chinese students should be  allowed

to  take the Secondary IV examination, I personally  am

not competent to speak on that. But in such matters  on

which  I  am  not  competent to speak, naturally  I  am

guided  by persons who are competent to speak  on  such

matters  and, in my view, the persons who are competent

to  speak on these matters are the educational  experts

in  the  Chinese educational field. As far as  I  could

understand from the Government, these people have  been

consulted  and  it  was agreed that  the  Secondary  IV

examination was a good thing for Chinese education  and

Chinese culture. Apparently, that was the situation two

or three months ago, but since then things have taken a

different turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was speaking to a friend of mine

who   is  also  interested  in  education.  He  is  not

interested in the Chinese education stream  but  he  is

interested  in  the  English education  stream.  He  is

attached  to the University. He has some experience  of

education  and  children  and  how  children  react  to

examinations.  He  told me that if  a  vote  was  taken

amongst  the  children as to whether  they  should  get

promotions without sitting for examinations, more  than

fifty  per  cent  of  them would  vote  for  promotions

without  sitting for examinations. That  would  be  the

position if students were asked to express their  views

on it on a democratic basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us not overplay this democratic basis, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,In my own home, I would like  to  think

that I treat my children fairly and well, and that  the

way  I treat them is not the way my grandfather treated

my father or my father treated me. But then there comes

a  point of time when in every home, as in every State,

authority must be applied and the young children of the

country must be told where they get off - if I may use a

colloquialism.  And if in the view of a parent - and  who

knows better what the interest of the child is than the

parent? - the child is going off the track, it is  up  to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



father and the mother to pull him up and tell him where

he  has  got  off  the track. And if he gets  difficult

about  it,  then the solution is to put him across  the

lap and to administer a couple of good smacks where  it

will  hurt  most!  That is how I would  deal  with  the

situation in my own home. The State, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

is  merely a translation of the various homes into one.

Now  if  the children are objecting to this examination

when all the educational authorities are agreed that it

is  a good thing for Chinese education, I say that  the

children  who are acting as picketers should  be  dealt

with  in  an  appropriate manner, first of all  by  the

parents of those children. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir,

however much these students disagree with the Secondary

IV  examination, I do not think it is their business to

go  and  picket and prevent others, particularly,  when

from  the results that we have seen, according  to  the

statement  of  the Minister for Education,  about  two-thirds of them have attended these examinations.  On  a

democratic basis where the minority accepts the will of

the  majority,  I  suggest that  the  picketers  should

silently  take  up their tents and vanish.  If  one  is

talking  about democracy, that is the way  the  pickets

should  behave. So that from that point of view,  I  am

entirely with the 66 per cent of the students  who  are

going  into  these examinations, and I  appeal  to  the

picketers  no to prevent the others from, taking  their

examinations. If they have any legitimate objections to

the Secondary IV examinations, they have their channels

through   which  to  make  representations.  If   those

representations  are logical, to the  effect  that  the

Chinese  language and Chinese culture are going  to  be

destroyed, that naturally any government must take heed

and   make  the  necessary  adjustments.  But  in   the

meantime, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a problem, that is,

children who wish to take these examinations are  being

prevented  from doing so. The duty of the Government - as

the  parents have rightly pointed out - in the democratic

system,  when the people want to exercise their  lawful

rights and somebody else is trying to prevent them from

exercising these rights - is to come to their rescue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am wholeheartedly in

support  of  the motion, but I think the terms  of  the

motion  are  such  that  it  is  liable  to  give  some

misunderstanding  to people outside.  When  the  motion

about  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for

Education  came  before  the  House,  where  it  was  a

question of violation of the rights of a Member of this

Assembly,  I thought it was for the Assembly to  direct

the  police  to  take  the necessary  action.  In  this

instance,  where  the  rights of a  citizen  are  being

violated,  it is the duty of the State to protect  that

citizen and to see that his civil rights are not  being

violated.  Therefore, the responsibility of  protecting

such  a  citizen  falls  fairly  and  squarely  on  the

shoulders  of  the  Government. But  as  a  responsible

legislature which happens to be sitting at  the  moment

when  Government is faced with a problem,  and  if  the

Government comes to this House for an expression of its

opinion on the problem before it, then, of course,  the

Government  is entitled to get a fair answer  from  the

House.  Therefore. Mr Speaker. Sir, I wish to move  an

amendment to the latter part of the motion. I have here

a  typewritten  copy. Mr Speaker, Sir.  The  amendment

will be,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete the words "supports any action by" in lines

6  and  7 of the motion, and insert therefor the words,

"approves  of  any  action  according  to  law  by  the

Government through".



<br><br>If I may repeat it again, Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete the words "supports any action by" in lines

6  and  7, and insert therefor the words. "approves  of

any action according to law by the Government through".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I will not be very long. I think I

have  made  my point. The amendment, Sir, is  moved  in

order to clear certain doubts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the motion stands, it says "... hereby resolves

that this House supports any action by the Police ..."  Now  that  might give room for doubt, although  the

Government will naturally say that "any action  by  the

Police" there means



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



any  lawful  action. But it could mean that any  action

could  be  taken by the police, and if something  turns

out  to be unlawful, they might come back to the  House

and  say,  "Well,  you  have already  agreed  to  this.

Therefore, pass legislation which will idemnify." We do

not  want all that. I think what the Government can  do

and should do is to act according to law in respect  of

persons acting not in accordance with the law.  And  it

is  with  that  intent  and  purpose,  Sir,  that  this

amendment is moved.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House condemns the actions of the picketers

in  obstructing, intimidating, or otherwise  forcefully

preventing students from taking their examinations, and

in  response to an appeal from parents of students  who

wish  to  take these examinations that they  and  their

children  should be afforded Police protection,  hereby

resolves  that  this House supports any action  by  the

Police  to  protect  students  wishing  to  take  their

examinations to ensure that they are not intimidated or

injured,  and that the students and their  parents  who

accompany  them are given free passage and access  into

and out of all examination halls."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lines 6 and 7, to leave out the words "supports any

action by", and there to insert "approves of any action

according to law by the Government through".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it might be for the convenience of hon.

Members  if  I suggest that in the debate  that  is  to

follow, Members debate both the original motion and the

amendment,  so that at the end of the debate - it  means,

of course, that each Member will be allowed one speech,

and  not  more than one speech, except the proposer  of

the  substantive  motion who will  have  the  right  to

reply - I  will  put the Question on the  amendment,  and

then  on  the original motion, as amended, as the  case

may be. That is for the convenience of hon. Members. No

dissenting voice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, the Government accepts the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, that is an indication for hon.

Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Parliamentary Secretary has given his own grim picture

of so-called sinister men - but sinister men of the

P.A.P.'s own making, own make-believe, so that they can

keep on building and maintaining that artificial

atmosphere of tension and suspense. This will fit into

their scheme of things, Sir, as I will endeavour to

explain. The Parliamentary Secretary also talked of the

hooliganism of the students. We, on our part, Sir,

never believe that the students can ever be hooligans.

Hooliganism is only present in those mysterious people

who wear drainpipe trousers, who throw stones, bulbs

and glasses at the students, and generally attack the

students in every way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education issues are always emotional issues. And

emotional issues bring out undesirable features  which,

in  a debate of this nature, we want to avoid. For this

reason alone, we would have preferred the motion before

the  House not be debated now. There would be cries  of

chauvinism  from  people  who  do  not  understand  the

Chinese  education  problem.  Even  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister himself, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Do you understand?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - said the other day that Nanyang

University is evidence of Chinese chauvinism. So we see

how even the so-called enlightened -

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I want to know when he quoted me

definitely  in which and in what context I  said  those

very words.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I cannot quote you the exact

context,  Sir,  but it was said in this  very  Assembly

only a few days ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, even a Chairman of a political Party who

once  upon a time preached equal treatment for the four

streams of education can make blunders like this. It is

no  wonder  that people outside are becoming  more  and

more confused. Sir, the motion before the House is  not

just to get the Assembly to endorse the rule of law and

order.  That  is  not necessary. We all  want  law  and

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what we want to know.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this motion has, however, been

introduced  with sinister motives. There  were  already

insinuations  and innuendoes of pro-Communist  elements

inside and outside the Assembly. There were suggestions

that  the Barisan Sosialis was obstructive and did  not

allow  the  Assembly  to discuss important  matters  of

State.  We  have seen, Sir, how surprise  motions,  one

after  another, were introduced in the  midst  of  this

merger debate, and it is not unexpected therefore  that

we  have this motion before the House. The P.A.P. hopes

that  such  diversion will draw the  attention  of  the

people away from the ugly revelations of their sell-out

merger.  The  P.A.P. is desperately  trying  to  divert

public attention from the merger debate in which -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of order. After

you  have  ruled  that  a Member should  avoid  tedious

repetition, if I may quote the exact words,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  of  Standing  Order 54  to  which  you  drew  the

attention of the House:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention  to the conduct of a Member, who persists  in

irrelevance, or tedious repetition either  of  his  own

arguments or of the arguments used by other Members  in

debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard all this, Sir, even though it was in some

other debate. Could we be spared?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose there is a little

repetition.  A  little repetition is  inevitable  since

this motion and the merger motion overlap. I suppose  a

little  repetition is unavoidable. It is only  when  it

becomes   tedious  that  the  Speaker  will   have   to

intervene. Perhaps the Member for Queenstown will  bear

that in mind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this only proves my point,

namely,  that  they  are  trying  to  distract   public

attention from the merger issue. We are quite  used  to

tricks like this. We were in the P.A.P. at one time, so

we know -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Traitors!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - what tricks are up their sleeves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the real motives be, hind this sudden

move? As I said, these motives are all sinister. As you

know, Sir, there is a deliberate attempt on the part of

the P.A.P. to smear all those who do not agree with

them as Communists and pro-Communists. And this motion

is meant to link the Barisan Sosialis with the

students' strike and paint everything as Communist

inspired. Thus, Sir, just because the students stick

posters on Chinese-owned buses, and as Mr Fong Swee

Suan (you will remember the other day, Sir) is the

adviser to the Singapore Bus Workers' Union -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> He is a

Barisan man.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the adviser to that union, so,

according  to the P.A.P., Mr Fong must be  responsible

for  those  posters  on the buses! Such  dangerous  and

illogical  reasoning of the P.A.P. shows how completely

off  the track they have gone. Sir, many will know that

posters have also been stuck



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



on the S.T.C. buses and trolleys. Mr Devan Nair is

adviser to the S.T.C. Employees' Union. If we were to

accept the P.A.P.'s logic, would we not have to blame

Mr Devan Nair for the students' dissatisfaction?

Again, Sir, the Member for Anson is -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> He is here to defend

himself!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - is the legal adviser to the

Public  Daily-Rated Employees Union Federation. On  the

same  logic, are we to blame the Member for  Anson  for

the recent strike -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Nobody did, you know. That is the

point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, year after year, millions of

dollars - money which has been taken from  the  people - has been spent on the Special Branch. For what? So that

the  Special Branch can misrepresent all expression  of

genuine grievances of the people as Communist-inspired?

For  getting  intelligence like that  concerning  Tommy

Koh? I will come to the Special Branch again. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope we are not going to embark

on  a debate on the Special Branch, because I will  not

allow it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir. I just want to bring out

the  relevant points about the Special Branch  in  this

particular motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why are you interested in the Special

Branch?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the Government Benchers

are  a  little  bit more patient, they  will  have  the

opportunity  of  replying.  Let  us  not   have   these

interjections. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you, Sir. Such gross

inefficiency of the Special Branch can only be  matched

by  the  utter stupidity and inefficiency of the  whole

Ministry  of  Education  and the  whole  Lee  Kuan  Yew

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, is a delicate situation caused by the

mishandling of the genuine grievances and discontent of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



students  fostered  and  deliberately  allowed  to   be

aggravated by the P.A.P. Government. Instead of finding

a  solution to the just grievances of the students  and

so   preventing   the  development  of   an   explosive

situation,  we find the most inept handling of  student

grievances  in the whole history of Chinese  education.

in  their  incompetence and impotence to deal with  the

situation caused entirely by their own inefficiency and

ineptitude,  the Government now attempts  to  pass  the

buck  to  the  Assembly. By this the  P.A.P. hopes  to

saddle all the responsibility of their misdeeds on  the

Assembly.  Are  the Ministers, and the  Prime  Minister

also,  so utterly sterile in their outlook and approach

that  they must get the Assembly to be responsible  for

their foolish mistakes? They created the mess and  they

want  us to clear it for them. If they are so incapable

of  governing, why do they not resign? They still  hold

on  to  government when they cannot govern. Sir, today,

the name of Yong Nyuk Lin has become -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In this Assembly, and outside, Mr

Yong Nyuk Lin is the Minister for Education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The name of the Minister for

Education has become no better than the name  o-f  Chew

Swee  Kee.  He is a man attempting to do two  big  jobs

when, in fact, he is not even fit for one of them. Sir,

I   will   explain.  The  Minister  for  Education   is

concurrently Chairman of the Singapore Harbour Board, a

full-time job. One-quarter of Singapore's budget is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow this trend of

debate.  I  think the hon. Member must  know  that  the

responsibility of one Minister is the responsibility of

the  whole  Cabinet, and therefore I  do  not  think  a

personal attack of this nature is permitted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was only trying to explain to the

House  that the full attention of the Minister has  not

been devoted to the Ministry of Education. See what  he

has  done? He has made a mess of the whole job. If  the

Minister cannot spend adequate time and attention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



in the Ministry, then it is only fair that he

should let somebody else do it. If he could have spent

more time, Sir, in the Ministry, possibly the present

situation would not have arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hope, Sir, that the Singapore Harbour Board

would not be messed up as -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Queenstown knows that he ought to follow the

indications coming from the Chair. I have indicated

that the position, as far as this Assembly is

concerned, is that the Cabinet is responsible for all

the actions of each individual Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I misunderstood you, Sir. I thought

you    said    "Order"   for   the   people   opposite. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps for the people opposite!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, all this student

dissatisfaction is caused by the incompetence,  if  not

of  the  Minister  for Education,  then  of  the  whole

Cabinet. All this can be clearly seen from a review  of

how this trouble has developed. Let me briefly give you

an  outline  of  the Government education  policy  with

regard to Chinese education.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. No. I must certainly prevent that

being done, because if I do that, then there will be  a

debate  on the education policy. We are now debating  a

motion,  "at  the request of parents of students  ... that  this  House supports any action by the Police  to

protect students wishing to take their examinations"  I

am  paraphrasing the motion - "and in order that students

and  their  parents who accompany them are  given  free

passage  and  access  into and out of  all  examination

halls." That is all we are doing. I will not allow  any

debate  on the education policy to take place  on  this

motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was hoping I could explain to

you, Sir, that there is always relevance when there  is

cause and effect. One cannot discuss the effect without

knowing  the  cause. And it is because of that  that  I

have  tried to give you, Sir, just a very brief outline

so that we can have the proper background.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



Only  then  would we be able to understand the  present

dissatisfaction of the students. May I, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Chair is still not convinced, because

the motion, to my mind, seems to be just a request that

the  House does something in response to an appeal from

parents of students who wish to take examinations. That

is all. The fact that there is discontent among certain

students  about the education policy is incidental.  It

may  be  mentioned of course, in passing, as indeed  it

has   been.  But  to  go  into  details  is  completely

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I bow to your decision. But it

is  difficult  to debate this motion, Sir,  without  at

least  touching  a  little on -the  background  of  the

motion,   because  the  Government's  trick   on   this

particular  occasion  is  purely  to  let  the   people

concentrate on the result of what they have been doing.

They want people to forget all about the causes of  the

present  dissatisfaction of the students. It is  almost

impossible, Sir, not to talk a little of the causes  so

that  we  really could understand fully why we have  to

debate  the  present  motion.  However,  Sir,  I   will

endeavour to cut off as much of it as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Cut off the whole item!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, the grievances of the

students are genuine and legitimate. They have  genuine

fears  that  the so-called new system of the Government

is  not  meant as a step towards giving equal treatment

to  the  four streams of education but something  else.

And   because  of  their  genuine  fears  the   present

dissatisfaction  has come about. They fear,  Sir,  that

with  the  present system, the end result  would  be  a

reduction  in  quantity as well as quality  of  Chinese

education.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The difficulty is for the Chair to

draw  a line somewhere. I think all that this Assembly

should know in this particular debate is that there are

grievances - certain    students    think    they    have

grievances - and   therefore  as  a   result   of   these

grievances,  these students are taking this  action.  I

think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



that  is  about all this Assembly must be told in  this

particular debate. Of course the hon. Member will  have

other  opportunities of airing the  grievances  of  the

students  in this particular matter, but certainly  not

in this motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will skip all that, Sir. Anyway

there  are genuine grievances of students, parents  and

educational bodies which the Government has ignored. If

there  had  been consultation and democratic  practice,

the  ugly situation today would not have arisen.  There

would  have  been  no  student  protests  today,   Sir.

Unfortunately,  the  inefficiency of Chew-Swee-Kee-like

Ministers in the P.A.P. Government have caused  further

dissatisfaction  among all Chinese  education  circles.

Coupled  with this, there is also behind the  scenes  a

deliberate  attempt on the part of  the  Government  to

foment  even  more trouble. As I have  indicated,  Sir,

educational  issues are emotional issues. They  can  be

easily  misconstrued and mischievously  interpreted  to

mean Chinese chauvinism and the like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all news of this impending student

dissatisfaction and trouble was completely hidden  from

the  people.  There  was a complete black-out  of  news

until recently. Many people not connected directly with

Chinese education did not have the slightest inkling of

what  was  afoot  and what the present dissatisfaction.

don is all about. The English-educated especially, Sir,

Those  who  read  only  the  English  Press  were  kept

completely in the dark. It is no wonder that the recent

student  dissatisfaction has hit  the  English-educated

like  a  bolt  from  the blue.  But  what  the  P.A.P.

Government does not realise is this: that the  students

have  parents,  and both the students and  the  parents

have  friends, and they pass the information  round  to

all  the  people who show a little interest in  Chinese

education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> That is

why most of them sat for the examination.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And thus it was that a good number

of  people already knew that maladministration  of  the

P.A.P. was going to lead to trouble.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> For the Barisan!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The students in the last few months

have been trying to bring their grievances to the

attention of the public, but the Government has

deliberately suppressed all student opinion on this

matter affecting their very future. For instance, the

students had been holding mass meetings in the various

secondary schools -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How do you know?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and at each of these meetings,

there were thousands of students present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 25th of November, 1961, about 10,000 students

met in pouring rain at the Chinese High School grounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How many caught colds after that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But not a whisper of this appeared

in the Press. All this, Sir, was hidden from the public

and,  in particular, from the English-educated and  the

parents. Why? Why did the Government suppress all these

grievances?  Why is it that only now, when trouble  has

started that the Government brings the problem  to  the

notice of the Assembly? The Government has attempted to

explain   their  deliberate  suppression  of   student

opinion by saying that the so-called responsible  Press

did  not  want to publish the opinion of students.  You

will   recall,  Sir,  that  the  organ  of  my   Party,

"Barisan", published a circular issued by the  students

expressing the students' view-point, and because  of

this,  we in the Barisan Sosialis were accused  by  the

Government of instigating trouble amongst the students.

Sir, as all the Members of the Assembly will know, this

circular, which was published in the Barisan and  which

was  quoted  by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister for Education a few days ago, was actually the

same circular that had been sent to all Assemblymen.  I

am  sure the Government benches have all received their

copies of this circular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know, Sir, that a memorandum was submitted to

the Minister for Education. Why is it that the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



must  wait  until  now, when  the  situation  has

developed to such a serious extent, before seeking  the

help   of  the  Assembly?  Their  mishandling  of   the

situation has allowed the whole matter to develop  into

the present impasse. Hoping to get scapegoats for their

mishandling  of  the situation, the  Government  starts

using   terms  like  anti-social  elements,   political

agitators and so on. They want to vilify opponents  and

smear  them  as  this  and that. If  today,  the  Prime

Minister has a tummyache or a toothache, I am  sure  he

will also blame the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If he has that, and a Member

wishes to raise the matter, he has to do that by way of

a substantive motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will bear that in mind, Sir. Sir,

the present dissatisfaction in the Chinese schools fits

into the Govermnent political strategy very well. It is

to the Government's advantage that the present delicate

situation  be  aggravated. It  will  then  provide  the

Government  with  an  excuse  to  move  against   their

political  opponents. We in the Barisan  Sosialis  have

already  been blamed for the students' boycott  of  the

examinations. Already the stage is set. Having  accused

the  Barisan Sosialis of instigating the students,  the

Government  hopes  that  when an  explosion  does  take

place,  it can suppress the Barisan Sosialis under  the

guise of preserving peace and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all remember the days when the Prime Minister

himself and the P.A.P. were constantly accused by  Chew

Swee Kee of using Chinese school students for political

purposes.  We  all also remember, Sir,  that  when  the

student  trouble eventually exploded in 1956,  the  Lim

Yew Hock Government found a pretext to launch a massive

purge  of its political opponents and the entire  trade

union organisation.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Wah, terrible!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. today is just like

the Labour Front Government of 1956 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is all in vogue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The present Government, however, is

just a little bit more shrewd than the Lim Yew Hock

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh, you have found that out!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we must stop these

interjections from the Government benches. The motion

itself asks for law and order. I ask for order. [Laughter.]



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this only shows -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have ruled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P., Sir, have learnt the

folly of Chew Swee Kee. They know that any repressive

action against the Chinese school students in Singapore

would mean political death for the Party in power. That

is why the Government has now brought in this motion.

This motion on the surface, Sir, appears to be very

correct and proper. They hope, thus, to inveigle all

the Parties in this Assembly into supporting police

action against the students. We can be sure, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion does

not ask for police action, but the Member is indicating

that it does. Could he indicate where it does ask for

police action?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. It is just a

point of interpretation of the motion itself. The

motion itself asks that this House supports any action

by the Police to protect students. It is true that an

amendment has been moved which has been accepted by the

Government, but that amendment must first be accepted

by the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A point of guidance from the Chair. If it

please you, Sir, I have noticed repeatedly Ministers

raising points of order which are not points of order.

I ask the Chair whether it is possible to use

disciplinary measures to prevent an abuse of a right

which could seriously impede fair and consistent pursuit of a line of thought.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. There have been occasions when

Members of this Assembly, not only Ministers, have

risen on points of order which are not really points of

order. That is a practice which, of course, must be

frowned at, because that is, in fact, an abuse of the

rules of this House. Any abuse of the rules can, of

course, be adequately dealt with by the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Government benches, Sir, hope to

confuse me. I am not a lawyer and they want to play -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is this on the

point raised by the Minister? If it is, it is out of

order. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I was saying,

Sir, we can be sure that should this motion be

unanimously passed, the Government would use this as a

pretext to launch massive repressive action against the

students. As everybody knows, this can only lead to

violence and bloodshed all over the city. And this is

precisely what the Government wants, violence and

bloodshed, because under cover of such violence and

bloodshed, they hope to find an excuse to suppress all

political opponents in Singapore -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In other words,

Sir, the Government is asking Members of this Assembly

to give their blessing to a scheme - to provoke a

situation which will lead to violence and bloodshed,

which they hope will, in turn, provide the Government

with the excuse to suppress, not the students, but

their political opponents. Sir, the people of Singapore

are not fools. They have all learnt the bitter lessons

of the past. They remember 1955 and 1956. The horrible

memories of violence and bloodshed in the days of Chew

Swee Kee are still vivid -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether this repetition

of the name of Chew Swee Kee will help us at all. It

has been repeated about six times. I wonder whether the

Member for Queenstown could now avoid using that

exprecsion, which is becoming tedious.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is such a semblance, Sir,

between the attitude of the present Minister towards

the students and Chew Swee Kee's attitude that one

cannot help but recall Chew Swee Kee. But I will

endeavour not to mention Chew Swee Kee too often.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students and the people of Singapore have suffered

enough brutalities. But, unfortunately, we have today

in the Minister for Education, a person not unlike the

past Lim Yew Hock Government's Minister for Education.

Whereas the previous Lim Yew Hock Government was stupid

enough to carry out repressive actions on their own,

the Lee Kuan Yew Government and the present Minister

for Education are cunning enough to try to involve the

whole Assembly in a bloodbath which may follow any

action on the students.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come, come! Let us have -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether that is

a deliberate attempt to impute an improper motive to

the Government Ministers. If that is so, then it is

completely wrong. It is out of order. If the argument

is that any action might lead to the incidents which

have been related, then perhaps it is in order. There

is a slight distinction.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am sorry I left out the words

"might lead to". [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not wish to touch on

personalities, Sir, but everybody knows that the

present Minister for Education is known to everybody - particularly the English-educated and the school

teachers - for his arrogance and haughtiness, and he is

not a man who can handle the present delicate situation

with realism and reasonableness. If there is anybody to

be blamed for the present chaotic situation, it is none

other than the Minister for Education and his Cabinet

colleagues. They alone must shoulder all

responsibility. They cannot get away from this

responsibility by hysterically blaming their political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



opponents for stirring up trouble. Starting on the anti-Communist  line,  the Front-Benchers opposite  want  to

behave and rave like the Labour Front anti-Communist so-called Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I never raved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the English Press - the Straits

Times - has  given only one side of the story,  that  is,

the  Government  story  of the  present  situation.  As

usual,  they want to paint the Chinese school  students

as  little devils of violence and unrest. That has been

the  familiar line of the English Press for quite  some

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to get a correct picture of what is

happening  in  Singapore,  one  must  also   read   the

vernacular  Press.  Every day in  the  past  week,  the

Chinese  newspapers have carried detailed  accounts  of

how  the Government have been trying to provoke trouble

Sand  violence in the delicate situation in the Chinese

schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. A very

serious allegation is made that the Government  is  out

to  provoke  violence and trouble.  I  think  the  hon.

Member must substantiate that allegation and we want to

meet it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order is well taken. I have

indicated  that  there must not be any  allegations  of

that  nature. All that the Member would be entitled  to

say  possibly is that by the Government's  action  they

might provoke disorder and so on. But he cannot make  a

deliberate  allegation that the  Government  are  doing

that,  because  if he does that, then,  of  course,  he

opens himself to a situation in which he will be called

upon  to  substantiate  a serious  allegation  of  that

nature. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand, Sir. The Government

at  the  present  moment  is even  using  the  familiar

tactics  of getting plain-clothes men from the  Special

Branch amongst the students. We understand that some of

these plain-clothes men even posed as students and were

trying  to instigate the real students to violence.  We

have also learnt that others posed as parents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Since the hon.

Member is persisting - and obviously he must have solid

grounds  for  persisting - I must ask  him  to  state  it

categorically in writing and substantiate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member need not state

categorically  in writing. He is making  a  responsible

statement  in  this Assembly which  is  going  down  on

record  and  he takes the consequences if  he  makes  a

statement   which   he  cannot  substantiate.   If   my

recollection  is  correct,  I  do  understand  that   a

Commission of Inquiry into the student unrest has  been

promised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I just mention that in passing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, all these things that have

happened can be found in the Chinese newspapers.  There

is  genuine ground for suspicion that things like  that

have happened. We see pictures of so-called parents  in

the  various newspapers, and they appeared to  be  more

like   Special  Branch  plain-clothes  men  than   real

parents.  Sir,  there are also other  pictures  in  the

Chinese papers which, of course, do not appear  in  the

Straits Times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pictures show unidentified men who many people

guess  and believe to be Special Branch men in disguise

.assaulting students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me show [Indicating] you a picture published

in  the  Mm  Pau dated 2nd December, 1961.  Here  is  a

picture  of a young man dressed in drain-pipe  trousers

raising  his hands against the students who are turning

away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> By whom was it taken?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Any person can see from this

picture alone that there are vicious persons - definitely

not  the parents - who want to cause trouble amongst  the

picketing Chinese students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other reports that plain-clothes men

were hiding in the building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



of  the Teachers' Training College and that they  threw

bottles and stones at students picketing peacefully  at

the  gates  of the College compound. Let me quote  you,

Sir.  All  this does not appear in the English  papers.

They can only be found in the Chinese Press. I think it

will  help  matters if I read it in  Mandarin  and  you

allow the interpreter to interpret it for you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think all the hon. Member can do is to

give  the  name  and date of that paper and  paraphrase

what is in it in English.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 30th

of  November,  page  2, there are reports  of  students

being assaulted, and stones, glasses and bottles thrown

at   the  students  by  people  hiding  behind  certain

buildings.  You  cannot imagine that students  want  to

hurt themselves. It cannot be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, there is a report in the Nanyang Siang Pau

of  the  2nd  of December, page 2, which  says  that  a

student  called out, "They are using the  handcuffs  to

hit  me  on  the head." Only the police have handcuffs,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this little bit alone, you will see the

provocation  that has been directed at the students  by

"unidentified  men", "mysterious  men"  and  "men  with

handcuffs".  If they are not people who have  authority

behind  them, then I am sure the Commissioner of Police

should  take  particular  note  and  get  all  of  them

arrested. These are only pinpricks and they were  meant

to  get  the students to retaliate. If there should  be

any  retaliation,  then,  of  course,  it  suits  their

scheme.  Then  they could take action  and  they  hoped

that,  by  taking action, they would be  able  to  draw

everybody into their so-called net.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the things which the English-educated

section  of  our  population do not know,  because  the

Straits Times presents only one side of the picture. It

plays   up   every  little  incident  that   may   seem

unfavourable  to  the  students  but - deliberately   or

otherwise - it   suppresses  all  factual   truths.   The

Assembly  is  constantly being supplied  with  official

statements from this Ministry and that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



We   have  heard  of  the  so-called  intimidation   by

students.  But let us ask the Minister - where  does  he

get  all those reports? We have known how reliable they

are.  I  do not have to remind you again, Sir,  of  the

Tommy  Koh incident. Yet it is solely on the  basis  of

such  information  from spies and  informers  that  the

Government  is trying to make us believe their  version

of  the present situation. We know, Sir, that people in

the Special Branch have been trained to orientate their

thinking only in one direction. They have been  trained

to  see  all  children of Chinese schools as  potential

Communists  or  even criminals. How can we  ever  trust

such reports, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present situation has arisen out of genuine

grievances  among the Chinese school students.  To  say

that  there are political agitators behind the  present

dispute  is  to tell the public a deliberate falsehood.

If   there  are  any  political  agitators - as  I   have

endeavoured  to  show - amongst the  Chinese  students,

today,  they  are  the people who wear  goggles,  those

mysterious   men   with  drain-pipe   trousers,   those

mysterious men with handcuffs, and those mysterious men

who  throw glasses and bottles at students. The  motion

tabled  by the Government is only an attempt to involve

the whole Assembly in their diabolical scheme of trying

to   maintain  tension  and  strife.  The  Government's

determination to prolong this tension can  be  seen  by

their    deliberate   institution   of    supplementary

examinations  as announced. On the one hand,  they  say

that they do not want to use force on the students. Yet

on  the  other  hand, the Government are advocating  or

hoping  that  the  Assembly will support  their  police

action  whenever  they  find it necessary.  We  in  the

Barisan Sosialis will never give a blank cheque to  the

desperate  men  who  have  to  use  force  against  the

students.  The  students have shown  themselves  to  be

restrained and orderly in their picketing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They respond to your request.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I need point to you

pictures  of  students sitting around in circles.  They

are  not people who are unruly. They are not people who

want  to fight against the police. Nobody in his proper

senses  would be able to interpret anything like  that.

And  yet  we  hear  the Prime Minister,  the  Education

Minister,  and  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for  Education saying that the  students  are

causing  the  trouble. In fact, I would  say  that  the

students  should  be congratulated on  their  calm  and

restraint in the face of such grave provocation by the

P.A.P.  Government - and the Special  Branch  too,  I  am

sure.  We  trust and we hope the students will maintain

and  remain calm and restrained and not fall  into  the

P.A.P. trap of violence and bloodshed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the Government not to use the police on

defenceless  students. Students  have  suffered  enough

violence  and brutalities at the hands of the  Lim  Yew

Hock Government. We have complete sympathy with them in

their  fear of the police and in their wanting to cover

up  part of their faces. This is not cowardice, Sir, as

what the Minister for Education wants us to believe.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Hooligans.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is simple common sense. The

students know that photographs would be taken of  them,

and  that  if  recognised they would be dealt  with  in

various  ways,  like arrests on some other  charge  or

deprivation of jobs later on when they should  ask  for

jobs. We know, for example, Sir, that good citizens  of

Singapore have been denied their citizenship  or  their

jobs  because they had taken part in the 1955 and 1956

student demonstrations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> 1954!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So, Sir, I think the students are

very  wise. They have common sense. They know with whom

they  are dealing - unscrupulous people in the  P.A.P.

The  only cowardice, Sir, is the cowardice of an  inept

Government  that wants to hide behind the Assembly  for

their irresponsible handling of the whole affair.  That

is the only cowardice. Take note of that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we resolutely oppose the motion. We oppose

everything that smacks of Chew Swee Kee. If the name of

the  Minister for Education is to be linked up with the

name of Chew Swee Kee, then let us hope it is not going

to  be in the use of oppressive action against defence-less  students, but rather that it is in the  ownership

of iron mines. We urge the Government, if it is sincere

in its desire to solve the present problem, to adopt  a

realistic approach. First, there must be calm and quiet

in  the schools. We urge the Government that instead of

prolonging the affair and so creating further  tension,

to   reduce   immediately  this  tension  by   allowing

conditions  to return to normal. Let all anger,  temper

and  emotions settle down first, before the  Government

tries to do anything drastic. Using the police at  this

juncture  is  not  going  to contribute  to  peace  and

tranquillity. It is not going to solve any problem.  It

is  no  use the Government trying to bull-doze its  way

through. We know the Government has enough police,  and

military  strength too, to manhandle  the  students  if

they   want  to.  This  is  nothing  that  an   elected

Government need be proud of. We know the Government can

easily choose to ignore the grievances of the students.

But  this  will not solve the problem..  It  will  only

postpone the solution. Let the Government not  put  its

pride and arrogance above the interests of students. It

is sheer irresponsibility on the part of the Government

to   insist   on  conducting  supplementary  Government

examinations this week. This is a deliberate attempt, I

say, to prolong the present trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chinese School Secondary IV examinations are,

in  fact, over. But the Government intends to carry  on

supplementary  examinations.  Already   it   has   been

admitted   by   the   Minister   himself   that   these

examinations,  having  been  conducted  under  abnormal

psychological  stress and strain,  did  not  allow  the

students  to give of their best performances.  And  the

Ministry  has indicated that it is going to  take  into

consideration  the students' normal school  records  in

the   assessment  of  their  academic  standards.  This

examination  has obviously lost its educational  value.

It  cannot  be regarded as a proper assessment  of  the

student's academic abilities anymore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



Then  why carry on this fiasco?  Already  it  is

rightly believed, Sir, that the Government is going  to

pass  everyone  who  took  the  examinations.  This  is

obviously an attempt to encourage more students to take

the examinations. But what is more ridiculous, Sir,  if

true,  is  that  the Government intends  to  pass  even

students  who  did not take the examination.  This,  of

course,  will boost up the official figures of students

who were supposed to have taken the examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday thousands of genuine parents, I stress

the  word "genuine", Sir, assembled in the Chinese High

School Hall and collectively condemned the Government's

educational  policy and its mishandling of the  present

situation. How is it that this Assembly has  not  heard

anything  from the Government of the opinions of  these

thousands of parents?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Barisan supporters.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are told, Sir, that there is a

petition from parents asking for police protection. But

what   about   the  parents  who  are  condemning   the

Government? Sir, I am sure my colleagues will enlighten

you  on  what  had  passed yesterday, so  that  you - and

especially  the English-educated - may know exactly  what

is  happening.  But we, in the Barisan  Sosialis,  have

always  stated that we do not want tension and  strife,

for  we  do not need this tension and strife to achieve

our objectives. We believe that the people of Singapore

are  intelligent  enough  to see  through  the  present

propaganda campaign of the Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is exactly what we have done

to see it through!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and we are confident that by

purely peaceful and constitutional means we can achieve

our  objectives. Let no one misinterpret our opposition

to  this  motion as an indication that we do  not  want

peace  and  order in Singapore. We can well expect  the

Government   and  the  Straits  Times  to   twist   our

opposition to this motion as an indication that we want

violence  and  unrest.  In fact,  they  can  twist  and

distort anything they like. But it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



not  save the P.A.P. from their political doom. We urge

the  Government, Sir, to climb down, "Climb  down  from

your arrogant attitude, from your Lyceum heights -"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I have reached

those  heights  at  the moment? I ask  the  Member  for

Queenstown  to address the Chair so that he  will  not

forget  that  he should be calm and collected  in  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will keep that in mind, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the police force is not going to solve

anything  at  all. It will only aggravate  the  already

tense  situation.  The  only  realistic  way  for   the

Govermnent to solve the present difficulties is for  it

to  admit its responsibility for the present situation.

Let   the   whole   matter   be   viewed   calmly   and

dispassionately. Everyone concerned must  be  consulted

and  his  views must be considered. Let the  Government

consult  again  the educationalists, the real  parents,

and  above  all the students, and arrive at a  peaceful

solution to what is essentially an educational problem.

Let  it not try to make any more political capital  out

of   the  present  delicate  situation.  We  hope   the

Government will pay heed to what we have said.

has resorted to personal attacks, which method I do not

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I shall give the Member an

individual answer.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, there is every reason for the

present   motion   before  the  House   being   debated

seriously, because  the Member for Queenstown  himself

has  given the Government credit for not having brought

in  the  police  at  the very start of  the  Government

Secondary IV Examination over which there has been this

boycott.  But the motion has come before this House  at

the  request  of  parents whose children  are  students

taking  the examination under very difficult conditions

at great cost of time and energy, just in order to have

the right to take the public examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that after my ministerial

statement on Monday last, announcing to Members of this

House  the  position as known to me then of  conditions

which  existed  as a result of the boycott,  the  Prime

Minister  challenged  Members opposite,  that  is,  the

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen, to indicate whether  they

were  in favour or otherwise of the boycott. This  call

also  came from Members of the Opposition, namely,  the

Member  for Farrer Park, who himself was very agitated.

Where was the stand of the Barisan Sosialis? We got  no

answer - which  is very clear indeed that  silence  means

consent  and  that, in fact, the Barisan  Sosialis  was

egging  on  and encouraging the students to persist  in

this  foolish boycott, that they were all part  of  the

grand  design  to bring chaos out or order.  Therefore.

Sir, in those circumstances, had Government brought  in

the police to protect the poor students and the parents

who  wanted to carry on with the examinations,  the  13

Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis would have  been  the

very first to exploit the situation and say, "There you

are.  Here is the P.A.P. Government with the heavy hand

of  the  police  and  the  armed  might  to  crush  the

children."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



That we did not do. We did not fall into their trap,

much as they tried. But it is a different position

entirely when the students and the parents themselves

felt that they needed it because they could not stand

this nonsense for too long a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer Mr

Speaker, Sir, to the Straits Times issue of Saturday,

2nd December, where there was a report made by parents

of students at the Teachers' Training College Centre,

that is, parents of students who were taking the

examination? I am quoting the paper now on page 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The parents then said that a delegation of picket

leaders had met them earlier in the day and had

expressed regret for the clashes during the past few

days.'



<br><br>The spokesman for the parents said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We accepted their regret and advised them to sit for

the substitute examination due to begin on Monday.'



<br><br>But unfortunately the pickets did not keep their word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has tried to voice the so-called grievances of students in the Chinese schools.

But let me quote what the students themselves told

reporters at a Press conference the same day and in the

same column:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At a Press conference given later the ten member

boycott action committee, including five girls...'.



<br><br>This is what they said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They said they were not against the examination

itself,  but the condition which stipulates  that  only

those  who  pass the Secondary IV examination  will  be

allowed to take the Upper Secondary II examination.'



<br><br>Just that and nothing else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all right-thinking people applaud the brave stand

taken  by  students, their parents  and  guardians  who

refused  to  be cowed by the intimidation of  Communist

and pro-Communist manipulators who used innocent school

children for their diabolical aims. Although two-thirds

of  the  candidates are taking the examination and  its

supplementary papers, the persistence on  the  part  of

agitators   to   carry  on  picketing  even   for   the

supplementary    examination    today     shows     the

unreasonableness of the political agitators behind this

boycott.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



This attitude has exhausted the admirable patience  of

students and parents who want to be left alone to  have

the freedom and the right to take a public examination.

Having  been unreasonably harassed for more than  three

days,   they   decided   to  form  a   Students-Parents

Committee.  One  of their constructive  recommendations

was not to look after themselves but to suggest cutting

short  the  examination period by  one  day.  This  was

immediately accepted by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Government has already indicated that supplementary

papers  would  be  set this week, the  Students-Parents

Committee,  noting the continued forceful  intimidation

of  pickets on both students and parents who wish their

children  to take the examination and wishing to  avoid

further  incidents,  have asked for police  protection.

Hence the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the pickets conducted their picketing peacefully,

which  they should have but did not; had they left  the

entrances  to  examination centres open for  people  to

move  in and out freely and without forming human  wall

and  human  chain barricades and even  locking  up  the

gates  of  schools in the dark of night, the  Students-Parents Committee themselves would not have called  for

police protection. It would have been unnecessary. This

is   purely  a  move  in  self-defence.  They  are  the

aggrieved  party, not the picketers. They  want  to  be

allowed  to exercise their democratic right and freedom

to  take a public examination. Those who do not want to

take the examination are not being compelled to do  so.

They can stay at home and it is their own business.  If

they  want  to  boycott  it, no one  is  stopping  them

either.  But  they  should not impose  their  views  on

others.  Worse still, trying forcefully,  stopping  and

preventing others from taking this examination. This is

not  the  way  to behave in a democratic  society  like

ours.  This  is  the  way  of force,  intimidation  and

thuggery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at 10.55 this morning, I arrived at

the junction of Tanglin and Kay Siang Roads. There were

about 15 to 20 pickets, and my car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



was stopped by one of them. He asked my driver where he

was  heading  for. I answered in reply that  I  am  the

Minister  for Education. At this the leader said,  "Oh,

the  Minister is here." When I asked, "May I be allowed

to proceed to do my work?", they instinctively formed a

human  chain  first before coming to a decision,  which

was  that  my car would not be permitted to go  in  but

that  I  might proceed on foot, which I did. Then  they

burst   into  song.  Of  course,  the  song  was   very

derogatory to me. Twenty yards ahead was another  human

wall  of  about 50 to 60 student picketers  singing  in

unison and awaiting my arrival. When I was a foot  away

from  the singing human wall, one leader ordered, "Let

him  pass." And the middle link of each human chain was

loosened. I walked into the human mass and came out  of

it  again amidst their chorus which ended after  I  had

walked another ten yards away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were in all 240 candidates, as mentioned by the

Parliamentary Secretary earlier on, who took the  first

supplementary  paper on Chinese Language this  morning.

But  for  the picketing which blocked all entrances  to

the  three  centres for the supplementary  examination,

there  could  have  been  a  larger  attendance  today.

However,  since 1,859 candidates took this  paper  last

week (the earlier report made last week did not include

two  candidates at the Trafalgar Home) the total number

of  candidates  who  have taken  the  Chinese  Language

paper,  which is a compulsory paper, is now  2,099,  or

2,100 approximately. This represents, Sir, two-thirds

of the possible candidates of 3,171.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on the Member for Farrer Park did say that if

we  are  to follow democratic procedure, the fact  that

two-thirds   of  the  candidates  want  to   take   the

examination is clear evidence that the majority support

the  examination and that the picketers  should  accept

this  verdict and leave the others alone. May I mention

that this point was also stated by the Students-Parents

Committee after the first day of the examination?  They

have said that more than half have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



decided  to take the examination. So will the picketers

try  to stop the boycott and let others carry on?  But,

unfortunately,   there  are  forces  who   talk   about

democratic  procedure but who avail themselves  of  all

the  benefits  of democracy just to make a  mockery  of

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us not belittle the effect of tabling a

motion  for  debate  in this Legislative  Assembly.  On

Wednesday,  the  29th  of  November,  1961,   when   my

Parliamentary  Secretary was prevented from  coming  to

this Assembly by the pickets -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Beleaguered!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> He was prevented, and naturally he

was  beleaguered together with me had  I  attempted  to

come  out  earlier; but I was prevented from  doing  so

because  of  work, and I would have come forward  after

the work was over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pickets were immediately dispersed as soon as the

debate  on the motion regarding the freedom of movement

of  a  representative of the people was in progress  in

this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my way to this Assembly, I noticed that the

pickets  who were being dispersed on instructions  were

looking very confused. They were having a grand  time

playing  games and singing songs. It was  all  in  good

fun. Because it was after all during the vacation.  But

there  was another group of pickets still on duty along

Tanglin  Road  at the examination centre,  still  under

control,  picketing. And this other group  in  the  Kay

Siang  Road were asked to disperse. So they had a  very

confused look. "What is all this? How come? Why are  we

called off?", and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Sir, today, four hours before now, at 12.30

p.m.,  about  400  to  500  pickets  at  the  Teachers'

Training  College  and  at the  Ministry  of  Education

mysteriously melted away. Sir, had the Barisan Sosialis

Assemblymen  not objected to the present  motion  being

debated  on Thursday, the pickets would not  have  been

called  out  for last Friday and today's  supplementary

examination. Students and parents of those students who

want to take the examination would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



have  been spared the annoyance, the irritation brought

about by the pickets and the people behind them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to

pay  once again my tribute to the students, the parents

and  the  guardians of those students who  stuck  their

necks  out  in defence of democracy; to the  staff  and

officials  of my Ministry, to the postmen and officials

of  the Post Office for their loyalty and dedication to

duty during a very difficult period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be known that at this very moment more than

9,000   candidates  are  taking  the  Cambridge  School

Certificate and the Cambridge Higher School Certificate

Examinations.  So  I  wish  today  to  acknowledge  how

creditably  my staff and the officials of the  Ministry

of  Education  have, with great patience, handled  this

situation  over  the  boycott of the  first  Government

Chinese Secondary IV Examination and, at the same time,

looked  after 9,000 other candidates who  are  doing their  examinations. This is not the work of an inept

Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A good civil service!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is. I make my acknowledgement of

that fact without reserve.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Good administration!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> And it goes to show how, far from

being  desperate men, we know what to do and we always

think  three steps ahead of you across - I mean not  you,

Mr  Speaker,  but the Barisan Sosialis, who  can  only

look  at  their  own  noses and not recognise  them.  I

therefore,  Sir, wish to say that I fully  support  the

motion   before   the  House  and  would   urge   every

Assemblyman, if he has a conscience, to support it.



<br><br>4.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Education has charged that Communists  and

pro-Communists  are  using  the  Chinese  students  for

political  purposes.  His Parliamentary  Secretary  has

charged That sinister men are using the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



students for political purposes. When I asked who  they

are, we got no precision. Sir, I am not so naive as not

to recognise that the charges are probably true. I find

it  difficult  to  believe that these students  without

adult  instigation would carry on the  strike  in  this

manner.  But who are the men who are instigating  them?

We  do  not know or we have not been told. But I  would

like  to  say  one thing, Sir, though I am prepared  to

accept  that  there are adults who are responsible  for

perverting  our youth and utilising them for  political

purposes, I say this Government and this Front Bench is

using  our Chinese students for political purposes  and

using  their  boycott of the examination for  political

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very midst of this unhappy debate, where the

vital  issue  of  the  future of the  whole  people  of

Singapore  is  involved, we have  had  manoeuvre  after

manoeuvre  on  the Government side.  We  have  had  the

spectacle  of the Minister for Education utilising  his

right  to  make  a  ministerial statement -  instead  of

making  it  as  he should have, factually,  it  was  an

important   statement  to  make  if  the   facts   were

accurate - by   indulging  in  an  abuse   of   political

opponents  and  making remarks which ultimately  called

for a ruling from you, Sir, that there must be a debate

if  it  was to be proceeded with. Subsequently we  have

the  spectacle of the Minister for Culture standing  up

as  the  Leader of the House and telling  us  that  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for  Education

was beleaguered by 300 hooligans, and, Sir, I once more

fell into the error of believing the Government. Though

I  have  no love for the gentleman concerned,  and,  in

fact,  if  it  must be known, I have a strong  personal

antipathy to him, nevertheless the thought that he  was

beleaguered  by  300 hooligans was so repugnant  to  my

feeling  of justice that I offered to go [Laughter]  - Ah, yes, they laugh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Serjeant at Arms.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I offered to go with the Serjeant at

Arms to rescue him - [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And the Government Bench laughed. And

why, Sir? We learned shortly afterwards, when the

Member concerned walked into this Assembly with every

hair of his head well oiled and slicked back and - [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think all that the hon. Member

for Anson is entitled to do is just to have a passing

reference to these past incidents and not to go into

all those details. Let us come back to the motion. I

have always allowed exordiums, but if they are a bit

lengthy and try to go away from the motion, then I must

always bring the Member back to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Since the Member for Anson has

brought the Government to task for laughing at his

proposal to send the Serjeant at Arms to rescue the

beleaguered Parliamentary Secretary, perhaps I could

explain why there was laughter. The main reason is that

the Serjeant at Arms is a venerable gentleman of 68

years of age and is armed with a sword, not meant for

more than decorative purposes - [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. An hon. Member can only get up on a

point asking for elucidation of a Member's speech and

not to offer an explanation of his own!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, they say they want this motion

because the dignity of this House and support of this

motion would have effect on the school children. How

much more effect it would have if a representative of

this House in the person of the Serjeant at Arms had

been there, Sir? I go no further than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was seeking to point out to you, Sir, that we cannot

accept  the allegation in this motion as being true  by

virtue of the evidence that we have before us. We  have

before this very Assembly evidence of the untruth - I use

the word "inaccuracies",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



Sir - inaccuracies of allegations made by  the

Minister  for Culture as Leader of this House  in  this

very  House,  but  a few days ago,  on  the  very  same

subject, Beleaguered -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member knows the

matter  is  now in the possession of the  Committee  of

Privileges  and, therefore, he ought not to  anticipate

what  he  thinks  the  Committee  of  Privileges  might

decide.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

are  in the midst of a debate on the merger motion, and

as  the speakers have been proceeding, it is being made

abundantly  clear to the people of Singapore  that  the

proposals in the White Paper are rather handing  up the

people  of Singapore, tied hand and foot, with  a  very

large tribute -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Anson  is entitled to pass those remarks in this debate

on a motion which is asking for police protection.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am sorry. I am seeking to

make it plain that this is not a genuine motion seeking

the  assistance  of  this  House,  but  that  it  is  a

political  motion with political intent,  that  it  has

been  obscuring and diverting attention from our merger

motion. On the subject of political agitation by school

students,  Sir, this is at all times reprehensible;  to

the  minds  of  those who are Western-educated,  it  is

particularly abhorrent. But let us recognise that it is

part  of  the Asian scene of this era all the way  from

Cairo to Tokyo, and not excluding India. The fact  that

it  is part of the Asian scene does not make it any the

less  reprehensible, Sir, but let us recognise that  it

is a phenomenon which is not unique to Singapore. I for

one  have  always condemned, today condemn  and  always

will  condemn improper political activity on the  part

of school children. But I cannot see that there was any

call  for  this  Government to interrupt  repeatedly  a

vital  debate  for  the purpose of  seeking  these  two

debates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the

Member  not aware that we offered sittings on  Saturday

and  Sunday  in  order  that the  debate  could  go  on

uninterrupted?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No. If it please you, Mr Speaker, the

Government  has  repeatedly made allegations  that  the

Barisan Sosialis, the Communists and the pro-Communists

are  subverting  our youths in this improper  political

activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Who said that is right?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. When the Speaker is on his feet,

there  must  be silence in this Chamber.  I  think  the

Member  for Anson will find it much easier if he  looks

at the Chair and addresses the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always

understood the Chair to be a medium of communication to

Members opposite as well as to Members on this side  of

the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to have heard - as I believe

I  heard - the  words,  "That is  true"  from  Government

Benchers. I should not like to misquote them. I repeat,

they  have  alleged  through their Ministers  that  the

Barisan Sosialis, the Communists and pro-Communists are

responsible for subverting our youths in this political

activity. If this is true, then those people should  be

in  gaol not tomorrow but today. They should have  been

in  gaol yesterday, last week and before that, when the

conspiracy  was known to the Government. They  are  the

people who should be in gaol and they are the people -



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a

point  of order. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson

seems  to be rattling the whole of the Assembly. He  is

not giving his reasons.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just about to get up on my

feet  because  I think the Chair was being intimidated.

Perhaps the Member for Bras Basah was also feeling  the

same.  I ask the hon. Member for Anson to modulate  his

voice.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, now I understand what

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



means by intimidation - school children intimidating.  If

that  is  the  extent  of the intimidation,  bless  the

school children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government has information of adults who

are  poisoning  and subverting our youths,  then  those

adults  should be in goal. That is simple.  It  is  not

intimidatory.  If  they have not got that  information,

they should not make those allegations in this House. I

have not heard of a single person being charged in  the

courts  or  being arrested for poisoning and subverting

the-minds    of    the    Chinese   school    children.

[Interruption] in connection with the, organisation  of

this  boycott  of the examinations. I think  the  House

should  know - not vague allegations by the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Education  and  by  the

Minister:  Communists  and pro-Communists,  or  Barisan

Sosialis  backseat drivers -  since they seek to  make  a

serious  debate on  it, who are the adults  responsible

for  what,  to  my  mind,  is  unquestionably  criminal

conduct of a grave character affecting the welfare of a

material, segment of our population and the welfare  of

the  people of Singapore as a whole? It is those people

I  should  like  to see aimed at. It  is  those  people

against whom I would like to use the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is why you want the P.P.S.O.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I shall come to the P.P.S.O., Mr

Speaker, Sir,I promise the Prime Minister that he will

have a motion on the P.P.S.O. when we can clear the air

and we will see how he talks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> See how rude he talks!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, as regards the conduct of the

students, it may well be - in fact, Sir, although I have

no  evidence, and although no evidence has been offered

except  the word of the gentlemen from the Front  Bench

which  I  have,  through bitter experience,  learnt  to

question - that our Chinese youths



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



who  are  indulging in this boycott are not,  in  fact,

interested  in the educational aspects, but  are  being

utilised  for political ends. If that is so, Sir,  then

it  is  wrong to use the police against them.  You  are

punishing  the  victim.  You  are  not  punishing   the

criminal.  If  it is admitted that they  are  misguided

victims of adult political intriguers, then it  is  not

they  whom  we  ought to punish. When  the  Member  for

Queenstown  spoke about an ineffective and  ineffectual

Government,  I  say that to this extent this  has  been

proved  true. The Government cannot find the criminals.

So  they  want to punish the victims. That is  what  it

looks like on this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the conduct of the students may be - it is very

difficult  to get at the truth with all the smokescreen

and  exaggeration put up by the Government  - I say  that

to   date   the   maximum   possible,   Sir,   indicate

reprehensible  conduct,  but not  conduct  of  a  grave

character  seriously  prejudicing  the  peace  or   the

welfare of this country in any way. I would remind hon.

Members  opposite that this is not the  first  time  we

have  had student trouble. In fact, they have  been  so

reminded.  I would remind them that when I  was  seated

where they are seated today [Laughter] - a curious sense

of  humour,  Sir! - we had sit-down  strikes  of  a  very

serious  character affecting several  schools  over  an

extended  period.  The English Press  and  my  English-speaking  friends  and those who were  not  my  friends

called  me a coward for not using the police  to  flush

out  the students from the schools. At that time,  Sir,

the  leader of the S.P.A. was my colleague and he found

himself  in  full conformity with my views.  The  Prime

Minister from the Opposite Bench could find nothing  to

criticise  in  my not using the police.  In  fact,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I draw your attention - because  the

parallel is very real - to a very short passage  made  in

this  very  House on 25th May, 1955 (6� years  ago)  at

column 258:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Government has been told - we have been accused - that

our action, and our inaction,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



has  undermined authority. We are told that our son has

publicly  cocked his snook at us, and  our  other  sons

stand by wondering at our forbearance, perturbed,  even

dismayed.' -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I have the name of the

speaker?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I was the speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Words of wisdom!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do not retract one single word.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just going to remark that I

might have guessed!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am glad I have not

changed. I read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, our son is as one who is ill. He lies stricken

with the chicken-pox, his body a mass of red spots, and

the  more  we  forbid  him  to  scratch,  the  more  he

stubbornly   scratches,  and  the  more   those   spots

suppurate.  What would you have us do? Use a  knife  to

excoriate those red spots? Take down the whip and  lash

out  in  a frenzy of hurt pride, and then weep  at  the

damage we have done? This, Sir, is not the time for the

whip, or the knife. I have no pride in the face of this

illness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese people, Sir, are the very heart in our

body  politic. They are the blood in our veins. To harm

them  would  destroy all. It would destroy forever  the

glorious  future now within our grasp  of  a  free  and

independent  people, working together  as  brothers  in

love  and  in mutual respect. This, Sir, is a time,  in

our  view,  for gentle nursing. Age-old Chinese  wisdom

and  Chinese stability, working on a constitution  that

is  basically sound, will restore this son  to  health,

and  we will be proud of our Chinese son. Friends think

us  weak; others call us cowards. They will not deflect

us from our vision of a united people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task before us, Sir, is a tremendous one - a task to

win  the confidence of our Chinese people, a people who

have  had considerable cause for complaint in the past.

In  humility,  and with all we have, we shall  seek  to

gain that confidence and to gain that cooperation which

is absolutely necessary for the welfare of all races ...'.



<br><br>That was said, Sir, in times of stress, in times when I

had  to  suffer from Chinese school children much  more

than  this Government has ever had to suffer. I do  not

regret even after 6� years the patience not only under

stress but under insults from the English Press and the

English  speaking  world - the  terms  of  abuse  and  of

cowardice that were flung at us for the strength of our

patience which they could not recognise. For I  say  to

you,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



Sir, that in moments when patience is called for, it is

weakness and cowardice that runs to the police  to  ask

for  the  baton  and the bullet. I would  not  use  the

police  against school children 6� years ago.  I  will

not  use  the police against school children  today.  I

repeat,  the  Government should and  it  must  use  the

police against the adults. If they really do exist, and

I  am inclined to believe that they do exist, then  use

your police and use your powers. You have got plenty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Hear, hear! A vote for you!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> To use the police against school

children  at this stage is to admit complete defeat  of

the  democratic process. As I have said,  you  are  not

punishing   the   criminals.  You  are  punishing   the

misguided victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, looking back over the last seven

eventful   years,   surely   some   Members   of   this

Government - one of whom at least was active politically - must  be conscious that the tradition of patience  with

school  children pays. The every fact that  today,  far

from having 100 per cent of the students barricaded  in

their  schools - as we had to suffer it  - you  have  two-thirds of the children (according to the Minister), you

have  three-fourths of the children (according  to  his

Parliamentary Secretary) having taken the examinations,

is  that not some evidence that we have come a long way

through   patience  in  teaching  those  children   the

discipline  compatible with democratic  principles?  To

use the fire hose and the baton against school children

today -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

motion  here  calls upon the House to give approval  to

allow  police protection to students and not to assault

them  with  the  baton and the bullet. I  do  not  know

whether  the Member for Anson has clearly in  his  mind

the  terms  of  the motion. He seems to  be  under  the

impression  that the motion suggest that we should  ask

the  police to beat up these kids, but that is not  the

text of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Surely that is an argument which

the Minister could advance

But he can be answered. It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to ask

your guidance. I would like the conduct of the Minister

in  interposing  at this juncture on a point  which  he

knew not to be a point of order, to be referred to  the

Committee of Privileges.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think I will be justified in

motion] by the Police to protect students [we have  not

heard  of any who have been assaulted] wishing to  take

their  examinations  to  ensure  that  they  are   riot

intimidated or injured, and that the students and their

parents  who accompany them are given free passage  and

<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in accordance with

Standing  Orders.  I  presented to  the  Assembly  the

"Estimates containing a vote on account for part of the

year   1963  for  the  State  of  Singapore"  and   the

"Development  Estimates for the State of Singapore  for

the  year 1963". Notice required under Standing  Orders

of  the  first allotted day has been submitted  to  the

Clerk of the-Assembly at 3.20 p.m. today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates containing a Vote on Account for six

months'   expenditure  in  1963   were   presented   in

accordance  with  section  98  (3)  of  the   Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, which  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Assembly may, by resolution approving estimates

containing a vote on account, authorise expenditure for

part   of   any   year  before  the  passing   of   the

Appropriation  law  for that year,  but  the  aggregate

amount   so   voted  shall  be  included,   under   the

appropriate heads, in the Appropriation Bill  for  that

year.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates are calculated at 55 per cent of the

expenditure  appearing in the 1962 Estimates  shown  as

expenditure to be voted by the Assembly. This means  an

increase  of 10 per cent is provided in 1963 over  1962

estimated   expenditure   as   allowance   for   normal

expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Estimates containing a Vote on Account were

presented  to the Assembly in accordance with  Standing

Order 89.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 98 (3) of the Constitution to which I

referred  earlier  does not apply  to  the  Development

Estimates.  For  the  Development Estimates  for  1963,

contained  in this Paper, it is necessary therefore  to

follow  section  4 of the Development  Fund  Ordinance,

1959.  Under  section 4 (1) of this  Ordinance,  it  is

necessary  for the estimates for the full  year  to  be

shown.  Also the sums necessary to meet each  head  and

sub-head of expenditure have to be shown. This explains

why the Development Estimates for 1963 show expenditure

for   12   months  as  compared  with  the   estimates

containing a Vote on Account which show expenditure for

six  months  only. It also explains why the Development

Estimates  for  1963 show both heads and  sub-heads  of

expenditure, whereas the Estimates containing a Vote on

Account show only heads of expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must explain why the Government

had  decided upon these steps. In recent months, it had

become  obvious that progress towards merger  has  been

achieved at a rate which has exceeded all expectations.

With the support of the vast majority of the peoples of

the  Federation, Singapore and the Borneo  territories,

the movement towards reunification of these territories

has  gathered  momentum and has be-come an irresistible

force.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

We  have  given  permission for  him  to  make  factual

statement.  Is  it  appropriate for  him  to  introduce

matters   of   political   inferences   and   political

propaganda?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated in the past, of course,

that  a  ministerial statement should  be  factual  and

should  not  be  such as to invite  a  debate.  If  the

ministerial statement is such as to invite a debate,  I

did indicate that the proper procedure would be for the

Minister,  after  making  his statement,  to  move  the

adjournment of the House to enable the House to debate

the statement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am quite happy for this

statement  to be debated. But if the Member  for  Anson

will  bear  with me for a while and reflect on  what  I

actually said, there is absolutely nothing here that is

controversial,  because  all sides  of  the  House  are

agreed that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



merger  is  desirable. It is nothing  controversial  at

all, as I said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well, to continue, Mr Speaker, Sir. It is

important that we in Singapore must not allow  lack  of

preparation  to  hold up the implementation  of  merger

plans    because   of   possible   hold-ups   in    the

administrative machinery. We must not only look at what

is  likely  to  happen in 1962, we  must  also  try  to

visualise  events in 1963. The Prime Ministers  of  the

Federation and Singapore, in a joint statement made  in

September  this  year, have set  the  target  date  for

merger  in  or  before June 1963. The  way  events  are

moving, there is little reason for doubt that it  would

be   realised.  The  Government  anticipates  that  the

preparation  of a  budget  for  1963  will  encounter

numerous technical problems of details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget of any government is not something that is

prepared just before Budget Day. As I have mentioned in

a  previous  budget  statement, the  preparation  of  a

budget  is  a  continuing and a continuous process.  No

sooner  has  one budget been approved in  the  Assembly

than  the  Treasury gets down to the task of  preparing

for the next one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation for the budget for 1963 must normally

therefore begin in a month or two. At the same time  we

expect that all Ministries of the Singapore Govermnent,

especially the Ministry of Finance, will have  to  bend

their   minds   to  the  many  intricate   details   of

implementing the White Paper proposals on  merger.  The

strain on the Treasury Division of my Ministry will  be

particularly  heavy.  We have  had  experience  of  one

exercise in the preparation of a budget when the  whole

basis  of  the administration is radically  changed.  I

refer,  of  course, to the current year's budget  which

integrated  certain City Council departments  into  the

Central  Government both in respect of its revenue  and

expenditure proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the budget for the new State of

Singapore,  as a constituent member of the  Federation,

will  be even more complicated and onerous. It is well,

therefore,  that the situation should be explained  now

and  that  both the Assembly and the general public  be

made aware of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To settle the details of allocation of votes and

revenue between State and Central Government,

additional work will devolve on Treasury officials and

those Ministries affected by transfers of

responsibility, and it is not likely that the 1963

Budget will be ready in time. This may well expose the

Government to criticism. There might even be a loss of

confidence in the administration. For this reason and

in fairness to the administration, I will be asking the

House to approve a vote on account for the first six

months of 1963. I also intend to ask approval for the

Development Estimates for the whole of 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These requests are only in accordance with the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, and with the

Development Fund Ordinance. The Development Fund

Ordinance, as I said a moment ago, requires that

approval for development expenditure should be passed

by the Assembly in respect of a full year while the

(Constitution) Order in Council allows a vote on ac-count for part of the year. This provision of the law

is quite reasonable. The vote on account is asked in

respect of annually recurrent expenditure. Such

expenditure is incurred in regular amounts each month

being payments for salaries of staff, regular services

used by the Government such as water, light,

electricity, stationery, telephone, rents of offices

and so forth. Development expenditures on the other

hand is paid for in block amounts as and when a project

is completed. Payments are therefore not regular

throughout the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote on account, as I said earlier, provides for

expenditure for the first six months of 1963 at 55 per

cent of the expenditure appearing in the 1962 Estimates

now before the House. As regards the Development

Estimates, no new items have been introduced. They were

all projects entered in the Four-Year Development Plan

which had been approved by this Assembly earlier this

year as well as a few new projects which I have

discussed in my Budget Statement last week. I should

perhaps refer to one difficulty in the preparation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



the Development Estimates for 1963. This is the problem

of forecasting the date of completion of projects. Some

projects which are scheduled to be completed in 1962

and therefore paid for from the funds to be voted for

that year, may incur some delay owing to circumstances

beyond the control of the Government. In such cases,

financial provisions must be made in 1963 to pay for

the completion of such projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me add that

the Treasury will, in spite of the heavy duties which

the administration would have to undertake in the

coming months, try to prepare the estimates in time. If

it can be done, the Government would then present these

estimates to the Assembly in the normal way. But ex

abundantae cautela we consider it prudent to ask the

Assembly's approval for expenditure in the first six

months of 1963. Everyone will agree that in matters of

State finance, the cautious approach has much to

commend it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to allow a debate

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would suggest that perhaps the more

opportune moment will be 2.30 p.m. tomorrow when hon.

Members will have had an opportunity to study that

statement. Copies of the statement will be made

available. Any Minister could then move the adjournment

to enable a debate to take place. Does that satisfy

hon Members? I might add, of course, that at 2.30 p.m.

tomorrow, if hon. Members think they do not wish

further debate they could indicate, and then the motion

need not be moved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are now on item 2 of the Order Paper.

Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, before adjourning I informed

you that I am against using the police against school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



children.  I say to the Government, "If you cannot  get

men  your  size - the sinister adults  who  you  say  are

responsible for subverting these school children - do not

go  bullying the school children." Their attitude, Sir,

is  this, "We are not bullying the school children.  We

have  been  asked by the parents." If you look  at  the

motion, Sir, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In response to an appeal from parents of students...'.



<br><br>Sir, I would like to ask this House, which consists  of 51  Members,  all alive, did anybody else  receive  any

word  from parents in his division? I have not, Sir,I

have    received   letters   about   the   Government's

educational  policy,  but not  a  word  asking  me  for

protection   of   students  who  are   going   to   the

examination. But it seems that the Political  Secretary

to  the  Minister  for Education has  received  such  a

petition.  It  is  signed, I  am  told,  by  about  100

persons.   Who  are  these  100  persons?  Were   they

politically motivated? Who organised the petition?  How

is  it that none of the rest of us have heard from  any

parents to like effect?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will appreciate, Sir, why I take this allegation

of  a  petition - no, the statement of the receipt  of  a

petition - with a pinch of salt. Not that I deny that  a

petition  was  received.  But the  genuineness  of  the

alleged  representation and the freedom from  political

motivation of these persons who signed those petitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told by the Political Secretary to the

Minister for Education that there are only 600 students

who  have  not  taken  the examinations.  I  think  his

arithmetic is wrong. But that is what he has said to us

this   afternoon.  If  there  are  600  students - school

children - and there are only 100 parents petitioning, it

does  suggest  that  600 children have  more  than  100

parents.  I trust he will accept that. In fact,  a  lot

more  than 200 parents for 600 school children. In  the

circumstances, are we to understand that  the  majority

of  the  parents do not want police protection? And  on

the basis of what the Minister has said, in a democracy

the majority will must rule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at it in a different way. The

Parliamentary Secretary says that there 600 pupils  who

have  not  taken  the  examination.  The  Minister  for

Education  told  us  this afternoon  that  400  to  500

pickets this morning were gathered at one centre. So it

means that there are only 100 students left - if we  take

400  to  500 who are picketing - who might want to  enter

for  the examination. If 240 could take the examination

this  morning,  why could not this extra  100?  Wherein

lies  the  urgency or validity of this motion on  their

own  arithmetic?  Where is the plea  of  the  Political

Secretary to the Minister for Education, his plea -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson must refer to

the   Parliamentary   Secretary  as   a   Parliamentary

Secretary  and not as a Political Secretary.  They  are

two different types of individuals.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Where  is  his  plea  for  the safety  of  hundreds  of

parents? Where are the hundreds of parents? Have we had

a  single instance of a single parent being injured  or

hurt?  Where  is his plea about the illegal  action  of

hooligans? As far as I can see, Sir, it is based on his

suggestion that his car was stopped, that eight  people

said to him, "Khoon choy, khoon choy", which in Chinese

means,  "Will  the  Political Secretary  got  into  his

coffin?"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the Member for Anson going back

to  the  original motion which we have debated - the  motion  on

privilege?  The  Member for Anson is  referring  to  an

incident  which  is  not  the subject  matter  of  this

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was talking of his

plea today that there should be protection against  the

illegal  action of hooligans. Where is the evidence  of

hooliganism? The Minister himself said that there  was.

So  far as I can remember, in answer to a supplementary

question (I think it was on Thursday afternoon),  there

was  not  one  single instance of violence or  physical

injury.  Are  there  any instances  today  of  physical

injury to anybody? But according to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



Minister,  2,000 took part in the examinations  out  of

3,000.  According to his Secretary 2,500 took  part  in

the  examination  out  of 3,000,  and  not  one  single

incident of physical injury. Yet we are being asked not

merely  to interrupt a serious, a grave debate, but  to

ask  the  police to take action against student pickets

who are obstructive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it must be obvious that the Government has, for reasons best known to itself, some of which I might guess at, seriously exaggerated the gravity of

what is taking place. I say we must not throw away  the

principle of patience with school children in order  to

cope  with minor incidents. I will not use the  police,

and  I  will not support the use of the police, against

groups  of  school  children.  I  ask  this  House   to

recognise   that  the  Government  has   inflated   and

exaggerated the facts. And I ask the House to  be  wary

of  supporting  any  action by the police  against  our

school children. Let us not be so foolish as to  use  a

sword to cut a pound of butter. We might find ourselves

cutting ourselves. We might find that we are destroying

what  we  have  built  up over several  long  suffering

years,  and  that  is  the tradition  of  patience  and

reasonableness with our school children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I sit down, Mr Speaker, I would like to

make  my  own  stand  clear on  the  subject  of  their

conduct.  I would not like, by implication  and  in  my

refusal  to Support police action, to let it be implied

that   I  am  sitting  on  the  fence  in  so  far   as

condemnation  of  improper  obstructive   or   forceful

conduct  on  the  part  of pickets  is  involved.  Sir,

without  hesitation, I do condemn political  activities

on  the part of school children. I consider it inimical

to the healthy development of a parliamentary democracy

when  those  who  can know nothing by virtue  of  their

tender  years of the issues which are involved, permit

themselves  to  be  manipulated, to take  advantage  of

situations,  where  our sympathies  are  involved,  for

political purposes. I want to go further. If, in  fact,

the  students  have used violence, as  alleged  by  the

Straits Times cameraman, even once against any pupil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



seeking  lawfully to go in to his examination,  then  I

say  such action is improper. It is reprehensible,  and

the students concerned are not a credit either to their

school or their parents. Sir, I would have like you and

every  Member of this House to see what this  gentleman

here showed me in a newspaper just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Mr Marshall addressed an hon. Member sitting

below him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I have that newspaper you showed me just now? What

is the date?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir. Saturday, 2nd of

September. It is the Mimi Pau. Mr Speaker, Sir, it  is

a  very  informative photograph where  school  children

seemed  to  be acting with patience and forbearance  in

the  face  of adult intimidation. I would like  to  say

that  it  is  my impression that the vast  majority  of

these pickets have acted with propriety, restraint  and

discipline.  But that they have so acted  is  only  how

they  should  act. It does not in any  way  excuse  the

conduct  of those few who are guilty or may  have  been

guilty of acts of violent obstruction to those students

who  sought to take their examinations. I believe  they

are  very  few, Mr Speaker, Sir. But few  though  they

are,  I  would  not  like  to be  misunderstood  in  my

condemnation of such conduct, particularly if they  are

conscious   that  it  is  not  in  pursuance   of   any

educational   aims,  but  in  pursuance   of   improper

political activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is no room for the second part of this motion. No cause has been shown for the second part of the motion which calls upon this House to

request  the  police and support police action  against

students.  I  would  like to say, quite  categorically,

that  if the first part of this motion had stood alone,

and had I thought that it would have been of any value,

I would have moved for the deletion of the second part,

but  I  can  see that I will get nowhere with  it  anti

merely  lengthen the debate. But in case Government  is

in  any way prepared to withdraw the second part of the

motion  seeking for police action, I would be  content,

Sir, to support the first part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



condemnation. I repeat, Sir, I will not be prepared, in

the circumstances of today, and in the minor incidents

of today, to call upon the police to take action

against school children.



<br><br>6.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened with

great interest to the dexterity and skill with which

the Member for Anson supported all sides that were

right. I say it is no mean achievement to be able to

say, on the one hand, "I condemn intimidation"; and on

the other, "Look at this picture which shows how

peaceful they are in the face of intimidation". At the

end of it all, I am left in doubt as to whether, in

fact, the Member for Anson is quite sincere when he

says that he will vote for the first half of the

motion, but not for the second half, for the reasons he

has stated. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, because I am

in some doubt as to that, I would suggest that at a

later stage perhaps the vote can be taken in two parts.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, the condemnation, and then

the request which I think spells out logically from the

condemnation, for police protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on Thursday evening, the 30th of November, a

statement was issued by the Barisan Sosialis in the

name of the Member for Queenstown. The contents of that

statement showed how important it was for the

Government not to have provided the open police

protection asked for by the parents of the students

taking their examinations without having first debated

the matter in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody in his right mind, Sir, can doubt that it is the

picketers who are out to make mischief, because if

there are no pickets, there will not be any trouble. It

is not the students and the parents who accompany these

students into the examination hail who bring trouble.

All that the parents want to do with their sons is to

see that they enter the examination hall in peace and

safety and leave in one piece, equally safe.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read to you, Sir, certain extracts from the

statement - and we can congratulate ourselves on the

wisdom of having first tabled this motion for debate in

this House. This was in the Straits Times of 1st

December:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Late tonight [meaning Thursday night] Dr Lee Siew

Choh, Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis, declared his

party's strong opposition to the use of police against

Chinese school students who had "genuine grievances"

against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "The P.A.P. Government today tried to

introduce a motion to sanction police action against

students...".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never asked for any police action against students.

We asked for police protection - to sanction police

protection for parents and students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"It has smuggled into the Assembly a so-called

petition alleged to have been sent by parents of

Chinese students...".'



<br><br>The "so-called petition". Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary, the Member for Bukit Panjang, had

anticipated all these reckless allegations being made,

and when he handed out copies to the Press, he was

careful enough to hand out photostat copies, in the

genuine handwriting of the parents, and signatures. He

informed me that he had made quite sure that the

parents who signed those documents were parents who had

taken their children to the examination centre at the

T.T.C. These things are on the record. We can table the

petition. It can be checked at a subsequent date, and

he who lies can be discovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Nanyang Siang Pau, these same parents have

come out with a trenchant letter against the President

of the Chinese School Teachers Association for his

statement suggesting that this whole examination should

be abandoned and that the Government give in to

intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statement is in Chinese and I do not wish to

do a running translation in English. I think one of my

colleagues will probably be speaking in Chinese and the

statement can then be translated by the official

interpreter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lee, according to this statement, said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...it was clear that this was part of the P.A.P.'s

scheme to divert public attention from the current

important debate on merger in which the Government was

fully aware it was not faring well.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are categorical assertions.

That something is what one wishes to believe it is,

does not make it so. This debate on merger has gone on

in its wildest dreary way for more than 10 days.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Dreary for the Government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir, dreary for the Speaker.

The Government never complained -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did make an announcement on the

matter, but I think the matter should end there. It

should not be interpreted as being dreary for the

Speaker. The Speaker is trained to listen to dreary

debates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I

am letting anything out of the bag if I indicate that

at a meeting called in your Chambers on Friday, the

Acting Leader of the House made it quite clear -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is

this. To my mind, all conversations with the Speaker

whether in his Chambers or otherwise, whether alone or

in a group should be completely confidential, unless

permission is given in advance for their disclosure

however innocuous.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is a ruling which I have

not made, but it is a good indication of what should be

the case. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that he

does not go into details of what took place in my

Chamber. He could, if he likes, refer in passing to

the announcement I made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir. I think I am entitled to

do more than that. By way of analogy, may I remind the

Member for Anson that what transpires in the Judges'

Chambers is not necessarily forgotten when one goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



into open court and takes a different stand? One cannot

say something in private and go into the public chamber

and say something quite different. We are accustomed to

saying privately what we think publicly and say

publicly. I am entitled to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, I had

prior conversation and discussions with the Acting

Leader of the House - he agreed to tell Members of the

Opposition and you that we considered it, a matter of

the utmost importance that everybody in this Chamber,

all Members, should have all the time and all the

opportunity in the world to say whatever they wish to

say on this merger debate without any restriction

either by way of time or by way of guillotine. We said

that to you privately. We say that publicly. We wanted

to give Opposition Members more time and, for that

reason, we moved that the House sit on a Saturday and

on a Sunday, and we are still prepared to do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is likely if we go on in this dreary fashion,

that we might sit through Christmas, which I think is

something which the Member for Anson, as a man of the

world, would find very unpleasant and so would I -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Then may I add my voice to it? So

would the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So you see, Mr Speaker, Sir, how

can it be said that we were, in fact, trying to divert

attention from a debate in which we were not faring

well when, in fact, the whole House was bored stiff,

Mr Speaker, Sir, with 7� hours' weary rattle -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Hon. Prime Minister has made

his point. If he goes on in that strain, then Members

from the Opposition will say that the Assembly was not

bored stiff. So it goes on, and the debate will be more

dreary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am obliged. Mr Speaker, Sir,

except that had they said that, we would have pointed

out that their own Members left the Chamber when they

performed. But be that as it may.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement then goes on to let what to our minds is

the most significant cat out of the Barisan bag:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"We have seen enough [these were supposed to be the

words of the Member for Queenstown] brutalities and

violence perpetrated by the Lim Yew Hock Government

against our children."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that whatever happens in a

fracas in which young students are involved with adult

policemen, it is more than likely that some young

students will be injured. On one last occasion when

such a student was injured, his body was taken aloft,

still alive, paraded round the town to arouse the

feelings of the multitude - which it did - and he, the

poor, injured student, died in the process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my colleague, the Minister for Culture, will be

quoting to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, the words of the then

Chief Minister on this matter. The then Chief Minister

has quoted words from that same speech he made. He has

been through the mill and he knows what this is all

about, Mr Speaker, Sir. That is why he says he has

more than a shrewd suspicion that there are adults

behind it. And he finds it difficult to believe that

young students, for no rhyme or reason, can suddenly

misbehave for the purpose of disrupting an examination

which is purely voluntary and which is, in fact,

intended to be an embellishment and a suitable

conclusion to their academic career. Be that as it may,

I would like to suggest to the Member for

Queenstown - and, more important. I would like to suggest

to those who are charting the destiny of the Red Star

of the Barisan Sosialis - that they are not going to

find in the P.A.P. Government the same hamhanded.

unwitting opponent that they found in former colonial

governments and in the Government of the first Chief

Minister - the Member for Anson - for the, Government of

the second Chief Minister-the Member for Cairnhill.

Every time he mentions Chew Swee Kee, every time he

likens me to the Member for Cairnhill, and every time

he says that P.A.P. is like the Labour Front,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



what  his ghost writers are doing is crying in  anguish

wishing that that were so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had the singular privilege of having worked

together with the Communists in a united front  against

the colonialists - a genuine classic anti-colonial united

front.  We  knew that they were Communists.  They  knew

that  we  were not Communists. We gave them  cover  and

they  gave us cover. We wanted to beat up the  British.

As  a  result,  not  unnaturally  we  learned  how  the

operations  are done. We take up the top hat - they  have

first put in the rabbit. We pull it out to the applause

of  the multitude. They allowed themselves to be  bound

up  and  put  in a box, and after a decent interval  of

time,  we  opened it and lo and behold  the  Communists

were free again, to the applause of the multitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gentleman opposite said it grieved him to see

these empty Benches at the back - if he were honest  with

himself, he would subconsciously wish he was back  here

instead  of  being windy across the way. The Communists

have embarked on a different kind of united front. This

is  not the classical anti-colonial united front.  This

is  the hazardous occupation of forming a united  front

against  the  nationalists. This is  not  fighting  the

dying  British.  This is fighting the very  much  alive

nationalists.  It is a very different proposition.  For

instance,  if  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  allowed himself to be tied up and  put  in  a

trussed luggage, after 12 years, when it is opened,  he

would still be there bound and gagged - not like the last

time. It is a different proposition. One of these days,

through sheer lack of expertise, instead of pulling out

the rabbit from the top hat, the Member for Queenstown

might  be  pulling out a serpent which might  bite  him

mortally.  So  you  see,  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a

different  kettle of fish. It is not Lim  Yew  Hock  or

Chew  Swee  Kee  that you are meeting.  We  do  not  do

foolish things. We have seen the props and we make sure

that  before  the  magician performs, we  first  remove

them. Then we ask him to pull



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



out  the  white  rabbit, but there is no  assistant  to

first put in the rabbit. So the magician is left on the

stage  with  the spotlight on him, but no white  rabbit

comes out, and the audience want their money back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the trouble with the Barisan Sosialis now. We

have  been  through the whole gamut  for  a  long  time - 1953,  1954, Fajar, national service. King  George  V

Park, and students beaten up. I have been through  all

this, Sir. Once in the middle of camping in the Chinese

High  School, they turned up in the early hours of  the

morning - one  boy  had been scalded and  he  fainted - and

asked me what to do. I was their legal adviser and  not

their  medical adviser. So I told them it  was  a  very

risky  business. They did not want to take him  to  the

General  Hospital, because  other  parents  would  get

excited  and  take  their  kids  home.  But  they  were

resourceful  people and undoubtedly children  of  great

promise. So they took him to Youngberg Hospital to keep

the whole matter quiet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, we do know how these things are run and we

do  know  how these things are done. I can  assure  the

Member for Anson that the last thing we will allow  the

police  to  do  is  to interfere with young  kids  with

batons, bullets or fire hoses. But I will tell you what

we  will do to them if they keep on doing nasty  things

like throwing bottles into examination halls - which I am

told  happened on Thursday last week. They  might  know

that  in  Italy they have discovered a form  of  powder

called  itching  powder which is very effective,  I  am

told, against Communist demonstrators when they pose in

revolutionary postures and clench their fists. A  cloud

opens  over  them  and then they disperse  to  riotous

laughter.  Instead  of  being  figures  to  be  pitied,

martyred   and  pilloried  because  they  are   broken,

drenched, beaten and carried to hospital, they  scratch

furiously and run for their lives.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Government seems to be suffering from

laughing here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would tell the Member for

Anson  that I am grateful to him - and to his successor - because  he  opened Pandora's Box and  I  watched  with

great  amazement at what came out of it. Therefore  for

me,  Sir,  there are no more surprises. He had  charted

the  course  and  all the landmines  blew  up.  I  knew

exactly  where they were and I knew who put them  there

and  how  they blew up. It is not my intention  to  let

this  Government go and trigger off any  landmine.  For

that  reason,  I  told the Member for  Anson  just  now

during  the  adjournment - to salve his  conscience - that

whichever way this House voted, it is our duty  to  the

police  and to the people of Singapore to see that  the

police  are  not  drawn  into  an  incident  in   which

sympathies must naturally go to young students. And  so

try  what  they will, do what they want, they  are  not

going  to find this Government a lame and sitting duck.

The fact of the matter is that they have learnt nothing

new.  They are performing the same old turns with  this

one difference, that every time the prop is supposed to

be  there to pass something, the spotlight, instead  of

being on the juggler, is on the prop, so that everybody

can  see  that he is passing something over. Hence  the

difficulty  of the Member for Queenstown, and  more  so

the difficulty of the chaps really advising the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me add, Mr Speaker, Sir - I do not know what

prompted  the  parents  - but I  was  informed  by  the

newspapermen  that as a result of the almost  unanimous

support  of the Assembly to protect the free  right  of

egress and ingress of the Member for Bukit Panjang, the

parents  were  annoyed that the Assembly had  acted  so

promptly  in  defence of the rights of its own  Members

and  left  the parents, who were ordinary  people,  not

leaders  and  representatives, to fend for  themselves.

For  that  reason,  they sought out  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  because  he  was  the  man  who   drew   the

publicity.  This House came to his rescue and  we  were

sufficiently encouraged by the way in which the Barisan

Sosialis  voted  on  that  occasion  to  believe   that

suddenly they had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



become supporters of righteous, orderly behaviour and

proper conduct. But I do not know whether it was really

intended, because from the tener of the speeches that

day, I think we were all most delightfully surprised

when the Division came, because having strenuously

fought against the motion, they then voted for it. Sir,

imagine our disappointment when, in defence of the

rights of parents, we asked the motion to be debated,

they refused permission. I am told, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that when they voted for the motion, they incurred the

displeasure of quite a number of their important people

who decide these matters. First, the Member for Hong

Lim, who is an extremely experienced person in these

matters, by his wise act became the only defender of

the Chinese students against the Parliamentary

Secretary, and the Barisan Sosialis joined the wicked

colonial forces in wishing to lock up the Chinese

students. I think that must have been a factor which

weighed in the minds of those who decide in the Barisan

Star. And so when it comes to the second motion which

is more important - not the right of access for a

representative of the people, the Member for Bukit

Panjang, but for ordinary men and women, parents with

kids who want to go in and sit for examinations - they

who are supposed to champion the rights of the people

are extremely reluctant to provide police protection.

The last time it was not police protection. Mr

Speaker, Sir. The motion called for the police to take

action against the culprits according to the law as

laid down by the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges) Ordinance and 11 ayes - two were discreetly

absent; they were talking in the Chamber but when the

Division was taken, they were absent -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Prime Minister

should make these allegations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am speaking on facts. All I

was drawing attention to - and I did not want to condemn

all the 13 Members; it would be unfair - is that 11 voted

for the motion in support of law and order, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



two, the Member for Nee Soon and the Member for Upper

Serangoon, were absent although they spoke on the

debate. So I wanted to clear them -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister used the

word "discreetly" which I think is unfair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Perhaps I should not allow my subconscious to influence

me in these matters. What I meant was that they were

conspicuously absent when their names were called out.

I remember distinctly that the Minister for Health was

indiscreet enough to shout, "Absconded!", much to the

discomfiture of the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Prime Minister

should take advantage of the leniency of the Chair by

bringing in all these jibes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All I wanted to say was that the

parents were encouraged by the voting on the motion, in

defence of the rights of free passage for Assemblymen,

to seek the support of our Assembly to give them some

rights. But it would appear that they were wrong in

assuming that the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are as

jealous of the rights of parents and students as they

are of their own rights as Assemblymen. However, be

that as it may. I hate to believe that anyone in

Singapore would take seriously the allegation made by

the Member for Queenstown - that the Government wants to

maintain tension, and wants a bloodbath and a riot, and

in the course of the riot, political opponents can

disappear. Sir, I can give them no such comfort

whatsoever. I have explained this to my former

Parliamentary Secretary at great length in the days

before he took such a precipitate step. In the compound

of Singapore there is a lion, albeit a bit old and

ageing, and there is a tiger that is young and virile,

and there is an Alsation dog, i.e. the P.A.P.

Government. And there is a fox running around -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Prime  Minister just now mentioned that I  had  several

talks  with  him  before I parted with  him.  I  cannot

recall saying anything about a lion or an Alsation  dog

in our conversations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a point of elucidation,

but  never mind. Obviously at that time, because of the

late night sittings and so on on 20th July, he may  not

have been compos mentis. But I distinctly remember, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that when analysing the situation,  there

was the Internal Security Council. There was a lion,  a

tiger,  and  an  Alsation dog. But in  the  compound  a

cunning fox had been spotted. And the lion said to the

Alsatian  dog, "Go chase it and bite it." The  Alsation

dog looked at the lion and said, "Well, I don't like to

eat foxes. You like it. You had better chase it and eat

it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, Mr Speaker, Sir, the wishful thinking of

those   who  compose  the  line  for  the  Member   for

Queenstown  just  would not come  through.  It  is  not

possible,  because the P.A.P. is not that  foolish.  He

ought  to  read  what  his own member  of  the  Central

Executive Committee, Mr Fong Swee Suan, said. Whatever

he  thinks  may be the faults and deficiencies  of  the

revisionists  in  the P.A.P., and  whatever  Mr  Devan

Nair's  shortcomings  or my shortcomings,  we  do  know

something  about these matters. We do spend  some  time

analysing and thinking things out. We do know what  has

happened  in  the past and why they have happened.  So,

when  confronted  with  the  situation,  we  sum  up  a

reality, not a fantasy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the fox cannot run, Mr Speaker, Sir,It is a

closed  compound, as I have said, with  three  powerful

forces  contained  in  it.  Of  course,  all  want  the

Alsatian dog to go and run for the fox, but foxes  have

a  nasty  way of biting back, and Alsatian dogs usually

are brought up domesticated. We are men of peace, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir. We like to talk and argue. We do not like

all  this bloodbath and violence. And I can explain  to

them  that  if a bloodbath and a riot takes place - as  I

have   explained   in  my  attempts  to   clarify   the

situation - then  they  meet in a collision  with  final

authority.  As  far as I am concerned, I  am  only  the

penultimate authority, Mr Speaker, Sir, I can give the

order. My colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, can

give  the  order for the police to act. It is  doubtful

whither  he  can even give the order to 817 members  of

the Singapore Infantry Regiment, because there is joint

control. The British pay half for it. And so there will

be  an argument. Supposing the British do not like  the

troops to be used, then there will be an order,  and  a

counter   order,  and  it  is  doubtful  who  has   the

authority. But I can assure them that there are  25,000

troops in and around Singapore under the command of the

G.O.C.,  Singapore, and the G.O.C., Malaya. And  I  can

assure  them,  too, that some of these  men  have  been

receiving proper training in the Congo, ft you can deal

with the Congolese situation, I say there is no trouble

at  all - I mean in 1955-56 there was no trouble at  all.

So I urge them to pass this to the chaps who settle the

Barisan  line - "Don't do foolish things in anticipation

of  the P.A.P. doing foolish things." The P.A.P. never

does  a  foolish  thing.  [Interruption]  We  hope  so.

Anyway, we spend our time calculating. If we do make  a

foolish miscalculation, then we have to pay for it,  as

no  doubt others have made miscalculations and will  in

good  time,  when the day of reckoning comes,  have  to

settle.  But  that is their problem.  We  give  advice,

generally well meaning and well intended. If it is  not

accepted,  what can we do? But I will say this:  forget

this bloodbath. Our line is the line of peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among the nursery rhymes that they have coined,

not those that the kids have coined, Sir, these jingles

are  quite  cunning.  It  is  not  as  simply  as  that

suggested by the Member for Anson - "Khoon choy"  means

"entering  the  coffin", no. There is quite  a  cunning

play  on  words - alliteration. They  have  little  words

jingled. Like the Member for Bukit Panjang, his name is

Lee Khoon Choy, which means something good. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



they  change  it to "Chun Ch'ai", which means a  fool.  Then

they  say, "Chin Kwan Ch'ai" which means "enter the coffin".

And so the jingle goes on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I figured in these jingles too. I have been accused of

selling  out  peace, Mr Speaker, Sir. I  was  reading  the

jingle.  This  is all properly recorded and documented.  And

part  of  the honour that I have received of being mentioned

in  their despatches is having sold out peace. Sir, I do not

know how I could have sold out peace that did not belong  to

me  in the first place. It belongs to all mankind. Sir, when

the  Commission of Inquiry sits, one of the things  I  would

like  to  ask  the student leaders who have got these  songs

circulated is this: "How is it that I owned peace? How did I

sell  it out? To whom did I sell it?", and so on. And I will

say  this:  the  cards  have already been  distributed.  The

stakes have been called, the chips are down. And the way  we

calculated  those cards. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  have  played

peacefully  from  beginning to end. If we do  not,  we  must

perish.  We know that. If we bring the police into this,  we

lose.  Why should we beat up our own children, kill Chinese

education and culture? Why should we? On whose behalf?  What

for?  The  Minister  for  Education  asked  the  Member  for

Queenstown, where did his kids go to school, and  he  wanted

to explain but he never had a chance. But never mind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My children speak better Mandarin than

even you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, that is my misfortune, Mr

Speaker, Sir. That is why I have to expend such a tremendous

amount of energy and effort to try and imbibe a culture  and

civilisation  which  is  part of my heritage,  but  which  a

colonial education denied me. Hence the effort that is made.

He  knows  the effort. Unlike his children who are fortunate

in  having  a father who has given them such great qualities

as  linguists,  I have to do it the hard way,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir.  But  is  that  proof that I want  to  destroy  Chinese

culture and education?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell them what is their problem - the situation is

too  cold.  That  is  what is wrong. You cannot  get  people

excited on bogus issues. Who decided 4-2? Let us go  to  the

genesis  of it all. The P.A.P. Government wanted to  destroy

Chinese  culture and education? Ask the former Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education. He was defending 4-2  when  my former Parliamentary Secretary, at a meeting  of

Parliamentary  Secretaries in which the Member  for  Queens-town  was present, attacked him for his lack of explanation.

Let  us  be honest. Let us not hide behind - say one thing  in

private  and another in public. Who decided 4-2? The P.A.P.?

No. It was decided when the motion was already launched.  If

they  did not like it - I went down on Teachers' Day, was  it

the third?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Fifth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Fifth, and told the Chinese

educationists that it was theirs to decide - 3-3, 4-2, have it

any  way. I do not understand Chinese education as  well  as

they do. I never went to a Chinese school. I just learned my

Chinese the hard way, after I became an adult. I am sorry if

it  is  not good enough, but I am still trying, Mr Speaker,

Sir. But they decided it. They wanted 4-2. We did not decide

4-2.  We could have gone back to 3-3, and we made the offer,

"Stick  to 3-3." Whom are they fighting? Where is the united

front  of non-Communists, crypto-Communists, and Communists,

versus  whom? Versus the colonialists? No. They are  out  of

it. They are smart. They leave this to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry to have to rise on a point of

order. I am hoping for the voting to be taken tonight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do rise to point out that the Member for

Queenstown  was  stopped because he was  discussing  Chinese

education  and  he seemed to be meandering  between  Chinese

education and Communism. Can we not get on with this motion?

I would like the voting to be taken tonight.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was thinking that possibly the Prime

Minister  was going further and further away  from  the

motion. And the Member for Queenstown was stopped as he

was going into too much detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In the nature of things, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  once  you  allow  a  Member   to   make

allegations,  you  must expect, as a matter  o  course,

that they have to be answered even if in passing. But I

can  assure  the Member for Anson that the voting  will

take place tonight, because the Leader of the House has

told me that he intends to lift Standing Orders to  see

that this motion goes through.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Good!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So, Mr Speaker, Sir, we try to

oblige whenever we can. We are not like the Member  for

Anson,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir. We  try  to  reconcile  the

reconcilable.  What  is  not reconcilable,  we  do  not

attempt  to reconcile, if I may, Mr Speaker, tell  you

from my experience what I think is irreconcilable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you form a Communist united front to fight the

nationalists  and you keep on telling the  people.  "We

are  fighting the colonialists", but, in fact, you  are

banging at the nationalists, then they are not sticking

out  their  jaws for you to bang. After a  while,  what

they  have  said on the posters and what they  know  in

their  minds  do  not  reconcile themselves.  They  are

fierce  slogans,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  all  these  little

strips  of coloured paper which you see but perhaps  do

not  understand.  They are fierce words - destruction  of

Chinese  culture,  education, unreasonableness  of  the

Government - fierce  traditional  slogans,  a   rallying

cause, battle cries for Chinese students since 1945.  I

knew  it. The Member for Anson knew it. The Member  for

Cairnhill  went through it. And you will remember  the

great  trials and tribulations he had. He had to excuse

himself every few minutes from this Chamber. But let us

not  pretend that these things do not exist.  they  do

exist.  The Member for Cairnhill knows that. The Member

for Anson does know. And what we say is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



this:  we  learned  from him at  his  expense.  We  are

grateful.  If  we  had not learnt, we would  have  made

similar stupid mistakes. The reason why we are debating

and  not rioting is that we have not allowed the police

to  be  an excuse for an incident. Whatever happens  to

this  motion, be it accepted unanimously by this House,

by  the Opposition, we will not allow the police to  be

the  cause  for  an incident. We will give  protection,

yes, but in a manner which will never open them to  the

slightest chance of being implicated in an incident. We

have  been  through  all that and we  do  not  want  it

anymore. Let me say to those adults to whom the  Member

for  Anson has referred - as I have said, there is a lion

and  there  is a tiger. The lion may be old. His  claws

may  be  a  bit hard and corny, and his teeth may  have

lost their bite. The tiger is young and virile, but  is

not  a man-eater, Mr Speaker, Sir. The lion is a  man-eater. And they went into the Barisan Sosialis thinking

they  were-going to fight the lion, quite oblivious  of

the fact that the lion was too wily, and had hopped off

and left behind the tiger. And now they say, "Down with

the lion!" But the lion says, "Yes, that is right. I am

already  out. Here is the newcomer. Face him!" What  do

we hear in this House? A bouquet. Mr Speaker. Sir. You

have  heard  it. I was surprised. I was not  here,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, or I would have interjected to  ask  the

Member  for Nee Soon to repeat it again. He is  one  of

the  most  intelligent of all the thirteen Assemblymen.

In  fact, I would say, "For I.Q. I give him the fullest

number  of marks." He was always the Secretary  at  our

Parliamentary meetings. He kept very good  minutes.  He

noted all the points in case -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> On a point of order. Mr

Speaker, Sir, r wonder whether this has anything to  do

with  the main motion. It seems that the Prime Minister

is repeating what he has said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am inclined to agree that the Prime

Minister is probably being repetitive, if that  is  the

right word. Perhaps he could now bring his speech to a

conclusion.

I  have to explain this to them. But they did not grasp

the  essentials of the problem. They thought they  were

going  to  fight  me, Mr Speaker, Sir,  and  chase  me

around. I mean, with 817 troops, what could I do? I was

not  even in proper command of the troops. I explained

at  Hong  Lim and Fullerton Square that if you want  to

take -on final authority, then count me out. And I  say

to  these adults that the way they are going, they will

be taking on final authority sooner or later. When that

happens, I have not the slightest doubts in my own mind

what  the  outcome  will be. I am quite  convinced  and

certain of this. We as an elected democratic government

should  always  talk  peacefully,  act  peacefully  and

persuade people peacefully.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have explained with the aid of

metaphors.  I am not as good as the Member  for  Anson.

because I have not the command of lurid metaphors, like

chicken pox. It frightens me. Mr Speaker, Sir,I  have

a  horror  for disease. But, nevertheless, what  I  was

trying  to explain with the aid of animals was to  show

that we are looking for that fox. We know he is around.

We  -have a shrewd idea which o the three hiding places

he  could be in. We do not intend to put our snout into

those hiding places, because that is the surest way  to

get a nasty snap! But we know that the tiger has got  a

way to scratch these hiding places open. It is a matter

of time. The day of reckoning must come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> So you do not know?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, we do. There are three hiding

places, and there is one fox. So you can put your  nose

say, we talk peacefully, we act peacefully, we persuade

peacefully - always  peacefully.  To   the   Member   for

Queenstown, to all his thirteen - I myself never  thought

person just too much!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It appears to me, from the levity which

appears to be coming from the Government benches,  that

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, anyone who wishes to see

peace,  law  and order in this State of  ours  and  who

wishes Singapore to move towards progress will feel, in the  present  state of things today on the  subject  of

Chinese Middle School students, that this matter cannot

be  treated lightly. Especially, Mr Speaker, when this

matter  is  something which has happened  in  Singapore

before,  as  has  been explained by the Prime  Minister

himself.  We  have  all witnessed  this  previously.  A

problem  has arisen now, and in the minds of the  great

majority of the people who do not wish to see  all  the

past  incidents  being repeated, they  are  asking  why

there have been no steps or action taken to prevent  a

recurrence. From the public point of view, this  matter

is  no  longer a matter of educational policy  but  has

developed   into   a  political  issue.   Many   people

appreciate the difficulties that would be faced by  the

Government in consequence of any action taken with  all

its reactions and repercussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, Mr Speaker, from past experience of the

question  of security, the members performing the  task

of  maintaining law and order in this country  comprise

mainly Malays. So a clash between the student examinees

and the picketers, if the police were to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



resort  to any action without taking into consideration

its  reaction, would cause a further clash and  become

more  dangerous.  So I rise here, Mr  Speaker,  hoping

that  this  House will consider this matter  carefully.

All  elected  Members especially should  consider  this

matter seriously without any consideration of political

rivalry, and think in terms of peace and good order  of

the State, so as to prevent any unpleasant incidents as

much  as  we  could.  I, therefore, fully  support  the

motion  moved  by  the Government, as  amended  by  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park, so that  this  House  could

afford protection to those who voluntarily wish to take

the  examinations conducted by the Govermnent. This  is

our  responsibility  in the face  of  the  difficulties

Government  is  facing. I believe. Mr  Speaker,  that

every elected representative of the people of Singapore

must realise his or her responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to speak at length. Originally I was

reluctant  to participate in this debate,  but  in  the

interest  of  Singapore, we must oppose  anything  that

would lead to the destruction of democratic practice in

Singapore.   Therefore,  Mr  Speaker.   I   speak   in

wholehearted  support of the motion and  the  amendment

moved to it by the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>6.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  were told that our youths have been manipulated  by

evil men - by Communists. I was very disappointed, in fact disgusted, Sir, to see the Government, especially

the Prime Minister, treat this question and this motion

with  such levity. You yourself have remarked on  that,

Sir,I have never seen the Prime Minister so happy  and

so  joyful.  In  fact, he was so tickled  that  he  was

giggling  like  a  teenage girl. I was surprised,  Sir.

This  motion is so serious that I wonder how  he  could

ever  have brought himself to that pitch of rejoicing.

I  have  never seen him show a greater sense of  humour

than  he  has  shown today. I hope, Sir, as responsible

Members of this House, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



could  debate a serious question seriously,  especially

when  it involves the safety of our youths. Our  youths

are  being  used  by  Communists  and  manipulated   by

Communists, and here we are laughing away at it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this boycott and this picket is an important

question. On its own, it is an important question.  But

it  has  become more important by the added information

we have had from the Government that there are evil men

and  Communists manipulating them. If this is the case,

Sir,  then  why has the Government allowed  nearly  one

week,  I  think, to go by before it thought  of  doing

anything seriously? It has not done anything at all  to

try  to  put  a  stop  to  it immediately.  I  say  the

Government has not done anything. Look at it, Sir. What

difference  was  there between  the  last  day  of  the

examination  and  the  first day? Children  were  still

prevented from going into the examination centres. Just

as  many  picketers were still there.  Everything  that

took place on the first day took place on the last day.

What has the Government done, Sir, during that week  to

put  a  stop  to it, knowing that these picketers  have

been  influenced  and  have been manipulated  by  these

so-called  Communists or evil men? What has been  done

to  stop it? Sir, it looks like the Government was  not

prepared  to  take  any definite  or  serious  step  to

protect children and parents until this House gives its

support. Is this delay really necessary, Sir? As far as

I  can remember, the Prime Minister in July 1959,  said

in Hansard, Vol. 11. No. 6, col. 373:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the business of a government is to govern and we

have  the mandate to govern. What is more, we  had  the

courage  to pm down what we intended to do  and  had  a

clear  mandate  on it, unlike Members on  the  opposite

side.'.



<br><br>And  what  is  happening today, Sir? Why  do  they  not

govern?  A  mandate  has been given  to  them.  Is  the

mandate no longer sufficient now? I am sure. Sir, it is

not  the  Alliance Opposition that they are  frightened

of, because they know that we always support any proper

move  that aims at maintaining law and order. I am sure

they  can  be assured of that. Could it be the  Barisan

Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



that  they  are so afraid of? They are so  afraid  that

they  dare not take action to protect the students  and

the  parents  from being manipulated by the  Communists

without  the consent of the Barisan Sosialis?  Had  the

P.A.P. handled the matter efficiently right  from  the

very  beginning,  it would not have  developed  into  a

serious national crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although experts of parliamentary democracy have

stated  that  it is the job of the Opposition  to  show

that  they can do better than the Government, they have

never  failed to stress that the interests of the State

should  always be the first concern of both parties - the

Government  and the Opposition. But we have seen,  Sir,

that both the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis have  not

only  disregarded,  but  have actually  sacrificed  the

interests  of  the  students and their  parents  in  an

attempt to show that one is better than the other. Sir,

the  question where the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis

are  concerned is not which is the better Party. Today,

if you go out on the streets, Sir, the popular question

is:  which is the worse Party? The Barisan Sosialis  or

the  P.A.P.?  The  answer  is obvious,  Sir.  Both  are

equally  destructive, as is clearly manifested  by  the

way  a  matter of utmost urgency and importance,  i.e.,

the safety of our youth, is being exploited by both the

Barisan  Sosialis and the P.A.P. to promote  their  own

political  interests. Both are unashamedly using  young

innocent  students  to fight out the  political  battle

between the two political Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government has become so weak that they

dare  not take steps to protect the youth of our  State

without the Opposition sharing the responsibility, then

why  did  they  not  bring  the  motion  to  the  House

immediately  the trouble started so that  the  children

would   have   been   spared   one   week   of   agony?

Alternatively,   why   did  they   not   postpone   the

examination?  They refused to postpone the examination.

Sir, you remember I asked whether it could be done, and

they   refused   to  do  it  because   postponing   the

examination means admitting defeat. So to keep  up  the

P.A.P. prestige, pride and probably complex,  children

and parents have to be subjected to one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



week  of  physical  and  mental  agony.  Sir,  if   the

Government  claims  that there are Communists,  and  if

this is true, then it is their duty to fight and arrest

them as soon as possible and not leave the students and

parents   to  do  the  fighting  for  them.  Why   must

Government  knowingly allow the Communists to  continue

using  the  students instead of putting a  stop  to  it

immediately, even if it means temporarily  halting  the

examination and probably also hurting the pride of the

P.A.P. Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our youth must not be used to pay the price for

maintaining  P.A.P. prestige  with  their  poor  young

innocent bodies and one year of their life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have on many occasions ridiculed the

Member  for Cairnhill and have always hinted,  directly

or  indirectly, at his so-called folly  of  - I  do  not

quite  remember  the  words,  but  they  are  to   this

effect - putting the subversive Communists  in  gaol  and

using  the police to stop student riots at the cost  of

his  Party suffering a defeat at the last election. But

the  P.A.P. forgets, Sir, that the Member for Cairnhill

will  forever  be remembered as the man who  sacrificed

his  personal and his party interests for the  good  of

Singapore.  Can the P.A.P. claim this? What  have  they

done? They have sacrificed the safety and the interests

of  the  youth of this country to promote the interests

of  their  Party. The Government is now  hiding  behind

angry  parents  of  candidates to fight  against  these

student pickets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not trying to talk about the blood-bath and

all that, as what other people have been talking about,

trying  to threaten or trying to bring about commotion;

but  I do want to ask the Government whether they  have

ever given this matter serious consideration. Have they

ever  given  thought to the horrible scenes that  could

have  taken  place  if parents of the student  pickets,

angered  by  the treatment dealt to their  children  by

parents  of  the candidates, had decided  to  retaliate

even  if  the  pickets were at fault?  You  know,  Sir,

parents  are  inclined  always  to  think  that   their

children are right. If they had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



decided  to  retaliate,  had Government  ever  given  a

thought  to what ugly scenes might have arisen? Because

which parent would stand by and watch their teenage son

being  attacked, probably by a big hefty adult, without

becoming  emotionally  aroused?  Could  the  Government

guarantee  that none of the angry parents of the  1,900

candidates would ever be so angry as to attack  any  of

the  student  pickets in fighting for entry  for  their

candidate  sons?  Could the Government  guarantee  that

this  would not happen? And should a few angry  parents

of  candidates be so tactless as to attack some of  the

pickets before the eyes of their parents, would it  not

be possible that this might end up with a clash between

the  parents of candidates and the parents  o  students

pickets? Sir, the P.A.P. Government should go  down  on

their  bended knees and thank their gods - if  they  have

any  - that there has been no clash between the  parents

of  candidates and the parents of student pickets.  And

God forbid that it should ever happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not trying to advocate using police force on

students, but as this motion before the House is asking

for  police  protection for students, Sir, I  ask  this

question: Right from the very beginning, would  it  not

have been safer to use cool-headed, unbiased, and well-trained  police officers, over whom the Government  has

full control, to protect the students and their parents

rather   than   use  angry  parents, who   have   been

emotionally roused and over whose temper and  behaviour

the Government has no control whatsoever, into fighting

the  pickets?  What guarantee has the  Government  that

these parents would not lose their heads and get beyond

control, especially if they should come to a clash with

parents of the student pickets? Could this not lead  to

scenes of unprecedented ugliness? Why should the  whole

State  be open to this risk just to maintain the  pride

and  the  popularity  of  the  P.A.P.  Government?  The

P.A.P.'s  argument, Sir, that had they used the  police

to protect the students, there would have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



a  riot  does not hold water any more, Sir. Because  if

that  is  the  case,  then  why  are  we  sitting  here

considering  whether we should give the Government  the

green  light  to use the police force to  provide  this

protection?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, may I ask, it the purpose of bringing this

motion  into  this House? Let us not give  the  Barisan

Sosialis  more  credit  than they  deserve.  I  do  not

believe that it is Only when the Barisan Sosialis  give

their  consent  to  the Government to  use  the  police

force,  can the police be used without causing a  riot.

They are not as important as all that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this trouble is the result of Government's

failure  to  get  the education policy through  to  the

Chinese  school  students is  undeniable,  Sir. In  my

opinion,  had  the  Prime Minister  taken  the  trouble

during his two months' leave (I stand corrected  as  to

the  number  of  months)  to  explain  to  the  Chinese

students Government's education policy, he might,  Sir,

with  his  intelligence and his eloquence and power  of

speech,  have succeeded in persuading all the  students

to  accept  the policy, and the Communists  would  then

have  been deprived of this opportunity of manipulating

our  students, and our students would have  been  saved

all the trouble that is taking place today, it is still

not  too  late, Sir, if the Government would  agree  to

postpone  the  examination, and in the  meanwhile  make

another effort to explain the education policy  to  the

misguided students and to expose the aims of  the  evil

manipulators. Government probably will be preventing  a

lot of future trouble and misery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are lots of things about this education

policy which many of us do not know. I myself have just

discovered   something  new  from   the   Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education, and I am  much

obliged to him. I am sure many of the students  are  in

the  same position. There are lots of things which they

do  not  know and they are under a misapprehension.  If

that misapprehension could be cleared, probably the air

would  be  cleared. Moreover, Sir,  it  is  fairer  to

students  to  take  the examination under  more  normal

conditions. The onus.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



is on the Government to provide a quiet and peaceful

atmosphere and environment for students to take the

examination. This delay, Sir, will give time, as I have

said before, for tempers to subside, nerves repaired

and common sense restored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I learn that the professional examination of the

T.T.C. has to be postponed in order to give way to the

supplementary examination of the Chinese school

students. I do not see sense in that, Sir. The T.T.C.

professional -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us not debate that, because

that is really far away from the motion we are

debating.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, it is Government's duty to

educate children and not to fight them or use them to

fight their battles. I agree, Sir, that no effort must

be spared to bring the real culprits to book. But the

poor misguided children must not be used to catch these

culprits or to pay for the sins of the Government.

Something must be done at once to save the children

from the evil manipulators. Sir, every single day that

these children are allowed to be used by these evil

manipulators, be they Communists or otherwise, is

another day of P.A.P. failure. The sooner it is

stopped, the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Minister for Education, there has

been a victory for

the Government over the evil men (to quote him) who

tried to use misguided students to cover their sinister

operations. He said, Sir, that the evil mainpulators

had been reduced to a state of impotence

and frustration. Let us face the naked truth. Sir, no

matter how unpleasant and humiliating it may be to the

P.A.P. Government. The public must know the truth. Has

there been a victory for the Government and a defeat

for the manipulators? Let us analyse the situation. I

suppose the Government will agree with me that it was

the Government's intention that all the students should

benefit by the 4-2 system of Chinese secondary schools,

and that it was the intention of the evil manipulators

that they should not. I am sure the Government will

agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



to that. But what is the situation today? Hundreds of

students who have picketed have lost one year of their

life. They are now bitter against the Government. The

State has lost one year's expenditure on the students

who have wasted their one year's education. Those who

are young enough to take the 4-2 examination next year

and could have taken it this year, but did not, will

cost the State one year more of expenditure. The

candidates who had to do their examinations amidst

noise, confusion, fear, worry and fights probably have

suffered. Have any of the Chinese children benefited?

Have the picketers benefited? Who has benefited? Whose

intention was it that they should suffer - the

Government's or the evil manipulators'? Who has won the

battle, Sir? Who have been reduced to a state of

importance and frustration? It looks as if the

Government has been, Sir - so frustrated and so impotent

that they need the moral support of the Opposition

before they would dare exercise the power vested in

them to carry out their duty. Although the pickets

might have melted away, Sir, the Government need not

run away with the idea that they have won the fight,

for I say that a man convinced against his will is of

the same opinion still. May I ask, "Have they convinced

the students -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we are debating as

Government have won. That is all. I do not think we

should go into details of this nature.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said

just  now, I maintain that the Government has  not  won

the  battle. The evil manipulators seem to have got the

better  of the Government. May I ask what is  the  next

step?  What is Government going to do to see that  they

win  the  battle eventually? I think this House  has  a

right  to  know, because, as I said, we feel  that  the

Government has not won the battle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the parents of the candidates - many of them

must have voted for the PAP, in the last election - voted

the  P.A.P, into power, they expected to be protected.

Have  they  been protected? When their children  needed

protection, they had to do the fighting. They were left

to  protect their own children. Is this what they voted

the P.A.P. into power for?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we the Alliance would rather take the blame and,

if  necessary,  lose another election than  expose  the

youths of Singapore to danger and to leave them at  the

mercy of evil manipulators and the Communists. We  will

therefore  support the motion as amended, so  that  our

youths and their parents can be protected. I have  said

before,  Sir, and I hope you will permit me  to  repeat

just this, because it is very important, the motion has

indicated   how  Government  intends  to  protect   the

candidates   and   their  parents  from   the   student

picketers,  but  the more important question  is,  what

steps is Government going to take to bring the evil men

to book?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Can we have the assurance that

they would not be shielded as some have been?



<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has tabled this motion

with  the main aim of confusing the minds of the people

on this question of merger. The Government is trying to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



put  the  blame on others to cover up their own faults.

This   is  very  irresponsible  on  the  part  of   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before this House indicates that the

Government is useless, because we know that if there is

a  fight between secret society members, or if there is

some  trouble  at  the  scene of a  strike,  would  the

Government  then  table a motion  before  something  is

done?  This  shows  that the education  policy  of  the

P.A.P. is at fault and, therefore, it should be brought

up  for  review  and discussion. But in order  to  save

their own faces, they have brought up this motion. They

seem  to  be prepared to make use of the police against

the  helpless  and unarmed students. We know  that  the

students are dissatisfied with the 4:2 system,  because

this is a departure from the policy drawn up in 1958 by

the   Urn  Yew  Hock  Government.  We  know  that   the

Government 4:2 education system in the secondary  stage

is  the  same as that in the English schools, that  is,

they take four years to reach -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am trying to avoid a debate on

the  details of the policy. I think the hon. Member  is

correct  in just referring to the policy in passing  to

say that the students are dissatisfied, and that is  as

far as I permitted the Member for Queenstown to go, and

I  think the Prime Minister as well. So let us  not  go

into  detail  as to whether the 4:2 system  is  a  good

system  or  a  bad  system. All we need  know  for  the

purposes of this debate is that the students appear  to

be dissatisfied with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  try  to cut short my speech and explanation.  The

students are dissatisfied with the system because  only

25  per  cent  in the English schools can sit  for  the

H.S.C. examination.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought I had made myself

clear. I do not want a debate on why the students  are

dissatisfied.  The  debate on  this  motion  should  be

confined to the bare statement that the students  are,

in fact, dissatisfied. Once I allow a debate on details

as  to why the students are dissatisfied, then we  will

be going far, far away  from the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is  a  cause as to why this has come about.  The

dissatisfaction  of the students has  arisen  from  the

fear of being eliminated. The standard of education may

be  lowered, because they are being deprived  of  their

six-year  education  in the secondary  stage.  I  think

perhaps the Government is trying to save a lot of money

on education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk about what has been done by the

Ministry of Education in regard to this system. I  have

said  that what has been done is insufficient. The only

thing  is  that the students taking their Secondary  IV

examination will be promoted to Upper Secondary II  and

then  they  will be able to go into the  University  of

Malaya and Nanyang University.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want to appear to be

obstructive.  I have indicated that we cannot  in  this

motion  debate the education policy. All we can  do  in

this particular motion is to say that the students  are

dissatisfied  with  the  education  policy,  and   that

because   they   are  dissatisfied,  there   has   been

picketing. The House is asked to condemn the actions of

those  picketers  and, in response  to  an  appeal,  to

support  any  action by the police to protect  students

and to allow students and parents to

have  free  passage  and access into  and  out  of  all

examination  halls. That motion does not open  out  the

field  for a debate on the education policy.  The  hon.

Member will no doubt have an opportunity of saying what

he  wishes  to  say on the education  policy  when  we

debate  item  13 of the Order Paper which calls  for  a

Commission  to inquire into the Government's  education

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, we are asking the House whether or not

it condemns the action of picketers, whether or not the

House  would  support action by the police  to  protect

students  and  to  give  free  passage  and  access  to

students and parents. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   boycott  has  come  about  as  a  result  of  the

Government's mishandling of the problem. The Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



has not accepted the views of the educational

organisations because the memorandum submitted  by  the

Teachers  Union  of  Chinese  schools  asks  that   the

secondary  education in Chinese should  be  six  years.

This   memorandum  has  received  no  reply  from   the

Government.  The  Government is using pressure  on  the

principals  to  make  them conform  to  its  policy  in

education.  The  principals  of  Chinese  schools  were

called to attend a meeting in the Ministry of Education

and  they  were asked to agree to the 4:2 system.  They

were  not given enough time to discuss this with  their

teachers  and, therefore, they had to agree  with  this

policy under pressure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government has exerted pressure on the

Board  of  Directors to agree to this reform. In  fact,

the  Government  has  called the Directors  of  Chinese

schools for a meeting in the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the Member

is  deliberately misunderstanding the Chair. I  do  not

wish to appear to -be obstructive, but can he tell  the

chair how all this is relevant to the motion, which  is

merely  asking a condemnation of picketers  and  asking

the  House  to  support  Police action?  I  cannot  see

anything relevant in what he has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We read from the

newspapers  that during the boycott over the  past  few

days, there were so many young men, whose identity  was

not known, beating students. But the Government did not

take steps to protect the students. Similarly, we learn

that  on  the  same day a car, with three young  people

inside,  knocked  down  a student,  and  the  car  then

escaped.  I wonder whether the police has taken  action

to protect the safety of students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has arisen as a result of a mistake

made  by  the Prime Minister. During Teachers'  Day  he

declared at a meeting of teachers that the 4:2  or  3:3

system should be decided by the teachers themselves. So

the  students were at a loss not knowing  what  to  do.

They  are waiting for a final decision. The Government,

in order to save their faces, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



rightly promised that those who have failed the

Secondary IV examination may be promoted to higher

classes, but will not be permitted to sit for the Upper

Secondary II examination. This is a contradiction on

the part of the Government. Why should the Government.

on the one hand, allow these people to be promoted, and

on the other hand, refuse them the opportunity to sit

for the higher examination? Why should the Government

not say frankly, "We want to implement the four-year

system. If you fail, then you should not be promoted."?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of order, Sir,If the

Member for Serangoon Gardens like to debate on the

Chinese school system, he will have a chance later on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I think he is going into the

details of the system.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indeed time and time again told

the  Member for Serangoon Gardens that his remarks  are

completely  irrelevant to the motion. I have  indicated

that  he  will  have an opportunity of saying  what  he

wishes  to  say when we come to item 13  of  the  Order

Paper,  which is a motion standing in the names of  the

Member for Anson and the Member for Joo Chiat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

recommend  the appointment of a Commission  to  enquire

into the Government's Education Policy, its content and

administration in all fields other than vocational  and

technical education, and to make recommendations'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the motion on which the Member for Serangoon

Gardens  can  speak, and speak at  length,  on  how  he

thinks   the   Government's  education   policy   needs

revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might again draw attention to Standing Order 54.

which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention  to the conduct of a Member, who persists  in

irrelevance [that is what I think the Member  is  doing

now], ... may direct him to discontinue his speech.'



<br><br>I ask him not to persist in irrelevance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this occurrence has taken place, and -the only solution

to the trouble is, I suggest, for this motion to be

withdrawn. The Government should hear the opinions and

views given by Chinese teachers, principals and

directors. There should be a solution to be discussed

between the Government and the Chinese school

authorities. We must not make use of money, such as the

100 bursaries, to buy over the students.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I will give the hon. Member just

one  more chance. If he persists in this line of debate

then I must ask him to discontinue his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I mention again that we are now debating a motion

which  asks  this  House  to  condemn  the  action   of

picketers,  and which also asks this House  to  support

any  action by the police to protect the students,  and

to  give  the  students and parents  free  passage  and

access  into and out of all examination halls.  I  have

mentioned  time and time again that it is in  order  to

say   that  the  students  are  dissatisfied  with  the

education  policy. That is perfectly in order.  But  if

the  hon.  Member goes into details and tries to  start

debating what that policy is and how it is alleged that

it  is wrong, then that is completely irrelevant. I ask

the Member for Serangoon Gardens to try to be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The solution lies

in   the   postponement  or  the  abolition   of   the

examination.  Therefore, I oppose the motion  moved  by

the Government.



<br><br>7.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, here we

have  a  motion moved on a note of urgency on a serious

matter,  and  here  we  have  today  Members  of   this

Assembly,  in  particular the Prime  Minister,  talking

merrily on the subject and on stories of animals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion is divided into two parts. First of

all,  it  asks the House to condemn the action  of  the

students, and secondly it asks support of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



House  for police action against the students. Sir,  we

have  a Government here, and there is no better example

of a government which is shirking its responsibility, a

government  which refuses to govern. We are now  seeing

in front of us a Government which wants the Assembly to

give it cover for a certain action which it intends  to

take but dare not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir the motion, if accepted, would reduce the

Singapore  Government  to just an  escape  body  taking

instructions from this Assembly. This Assembly would be

like  the  32  men  in  the City Council  with  you  as

President.   And  we  would  have  Standing   Committee

comprising members of all political Parties running the

government  of Singapore, just as a Standing  Committee

of  32 men in the City Council ran the local government

a  few  years  ago. Sir, when the Government  used  the

police  and military personnel against the strikers  or

used   the  police  and  military  personnel  for   the

protection of new workers when the City Council went on

strike, they did not co-me to this House to ask  for  a

vote.  They went under their own steam, and  they  took

the  responsibility of government. I cannot  understand

why,  on this occasion, the Government should come here

and  ask  us for a vote. And that is why, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  they  should  not  use  police  when  there   are

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last week we have almost a similar

motion which also called for police protection against

the students, so that we could defend the privilege of

an Assemblyman. What happened in that motion is that we

would be getting the police to bring the students - or

arrest them if necessary - before the Committee of

Privileges. And if they are guilty -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is what the

motion means. The motion just asks the police. I think.

to take action according to law. I do not think we

should go back to that motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am trying

to  drive  at is that the basic principle  of  the  two

motions is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



about the same, that it calls for police action against

students, which action will lead to trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present atmosphere, it is important for

the Government to reduce whatever tension there is.  By

calling  students  hooligans and by  using  the  police

against  students  would  not  be, conducive  to   the

creation of peace, as what the Prime Minister said just

now.  The  threat of violence or the threat  of  police

action  would  not  reduce tension, but  would  instead

aggravate  the situation and create bitterness  on  all

sides.  Sir,  I  cannot understand why this  motion  is

necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> As we all know, the Middle IV

examinations  were  completed  last  Friday.  I  really

cannot understand why the Government did not defer its

supplementary  examinations until a  calmer  atmosphere

prevails.  And  why  it should insist  on  having  the

supplementary examinations immediately after the Middle

N  examinations are completed, and coming to this House

asking  it  to  give protective cover  for  any  police

action  it  might intend to take, not on this  occasion

but on future occasions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has said that between two-thirds

and  three-quarters of the students  have  taken  their

examinations. Only a fraction is left. A few hundred of

the  students have not taken the examination.  That  is

why  I  cannot understand why this motion is necessary.

When  three-quarters of the students have  taken  their

examinations  without  police protection  and  without

police action, why should the Government ask for police

protection when a small fraction is left?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although we oppose this motion, as we opposed the

motion  last Friday, we are confident that the  parents

of  the  students will understand that if there is  any

police  intervention in the supplementary  examinations

or  in the Senior Middle III examinations which are  to

come,  their children might be hurt during any  scuffle

which might ensue. We are confident that without police

intervention, any student who wants to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



take the examination can do so since three-quarters

have already done so. From the newspapers, it seems

that those who are picketing have announced that they

will be picketing peacefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today's debate is not one on the merits or

demerits of the 4 : 2 system versus the 3 : 3 system.

But we hope that these problems will be aired and

resolved during the ensuing debate on item 13 of the

agenda or at the Commission of Inquiry, for which the

Member for Anson has asked and which the Government has

promised. We hope that during the Commission of Inquiry

the merits or demerits of the 4 : 2 system and the 3 : 3 system can be respectively aired and resolved to the

satisfaction of everybody.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has accused the

Government of trying to use the police against the

students and that the Government has abdicated its duty

to govern. May I suggest to him that in trying to be

friends to all and be the champion of Chinese school

students and Chinese education, his efforts will not

be appreciated by the Communists? In fact, they would

only hate him more for trying to pose as a champion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, serious allegations have been made

by  the  Member  for Queenstown that police  have  been

disguised  as  students and parents to assault  student

picketers. I do not wish at this stage to be drawn into

a  lengthy  argument  with the Member  for  Queenstown,

since  there  will be a Commission of Inquiry  and  the

Member   for   Queenstown  no  doubt   will   have   to

substantiate his allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should like the Members of this House to

note that none of the parents and the students who want

to  sit for the examination mask their faces, for  they

have  nothing to be ashamed of or to hide. And it seems

to  be  utterly  foolish  for  the  police  to  assault

students - if such an allegation is true - by going  about

it  openly, to invite identification without taking the

necessary elementary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



precaution of disguising themselves  like  the

student picketers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion flows logically from the

motion  that was approved by this House, including  Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis, on 29th November.  That

motion read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House, taking cognisance of the complaint

on  a  matter of privilege reported to it by the Leader

of  the House, condemns the conduct of the hooligans if

in   fact   such  hooligans  illegally  prevented   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Education,

who  is  the  Member for Bukit Panjang, from  attending

this   meeting  and  discharging  his   duties   as   a

representative of the people, and calls upon the police

to ensure that the culprits are dealt with according to

the  law  as  laid  down  in the  Legislative  Assembly

(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  those  who approved that  motion  cannot logically  disapprove  of the  motion  now  before  the House.  In  fact,  there is more  reason  for  them  to

endorse this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of 29th November related only to the

protection   of  the  rights  and  privileges   of   an

individual Assemblyman. The motion we are now  debating

extends  protection to the ordinary citizens,  in  this

case  parents  and students, to exercise  their  lawful

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly state what the parents have to say on

this  question and whether their appeal for  protection

is  justified. I refer, Sir, to a statement  issued  by

the Preparatory Committee of the Parents Association in

reply  to the President of the Singapore Chinese School

Teachers Union who accused them of asking the police to

be brutal against the students.



<br><br>7.53 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> This statement appears in today's

Nanyang Siang Pau.

The  parents  asked these questions  of  the  Singapore

Chinese School Teachers Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Have the parents no right to enjoy the fundamental

right  of  personal safety which every  citizen  should

have?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the parents committing an offence in bringing

their children to examination centres?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the parents to be deprived of even the right to

appeal  for  police  protection  when  they  and  their

children are subject to obstruction by pickets  and  be

the  targets of brutal assault by stones, mud  and  bad

eggs?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. Could the Minister

inform us whether he is aware of any parent having

suffered a single injury at any time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am

paraphrasing the statement issued by the Parents

Association and I shall come to it later. The parents

continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We believe that the police is a department for the

preservation of peace and good order in a democratic

State. The pickets are not armed. The students who want

to sit for the examination and their parents are also

unarmed. Can anyone deny this fact?'



<br><br>Then  the parents go on to enumerate four instances  of

injury  and assaults by the picketers. In one  case,  a

parent took two parcels of food to his children at  the

Teachers' Training College. He threw the food over  the

fence  to his children. The pickets rushed and  grabbed

the  food  and assaulted the students, with the  result

that  there was a scuffle between the pickets  and  the

parents  who  want  to  the victims'  aid.  Stones  and

bottles, according to the parents, were thrown  by  the

picketers.  Then  the parents also quoted  an  instance

where a 70 years old woman who took her grandson to the

examination centre, had to brave abuses and the pickets

in order to go into the examination centre. She fell as

a result and her leg was broken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what this motion asks is that

no  one should forcefully prevent students who wish  to

take  examinations from doing so. This motion does  not

force those who do not want to take the examinations to

do  so.  All it seeks to do is to protect the right  of

students who want to sit for the examinations  and  the

right  of  parents and guardians to see  that  no  one

prevents their children from taking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



such examinations. In fact, if the boycott is a popular

move  and  has  the  support of  the  majority  of  the

students  and the parents there is no need of picketing

and  human  chains, and the presence of the  police  is

unnecessary.  Or if the picketers indulge  in  genuine,

peaceful picketing, instead of linking arms to  prevent

by  force  students from taking the examinations,  then

the  need of parents to ask for police protection  does

not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is therefore surprising that allegedly responsible political leaders of the Barisan Sosialis should try to confuse this simple issue by

raising  a  hue  and cry about police  brutalities  and

violence  and presenting it as an attempt  to  use  the

Police Force against school children. And I regret, Mr

Deputy  Speaker, that even the Chairman of the  Chinese

Chamber  of  Commerce, who should have more  sense  and

should have been more clear-minded, should have allowed

himself  to  be  fooled  and confused  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What did he say?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I humbly

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order, Mr Marshall?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes. The President of the Chinese

Chamber  of Commerce has been mentioned and abused  for

being a fool for saying what he said. Can we know  what

he  said? I think it is only proper, since he is  being

abused, that we should know what the abuse is about?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. Ms

Ong Pang Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I

refer him to the Nanyang Siang Pau of today's date? May

I  go  on?  I  humbly suggest, Sir, that  the  Barisan

Sosialis,   as  part  and  parcel  of  their  desperate

strategy  to  create  clashes and violent  disorder  in

order to halt merger, have deliberately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



distorted  this motion to mean that we want  to  launch

police  action against picketing students.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, the falsity of this charge can  be  seen

from  the fact that throughout the past week,  we  have

deliberately  refrained from using the  police  against

picketing  students simply because we do  not  want  to

fall  into  the  Communist trap of  trying  to  provoke

clashes  between  school children and the  parents.  We

resisted   doing  this  even  when  picketing  students

illegally  and forcibly assaulted students (who  wanted

to  take  the examination) and their parents.  However,

the  Barisan Sosialis, who on 29th November were  ready

to  condemn acts of hooliganism by picketers against  a

fellow  Assemblyman, and call upon the police to ensure

that   an  Assemblyman's  rights  are  protected,   are

obviously  not  prepared to extend the same  protection

against   hooliganism   to  law-abiding   parents   and

students. Though I fully agree that an Assemblyman must

be   protected  in  the  exercise  of  his  rights  and

privileges,  I think this Assembly should  be  just  as

ready  to  protect the rights of ordinary students  and

citizens  as  well,  otherwise  this  House  would   be

treating Assemblymen as privileged people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, in particular, would, if they

oppose  this motion, be saying we are ready to  protect

the  rights  of Assemblymen because that  involves  our

personal  welfare, but who cares about the rights  and

welfare   of  students  and  parents?  In  a  statement

published  on  1st December in the Straits  Times,  the

Chairman  of  the  Barisan Sosialis declared  that  the

present  motion is a motion to sanction  police  action

against students. The statement went on to say,  and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. is now anxious to use the police to

suppress mounting dissatisfaction. The Barisan Sosialis

strongly  opposes  any attempt to justify  the  use  of

police force against the children of our State. We have

seen enough brutalities and violence perpetrated by the

Lim Yew Hock Government against our children.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a completely distorted statement of the purpose and intent of this motion and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



typical example of the political dishonesty of the  men

who manipulate the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis and

his Assemblymen henchmen. Let me now show, Sir, how  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have distorted  the  spirit  and

intent  of this motion. The motion starts off by asking

the  House  to  condemn  the actions  of  picketers  in

obstructing,   intimidating   or   otherwise   forcibly

preventing students from taking their examinations. Not

even  the Barisan Sosialis can deny that students  have

been  and are being prevented from taking examinations.

Students have not only been obstructed and intimidated,

but force has been used by picketers against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis are not themselves

directly involved in the boycott, they should surely be

ready   to   condemn  the  actions  of   picketers   in

obstructing and intimidating students who want to  take

examinations.  The  students who  wanted  to  take  the

examinations  were not doing anything wrong.  They  did

not even query the right of picketers to stay away from

the  examination. All that the students asked was  that

they should be allowed to take these examinations.  The

Barisan Sosialis, unless they are up to their necks  in

this  Communist  plot to create a clash between  police

and   picketing   school  children,  should   have   no

difficulty   in  condemning  those  who   obstruct   or

intimidate or use force on those who want to take their

examinations. As responsible political leaders, the Barisan  Sosialis  cannot maintain that  those  people  who

intimidate  and  obstruct  students  should   not   be

condemned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the next part of the motion refers to an appeal from parents of students who wish to take these examinations that they and their children should

be afforded police protection -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Count them P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, it is true that parents have

asked  for  police protection for themselves and  their

children. I repeat, Sir, that what this motion asks the

House to do is to approve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



police  protection - and I repeat, police  protection - for

students  and  parents,  not as  the  Barisan  Sosialis

falsely   claims,  to  endorse  police  action  against

students.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And to ensure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The last part of the motion makes

it  amply  clear  that the intention is  not  to  take

action  against peaceful picketing by students  but  to

take  such  action  as  may  be  necessary  to  protect

students wishing to take their examinations, to  ensure

that they are not intimidated or injured, and that  the

students  and  their parents, who accompany  them,  are

given  free  passage and access into  and  out  of  all

examination halls. There is, therefore, no question of

taking  action  against picketers or  breaking  up  the

pickets.  To do so would be to fall into the  Communist

trap.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Oh, Communist semua-yah?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> So long as the pickets do not

interfere   with  the  rights  of  students   to   take

examinations,  so  long  as  they  do  not   intimidate

examinees  or use force against them, and so  long  as

the picketers do not do things to endanger the life and

limb  of people, there can be no question of using  the

police  against  them.  This  motion  merely  seeks  to

prevent  picketers from intimidating or obstructing  or

using violence against examinees and their parents.  If

a hooligan starts beating up an innocent hawker and the

hawker appeals to a policeman for assistance, would the

Barisan  Sosialis  claim that the policeman  was  being

brutal  in not allowing the hooligan to beat the hawker

to  pulp? Yet, that seems to be the stand taken by  the

Barisan  Sosialis  leaders. Any  action  taken  by  the

police  to  see  that  students and  parents  are  not

molested or intimidated by student picketers who are  being manipulated by pro-Communists is, in the eyes  of

the  Barisan Sosialis, an act of brutality, if I  read

the  Barisan  Sosialis'  stand correctly,  it  is  that

picketers  should be allowed a free hand to intimidate

and  use  force against students and parents.  That  to

protect the students and parents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



from such action is brutality. This is not merely logic

gone mad, but politicians gone mad. One can imagine the

kind  of  justice and law that would prevail  under  a

government run by the Barisan Sosialis politicians.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sama juga P.A.P.-lah!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What about your Government?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Same!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Barisan Sosialis followers would be given the constitutional right to beat up those who

disagree  with  them, and any one who  defends  himself

against  such  assault  would  be  charged  with   high

treason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is contended that if we withdraw this motion,

everything  would be all right. It is  our  submission,

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, that if this  Assembly  does  not

approve of such a motion, then the green light would be

given for more intimidation, more obstruction and  more

use  of  force  by picketers against peaceful  and  law

abiding students and parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one week the picketers intimidated and obstructed

students. They grew bolder until they decided that they

would  prevent  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for  Education from coming to this  Assembly.

But within a few minutes of a motion of privilege being

raised  in this House, the students dispersed, and  not

only that, but the day after the motion was passed with

the approval of the Barisan Sosialis, the picketers not

only   did   not  try  to  obstruct  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for  Education,  but  were

extremely polite to the Minister for Education and  his

Parliamentary  Secretary.  In  other  words,  Sir,  the

motion  of 29th November, had a salutary effect on  the

students.  There was no need to give police  protection

to  the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Education,  because  the  fact  that  this  motion  was

endorsed   by  art  overwhelming  majority   vote   was

sufficient  deterrent.  I am  equally  certain  that  a

unanimous  vote for this motion would have  an  equally

salutary effect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



on  the  pickets. But if they are led to  believe  that

some  Assemblymen  would be prepared to  espouse  their

right  to intimidate and use force against parents  and

students, then the pro-Communist elements who are using

these children would egg them on -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Why do you not arrest them?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> - to commit unlawful acts of

intimidation  and  force in the hope  of  precipitating

clashes  between the police and student  picketers.  By

the  stand  the Barisan Sosialis take on  this  motion,

they will make it clear whether they are or are not  up

to  their necks in this plot to use children as  cannon

fodder in their political warfare against merger.  They

will  make it clear whether, being too scared  to  come

into open conflict with the police themselves, they are

ready  to  use little children as a shield  to  protect

themselves.   They  want  to  achieve  their   sinister

political  aims  on  the maimed and injured  bodies  of

school children.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is your view and of the

Special Branch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Anyway, I appeal to their innate

sense  of  decency  not to hide behind  the  skirts  of

school  children. Let them not persist in the  pretence

that  this  motion  is a motion to take  police  action

against picketing students. All that this motion  seeks

to do is to prevent picketing students from using force

and intimidation against parents escorting students  to

examination halls and students who want to  take  their

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant, Sir, that since the Chairman of the

Barisan Sosialis announced his intention to oppose this

motion,  the picketers have picked up courage and  have

renewed  their  picketing  and  intimidation  today.  I

understand that today they picked up enough courage  to

halt  the  car of the Minister for Education and  force

him to walk to his office. I humbly suggest, Sir, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



it was the statement of the Barisan Sosialis which gave

them this new confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Barisan Sosialis leaders egg

picketers  on  to persist in their acts of intimidation

and  show  of force, then the Barisan Sosialis  leaders

are  playing  with  fire  and  with  the  pro-Communist

elements in so far as these sinister men are using  the

children as cannon-fodder in their political game.  Let

it  be made clear now that the Barisan Sosialis leaders

cannot  evade responsibility if, as a result  of  their

reckless  and  dangerous manoeuvres,  they  succeed  in

providing  pro-Communist elements with  a  pretext  for

forcing clashes between school children and the police.

The  Government for its part will not allow the  police

to  come into a clash with school children. Our aim  is

to  come  to grips with the adults who are manipulating

these children.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> All that the Government is asking

this  House to do is to ensure that protection is given

to  parents  and children, and if unanimous support  is

given  to this motion, then, in our view, the picketers

will,  of their own accord, stop intimidating and using

force against parents and students.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification. Would the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs, who  is  responsible  for

security,  inform  this  House whether  he  intends  to

arrest those adults whom he knows to be responsible for

subverting our youths to improper political activities?

Just a simple yes or no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister has answered a similar question raised by  the

hon. Member just now.



<br><br>8.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it would

now appear very clear that every motion that is brought

before this House will be a matter for struggle between

the  P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P., and that the  debate  on

every  motion will be an occasion for each  to  try  to

tear down the other.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a motion of this grave nature, one would have

thought  that  the Government would have presented  the

issues fairly and squarely. Sir, the Minister for  Home

Affairs  said  that  if  the  Government  could  get  a

unanimous  vote  of  this Assembly,  it  would  have  a

salutary  effect on the picketers. Let us  examine  the

way  the Government Benchers are going about trying  to

seek  this  unanimous vote. First and foremost,  doubts

are  cast  on  the  Barisan Sosialis. They  accuse  the

Barisan Sosialis of doing this, that and the other. But

they  appeal to the Barisan Sosialis, "Please  give  us

your  vote.  It  will  have a salutary  effect  on  the

pickets." Sir, even the Prime Minister himself  is  not

free  from blame. Members will remember that  when  the

motion on the question of privileges of a Member of the

Assembly - that  is, the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Education - was discussed in this Assembly a

few days ago, the Barisan Sosialis Members stood up and

spoke  strongly  for  the  rights  and  privileges   of

Assemblymen.  They  were against anyone  who  tried  to

prevent  any  Member  of this Assembly  from  attending

sittings  of  this Assembly and doing his  work  as  an

elected Member of the people.

Barisan  Sosialis voted for a motion in all  sincerity,

the  Prime Minister himself could just laugh  and  say,

"Ha!  They  were caught." Now that is why they  do  not

want  to  be  caught  again. Can we blame  the  Barisan

Sosialis for taking their present stand?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is indeed a watchdog of law and

order and of the security and welfare of the people  of

Singapore.  The Prime Minister in his speech  just  now

likened the P.A.P. Government to an Alsatian dog. I beg

to  submit, Sir, that he has too high an opinion of his

own Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Pariah dog!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> An Alsatian dog is indeed a very

good  watchdog, and I would like to say in  this  House

that  the  P.A.P. Government is not a good  Government.

Therefore, it cannot be a good watchdog. If  the  Prime

Minister is fond of likening himself to a dog,  then  I

would  say  that  the proper description  of  the  P.A.P.

Government would be a mongrel and not an Alsatian  dog.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go on to other matters. I would like to

say  this.  Having been a Member of this  Assembly  for

many  years, and having been the, shall we say foolish

Chief  Minister in the last Government, I  cannot  help

but feel that the debate which is taking place today is

actually  just a replay of what took place in 1956.  At

that time, I was on the other side of the House and our

great  Prime Minister was sitting on this side  of  the

House  as  an  elected representative of the  P.A.P.  I

would  like  to say this - and there is the  Hansard  to

prove it - that the words he uttered are almost the  same

as  those  uttered  by the Member for Queenstown  today

against  his  Government.  If  one  were  to  draw  any

conclusion, one would just say that perhaps the Barisan

Sosialis  (ex-P.A.P.) have learnt very, very well  from

their masters. Now they come out and give back a little

bit  of  the medicine which the P.A.P. when in  the  Op

position gave to the previous Government. But what  the

previous Government did - according to the P.A.P. -  was  a

foolish thing. "The Government fell into a trap." So it

is  now admitted in this Assembly that there was a trap

laid by the P.A.P. for the previous Government. At that

time,  Sir, I was the Chief Minister. I knew that there

were  such political moves being made, but I felt  that

if  a  government wants to govern, it must  govern.  It

must  not take into consideration, in carrying out  its

sacred  duty  of  looking after  the  welfare  and  the

security of the people of Singapore, whether the  Party

will  survive.  The  security and the  welfare  of  the

people  of  Singapore are above the continued existence

of any Party in Singapore and anywhere in the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



So  I  say to them that if they want to claim that they

are  a  good,  strong and responsible  Government  they

should behave like one. Do not come to this Assembly on

a  motion telling us in advance, "We do not want to  do

this.  Last  time the previous Government fell  into  a

trap.  Now this is a trap which we laid but it is  laid

for  us.  Therefore, we do not want to  fall  into  the

trap. Please help us out. If you will all just say yes,

everything will be over." Sir, that is not the  way  to

run  a  government. It is the duty of a  Government  to

govern. It is definitely not the duty of the Government

to  place  the  interests of the  people  of  Singapore

second  to the interests of their own political  Party.

That  will  not give them the right to claim that  they

are a good, clean and honest Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Where is the Government?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I remember, Sir, that even in the

speech  of the Minister for Home Affairs just  now,  he

said,  "Look at the Barisan Sosialis playing  with  the

students." I have no sympathy for the Barisan  Sosialis

in  all  its  attempts to, shall we say, overthrow  the

Government, but what I would like to point out in  this

Assembly is this: what they are accused of doing  today

is  actually what the P.A.P. did when they were in  the

Opposition.  Let  them deny this. The  Government  say,

"Oh,  yes,  we  know there are adults behind  all  this

move."  If  they really know that there are adults  who

are  instigating innocent children and misleading  them

into  behaving in a manner which does not bring  credit

to their schools or to their families, then it is their

duty to bring these instigators to book. If they do not

want  to  do  it, then the less they try to hide  their

weakness by saying that there are men behind all  this,

the  better  for  all concerned. They should  to  their

duty, but if they do not, they should not try to  find

an excuse for their weakness and ineptitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier that the debate that is going on today

appears to be like what happened in 1956, but there is

now a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



change in the dramatis personae. The Prime Minister  is

now  having a dose of his own medicine and he does  not

like it, but then he is trying his best to wriggle  out

of  it,  and in trying to do so, he keeps on  insulting

the  Opposition and then says, "Tolong lah! If  not,  I

mati!"  How can it be like this? What kind of culture

is this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been asked by this Assembly why such a motion

should have been tabled in this House. Well, the  Prime

Minister  made it clear just now - he spent most  of  his

time laughing it off; I do not know why he should treat

a very serious subject as a laughing matter - that he was

out  to trap the Barisan Sosialis, and he charged  that

the  Barisan Sosialis were out to trap him.  I  do  not

know  who is trapping whom. If this is going to be  the

trend  of  debate on every motion in this  House,  then

this  sitting  is  going to be a very,  very  long  and

protracted  affair.  I hope that  the  Members  of  the

P.A.P.,  either present or past, should try to  refrain

from bringing their political war into this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to come to the defence of the

Barisan Sosialis, but I must say this, that having been

in  the government myself, I know it is wrong to  start

accusing  people  of being involved in activities  that

are detrimental to the security of the State and not do

anything about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If it is true that today there are

people  in  the Barisan Sosialis who are involved - as  I

pointed  out that during my time there were  people  in

the  P.A.P. who were involved in subversive activities,

and  we arrested them - then the Government should arrest

these  people, and I am sure that they themselves would

be  only too pleased. "If we are really guilty, pull us

in.  We don't mind going to gaol. But don't just simply

black-list in that way and call us all sorts of names."

When the previous Govern

ment  took  action against subversives in  the  P.A.P.,

what  did  the  Prime  Minister who  was  then  in  the

Opposition - in fact, sitting almost in the same seat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



as  I  am sitting now - do? He stood up and defended them,

and  called the Government all sorts of names. He said,

"These  are  good people. These are comrades  of  mine."

Above  all  that,  he even shed tears trying  to  defend

them.  And  today, out of his own mouth he  called  them

worse names than I ever dared to call them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed a pity that politics in Singapore has

come to such a stage whereby a government would not dare

to move in the interests of law and order without trying

to get the Barisan Sosialis involved. According to their

logic,  if  the Barisan Sosialis votes with  them,  then

everything  is honky-tonky. And if the Barisan  Sosialis

say,  "No",  then everything is going to be  difficult.

How could it be? If they like the Barisan Sosialis, then

invite them to go back and work with the Government.  Do

not let them sit on this side of the House and give us a

lot  of unnecessary noise from their sides. We are quite

able to look after the interests of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park, has

tabled  an amendment. The amendment is to make it  clear

that  it  is  the  duty of a government  to  govern,  to

maintain  law and order. And if it is of any  assistance

to the Government in the proper discharge of its duty to

maintain  law and order, then we are prepared  to  give

them  our vote. But we want to say this to them - and  the

amendment  seeks to focus attention on this - that  it  is

the  duty of a government to govern. I do hope  that  in

future  the Government will not come running  into  this

Assembly  asking  for  the views of this  Assembly  in

matters which directly concern the duties of government.

They either govern or they do not govern. If they do not

wish to govern, the answer is simple. They get out.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find it

very difficult to understand the Member for Cairnhill. I

do  not know where he stands, what he means, whether  he

is here or there. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



starts off by criticising the Government for having cast

doubts  on  the  sincerity of the Barisan Sosialis.  And

then  he ends up by criticising the Government,  yet  at

the  same  time agreeing to the sentiments expressed  in

the  motion. I can only say, Sir, that I find the Member

for Cairnhill a very slippery customer. But I would like

to   tell   him  this - he  has  left  the  Chamber,   but

nevertheless  I would like to tell him this - there  is  a

strong  rumour  in  town  that there  is,  in  fact,  an

alliance between the Singapore People's Alliance and the

People's Action Party Government. And it could be,  Sir,

that in the anxiety of the Member for Cairnhill to cover

up  this  alliance,  he wants to criticise  us  and  the

Government,  but nevertheless, when it comes  to  the basic  situation, he makes sure all the time  that  the

Government gets more than 26 votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret that in a debate on a motion of such a

serious  nature  as we have today, we  saw  a  clowning

performance of the Prime Minister. Sir, either the Prime

Minister thinks that the motion before the House is  one

that  makes him laugh, because he thinks that after  the

passing of this motion what is going to happen is  going

to  be amusing to him; or because he finds that What the

Member for Cairnhill has said is the truth, and  as  it

is  the truth, it hurts him and he wants to cover it  up

by  just  laughing it off. Sir, since the debate started

at  2.30  p.m. today, every Government speaker has  been

trying  to  avoid the issues projected  by  this  motion

before  us.  Sir, nobody in the Barisan Sosialis  doubts

that,  on the face of it, the motion purports to  uphold

and defend the right of every student to his freedom  to

pursue his studies and sit for an examination. But, Sir,

is this all there is to this motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House seeks to obtain for

the  Government a blank cheque from this Assembly. But,

Sir, before we decide to put such a blank cheque in the

hands  of  the  Government, it is our bounden  duty  to

ensure  that there is, in fact, no foul play  intended.

Sir, Singapore today is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



forced to witness and tolerate the pathetic picture  of

poor  vain  threats, plots and  plans  of  the  P.A.P.

Government in its last days. And, Sir, we would fail in

our  duty  to  our  people if we  did  not  expose  the

desperate move of this discredited Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion calls on this Assembly to condemn the

student pickets and to sanction the use of police force

against school children.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member can

say that. It calls upon the House to support any action

by  the police to protect students. I do not think  the

motion says anything about force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> May I submit, Sir, that in my

interpretation,  the  intention of  the  Government  in

moving  this motion is to get this Assembly to  condemn

the  student  pickets and to sanction the  use  of  the

police against school children?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, the hon. Member is

quite entitled to interpret it that way. But if he says

that the motion says so, then he is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If I may now continue, Sir,It is my

contention  that before we can venture to  condemn  the

student  pickets, we must first seek to understand  why

there was, in fact, the necessity to picket. Sir,  this

picketing   is   the   logical   consequence   of   the

Government's  determination to hold  the  Secondary  IV

Examination in the face of genuine grievances and fears

on the part of Chinese educationists and students. Sir,

the P.A.P.'s education policy - I assure you, Sir, that

I  do  not  intend to start a debate on  the  education

policy,  but  all  I want to say is that  the  P.A.P.'s

education  policy, particularly in respect  of  Chinese

education,  should be understood. For it is  this  that

has  brought about the boycott and sufferings  to  both

parents   and  children,  whether  they   be   in   the

examination ball on in the picket line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, all teachers from all streams of

education in Singapore know about the efficiency of the

Ministry of Education. The public, because of this  sad

situation in the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



schools,  is also made aware of this fact.  Sir,  as  I

have said once before, I have respect for the trust and

privacy  of  private conversations,  unlike  the  Prime

Minister. Hence, I do not think I should reveal to this

House  what  Mr C. V. Devan Nair told me  many  times,

when he was the Political Secretary to the Minister for

Education, of his estimation of the competence  of  the

Hon, the  Minister for Education, who incidentally  is

the  ex-General Manager of an insurance  company.  But,

Sir,  I  want to make this point: running an  Education

Ministry is not like running an insurance company. Even

in the insurance company and in the insurance business,

he is known as an Asian expatriate by the local staff.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is all this really necessary in

the  debate  on  the motion? Let us  get  on  with  the

motion. Time is getting on. It is a quarter to nine.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The point that I really want to make is this

expatriate attitude, this contempt for the view of the

poor  native, be he an educationist or a student, which

has  helped  to result in the boycott. The question  of

having to sit for an examination was never disputed. In

this   respect,  Sir,  we  must  condemn  the  P.A.P

Government  for  not telling this Assembly  the  facts.

They tried to confuse the issue by distorting the facts

and  stating  that  the students do not  agree  to  the

universally recognised principle that one must  pass  a

lower  examination before going for a higher one.  This

principle, Sir, as I have said, was never an issue.  It

probably remained an issue in the mind of the Minister,

and  I  would suggest that the sooner he sorts out  his

thoughts  and facts clearly, the better it is  for  him

and everybody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how the Government examination, at the end of

Primary VI in the English education stream, serves as a

bottleneck, as a valve to limit the number of  children

going into the Secondary English schools.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry I have to interrupt

again. I did stop the Member for Serangoon Gardens when

he endeavoured to go into those details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



I  think  the  Member  has made  his  point,  that  the

students  are  dissatisfied with the education  system,

and  as  a  result of that dissatisfaction,  they  have

picketed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As I said, I have no mention of going into

details.  But what I do want to say is that it  is  the

subconscious  fear  of many Chinese educationists  that

the  Government may use their Secondary IV  Examination

like   nets.  Sir,  the  Government's  insistence   and

adventurous attitude on its effort to hold examinations

in  one  way or another have all helped to enhance  the

fears.  Whether these fears are groundless  or  whether

they  do in fact, reflect Government's intention is  of

no  consequence to us today. But what is of importance,

Sir,  is  that  these  fears are genuine.  They  are  a

reality and we must take cognisance of them. Sir, if we

behave  like expatriates then we will end  up  in  this

present mess. The P.A.P. has deliberately ignored these

objective  factors. It ignores them, Sir,  at  its  own

peril.  But  this  Assembly  shall  not  share  in  the

responsibility due to the consequences of the  P.A.P.'s

follies. It is the height of impertinence, Sir, and  an

insult to this Assembly that this House should be asked

to sanction police action so that the P.A.P. may pursue

a  course  pregnant with threats to the peace  of  the

island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the pretext of maintaining law and order,

the  P.A.P. wants us to give it the green light so that

its  action might create more disorder and violence and

enhance  the  atmosphere of tension the Prime  Minister

has  tried  to create in his radio talks. Sir,  if  the

P.A.P. Government does not want violence, does not wish

to  create an artificial tension in Singapore, and does

not  wish to turn this sad issue, which is a result  of

their  own  folly, into a weapon to suppress  political

opponents,  then  they  should  not  have  handled  the

situation  in  the  way they in fact did.  The  present

student  unrest appears to be the result of a  plan  by

the P.A.P. to cause violence and an air of tension. The

Government  seems to be out to justify what  the  Prime

Minister  has  warned of in his radio  talks.  We  have

seen,  Sir,  how the Government tried to  justify  such

forecasts,  as the Prime Minister said in  relation  to

the industrial front, by indulging in acts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



which would have provoked violence amongst strikers and

police. We have even seen the case of the strike by the

Public Daily-Rated Employees, when the Government tried

to  make  the issue a political one, when in  fact  the

strike was precipitated by Government's sponsorship  of

a  yellow  union, the A.U.P.E. The Prime  Minister  had

forecast   that  his  political  opponents  would   use

students. He now appears to create a situation to  make

his  forecast appear true. Sir, it is important for  us

all to realise how the present situation was created by

the  P.A.P. and how it could have been avoided  if  the

P.A.P. had not been bent on creating trouble so  as  to

push  through  their  phoney merger  in  the  resulting

confusion  and unrest. History has shown us  many  such

examples. In Singapore's recent history, Sir,  we  have

seen  how  the Member for Cairnhill and Chew  Swee  Kee

sparked  off trouble in the students section so  as  to

clamp  down  on militant trade unionists and  political

opponents.  We  see,  Sir,  in  the  P.A.P. manoeuvres

designed  to create unrest so as to eliminate effective

opposition and keep themselves in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as early as 1960, the Minister for Education

mentioned the P.A.P.'s plans to revise and shorten  the

secondary  education in the Chinese secondary  schools.

But  nothing was done until mid 1961, when the Minister

restated  his  intention  once  again.  Sir,  all  news

regarding  criticism of this policy was  systematically

suppressed. There were grievances and fears. But  there

was  no  means  for  all to have open discussions.  The

public  was  completely  kept  in  the  dark.  Then  in

September,  the  P.A.P. decided to announce  officially

the  conversion plan. They decided to push through  the

examinations  even  when  the syllabus  for  the  upper

secondary classes plan was not available. They  started

on  this  course  knowing full well the resentment  and

fears of the Chinese educationists and the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they were fools and half-wits, then we would

have  forgiven them. But they are men who claim  to  be

intelligent, Sir, and as such, they know full well that

pushing  through  this  delicate  and  emotional  issue

against suppressed grievances

and fears will only result in a blow-up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  their  censorship of grievances and fears  failed

when the "Barisan", the organ of my Party, published in

full the grievances of the students. The "Barisan"  was

careful  just  to report the news of the grievances  of

the  students without any comment whatsoever. Our  aim,

Sir,  was that unless all are made fully aware  of  the

grievances and the fears of the educationists  and  the

students,  they  would not be able  to  appreciate  the

mischievous designs of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a showdown was obvious and inevitable with the

Government  determined to teach the students  a  lesson

and thus achieve their desire. It is our responsibility

to  lay facts for the parents and others to see. We did

not  comment, Sir, for we did not want to stir  up  any

feelings and fall into the P.A.P. scheme of things. Our

publishing of the genuine grievances had ultimately let

the  cat out of the bag for the P.A.P. Despite the fact

that  we passed no comments, the P.A.P. thought fit  to

unleash  a  campaign directed at us for  agitating  and

instigating the students. Sir, we see the same  process

being  repeated. Sir, Chew Swee Kee in 1956 blamed  the

P.A.P. for  instigating  the  students.  The   P.A.P.

leadership  then  knew  that  those  allegations   were

fictitious. Now they have resorted to the Chew Swee Kee

tactics, and it is the Barisan Sosialis this time which

is the scapegoat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Education mentioned three

Barisan Sosialis Members and Mr Tommy Koh Thong Bee as

having gone to the schools to instigate and give  moral

support  to the students. We are glad that in the  case

of  Tommy  Koh the Minister had to eat his  own  words.

But,  Sir, what is more important is the logic  of  the

Special  Branch and the Minister. Tommy Koh's  car  was

there -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we should go into

details on that. I think the Member has made his point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I beg your indulgence, Sir, because this is

the  basis on which serious allegations have been  made

against the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member has made his

point,  so far as Tommy Koh is concerned. We  know  the

whole history of it. There is no need to repeat

it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not, in fact, going into the details of

Tommy  Koh's case, Sir. But I just want to  expound  on

the  logic of the P.A.P. Ministers and the Intelligence

Service  that they are using to base their  allegations

upon. I was saying that Tommy Koh's car was there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It was not!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Exactly. There you are, when one

goes  into detail, one makes mistake. The hon.  Member

now  says  that  Tommy Koh's car  was  there, but  the

information  is that his car was not there.  Anyway,  I

think I must stop details of that nature. The point has

been made. Let us come back to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I would like to ask the Minister whether,

apart from the students, there were others that morning

at the schools, and whether they also were giving moral

support.  Were  they, Sir, to use  the  Special  Branch

logic,  instigating the children? The Minister and  the

Special  Branch  ventured to carry  their  logic  to  a

higher  stage.  Because three Barisan Sosialis  Members

were  there that morning - three out of numerous  parents

and onlookers - the Barisan Sosialis was therefore behind

the  disturbances. And again, as two of the three there

happened to be at the same time bus workers, Fong  Swee

Suan  was behind the show. Sir, such logic is the  same

as  saying, if a P.A.P. Member commits murder, then the

Prime  Minister  and Secretary-General  of  the  P.A.P.

instigated  him. This is the very logic  that  composed

the  underlying  theme of all the radio  talks  of  the

Prime  Minister.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have  all  been

thrilled by the rhythm of the Harry Lime theme, but our

people are now being subjected to the sickening refrain

of  the Harry Lee theme. How desperate can this man be,

Sir? And how low can the P.A.P. leadership sink?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having found somebody to blame for their follies,

the   P.A.P. was  determined  to  push  through   the

examination in the Chinese schools. Mind you, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



there  was  no  urgency  for this  plan.  It  could  be

introduced  even  next  year. Having  failed  in  their

efforts, Sir, they now persist and want to hold and, in

fact,  are holding supplementary examinations.  Why  do

they  wish  to  perpetuate tension? Why is  the  P.A.P.

Government determined to force students to sit for  the

examination  when  everybody  knows  and  feels   that,

because  of  the  atmosphere,  which  is  and  was  not

conducive  to  getting the best out of the  candidates,

the examination results cannot be of any significance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is easy to fight school boys and school girls.

But to ask Gurkha mercenaries to beat up our children

is no way to solve educational problems -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not heard any allegation

that Gurkha mercenaries have been asked to beat up

children - [Interruption]. Order. When the Speaker is on

his feet, there must be silence. That type of statement

is completely false and should never have been made in

this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to establish this, Sir, that there is

definitely  a  reason  why the Government  persists  in

wanting  to perpetuate the tension. Sir, the point  is,

how  can  any candidate answer examination papers  with

peace of mind when he knows that his fellow classmates,

perhaps  his  team  mates in the basketball  team,  are

outside picketing and may be engaged in a struggle with

the police? Sir, these are effects which I am sure even

the Minister for Education is not unaware of. Sir, I am

inclined  to believe that the Prime Minister  does  not

want  to  solve this problem peacefully. He might  want

tension   and  violence  so  that  under  an  emergency

atmosphere, he can oppress his political opponents. But

by  his own admission, he has learnt a lesson from Chew

Swee  Kee's  mistakes. He does not  want  to  bear  the

responsibility  for  police  action.  He   wants   this

Assembly  to sanction such action. He wants  to  commit

this  Assembly to an act which he himself dare  not  do

alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, except for slight modifications, we see Chew Swee

Kee's  actions all over again. Sir, the former Minister

for Education under the previous Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



may  be  dead  but it would appear that his  soul  goes

marching  on. Marching, Sir, in step with that  of  the

P.A.P. leaders.  Today we witness in  this  House  the

joining up of forces of the Member for Cairnhill,  Chew

Swee Kee's cronies, and the P.A.P. desperadoes. This is

not unexpected, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. These unparliamentary expressions

are  getting more and more unparliamentary.  I  do  not

know  whether  the Member for Thomson is alleging  that

the Member for Cairnhill was Chew Swee Kee's crony.  If

he  is, then that is completely unparliamentary and  is

offensive. He must withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was not referring to the Member for

Cairnhill as a crony of the previous Minister. But I

was saying, Sir, this is something that we expected.

The plan to reduce Chinese secondary education- stems

from the previous Government. Sir, the tactic of

creating disturbances while professing to maintain law

and order is something the Member for Cairnhill holds

dear to his heart. Sir, the trouble was that Chew Swee

Kee was, in fact, too straightforward. But then, Sir,

he had not the experience to learn from the mistakes of

his predecessors -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is customary for the Barisan Sosialis always to

mention  Chew Swee Kee. I thought that the Speaker  had

already  ruled that Chew Swee Kee's name  was  becoming

very tedious.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. The name of Chew Swee Kee was

becoming  very  tedious when used  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown. Perhaps I can say to the Member for Thomson

that  the  use of the name of Chew Swee Kee is becoming

tedious  but  it  has not reached  that  stage  at  the

moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I can very well understand how the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. has now polished the old

machine and we see a bunch of polished and skilled

operators.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



Today,  ("parents" are parents within inverted  commas)

used  as  their  first line of attack  instead  of  the

police.  In the last few days, Sir, we have seen  well-trained  and  co-ordinated "parents"  manning  gateways

through picket lines. Sir, we have seen students  being

assaulted by these so-called parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here, for your information, a picture

published in the Free Press of Friday, 1st December, of

these   people   whom  the  P.A.P.  Government   called

"parents".  And  the  note  under  the  picture  reads,

"Parents  and supporters stand by outside the  Ministry

of  Education."  They all appear to  me  to  be  people

ranging from the age of nine to not more than 20.  Sir,

I  can assure the Minister for Education, who seems  to

be  amused,  that this is not a picture  taken  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis  cameraman. This is  a  part  of  the

Straits  Times  outfit, and if at all anybody  supplies

photographs, it  should  be  the  Government,  as  the

Government,  in  fact, supplied the  photograph  to  be

published  in the Straits Times. I cannot remember  the

date,  Sir,  but the Straits Times carried a photograph

and  underneath  it  is a note saying,  "Photograph  by

Ministry of Culture."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What about the Chinese Press?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, anyway, that is something that we are

not  in  the habit of doing. But the point I  want  to

make  here is, are these the parents of Chinese middle

school students who I am told are aged about 16 or -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Twenty-four.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - 17? One is left to wonder about the

multifarious  designs of the Special  Branch.  We  have

noted  window panes being broken by these men, so  that

the  glass  may  injure the students below.  Definitely

there  have  been more casualties amongst the  students

than  among the "parents". Now we are asked to  protect

these  "parents".  We  are  asked  to  sanction  police

action - that   is  my  interpretation  - against   school

children.  Sir,  we have never been asked  to  sanction

police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



action  against striking workers, as, for  example,  in

the  case  of  Robinsons. When  the  police  were  used

against  salesgirls, the Government did not  come  here

and  ask  us  to  sanction  such  action.  Why  is  the

Government  doing this now? Will the Government  assure

us  that in the future if police action is to be  taken

against  pickets, they will summon an emergency sitting

of this Assembly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not too late for the P.A.P. to call off its

scheme. We appeal to them once again not to place their

political  future above the interests of the people  of

Singapore. Their actions might have provoked  violence,

but  thanks to the restraint shown by the strikers  and

the  pickets and recently by the school students, there

was none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point that I wish to answer is something raised by

the  Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime  Minister.

Sir, the charge against the Barisan Sosialis is that we

want  to create violence to topple the Government.  Let

me  assure the Members opposite that we do not have  to

have   violence  to  topple  the  Government.  We  have

complete  faith  in  the  peaceful  and  constitutional

methods  available  in the State,  and  we  tell  the

Government that. If they doubt the statement, all  they

have to do is just resign and hold general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Today?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> This is not a matter for laughing. We are

not desperate men, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> It is a day-dream!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - who are afraid to meet the people, who are

afraid  to  face effective opposition. Therefore,  they

have  to  dress up agents provocateurs as  parents.  We

have  the  confidence of the people and we are prepared

to  meet  the people any time. As I have said, we  have

every  confidence  in  replacing  this  Government   by

peaceful and constitutional means. Sir, if the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



wants  to prevent violence and further unrest,  then  I

say,  better  withdraw  this  motion.  The  way  for  a

peaceful  settlement does not lie in the use of  police

action.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the results of the examinations, as I

have  explained, are of no significance. No intelligent

man  in his right senses can expect the results  of  an

examination  held under such unfavourable circumstances

to  reflect  the  true ability of the  candidates.  The

Government   must   also   cancel   all   supplementary

examinations scheduled for this week, which,  in  fact,

have   started  today.  This  step  will  prevent   the

perpetuation of tension. Police action on the one  hand

and  bursaries  on  the other are  not  going  to  make

examinations  any more acceptable to the students,  nor

the   results  any  more  significant.  Sir,  the   100

bursaries to successful candidates remind me of the $12 million -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again I think the Member for

Thomson is straying into details which he ought not do.

He  has made his point and I do not think he should  go

into details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, what is important is that an atmosphere

conducive to gainful negotiation and consultation  with

Chinese  educational  bodies  must  be  achieved.  This

cannot  be done, Sir, by the use of police. It is  only

by  consultation, discussion and persuasion that  fears

can  be  dispelled and grievances settled. It  is  only

when  all  points  of  views are  fully  explained  and

publicised  that fears of parents and students  can  be

allayed.  The censorship of news and then exploding  it

to shock the public is no way to solve problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me remind them this that when the Government

stops  playing  hide and seek with the students,  I  am

sure  the students will stop catching the running  dog.

Let  me  say  once more to the P.A.P. leaders  to  stop

their reckless scheme. Let me remind them that even  if

they  do succeed in creating conditions for unrest  and

violence, they cannot continue to hold office  forever.

All  the  achievements in this respect by the  previous

Government, led by the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



for Cairnhill, did not help to keep them in office

forever.  Sir, for those who secretly admire Chew  Swee

Kee  and  wish to tread in his footsteps, let  me  also

remind them that it is not easy to create 26 iron mines

and  26  directorships. Uncle Sam may be  generous  but

Uncle Sam is also a businessman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis do not accept

this motion at its face value. It must be considered in

the   context  of  events  which  have   led   to   the

introduction of this motion. We do not intend to  share

the  responsibility arising out of the incompetence and

deliberate  scheming of the P.A.P. Government.  It  has

landed itself in a mess. It now wants us to help  carry

its  burden. Is the P.A.P. Government willing to  admit

its  mistakes and its responsibilities for this present

unrest amongst the Chinese school students? If not,  we

call  upon  the Government to resign and not  by  their

reckless policies bring more sufferings to our people.



<br><br>9.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to the

Member  for Thomson, I was reminded of the tourist  who

smuggled  a whisky bottle in his luggage, and  when  he

was  asked by the Customs official, "Have you  anything

to  declare," he went into a long tirade about his  own

life story.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Like the Prime Minister and his animals!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So similarly in the case of the Member

for  Thomson, with occasional "Hear, hears!"  from  the

Member  for  Anson. The Member for Queenstown  was  the

only  one who laughed at the jokes. Obviously that  was

prearranged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is a very simple one. All it asks is -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For police action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - for the House to condemn the actions

of  picketers in obstructing, intimidating or otherwise

forcefully   preventing  students  from  taking   their

examinations.  That is the first part  with  which  the

Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



Anson  agrees, that if there is intimidation to prevent

students  from  taking their examinations,  then  there

should  be  such condemnation. This first part  of  the

motion  is  a simple statement. Do you or  do  you  not

agree  whether  a minority of students - which  is  quite

clear  now - can prevent two-thirds of the  student  body

from  taking  their  examinations?  That  is  a  simple

question. Can you throw bottles, form human walls -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How about window panes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - to prevent a group of students from

taking  their examinations? They are not asking  to  do

anything that is illegal and they are entitled  to  sit

for  their examinations. They say, "Please, we want  to

sit  for an examination. Let us pass. Please picket  by

all   means,   but  do  not  resort  to  violence   and

intimidation." That is a simple proposition.  There  is

nothing very complicated about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> For the information of the Minister, I must

tell  him  that  without provocation two strikers  were

assaulted by the police this afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member rises on a point of

information  or elucidation, he must rise  on  a  point

which  has reference to what has been said.  I  do  not

know  whether strikers are meant to be picketers.  Were

they picketers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They were strikers. The Minister was saying -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I just want an answer. By

"strikers", does the Member for Thomson mean "student

picketers"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No, Sir. They are employees of Guthrie & Co.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then the Member was out or order. Please

continue, Mr Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am coming to this because this is

far more dangerous than merely debating a motion to ask

the House to condemn obstruction by students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the best part of this afternoon and evening,

the  Members of the Barisan Sosialis have been  beating

about the bush, talking about the Robinson strike, Chew

Swee Kee, bullets -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Your version!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - and everything else, except

answering a direct question. Are you or are you not  in

favour of condoning students picketing and intimidating

the  vast  majority of students who want to take  their

examinations? It is quite clear what this  amounts  to.

They have been exposed.

For  a  couple of days, they have been saying that  the

students    and    the   public   are    against    the

examinations - just like their propaganda that the public

are  behind  them in everything else - but it  transpired

that  a  vast majority of the students went  for  their

examinations  and still many more would have  gone  but

for  intimidation  and the use of violence  by  student

picketers  and,  more important, by the  dangerous  and

wicked  men  who  are using these students  to  further

their  political aims. I hope these men will  have  the

courage one day to come and face the Government - and  on

that day we will face them and meet them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is doing exactly what

I  have  asked Members not to do, and that is to  point

accusing fingers at the Members opposite. I think if he

points his finger at me, I might not be intimidated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has intimidated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. Yet I

managed to point my finger at the empty Benches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me first say that this debate is not an issue

on  which  we  are  going to take a vote  and  go  home

sometime  this  evening. I think the Member  for  Anson

went  through this before. He asked a question whether,

in fact, the Government is creating a fiction about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



adults using school children. He said that he agrees to

the motion in principle but that he disagrees because

we cannot name names.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> But let me quote from a speech -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged to the Minister. I

said that I am prepared to believe that there are

adults manipulating the students but I find it

difficult to believe that the students would organise

this boycott on their own. I did not talk of fiction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am glad of the correction. But I

would  like  to point out that the use of  students  to

boycott  the examinations is not purely for the purpose

of  embarrassing  the  Government  but  of  creating  a

situation in which the lives and limbs of students  and

young people could be jeopardised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote from Hansard, 16th May, 1955, column 241.

During  the  Hock Lee strike, school students  went  to

help  the  strikers.  There were clashes  between  the

police and the students. I remember, Sir, there was one

student who was badly injured and the students, instead

of  ensuring  that this boy was sent to  the  hospital,

carried  the  body of a dying schoolboy  all  over  the

place  including, I think, the office of  a  newspaper,

because  they were quite determined to have a  martyr - a

dead  schoolboy.  Had the boy been  taken  to  hospital

straight-away, he would have been saved.  But  the  men

who  organised this demonstration were quite determined

to  have a dead schoolboy as a martyr. When the  Member

for Anson was the Chief Minister, he had this to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Government believes in the decency and the

worth  of  the  great  mass  of  our  youth  and  their

potential; that we believe a tiny group, which does not

stop at murder...',



<br><br>because I am sure the Chief Minister then knew that the

men  who  manipulated the school children were prepared

even to incite innocent boys who were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



misinformed to do something which amounted to murder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...has given Singapore and the Chinese schools of

Singapore a bad name.'



<br><br>Then he went to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Students have been driven from class-rooms to the

streets.'



<br><br>He then pinpointed the responsibility indirectly - he had

no  proof  then - on a Member who is now  the  organising

Secretary of the Barisan Sosialis - Mr Lim Ching  Siong.

The Chief Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am not an expert on Chinese culture, I admit to the

hon.  Gentleman for Bukit Timah, but I know  this  much

about Chinese culture;...'.



<br><br>He   went  on  to  say  that  in  so  far  as  he   was

concerned - quite rightly - that Chinese culture  indicated

an  exquisite courtesy and reasonableness. So we  know,

Sir, that if a situation like this were mishandled,  it

could  result  in  the  Communist  elements,  who   are

manipulating  the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis  and'

putting things into their mouths, being ready to  climb

to  power to get at their political objectives  on  the

maimed  bodies  of children. This has happened  in  the

past and it will happen again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, let us not discuss this debate and say

"aye"  or  "no". Because we know, Sir, as  one  of  the

Barisan  Assemblymen indicated to me in the  course  of

the  discussion,  the  fight for merger  has  now  gone

outside this Assembly, and we are just talking, and  as

a result it is quite meaningless. We knew long ago that

the  battle  for  merger would be  fought  outside  the

Assembly.  As I said earlier, Sir, in the  opening  of

the  debate on merger, sooner or later merger  must  be

stopped,  not by words but by deeds. And this  incident

of boycott and agitation over the 4 : 2 and 3 : 3 systems  is  one part in a long struggle since last  June  to

halt merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to repeat what I have said before on the

industrial front, the Peoples Association, and  so  on,

but  only this: this is one more attempt to provide  an

opportunity  to  spark off violence  and  disorder.  In

fact, Sir, I have noticed very recently that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis  have taken an interesting  line.  We

charge them with playing at communalism or doing things

which  incite communalism. They now take the line  that

we  are  the  communalists. We say that  they  want  to

incite.  When  I  say  "Barisan  Sosialis",  I  am  not

necessarily referring to the 13 gentlemen, as I do  not

think  many of them really know where they are  heading

for,  but  to the men who are manipulating  them.  They

know  what  they are doing. So we say those people,  as

Communist   elements,   have   always   believed   that

parliamentary democracy is a facade. They  have  always

maintained the theory and practice that revolution must

come  from outside the talking chamber. I will  believe

in parliamentary democracy if you can do it by debating

and voting. They know that. The parliamentrian wing  of

the  Barisan Sosialis may think that that is what  they

are  doing - that they are really deciding the fate of  -history  in  this  Assembly. But the manipulators  know

that  sooner or later they must give the red light  for

violence. When that happens, the 13 Barisan Assemblymen

will  have to toe the line and join them in the streets

when the battle starts. If they do that, I will take my

hat  off to them. At least we will know that these  are

real  revolutionaries. But for people to come here  and

talk   about   revolution,   about   overthrowing   the

Government by parliamentary means, when, in fact -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker.

Please,  Sir,  it  is  9.35 p.m. Could  we  debate  the

motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was about to rise and inquire of the

Minister how all that he has said has any relevance  to

the motion; there may be some relevance but not all  of

it is relevant. Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the point that I want to make is

that this boycott of examinations is part and parcel of

an  attempt to create violence and disorder which  they

have   tried   to  do  in  other  fields - the   People's

Association,  the unions, and so on. Therefore,  it  is

essential  to  know  that this  boycott  by  itself  is

nothing. If there had been picketing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



shouting slogans, putting up banners, then,  as

far  as the Government is concerned, we would not  have

bothered. But if they attempt to create a fracas, or to

stop  students from taking their examinations, or  hold

meetings, victory parades or victory marches, then  we

know  that  there  is  something  more  than  that.  It

happened before - a little strike, students went out  to

parade, a fracas, and students got killed, and even the

Chief Minister had to give way. So it is our submission

that if the Barisan Sosialis are genuine about settling

this  dispute  over  the examinations,  they  can  very

simply  do  so  by  condemning the  students,  not  for

picketing  but  for  preventing others  from  taking  examinations  which they have a right to  do,  and  for

intimidating parents who want to take their children to

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other motion, as I have indicated earlier - the

Barisan Sosialis itself has agreed to it - is that when

a  Member  of the Assembly is barricaded and  prevented

from coming here, we pass a resolution. That was enough

to  persuade the students that it would be very foolish

to  do  so when practically all Members of the Assembly

were quite determined to provide police protection  and

even  to  punish schoolboys. The Barisan Sosialis  then

were  not  talking about police action.  It  was  quite

clear,  Sir, that they were quite prepared  because  of

self-interest. It was self-interest. And  that  is  why

they  passed the motion. Because - I think  it  was  the

Member for Farrer Park who indicated it - if you did  not

pass   a  motion  like  this,  perhaps  one  day   they

themselves  might  be in the same position.  Therefore,

they passed the motion saying that this Assembly should

extend  police  protection to an Assemblyman  and  even

punish  the  people concerned. But when we asked  them,

"Well,  here are the parents and the students who  want

to take their examinations. Would you be prepared to do

so?"  They  were  not  so certain  about  that.  May  I

therefore  tell the Barisan Sosialis: let  us  by  all

means  play  politics. Let them by all means  challenge

the Government in the Assembly or outside the Assembly.

We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



will be ready to meet them. But for God's sake, do  not

play  with the lives of school children, which, as  the

Member  for  Anson  will tell you,  the  last  time  it

happened, it resulted in what he called the murder of a

school  boy. Therefore, I say to the Barisan  Sosialis,

"We  are  adults. Let us go and fight  this  inside  or

outside  the Assembly, any way you want."  But  do  not

hide  behind the skirts of eight-year old or  nine-year

old children who do not know what it is all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of order, Sir,I think the

Minister  for  Culture  is very  intimidating  in  his

remarks. He is looking at me all the time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is exactly what I am trying

to   ask  Members - not  to  look  across  the  Floor  in

threatening  attitude and making threatening  gestures.

[Interruption] Order. The Leader of the House must keep

quiet when the Speaker is on his feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister for Culture to look at the Speaker

and  make  his  gestures to the Speaker.  Possibly  the

Speaker would not be intimidated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thank you, Sir. I have not seen a more

cheerfully   intimidated  man  than  the   Member   for

Queenstown!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He is only a little bored!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Since this little theme of "Resign

now" has been recurring, may I, Sir, in passing, put  a

stop  to this rather tiresome request by reminding them

that  every Assemblyman who crossed over has  signed  a

document stating quite plainly in black and white  that

any time they cross the Floor or resign from the Party,

they  have promised to resign their seats and  pay  the

Party  $2,000. These are gentlemen who are not prepared

to honour what they have written in black and white. We

shall produce it if you want it. We shall even give  it

to the newspapers. So therefore let us not hear any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



more  about  "Resign", and so on. This  Government  was

elected  to  fight for merger. In fact, the  Party  was

formed  to  fight  for merger. And  one  thing  we  can

guarantee the gentlemen opposite:

until such time as we have got merger, we are not going

to  quit.  We  will see to it that merger gets  through

before we decide what we shall do.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You have a -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Anyway, Sir, coming back to this

point. As the Prime Minister has indicated, let  us  by

all  means  fight this merger according to  Queensberry

rules  or  Queenstown rules. But we ask of  them:  keep

away from school children who do not know what this  is

all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Members keep on saying, "Why

don't  you consult school children?" Some of  them  are

eight years old, with dried milk on their lips; and  we

are  supposed to go and consult them as to whether they

want   4:2  or  3:3  when,  in  fact,  educationalists,

reverends,  and  ancient gentlemen who know  all  about

education have decided that 4:2 is the best system. And

now  the Members in the Barisan Sosialis say, "No,  no.

You  must discuss with the school kids." Some  of  them

are  six or seven years old. And they also say that the

Minister  for Education should probably sit  down  with

them  and discuss, "Well, what do you think of the  4:2

system? What do you think of 3:3?" Even if you conceded

that point of democracy, I am quite sure, Sir, that the

Barisan Sosialis, or its leaders, would want to pick  a

quarrel  with the P.A.P. They would say, "No,  no.  You

must  consult with children of two or three years  old.

Children who are still in their cradles should also  be

consulted  as to whether it should be a 4:2  or  a  3:3

system."  Therefore, Sir, I ask of them,  let  us  play

politics.  Let us even resort to revolutionary  tactics

outside  this Assembly. But please do not use  children

as  your  shield,  so that you might  get  children  as

martyrs  to prop up the falling prestige of a Party  or

at least of a group of men who are as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



ruthless  and  as  desperate as  they  were  when  they

manipulated school children in 1955 and in later years.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know how many more speakers

there  are.  But  we  are getting to  the  stage  where

arguments are being repeated. I would just like to  get

an  indication  as  to how many Members  are  going  to

speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Opposition side? Four. From the Government

side? Two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I might give a warning that if there is any

repetition  of  any  sort,  the  Chair  is   going   to

intervene,  and as strictly as possible. If  there  are

any points to be made, let them be new points.



<br><br>9.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Thomson  just  now  made  a  very  serious

allegation  against  the Singapore  People's  Alliance.

That, Sir, has to be answered right away. I am asked by

my  Party  leader, the Member for Cairnhill,  to  state

categorically  in  this  House  that  the  S.P.A. will

not - repeat, will not - at any time, now or in the  future

have  an  alliance with the P.A.P. The S.P.A. condemns

the P.A.P. for the trouble and misery it has caused the

people of Singapore. What we mean by the P.A.P. are not

only those sitting on the other side of the House,  but

also  those who now describe themselves as the  Barisan

Sosialis. Sir, we have made our stand clear.  We  as  a

Party  stand for the interest and welfare of the people

first   and  foremost  regardless  of  our  own   party

interest.  We are not prepared to and will  not  ensure

our success by riding on a tiger, as the P.A.P. did and

as the Barisan Sosialis Members are now trying to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue before the House is becoming confused

in  the  eyes  of  the  public,  because  it  is  being

represented to them that the parties here are  debating

the issue whether we are for school children or against

school  children, whether we are for or against Chinese

education and culture. Sir, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



I  see it, we are being asked to vote on whether we are

for  or  against intimidation, instigated and organised

from  behind. And whether we are for or against  giving

protection  to the parents and students who  are  being

intimidated and who seek protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an educationist, I believe students all over

the  world  are  by nature the same. In whatever  media

they   study,  their  thoughts  and  emotions  run   on

practically the same lines. As students they know  they

have to study. But, at the same time, they are fond  of

good fun, excitement and adventure. They are also fond

of  group activity, of group leaders and of working for

some good cause. Sir, under wise guidance, students  in

any  school can be developed into good citizens with  a

high sense of responsibility. But if they get into  the

clutches of people who have wrong motives, their energy

and   enthusiasm  can  be  exploited,  disciplined  and

expressed  in wrong and sometimes very dangerous  ways.

Sir,  their  main  protection  has  always  been  their

principals,   their   teachers   and   the    education

authorities.  If  this  line is  broken,  then  trouble

begins. This motion shows that this line of defence in

Singapore   has  broken  down.  Apparently  principals,

teachers and the educational authorities have tried  to

do  their best and, because they are not able  to  keep

their defences intact, the motion is moved before  this

House   asking  for  approval  to  give  the  necessary

protection to the parents and children who want to take

the examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not asked to approve aggressive police action

against  school children. We are being  asked  to  give

protection to the law-abiding parents and students  who

want  to do the right thing. Of course, Sir, we  wonder

why  an  educational  issue  like  this  has  become  a

political   issue  of  great  importance.  Why   should

students  be organised against students,  and  parents

and  students be organised again also against  parents

and students on the other side?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reference to a chichak dance has made many

people think of the snake dance which took place in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



streets   of   Tokyo,  and  threatened  the   Japanese

Government.  I  suppose, Sir, the  present  Government

thinks  that  there  must be some kind  of  similarity

here,  and  having known the strategy of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  Members,  as  they  themselves  were   their

tutors, they have made the necessary moves. Well, Sir,

that  is  their game. But as for us, we are interested

in  the welfare of education in Singapore and law  and

order in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Government to clarify at this time

their policy as regards the participation of secondary

school students in politics. As far back as 1957 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Does that arise on this motion? If

the hon. Member wishes to debate that point, let him

give notice of a motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I have a suggestion to make - that if on any controversial matter involving students

and  that matter is likely to give rise to a situation

like  this,  the Government should refer it completely

to an independent educational body and let them decide

on  it. Otherwise, because of party politics, Sir, the

thing can be developed again into a situation like the

one we are now facing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this issue of the 4:2 and 3:3 systems, at

this  point, if it could be referred to such  a  body,

those  students who have been misguided  can;  realise

that  the  matter  will  be taken  up  in  the  proper

quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hurly-burly, Sir, people are saying that

parents  in Singapore are showing their proper  mettle

by  coming out to defend the rights of their children.

They are not interested in the political struggle and,

therefore,  they  have  had to  do  that  because  the

present Government, knowing what had happened  to  the

previous   Government,  is  wary  about   taking   the

necessary measures to enforce law and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, that Members of this House, if they

are really interested in the welfare of our children,

would  be  against those who try to manipulate  things

from behind and exploit the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



children  from  behind:  We should  grant  protection

where  parents  and children need such protection  to

preserve their freedom to do what is right.



<br><br>9.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

you  will remember that last Friday, when the Minister

for Education was making his ministerial statement on

this  matter,  he  did show you a photo  in  the  Free

Press. He said in a very proud manner that the parents

were  supporting the government. Sir, I  do  not  know

whether you have seen the photo or not. But if you  or

anyone  else  had  seen it, I believe  he  would  have

laughed.  He would have laughed because the  so-called

parents in the picture in the Free Press are so young.

These  so-called parents are too young to  be  parents

and  too old to be students. The Government would feel

ashamed   if  it  compares  the  picture  of  would-be

parents, about 20 in number, to the thousands  of  old

parents  who attended the meeting at the Chinese  High

School yesterday afternoon. The joint meeting of these

parents and students proves that the so-called 62 per

cent  who  sat  for the examination is  inaccurate.  I

deeply believe that all the parents do not like to see

the  Government  using the Police  Force  against  the

students.  I  know  the feeling  of  the  peace-loving

parents.  I therefore believe that it is not the  real

intention  of  a  few  parents  who  called  upon  the

Government  to  use  the police against  the  peaceful

strikers.  No one would use force of arms against  the

students,  who are under 17 years of age,  except  the

reactionary forces. The main purpose of this motion is

to  condemn the peaceful strikers, and the Government

seeks  to use the Police Force against them so  as  to

achieve  the  P.A.P.'s sordid political  aim  for  the

benefit  of  a  few. I would like to  ask  all  P.A.P.

Assemblymen, Parliamentary Secretaries and  Ministers,

if  they are not in the Government and their sons  and

daughters are involved in any form of strike  and  are

beaten up by the police,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



what would they feel? Are they going to keep quiet  and

ignore  the  brutality of the Government? Or  are  they

going  to  suggest that the freedom of action  must  be

suppressed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leaders, by moving this motion, clearly

show   their   insincerity  to  settle  the   four-year

examination  problem. Instead of postponing  the  four-year examination, the P.A.P. Government extends it  for

another  week.  By extending it for another  week,  the

following incidents may occur - I quote one by one,  Sir,

the incidents which may occur:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To make the students continue their strike and

picket at various examination centres for another week,

so  that the policeman and the C.I.D. can lay hands  on

the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Once the students continue to picket at the

various examination centres, the Government may use its

machinery  and  mobilise its stooges  to  threaten  the

peaceful  student strikers in an attempt to worsen  the

situation,  thereby  forcing  the  Senior  Middle   III

students to go on strike again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To extend the examinations means to extend the

strike  for  another week. In this way, the  Government

would   have  more  chance  to  blame  their  political

opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) As the merger issue has become so widely known and

all  the people know the importance of citizenship, the

Government  is  now in a very precarious  position.  It

therefore adopts the tactic of putting the strike issue

over the merger issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The P.A.P. leaders, seeing that they are in a

state  of utmost confusion over the question of merger,

are  therefore  trying to direct the attention  of  the

people  from  the  merger issue to the  student  strike

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. Government, by blaming its political

opponents   for  creating  the  strike,  has   made   a

despicable  attempt to camouflage its attempt  to  sell

the rights of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Due to their inefficiency and lack



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



of  knowledge  of  the educational  problem  and  their

arrogant attitude, the whole educational problem is now

in  a  mass.  They,  therefore, dare not  shoulder  the

responsibility which they are paid to do. They want  to

push their responsibility away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The police may use batons against the little

children  who  put  up banners, posters  and  cartoons

criticizing the P.A.P. Government's educational policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Having seen the banners, posters and cartoons

posted  on  the streets, in buses and in  schools,  the

P.A.P. ruling  clique go mad and become desperate  and

shameful.  Because  of  their  narrow-mindedness,  they

cannot   stand   criticism  from  the   people.   They,

therefore,  find  a way out by taking  the  blame  from

their   shoulders  and  putting  it  on  the  so-called

agitators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The Government in moving this motion is not going

to  protect  the  students, but to use a  baton  charge

against  the  peaceful  and empty-handed  students  who

picket  outside  the gates of all examination  centres.

The Government in moving this motion is threatening the

peace-loving parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government might have thought that since

this  Assembly  could approve a motion to  protect  the

Member  for  Bukit  Panjang, who is  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education, therefore,  it

is  quite  appropriate  for this  Assembly  to  approve

another motion to protect the students. The purpose  of

this motion is not to protect the students, but to  use

the police force to suppress the students who are young

and  innocent. We supported the motion to  protect  the

Member  for  Bukit  Panjang  from  being  hindered   by

hooligans.  These hooligans were not and could  not  be

students.  As representatives of the people  and  above

the policemen, it is up to this Assembly to protect any

Member of the Legislative Assembly, because there is no

one  who  has the power to protect him. The Government,

in  moving  this motion, would make it appear, in  the

eyes  of the public, that the police force is not under

the control of the Government, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



under  the  control  of this Assembly.  It  would  also

appear, in the eyes of the public, that the police have

no power to maintain law and order which they, in fact,

have. In actual fact, the P.A.P. Government intends  to

use the police force to suppress the innocent students,

but  dare not do it on its own. It therefore asks  this

Assembly  to give power to the Government  to  use  the

police force against the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to advise the P.A.P. Government that the

only  way  to settle the student strike problem  is  by

peaceful  means and negotiation and not by  force.  The

Government, or even the police itself, has the power to

deal with this matter. Why does the Government want  to

bring  this  matter into the Assembly  and  ask  it  to

authorise the police to "protect" the students? What is

the  power  of the police and what is the duty  of  the

Government? Their duty is to maintain law and order. If

the  P.A.P.  Government is unable to govern,  then  the

only way for them is to resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention to bring this matter to

this  Assembly is to turn this controversial  education

issue  into  a political issue. The P.A.P. leaders  and

all Members of this House must realise that it is safer

to  look before they leap. The Government must not  use

its  political  power to suppress the  known  political

resentment of the students. These political powers  are

nothing  but batons and tear gas. The P.A.P. Government

is  trying  to  use  the  police against  the  peaceful

student  strikers. The P.A.P. Government's proposal  to

use  the police against the empty-handed students  will

not help -

repeated  about  five times already.  I  ask  the  hon.

agrees with them. I do not want any repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, education is not

confess that it has implemented the policy of the 4:2



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



system  in  a hurry, without any prior preparation  and

how  the  policy is to be implemented. They  must  also

realise that they are not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This argument also has been

advanced and is nothing new. It is a repetition of past

arguments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

blames the peaceful strikers for creating trouble.  Yet

we  do  not  see anyone who has sat for the examination

having  been  injured. But we can  see  young  men  who

behave  like  gangsters  trying  to  fight  the  little

students.  These young men, all unidentified,  are  not

students  or  parents. They break and force  their  way

through in order to disperse the students. Sir, I  have

two photos in the Mm Pao, dated 2nd December this year.

These  two  photos  show a few unidentified  young  men

trying  to  fight a group of little children  picketing

near the Ministry of Education. I ask the Government to

inform this House who are those unidentified young men.

The Government should have no difficulty in identifying

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to advise the P.A.P. leaders that the

sons  and  daughters of other people are the  sons  and

daughters of the State. They are innocent. The duty  of

the  government is to bring them up to serve the  State

and not to crush them. I sincerely hope that all P.A.P.

leaders will fight for the interests of all the  people

and  not  just the few who love the P.A.P. The duty  of

the Government is to govern the country. The Government

must  see  that  the rights and interests  of  all  the

people are protected. It must not rule the country  for

sectional interests and in order to protect the  rights

of the minority. The P.A.P. Government, which claims to

represent  the  vast  majority of the  people,  is  now

seeking  help  from the Opposition. Is it  not  clearly

shown  that  what the P.A.P. claims to be  is  entirely

false?  The  P.A.P. Government has now become  so  weak

because the majority of the people are not backing  the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state the requests of the people in

this  Assembly, and I would also like to put forward  a

few   suggestions  to  the  Government.  I   hope   the

Government will pay some heed to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Government must inform the parents publicly

that  it  will not use the police force and the  C.I.D.

men against the peaceful strikers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government shall forthwith postpone the 4-year

examination so as to lessen the worsening situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Government must see that no gangsters are

being used to threaten the strikers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government will immediately seek consultation

with all educational bodies to examine the cause of the

strike  and to make recommendations on this 4:2  system

of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) After consultation with the educational bodies and

after  all problems of the 4:2 system are settled,  the

Government must assure all parents that their  children

who  went  on strike will be allowed to re-enter  their

schools   to   study,  and  that  there  will   be   no

discrimination  or  prejudice  against   their   former

action. This is especially important when marking their

examination papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Any proposal to change the educational system must

be  based  on equal treatment for the four  streams  of

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Government should study and consider all

reasonable requests stated in the memoranda sent to all

Assemblymen by the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Government must accept the views and proposals

suggested by the various educational bodies which  know

the cause of the strike and know what is the meaning of

education.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, we fully understand the true motive of this motion

of  the  P.A.P. From the debate on the motion, we  have

the impression that the whole world is becoming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



chaotic.   You  have  people  outside  the  examination

centres shouting and asking for a fight. The safety  of

those  students who are taking the examination is being

jeopardized. Therefore, the Government has to resort to

the  use of police to suppress such actions. But, as  a

matter  of  fact,  we  do not see such  incidents.  The

activities of the students, whether they are correct or

not, is another matter. But from any angle, we can  say

that  the use of police against students should not  be

supported.  We support the police in their  maintenance

of   law  and  order.  But  we  resolutely  oppose  the

instruction to be given to the police against  students

who are helpless and unarmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we can see from the newspapers today that the Minister for Education has announced that in the present situation, those who have not taken the

examination are only 927 in number. This only  goes  to

show  the  motive behind the motion of the  Government.

Among these 3,000 students, if there are only some  927

who  have not taken the examination, then they will not

be  prevented  at all. This goes to show  further  that

there  is no need to make use of the police to suppress

the so-called activities of the students. In short, Mr

Speaker, Sir, we feel that this motion is redundant. In

the  first  place, as seen from any angle,  the  motion

should  not  have been brought up by the Government  so

that  the  police  will be used against  the  students.

Secondly,  the safeguard for the people is  already  in

the  hands  of the police, and the Government  is  just

trying to shirk their duty and pass it on to the  other

Members of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we resolutely oppose this motion.

prongs. They change the truth to something that is

untrue. However that may be, Sir, we have been taught a

lesson that from childhood we should listen to what is

being spoken but we should not pay attention to who is

speaking. In the interest 01 safeguarding democratic

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the boycott by the students, it is

clear that it has nothing to do with the weakness of

the education policy. If it is viewed from the result

that two-thirds of the students have sat for the

examinations, it shows that the present education

policy is accepted by the majority of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nonsensical allegations have been made by the 13

Members of the Barisan Sosialis to the effect that the

boycott was the result of our failure of our education

policy and its non-acceptance by the people. We wish to

know why, when they were with us in the Government,

they merely folded their arms and kept quiet? We also

wish to know further the stand and attitude of the

Barisan Sosialis towards Chinese education. It is the

custom and habit of undesirable elements to distort

facts. For instance, the Member for Thomson just now

tried to make out that the Government would use the

police to suppress strikers. We should distinguish

workers from children. Our responsibility now should be

centred on those who are manipulating the misguided

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should not forget the

efficiency of the subversive elements who have

succeeded in influencing these young innocent children

for their own- political ends. They would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



prefer to see the destruction of these children with a

smile, because, on their dead bodies, they can organise

and achieve their aims. Nobody in his right senses

will believe that there are no evil men behind this

boycott. I can bring up two incidents for this House to

ponder over very carefully. I am impressed by an

article written by Inche Gazali Bin Ismail, the ex-Secretary General of the Malay Students Union, which

appeared in the Utusan Melayu of 1st September, 1961,

under the heading of how these pro-Communist elements

tried to control or influence Malay students in 1955.

This article presented two special features

consecutively, but I am merely touching on the excerpts

to show how these pro-Communist elements infiltrate not

only into Chinese middle schools but also in the Malay

Students Union. One of the excerpts exposes one of the

methods adopted by the Communist cadres to influence

the students, and that is by organising picnics and tea

parties. Normally these functions are paid for by the

pro-Communist elements themselves through devious

channels. I will refer to another passage. A leader

from the University Union - I wish to call him J - played

an important part in the birth of a new movement

amongst Malay students. He helped to organise picnics

for Malay students. The cost was met from contributions

by the Pan-Malayan Students Federation. In one of these

picnics, students from Chinese middle schools

participated. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these

activities by undesirable elements could only go on for

one year, and then in 1956 their attempts failed. This

clearly goes to prove that these destructive elements

can influence not only the minds of Chinese school

students but they also attempted to infiltrate into the

Malay Students Union. Fortunately, their efforts failed

miserably. Subsequently I sincerely believe that these

same people tried to whip up communal sentiments among

the Chinese students who. I am quite sure, were pure in

their minds and healthy in their thinking. I received

two circulars issued by the Chinese middle school

students throughout Singapore, one of which reads

"Students on strike"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



written in the national language, with the intention of

sparking off communal emotion. If there had been no

evil men behind them, I am quite sure the students

would not have resorted to such tactics. I will read a

passage from the contents:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are youths who love the national culture and

national language. We are the sons and soil of Chinese

education.'



<br><br>I am merely reading short passages at random and these

go to show that they are fanning communal sentiments:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In order that the wishes of teachers and students be

not  subverted,  we swear on oath that we  will  become

fighters to defend our national or racial education.'



<br><br>It  ends  with "Long live national education  and  long

live  Chinese  education!",  thus  implying  that   the

present Government wants to kill Chinese education.  In

point of fact, our aim is to unify all the main streams

of  education into one national education in  order  to

build  one  united  Malayan nation.  These  people  who

intentionally   and  deliberately  whip   up   communal

feelings  are very dangerous. We will oppose them  from

whatever quarter they come because, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, we are in the process of building a united Malayan

nation.  The contents of this circular are lengthy  and

if   I   were   to   read  them,  it  might   lead   to

misunderstanding among the various races. What is  even

more  strange  is that the circular on the  boycott  in

Chinese  schools is written -in Malay and it  is  being

circulated  among Malay students with  the  object,  of

course,   of  making  the  parents  adopt  a   communal

attitude.  This  is  typical of the measures  taken  by

these  dangerous  elements.  The  object  is  to  cause

communal  clashes which are very dangerous  indeed.  We

must  condemn these destructive elements who are trying

to  get the various sections of the community to  fight

amongst themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must realise that the

students  can  be  likened  to  white  cloth - clean  and

pure - and  it is up to us to change this cloth into  any

colour   we   like.  Therefore,  it   is   our   common

responsibility  to use the proper colour  to  suit  our

climate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard Members of this Assembly putting forward

their views



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



and  opinions.  There are some who support  the  motion

whilst others oppose it. It is evident where they stand

in  this  matter  and we know why they  adopt  such  an

attitude. They cannot hide the facts. If some  of  them

try  to  hide  behind the skirts of school children,  I

challenge  the  13 Members in the Barisan  Sosialis  to

declare their stand openly and in all sincerity. It  is

not  enough  for  them to challenge the  Government  by

asking  them -to resign when they themselves  have  not

got the guts to go back to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To us, this motion is one which seeks to reconcile

differences and bring about happiness and prosperity in

our community. It also seeks to uphold the principle of

democracy  so  that democracy can be practised  in  the

true  sense of the word. I wholeheartedly support  the

motion  moved  by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Chinese newspapers, including the Sin Chew Jit Poh  and

the  Nanyang  Siang Pau, we can clearly see  that  many

which   we  are  debating  now.  The  newspapers   also

published  the views of the Singapore Teachers'  Union,

the  Nanyang  Graduates' Association and its  Students'

Union,  and  the opinions of other educational  bodies.

All these organisations feel that it is unnecessary for

the  Government to use the police against the students,

but to handle the dispute peacefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these educational bodies, it was also

reported in today's paper that yesterday 2,000  parents

met  in  the  Singapore Chinese High School Auditorium.

They also felt that the Government should not make  use

of the police. The people in these organisations have a

very  close association with Chinese education But  the

Government  does  not seem to hear their  opinions  and

views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the motion that we are debating today, it is stated

that it is made in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



response to an appeal from parents of students who wish

to  sit  for  the  examinations. We  want  to  ask  the

Minister  for Education this: if he is paying attention

to  the demand of only a minority of the parents,  then

why  should  he  not pay attention to the  opinions  of

2,000  parents? Does it mean that the opinions of  some

2,000  parents should be disregarded? The Committee  of

the   School   Teachers'   Association,   the   Nanyang

University  Graduates' Association, and  the  Students'

Union  of  Nanyang  University  were  established  long

before the Barisan Sosialis was formed. I believe  they

are  unwilling to allow any political Party to make use

of  them  or  to embroil them in a political  war-pool.

From  all this we can see that the Government  is  only

paying attention to those opinions which are useful  to

the  Government,  and not to those views  and  opinions

which  do  not  express agreement with the  Government.

Under these circumstances, we have no reason whatsoever

to  believe that the P.A.P. is a Party which values the

opinions of the people in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have pointed out in :their speeches made

just  now  the various reasons for opposing the  motion

tabled by the Government. I do not wish to repeat  what

they have said, but I would like to point out here that

the students' boycott has come about as a result of the

education  policy of the Government. The  Government's

intention  to  use  the  police  against  students  and

parents cannot solve the problem of the mishandling  by

the Government of its education policy. I would like to

stress  again  that  all  the  educational  bodies  and

organisations  have suggested to the  Government  many practical methods of how the present situation could be

handled.  In  today's  papers,  as  I  have  said,  the

organisations I have mentioned have sincerely suggested

how the Government should handle the situation and what

the  Government  should do about it. I believe  if  the

Government   should  accept  the  opinions   and   act

according to the suggestions, then that would  be  much

better   than   resorting  to  the  police.   But   the

Government, instead of acting on the opinions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



of  the  educational organisations, has  come  to  this

House  and brought up this motion. This shows that  the

Government's  intention  is  to  try  and  change  this

question  of  education into a political one.  We  feel

that  since  the  Government's  education  policy   has

brought  about  these incidents, we in  the  Opposition

have  no  reason  whatsoever why  we  should  bear  the

responsibility for the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organisations I have mentioned just now have been

in  existence for a long time. Some have existed for  a

year,  and others for seven or eight years. The  P.A.P.

Government, if it is sincere in valuing the opinions of

the people, should have won these organisations over to

its  side. So to say that these organisations have been

won over by the Barisan Sosialis and are being made use

of by them would be wrong, because the Barisan Sosialis

came into existence only three months ago. And it would

be  nonsensical  to say that it is impossible  for  the

Government,  in the course of two years,  to  win  over

these  organisations. If it is correct to say  that  we

can win over these organisations in the course of three

months, then we can see clearly that the government has

made a mistake in its education policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, regarding the reform in education, I think we had

better leave it to a later stage when the proper motion

in regard to education policy comes up for debate. I

will then make a clearer explanation of the matter. But

I would now like to point out to the Minister for

Finance that the boycott of the students today is not

against the 4:2 system. We must bear in mind that there

is no educational body which is against changing the

system of six years to the 4:2 system.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have made a ruling on the

education  policy.  The  hon.  Member  will  have   his

the merits or demerits of the education policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

regarding  the question of education, I  think  we  had

better  leave  it to the proper time when the  relevant

motion is brought up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must answer an allegation made by the Party in

government.  They  say  that the motion  approved  last

Friday is aimed at protecting a Member of the Assembly.

Regarding  this,  we must clearly point  out  that  the

motion  passed by this House last Friday  is  basically

different from the present motion we are debating  now.

The  motion  passed  last Friday  in  this  House  only

allowed  the police to protect Members of the Assembly,

but did not allow the police to take action against the

students.   What   we  contended  was   that   if   the

Parliamentary  Secretary concerned had been  obstructed

by the hooligans, then we should condemn the hooligans.

We  never  contended  that  young  students  should  be

considered  as  hooligans. This  is  a  very  important

difference.  The  motion we are debating  now  is  very

clear,  that is, the police must be made use of against

student  picketers who are doing their duty peacefully.

I   feel  that  the  Government  and  the  Ministry  of

Education should not consider students as hooligans. If

it does, and if the Minister should do so, then he will

not be fit to administer our education system, and this

Government will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



be able to handle the education problem properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question I would like to ask is this: cannot

the  present situation be avoided? In other  words,  if

the  Ministry  of Education has handled  this  question

properly,  could  this situation  be  avoided?  I  have

already pointed out that if the Government had accepted

the  opinions  given by the educational bodies,  then

the  unpleasant events and the question  of  using  the

police could have been easily avoided.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

the  motion  today is basically clear in this  respect.

There   is   a  minority  of  opportunistic   political

adventurers,  especially  my  friends  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  We  know  that  the Barisan  Sosialis  adopt

opportunistic tactics. On any question, they  are  very

good  at trying to gain over the support of the  people

by  opportunistic means. They are trying to do the same

on  this question now. We know that the tail of the fox

cannot be hidden from view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the motion today is the same

as the motion we brought up in regard to the protection

of  Members  of  the Assembly. Why should  the  Barisan

Sosialis oppose the present motion when, on the  other hand,  they have supported the previous motion? I think

it is very clear.

This is very fair and very reasonable. But our friends

opposite, especially those in the Barisan Sosialis, are

opposed  to  the  Government using the police  to  give

legitimate protection to the people. They are  opposing

our  making  use of the police to protect the  students

and  their parents, in spite of the fact that they have

supported the motion in regard to the protection  of  a

Member  of the Assembly. Why should they not  take  the

same attitude now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to

quote  some figures from the Nanyang Slang Pau  because

the  Member f or Queenstown said that some 4,000 people

attended a meeting in the Chinese High School.  But  in

the  Nanyang Siang Pau of today it is stated  that  at

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for

Queenstown is very good at

exaggerating. I would like to point out that among  the

3,171  candidates  there are only 1,012  who  have  not

taken  the  examination. But there is some  discrepancy

between  the  number  pf students  and  the  number  of

parents  attending the meeting. They said that  in  the

whole  of  the  Chinese High School  there  were  2,000

parents  who attended the meeting when, in fact,  there

were  only  about 927 students who have  boycotted  the

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full support of the present

motion.



<br><br>10.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, we

have  spent  much  time today debating  this  question.

Almost every one of -the Members of the Opposition  has

spoken  on  this  motion  at  length.  To  sum  up  the

arguments  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  They  have  put

forward the same views. In a nut shell, what they  have

said  amounts to this. They have exaggerated the number

of the so-called parents in the Chinese High School. At

the  same  time, they have deliberately  neglected  the

fact that there were 2,000 parents of students who took

part in the examination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



Secondly, they wanted to put the blame on the  Minister

for Education and on the Government. Lastly, the Member

for  Upper  Serangoon asked why we did not accept  the

proposals of the so-called educational bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said he supported the first part

of  the  motion. With regard to the second part of  the

motion,  he  was  in doubt. He said he doubted  whether

there should be such a motion, that is, the second part

of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill said that we, the Government,

tried   to   shirk   our  responsibility.   The   Party

represented by the Member for Cairnhill asked: why  did the  Government make use of its authority  to  use  the police  to  protect  the students?  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, before  I  make any reply to their criticisms,  I  must point  out  the fact that this was before the  13  ex-P.A.P. colleagues left the P.A.P. The ex-Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education said, "When  I

was  in  the Party, there was no trouble. When I  left,

there  was  trouble." This goes to show that all  these

troubles  have been created after they left the  P.A.P.

We  can all learn from the newspapers that before  the 13  Members  left  the P.A.P., we had  a  Party  Review

Committee  of  which the Member for Queenstown  and  I

were   the   Secretaries.  We  received  a   memorandum

submitted by the 51 Branches. We also received  a  very

long  memorandum submitted by the Member for Serangoon.

As far as I can remember, in all these memoranda, there

was  not a word mentioned that the education policy  of

the  P.A.P. was wrong. If the P.A.P. education  policy

was  wrong,  then  the 13 Members, especially  the  ex-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Education,

should  have pointed this out to the Committee at  that

time.  He  should have pointed out that  the  education

policy of the Government was wrong, so as to avoid the

unpleasant  incident that we have today. However,  they

did  not  mention a word about this matter.  Obviously,

from  all the designs we can get from the organ of  the

Barisan Sosialis, and from the attitude of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



the  Barisan  Sosialis Members, we  know  who  are  the

people  who  manipulated the boycott of  the  students.

Everyone  knows  that the eyes of the people  are  very

clear.  They  will  not  be  deceived  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis Members who pass off the eyes of the  fish  as

pearls.  Why  did  they  not  point  this  out  in  the

Committee? When they left the P.A.P., they created  all

this trouble to embarrass the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see from the newspapers that those who

took part in the examinations were in the majority.  We

have  also  seen  that parents were  insulted  by  the

student  picketers. If any Member in this House  is  in

doubt as to whether these parents have been instigated

by the P.A.P., or that they are nonexistent, we have  a

signed  document to prove this. We can point  out  that

their  children are students and also in which  classes

they  are  in. I can swear here that I do not know  any

one of these parents.

be  a  petition  to  the  Assembly.  I  understood  the

petition to be a petition to the Ministry. If it was a

petition  to the Assembly, then, of course, it  had  to

come under Standing Order 16. I am correct, I think, in

that aspect of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised a doubt. In his

interjection,  he  asked  whether  these  parents  were

they submitted their petition, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



did  not  know any one of them. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

facts  have proved that the majority of the students sat for the Secondary IV examination conducted by the Government. I feel very sad that our Members, who claim

to  represent the people, have distorted the  views  of

the  people.  They are in the habit of using  tactics.

Their  attitude is that the majority should follow  the

minority,  and  not  the  minority  should  follow  the

majority.  We have seen this thing before. Before  they

left  the P.A.P., we Assemblymen had a meeting  and  we

passed  a  resolution at that meeting that before  they

could  make any statement to the Press, it  should  be

passed by the meeting.

brief.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  the  Member  for  Anson objected  to  my  giving

details of this thing, I will forget about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Members in this House said that

there were 2,000 parents in the Chinese High School.  I

want  to ask them whether they can submit the names  of

these  2,000  parents. On our part, we are  willing  to

submit  the names of the parents as well as the pupils

who  sat  for the examinations. We do not want to  drag

all  the  people together and brand them as parents  of

the  students. The facts have proved that the  majority

of the pupils sat for examinations and there was only a

minority  of  students who have prevented  pupils  from

taking   their   examinations.   We   think   that   as

representatives  of the people, we  have  the  duty  to

persuade this small number of pupils not to do such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



foolish  things, because in a democratic  country,  any

person  has the right to sit for an examination and  he

cannot  be denied this freedom. If we know this  to  be

the  democratic system, then it should  mean  that  the

minority    should    follow   the    majority.    But,

unfortunately, the Member for Queenstown  congratulated

this  small  number of pupils. But does he  not  think

that  his  congratulations will embolden the pupils  to

flout  the law of the country and make them more daring

to commit unreasonable actions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Members have said just now that all those

pupils  who boycotted the examinations were  picketing

peacefully.  If their picketing were peaceful,  then  I

think  it would not be necessary to table this  motion.

But in our view peaceful picketing should not mean that

the pupils should form a human chain and link arms.  As

far  as  I know, when the representatives of the pupils

came  to see me, they had already used every method  to

convene  protest meetings in the school. They had  been

trying  to  persuade  the pupils not  to  sit  for  the

examinations, but their efforts had failed.  Then  they

resorted   to  this  unreasonable  action.   If   their

picketing  were peaceful, then it would not  have  been

necessary  for  us to use the police,  because  when  a

pupil  went  to  sit for the examination,  they  should

convince  him  and not - as reported in  the  paper  - use

force.  I  want  to refer to the open  letter  of  the

Preparatory  Committee of Parents  Association  to  the

Chairman  of  the  Chinese School Teachers  Union.  The

letter was addressed to Mr Lim Sek Kian of the -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of order.

Just now the letter was quoted by the Minister for Home

Affairs  and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary  not  to

repeat it again in this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the allegation by the Member for Upper

Serangoon is correct, then, of course, we do  not  want

any  repetition. But if it is not correct, then we will

have that statement read.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It is definitely not correct. I was

delivering  my  speech in English. The  letter  was  in

Chinese and obviously I could not have quoted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, will you carry on?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, an

incident  was mentioned in this letter. One parent  who

accompanied  his  child  into  an  examination   centre

yesterday  said,  "We  parents who  want  to  take  our

children to sit for their examinations have to  stomach

all  the  abuses flung at us by the picketers who  wore

school  uniforms.  Are  they  any  different  from  the

hooligans?"  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we must  not  cover  up

everything.   We   must  not  think   that   by   using

unreasonable arguments, we can convince the people. All

those  who  have  gone  through this  experience  know

whether the attitude of the student picketers is right.

I do not blame these student picketers because they are

young  and  easily manipulated. Therefore, I hope  they

will ponder over what they have done. They should learn

that   they  should  not  be  made  use  of   by   evil

politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened very carefully to the ex-Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education when he  spoke.

I  have not been in the Ministry of Education for long.

I have been there for only two or three months now. The

ex-Parliamentary   Secretary  to   the   Minister   for

Education  was in the Ministry of Education  for  quite

sometime  before me. Our Minister for  Education  is  a

very  frank  man.  He  knows that he  is  not  Chinese-educated,  and therefore on matters concerning  Chinese

education,   he   always  consults  his   Parliamentary

Secretary. It was with surprise that I heard  the  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for  Education

say  that the Government did not listen to the opinions

of  education  bodies. It will be remembered  that  the

decision on the 4:2 system was taken after we have  had

discussions  with the Committee of the  Chinese  School

Teachers  Association. We have  been  accused  that  we

forced  the principals of Chinese schools to adopt  the

4:2 system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



This  is an insult to the principals of Chinese schools

in Singapore. Only God knows whether any principal of a

Chinese secondary school can be so easily deceived.  If

this is so, then what kind of a world is this going  to

be?  All  people in the educational field can  remember

the  attitude of the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for Education towards teachers and principals

Yet  he  dares to say that we force the Chinese  School

Management Committees to accept our proposal.  This  is

an  insult  to  the  Committee of  the  Chinese  School

Teachers  Association.  He  was  in  the  Ministry   of

Education for two years and he knew very well what  the

4:2  system was all about. But now he wants to  distort

the facts by saying that we want to make use of the 4:2

system  to lower the standard of Chinese education.  It

is  mentioned in the Paper that when the students  pass

the   examination   after   the   four-year   secondary

education, they will be promoted to the upper secondary

classes for two years. How can it be four years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said the Prime Minister made a very

big mistake because, on Teachers Day, he announced that

the  question  of  the 3:3 or 4:2  system  could  be

decided by the educationists. If it is wrong to  decide

the  question by a majority, then I do  not  know  the

meaning of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also said that we wanted to buy over

the  students  with  money. Does it  mean  that  he  is

opposed  to  the giving of aid and assistance  to  poor

pupils  to  enable  them to take up further  education?

Does he think that this is wrong?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim said that the Government is

shirking its responsibility. He wanted to know why  the

Government did not want to exercise the right  that  it

has,  but  came instead to this Assembly to ask  for  a

mandate  to  be  given  to them.  The  Members  on  the

Opposition  are  contradictory in their  speeches.  The

Member  for  Hong  Lim  and other Members  accuse  the'

Government of being dictatorial. But now the Government

is   not   willing   to  use  force.   Is   this   not

contradictory?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that when dealing with adult gangsters and

criminals we should use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



our  power.  But these are innocent and  young  middle

school  pupils  who are being made  use  of  by  other

people. We know the people behind the scenes who  want

to  make use of them, to drive them into a clash  with

the  police  so as to create unrest in Singapore  with

the   object   of  getting  everyone  to  oppose   the

Government on the merger question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another important matter. The Member for

Hong  Lim  asked why we should make use of the  police

when  the  Secondary IV examination was completed.  My

answer  is very simple. Today we have heard  from  the

Minister for Education that he was obstructed  by  the

picketers  from going to his office. What  kind  of  a

country  is  this  going to be? This  is  due  to  the

instigation of the Barisan Sosialis Members who incite

the  students  to trouble. Not only do these  students

have  no respect for their teachers but they also have

no  respect  for  Ministers. This is the  aim  of  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for our tabling this motion is this. The

examination is in progress, and the Senior Middle  III

Examination will be held on Friday. I do not need  any

information from the Special Branch to know that  many

pupils  have been humiliated. They are disgusted  with

the  student  picketers and they are willing  to  give

information to us. We have information that the Senior

Middle III students will boycott the examination. I am

in the dark as to the reason for this boycott.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Changi implied that the

Senior  Middle III students also want to  boycott  the

examination.  This  seems to  be  connected  with  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  I feel strange  that  ten  minutes

after  the  motion  was passed in  the  Assembly,  the

students who beleaguered me dispersed, and the  Member

for  Changi  said  today that the  Senior  Middle  III

students wanted to boycott the examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last point is that the

intention  of our motion is not to use the  police  to

suppress  the unarmed students. If we make a  detailed

study  of  the motion, we will see that our motion  is

intended to ask for police protection



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



for the parents and the pupils, if the  pupils

who  boycotted the examination could carry  out  their

picketing  peacefully, then there  would  not  be  any

incidents or clashes with the police. Therefore,  what

we  feel  very  bitter about is that a Member  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  deliberately  distorted  the   word

"protection" into "suppression". Is this not something

to provoke the pupils?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Upper Serangoon said that the

Chinese   School  Teachers'  Union  and  the   Chinese

Committee  Teachers' Association  had  suggested  many

proposals.  But up to now we have still  not  received

any  formal  letters from these organisations.  If  we

follow  what  is  reported in the newspapers,  it  can

happen that the reports in the papers may be wrong. If

any  organisation has any views to submit,  it  should

submit  them  to us in writing. We cannot  follow  the

papers blindly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I want to tell the House. Last

night,  the  Chairman of the Chinese School  Committee

Teachers' Association (Mr Ko Teck Kin) rang me up and

said  that he was under pressure from certain  people.

He  said, "Everyday they give me trouble. They want me

to  give a public statement. What must I do?". I  told

him, "It is very simple. You can say to them that  the

Chinese  School  Committee Teachers'  Association  has

come   to  an  understanding  with  the  Ministry   of

Education."  He  said, "It is not as simple  as  that.

They  come  to  me everyday." As regards  the  Chinese

School  Teachers' Union whose Chairman is Mr Lim  Sek

Kian,  you will remember it was reported in the papers

that that Union wanted to convene a meeting to discuss

the problem of the student boycott and the problem  of

reform.  But on the following day, we did not see  any

resolution made by the Association. We could only  see

the statement made by the Chairman. We want to ask Mr

Lim Sek Kian whether his statement was approved by all

the Members. Does his -
