<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>PHASING OUT OF OLD GOODS VEHICLES</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

Hwang Soo Jin -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Communications if he

will  inform  the House the manner in which  it  is

proposed to phase out goods-carrying vehicles  more

than  15  years old and whether he will assure  the

House  that in phasing out such vehicles sufficient

notice will be given to individual owners so as  to

minimise  hardships  and to ensure  adequate  lorry

services to users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Teng Cheong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Registry of Vehicles (ROV)

records



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



show  that  there  are about 9,500  goods  vehicles

which  are over 15 years old. Of this figure, about

2,400  are  over  26 years old, and  another  1,300

between 22 and 26 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As goods vehicles generate a large amount of

economic  activity, it would not  be  advisable  to

take  them off the roads suddenly but to have  them

phased out gradually. Accordingly, the mechanically

unfit  or oldest vehicles will have to go  off  the

roads  first. To ensure that there is no disruption

to  the services provided by the goods vehicles, as

well  as  to  give  the owners sufficient  time  to

replace  the scrapped vehicles, a grace  period  of

six   months  to  two  years,  depending   on   the

mechanical  condition  of the  over-aged  vehicles,

would be given. Under the phase out programme,  the

ROV  will  send  notices  to  owners  of  over-aged

vehicles,  notifying them of  the  dates  to  bring

their  vehicles  for mechanical  inspection.  These

over-aged vehicles, if found mechanically unfit  on

inspection,  would be given 14 days to rectify  the

faults.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



If,  after repairs are carried out, these  vehicles

pass  the  re-inspection, they would  be  given  12

months extension. Such extension would be renewable

subject to satisfying the annual inspection  up  to

31st  December,  1974, thus  giving  them  a  grace

period up to two years. However, vehicles that fail

the  re-inspection after repairs would be given six

months'  notice  to replace. The insurance  company

would be notified also by copy of letter to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated that a large number of goods

vehicles'  owners  have voluntarily,  or  at  ROV's

recommendation,   scrapped  their   over-aged   and

unroadworthy vehicles ever since the White Paper on

the  Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service

of   Singapore  (Paper  Command  21  of  1970)  was

published in July 1970. Up to September 1972  about

2,500 over-aged and unroadworthy goods vehicles had

been scrapped and replaced by new vehicles.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members

may  be  pleased to note that as a  result  of  the

views  expressed in this House yesterday  that  the

proposed  increase in accouchement  charges  for  A

class  should be very much higher than those for  C

class, I have, after consultation with some  of  my

Cabinet colleagues, decided to increase further the

proposed charges for A class. The new rates  for  A

class will be as follows:-



<pre>

                                   A Class

                                     $

 Delivery for 4th child             400

 Delivery for 5th   and

     higher order child      	    400



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also take this opportunity to answer a

question  posed yesterday by an hon. Member  as  to

how we were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



going  to prevent parents from having more children

after  allocating  Housing  and  Development  Board

flats  to them. The answer to the question is  that

priorities for the allocation of HDB flats will not

only be for the application for the first flat  but

also for application for transfers to a bigger  and better  flat.  In other words, if those  who  after

having  been  allocated flats  continue  after  1st

August,  1973,  to have more children,  then  their

application  for transfers to bigger flats  in  the

future  will drop very low in priority. They should

then  not  blame  anyone other than themselves  if'

they  and  their bigger families had to  remain  in

their smaller flats for a very long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  in support of the motion of thanks to  the

President, moved by the Member for Bukit Batok, and

in this, I am categorically backed by the community

leaders and people of Potong Pasir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, too true the Government will have to

discourage  the  creation  of  a  more  "cushioned"

society  in  Singapore. Singaporeans will  need  to

learn  that rewards should be equated to hard  work

or  personal performance. But, in areas  where  the

people  are willing to work hard - in the vegetable

farms  of Potong Pasir, for instance - there should

be  no curbs. Urban renewal is threatening to erase

the  lust  for  hard  work these vegetable  farmers

possess.  More  than 1,500 people depend  on  these

farms  for a living, directly or indirectly.  Here,

on  120 hectares of rich land is grown, among other

vegetables,  nasturtium officinale  or  watercress.

The  alluvial soil of the Jalan Potong  Pasir  area

permits   the  successful  growth  of   this   much

cherished   vegetable,  which  possesses  medicinal

value  and is good for the health. It is said  that

the  same vegetable from Cameron Highlands is flat

to  the palate. While preserving the essence of the

vegetable by letting it continue growing in  Potong

Pasir,  the  Government  would  also  preserve  its

policy -just returns for hard work. I say, Sir, let

not  the  farmers be swallowed up by urban renewal.

Let  them continue sweating, toiling and doing what

they  love to do, until they are prepared  to  rest

their  aching  bones in a Housing  and  Development

Board  flat or to repose in deserved peace  in  the

bosom of the creator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that "nothing in life is for

free"  should  be  the axiom of every  Singaporean.

Many  still feel this is balderdash. But,  observe,

even  the air we breathe will cost much because  we

will  need to spend large sums of money to keep  it

fresh. The Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



will  have  a  task ahead to  eliminate  this

cancer  of  air,  water  and noise  pollution.  The

increased  attention the Government  is  giving  to

questions about the environment is most welcome. It

is   hoped  that  the  Environment  Ministry   will

indicate  priorities and act on them. The  work  of

this  Ministry will be important to the  well-being

of the community at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, my humble suggestions, Mr Speaker,

Sir, are that the Environment Ministry:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) selects problem areas and either take action

or make further inquiries;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) publishes information regarding the

environment  that otherwise would not be  available

to the public;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) establishes, where appropriate, international

co-operation to preserve the environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action to control pollution is the responsibility

of  the Government, industry, trade unions and  the

general public. All must be made aware of this, and

none    should   be   allowed   to   shirk    their

responsibilities.  Voluntary  organisations   could

also  play  a  valuable part in  mobilising  public

opinion about pollution problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to the pollution problem is the need to

strike  a  balance between the benefits of economic

growth  and the technological development on  which

it  depends,  on the one hand, with  the  costs  in

terms of harm to the environment, on the other. The

Government should institute a study of the costs of

pollution  as part of a wider action to provide  an

economic  framework  to  aid decision-making  about

those economic and technological developments whose

benefits are accompanied by some adverse effects on

the environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of forms, or causes, of

pollution  giving concern, and immediate action  is

necessary to deal with the most serious issues. Sea

pollution, for instance, can be limited if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



there  is  tight control on the dumping of  noxious

material; to limit noise pollution, there must be a

general reduction in levels; for refuse disposal on

land,  action  is  needed  to  firmly  control  the

disposal   of   toxic  wastes;  with  fresh   water

pollution,  ways and means will have to be  devised

to  meet the increasing demand for water, and I  am

glad  that  in  the  Addendum  to  the  President's

address,  the Ministry of the Environment indicates

the using up of valuable land for new reservoirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment will need to go

into  the qualifications and training of those  who

control  air,  water and noise pollution.  Constant

vigilance of international development of  improved

techniques for monitoring pollution will have to be

kept.   There  is  a  necessity  also  to  have   a

continuing appraisal of pesticides. Close proximity

with other bodies dealing with motor vehicle fumes,

disposal of farm wastes, oil pollution of  the  sea

and  clean air, must be preserved. Complex problems

.of  pollution have to be tackled in a sensible and

practical  manner.  Undoubtedly a  correct  balance

between economic benefit and environmental cost  is

difficult to achieve, but this is an urgent problem

that needs to be solved. It is especially important

to  take into account the costs and benefits to the

general  community,  and  in  some  instances   the

specific  effects  on workers, of  the  alternative

ways   of   promoting  economic  and  technological

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must pay for what we

want in life. But must some of the workers pay with

their  lives or mangled limbs! Occupational  Health

and  Safety  is  a  real problem in  Singapore.  It

concerns the well-being of more than half a million

people  in  their  daily work.  Finding  the  right

answers does not seem possible, but I hope to  make

some    contribution   that    will    provide    a

reinvigorated,  constructive  and  realistic   step

forward in an area where there is a crying need for

a  new  approach. Many people are  killed  at  work

yearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



and  many  more injured and more than 100,000  man-days

are  lost  annually because of  industrial  .

accidents  and  diseases. Quite  apart  from  human

tragedy  and  suffering, the waste of resources  is

colossal.  In  Singapore  today,  there  is  little

evidence  to suggest that the situation is  getting

better.  But there are signs suggesting a worsening

of  the  situation. Many new and difficult problems

will  arise  because  of  the  use  of  potentially

dangerous substances and materials. Some  of  these

present direct risks to the public as well  as  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can I humbly contribute the

following  suggestions  which  may  alleviate   the

problems:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That a more comprehensive and stringent

legislation, progressive in character  and  unified

under  a  single Act, be introduced for the benefit

of  all  the workers and also adequately protecting

the interests of the public;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the enforcement machinery for Health and

Safety  at  work  be  revitalised  into  a  better,

keener, more streamlined and more dedicated body;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That Health and Safety organisations at work-places

be  set up, charged with the responsibility

of  continuously monitoring and controlling  health

and  safety  problems as they  arise  and  as  they

change. For this to be successful, employers should

be  obliged  to  consult with  their  employees  on

Health and Safety measures;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That an education system be set up for

everyone  in  industry  to  stimulate  a  sustained

interest  and involvement in Health and  Safety  at

work;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That specialist training be given to safety

officers,  supervisors, technical staff  (including

engineers, chemists, plant designers, etc.), safety

instructors,  work study staff, specialist  workers

whose  work involves special risks, workers' safety

representatives  and all members  of  joint  safety

committees;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That Health and Safety be organised as an

integral function of management. Health and  Safety

must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



be accepted as a policy from top to bottom of every

undertaking,   and  this  must  be   reflected   in

organisation and methods throughout the works; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That there should be compulsory regular

medical  examination of workers at the  expense  of

their  employers to ensure fitness for  employment.

Apart  from  the wide range of jobs  in  which  the

safety of others is involved (transport drivers and

crane  drivers,  for example) and where  a  medical

examination  might  reveal  at  least  the  grosser

causes  for  action, any person returning  to  work

after  a  long bout of sickness, disabled  persons,

the  chronic sick, pregnant women and older workers

might  well benefit by medical appraisal  of  their

condition in relation to their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, certain sections of the

Workmen's  Compensation Act need to be reviewed  to

ensure   that  workers  are  fairly  treated.   For

instance,  in  Singapore today, an injured  workman

cannot  maintain  a  claim  on  his  employer   for

workmen's compensation and at the same time  pursue

a  claim  for  damages under Common Law.  The  same

applies  to  the next-of-kin of workers  killed  at

work.  Workers  or their relatives  have  to  elect

under  which heading they would take their  remedy,

and the acceptance of compensation is a barrier  to

a damages claim. In other words, it is compensation

or damages. Generally under Common Law, the quantum

of  compensation  is  higher  presuming  employers'

negligence.  Most workers and their  relatives  opt

for   workmen's  compensation,  because   of   this

legislation, and due to the worker being unemployed

or  dead  when  the  claim  is  made,  because  the

families  need the money. Other factors  considered

by the workers or their families are the protracted

nature of a law suit, the costs and the uncertainty

of the outcome, as proving employers' negligence is

not a cut-and-dry affair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible amendment to enable workers to obtain

a  just compensation, especially when employers are

negligent, is to allow workers to first accept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



payment  under the Workmen's Compensation  Act  and

then  if tort is successful later, the worker could

reimburse the compensation paid under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undue delays in the payment of compensation cause

workers and their families much hardship. The  time

taken  in finalising workmen's compensation  claims

varies  from case to case, depending on the  nature

of  the  accident  and the extent  of  the  injury.

Before  an  assessment can be made, it is necessary

to   ensure   that  the  claim  is  in  order   and

substantiated by an authentic medical  report.  All

the red tape is appreciated, but how do the workers

and  their families survive while all this is going

on?  Surely a satisfactory compromise can be worked

out with either government or employers; this could

be stipulated in the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a problem which presents a

challenge to both sides of industry, management and

workers  alike  is  "occupational  dermatitis",   a

condition  arising  out of one's  work.  It  needs,

however,  to be emphasised that dermatitis  is  not

confined to industry alone. Household and gardening

duties are all a possible source of contraction  of

dermatitis. At one time it was being contended that

the  use of modern detergents and cleansers carried

a   distinct   risk  of  dermatitis,   though   the

manufacturers  of  such  products  could   strongly

dispute   this.   However,  our  consideration   is

industrial dermatitis and we have to recognise that

this  scourge  is  a particular feature  of  modern

industry  bringing with it not only much  suffering

and  inconvenience for workers afflicted  but  also

retarding   the   country's   productive    output.

Dermatitis  is most common in industrial  processes

where   raw   materials  are  handled.   Chemicals,

alkalies,  de-greasing agents,  coal-tar  products,

mineral   oils   and  artificial  adhesives   cause

dermatitis.  Not  only is it necessary  to  impress

upon  employers the need to adopt the  most  modern

methods in order to combat dermatitis, but there is

also an equal need for Government to include in the

Second  Schedule to the principal Act "Occupational

Dermatitis" as a compensable disease.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is unjust to pay the

industrious  the same quantum as the indolent.  But

how  do we get about correcting this injustice? The

obvious  answer  is  the introduction  of  a  merit

premium or a performance allowance. This additional

allowance  is  determined  by, the  quantity   and

quality of the workers' products. This system would

mean  that over and above the basic wage, a  worker

can take home additional sums of money according to

his daily performance at work. The introduction  of

such  a  system  would ensure that those  who  work

harder would be amply rewarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, maintaining and continuing the rapid pace of

industrial  and  economic growth in  Singapore  for

continued  high growth rates is not an  easy  task.

The   willingness  to  work  cannot  be  inculcated

without  the  co-operation  of  both  workers   and

entrepreneurs.  The  working  relationship  between

entrepreneurs and labour many a time is  aggravated

by   suspicion,  false  fears  and  self-destroying

opposition.   Until  there  is  a  harmonious   and

positive  co-operation  and  unity  of  purpose  in

industrial life, struggles for higher productivity,

increasing efforts and better standards  of  living

can make little progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A requirement for the right sort of leadership

especially in management is visualised because this

leadership   determines  the   quality   of   human

relations and morale in any enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously, entrepreneurs make attempts to

motivate workers by monetary incentives only.  This

does  not  achieve the all-important  goal  of  the

realisation that workers are human beings  and  not

economic digits. Workers want, most of all, to be a

part  of  society,  their opinions  respected,  and

doing  their  lot in ensuring the  success  of  the

nation.  They  cannot and must not  be  treated  as

second-rate  by management. They should  always  be

treated as a part of the company in which they work

in because the success or failure of the enterprise

is  largely  dependent  on them.  There  should  be

created  a  greater  sense of  participation  among

employees and job-satisfaction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If workers are made a part of the company on a co-operative

basis, the incentive to work harder  for

the  success  of their enterprise will be  ensured.

This  is evident in Japan. The communion of thought

between   management   and, workers   successfully

implemented ultimately leads to a stable industrial

relations  climate, which is important socially  as

well as economically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tripartite association of Government,

entrepreneurs   and  labour,   Government   has   a

responsibility to take a fundamental  step  forward

to establish this co-operative relationship between

entrepreneurs  and  labour. The  changes  envisaged

would  mean  new  obligations, on entrepreneurs  as

well  as  labour.  New rights  would  be  given  to

labour,  and  new  powers and  responsibilities  to

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  echo  the  sentiments of the Member  for  Telok

Blangah  by  stressing that there is  a  dearth  of

concern  over the aged and underprivileged.  It  is

not  their  fault that they are old,  deaf,  blind,

dumb,   mentally   handicapped  or   spastic.   The

Government  must pledge a guaranteed share  in  our

rising   national   prosperity   for   these   less

fortunate. Most certainly we are conscious  of  the

many  difficulties at present experienced by  these

people.  I urge that immediate action be  taken  to

provide  more  adequate and  imaginative  help  for

them.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to add my support to the motion by the

hon.   Member  for  Bukit  Batok.  The  President's

address contains many good, guidelines and policies

which  the Government will implement over the  next

five years. I feel that every citizen should assist

the  Government to achieve these objectives in  the

coming years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important stress on quality is well accepted

by  all concerned, and we welcome the formation  of

the  Ministry of the Environment for preserving and

striving   towards   a   better   environment   for

Singapore. While it is accepted that this  Ministry

has an important function







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



to  perform, we also have to recognise some of  the

difficulties  that  it will  face  with  regard  to

staffing and the lack of many experienced personnel

in  implementing  some of these  policies.  In  our

eagerness  to  preserve the  environment,  we  must

ensure that unnecessary hardship is not placed upon

innocent people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the setting up of the Ministry

of  the  Environment  is being received  with  some

mixed feelings by some members of the public. There

is  a  fear  by this hesitant group that the  over-enthusiasm

in the implementation of some  of  these

policies  without proper knowledge  and  study  can

cause   extreme   hardship  to   some   industries,

especially the local small industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that some local industries

over the past year have been quite apprehensive  of

what  the  Government actually intends to  do  with

regard  to pollution control problems, as there  is

no clear-cut guideline on what should or should not

be done. I would therefore like to suggest that the

new  Ministry of the Environment should issue  some

general  guidelines so that the  officers  of  this

Ministry  could implement the policy  in  the  true

spirit  of  the  legislation  rather  than  to  the

letter,  for  after all people who are earnest  and

sincere in wanting to help Government implement its

policies should not be penalised. But, on the other

hand,  we must also have a mechanism, or machinery,

to   identify   those  who  pay  lip  service   and

constantly  flout  the  law for  self-interest  and

benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the concerned members of the

public would like to know some clear-cut statements

from   this   Ministry  concerning   the   relevant

implementations.  Otherwise it  can  drive  away  a

number of new industries which ironically the other

Ministries  may  be trying very  hard  to  promote.

Moreover,  some existing industries feel  reluctant

to  expand  as  there is uncertainty regarding  the

enforcement of the environment laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of legislation to fight

pollution is obviously a step in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



right direction. However, there must be flexibility

in  its  enforcement as antipollution equipment  is

very  expensive and this may cause a strain on  the

finances of some small manufacturing firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to comment, Sir,

concerns the easing of manpower shortage. Singapore

is  presently facing an acute shortage of manpower,

especially  in  the  higher  levels.  These   high-calibred

and  experienced  personnel  cannot   be

created  overnight, but need to  be  nurtured  over

many  years.  One  of the ways to help  solve  this

problem  is the relaxation of immigration policies.

But  this  has  its  limitations,  among  the  most

obvious  being  the need for adjustment  to  a  new

environment, the lack of dedication and the  danger

of  importing people of dubious talents. Perhaps  a

more  realistic  way to help solve  and  ease  this

problem immediately is the conservation and  better

utilisation of existing selected manpower. This can

be done by allowing to reduce the annual leave with

financial compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is usually the experienced senior civil

servants  who  are most needed on  important  jobs.

Simultaneously,  they are the same  staff  who  are

eligible  for  the most annual leave by  virtue  of

their   seniority  and  their  length  of  service.

Consequently,   some   senior   staff   have   been

accumulating  their  leave to an  unhealthy  level.

Much  discontent  would result  if  some  of  their

annual leave are forfeited. This conflicting  state

of  affairs  can be alleviated for  the  better  by

compensating for shortening leave, if required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, senior staff are eligible

for  33,  or 39, or 42 days' annual leave  a  year,

depending  on seniority and length of  service,  in

comparison  with leave entitlement in  the  private

sector  of  14 or 21 days. In trying to equate  the

terms  of service in the public sector to those  in

the  private  sector,  this simple  fact  is  often

overlooked.  Therefore, in  the  re-examination  of

service conditions as mentioned in the addendum  to

the President's Address



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



(Ministry of Finance) for senior civil servants,  I

would  like to suggest that the reduction of annual

leave  for selected staff in exchange for financial

compensation should be studied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent unsatisfactory situation as regards

general  maintenance  of Far  East  Mansion  in  my

constituency has brought home the point of  another

social problem in Singapore. I therefore feel  that

the  House ought to re-examine the problem  of  the

administration  and  maintenance  of   the   common

property and common area of flatted buildings.  The

statutory     provision    which    governs     the

administration and maintenance of common  areas  of

flatted  buildings is the Land Titles (Strata)  Act

(Cap.  277)  which came into force on the  15th  of

May,  1968.  Part IV of this Act provides  for  the

setting   up   of  a  corporate  body  called   the

"Management   Corporation"   for   every    flatted

building.    The    Management    Corporation    is

administered by a Council selected from and by  the

owners  of flats in the flatted building.  Section

19  of  the Act sets Out the duties and obligations

of the Management Corporation among which it is the

duty  of  the Management Corporation to manage  and

properly  maintain  the  common  property  and  the

common  areas of the flatted building, and to  keep

the same in good and serviceable repair. Section 29

of   the   Act  provides  that  if  the  Management

Corporation is in default of its obligations  under

Section  19,  then the Management  Corporation  and

every  member of its Council shall be liable  to  a

fine not exceeding $500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, many flatted buildings in Singapore have

yet  to  set  up effective Management Corporations.

The  main  reason appears to be that it  is  rather

idealistic  and sometimes impracticable  to  expect

flat  owners  to  undertake the  responsibility  of

initiating the formation of the Council. Perhaps  a

separate department for the implementation of  Part

IV  of  the  Land  Titles (Strata)  Act  should  be

established by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interim measures adopted so far are for the

developer  of  the flatted building  to  undertake,

prior to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



setting   up   of   the   Management   Corporation,

responsibility  for the upkeep and  maintenance  of

the  common  areas. The undertaking is incorporated

usually  in  the Agreements for Sale  and  Purchase

between  each buyer of the flat and the  developer.

The  developer's  obligations here are,  therefore,

strictly  contractual and the only remedy available

to  the  owners of the flats in case of default  of

the  developer  is to institute  a  civil  suit  in

court.  This usually takes a long time, as  we  all

know.  This is clearly an unsatisfactory  state  of

affairs,  as  in the case of Far East Mansions  for

instance.   I  feel  that  the  public  have   been

inconvenienced to a great extent and measures ought

to  be  taken  by  the Government  to  rectify  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the statutory provisions of

a  Management  Corporation  be  made  to  apply  to

developers  so that any default of these  statutory

obligations to manage and keep in a state  of  good

repair the common property and the common areas  of

the  flatted building will result in the  developer

liable  to a fine in the court. This calls  for  an

amendment  to the Land Titles (Strata) Act,  and  I

feel  that  this  may  act as a  deterrent  to  the

housing   developer  who,  very  often  after   the

erection  and disposal of the flatted  building  to

the  members  of the public, neglect  to  keep  the

common  areas  in  a  state  of  good  repair   and

condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to touch on, Sir, is

our  aims to create more satisfying and better paid

jobs  in Singapore. In this area, there is much  to

be  done  in  upgrading the skills of our  workers,

although the Ministry of Education and the tertiary

institutions  have' been expanded.  This  alone  is

insufficient, as the institutions can  do  no  more

than  provide basic training. In order  to  achieve

higher   technology  and  better  skills  to   make

Singapore into a service centre, there is a need to

have  better cooperation and understanding  between

those  who  work in the Government departments  and

those  in  the private sector. Therefore,  I  would

like  to suggest that a more effective consultative

machinery be established.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah

Hui):  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in supporting  the  motion

moved  by the hon. Member for Bukit Batok, thanking

the President for his thought-provoking Address,  I

take  the opportunity to elaborate on some  of  the

points mentioned concerning the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the Addendum to the Address, we

will  allow  industries  or enterprises  with  high

technology  or  higher  skill  content,   and   the

prospects  of  more sophisticated  manufacture,  to

recruit  labour on work permits liberally. This  is

to  ensure  that the growth of our industries  will

not  be  hampered  through lack  of  manpower.  The

Government  is  now working on a new  scheme  which

will  enable work permits to be issued readily  and

more  expeditiously  to  what  we  consider  to  be

"priority  industries". A list of  such  industries

will  be  drawn up and the scheme will be carefully

implemented  through greater co-operation  and  co-ordination

between the Economic Development  Board

and  the  Labour  Ministry.  We  will  also  inform

employers of the scheme so as to facilitate them in

the recruitment of foreign workers. In other words,

everything possible will be done to ensure that our

industries as well as those to be set up will  have

the requisite number of workers with the right type

of  qualities  needed by them. Would-be  investors,

therefore,  need not have unnecessary  fears  about

difficulties in recruitment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, however, we should not depend

too  much  upon the immigrant workers to  meet  our

labour requirements. More important, we must  train

and  upgrade the skills of our own workers not only

to   meet   the   needs  of  our  industrialisation

programme  but  also  to raise  their  standard  of

living    through    increased    efficiency    and

productivity,  and hence higher  wages.  This  task

calls  for  the  joint effort  of  Government,  the

employers and the trade unions. The Government will

do its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



part  mainly through the Industrial Training  Board

to be set up soon. The Board will undertake and co-ordinate

all  aspects  of  industrial   training,

including apprenticeship schemes as well as-on-the-job

and  off-the-job  training.  It, will   also

regulate  and  control  such  training  schemes  to

ensure  that  the  training  given  is  of  a  high

standard   and  relevant  to  the  needs   of   our

industries.  In  this  way,  a  growing   pool   of

technically   skilled  personnel   will   be   made

available  to  effectively meet the demands  of  an

increasingly industrialised economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep abreast with the changing times, it is

necessary  for  our employers to adopt  modern  and

scientific  management  techniques.  The   National

Productivity Board will act as a catalyst  in  this

regard.  By  conducting  seminars,  workshops   and

training   courses,   and   providing   consultancy

services, the National Productivity Board will also

help   to   raise   the  quality   of   management,

particularly   in   its  relationship   with,   and

efficient use of, workers. The Board will not cater

exclusively   to   the   larger   industries    and

organisations. Every effort will be made to  ensure

that small and medium-sized establishments can also

benefit  from  its services. As the  management  of

these  small  and  medium-sized establishments  are

mostly  Chinese-educated, the Board  has  recruited

some  Nantah  graduates  so that  its  consultancy,

training   and   other   services   can   also   be

beneficially utilised by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another urgent task of the Board is to help those

labour-intensive firms to modernise and  mechanise.

In the present tight labour market, these firms are

finding it increasingly difficult in recruiting and

retaining  workers  as  they  are  unable  to   pay

competitive   wage  rates  and  other   terms   and

conditions  of service. Unless they are  modernised

and  mechanised soon, they will be left far  behind

by  the  wheel  of progress and may have  to  close

down.  This  is  a  serious matter  to  which  more

attention    should   be   given.   The    National

Productivity  Board  will  establish  a  Low   Cost

Automation  Unit to help these firms to  mechanise.

The Unit will advise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



on  the  application of inexpensive standard pieces

of  equipment to achieve mechanisation,  previously

done  manually. The aim is to reduce human  effort,

(either physical or mental, required for each  unit

of production in order to increase productivity. It

is    an    intermediate   stage   between   simple

mechanisation and complete automation. I would urge

labour-intensive firms to make extensive use of the

Unit for their town well-being and survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sustain and accelerate our present pace of

economic  development, we have  no  option  but  to

continue  to pursue our policy of industrial  peace

with  justice.  This  calls  for  an  orderly   and

equitable  distribution of  the  additional  wealth

created  by  the  joint efforts of  the  tripartite

partners.   The   National   Wages   Council    has

recommended,  and the Government  has  accepted,  a

wage increase of 8 per cent for this year. Although

the necessary enabling legislations have yet to  be

promulgated, I am glad to note that,  true  to  the

spirit  of  tripartism, the  employers,  the  trade

unions  and the Government have agreed on 23rd  May

this  year that negotiations on the recommendations

could  commence  without  waiting  for  legislative

amendments. To-date, 17 trade unions have concluded

negotiations with 199 establishments providing  for

increased  wages  for  some  38,000  workers.  More

workers will benefit from the recommendations  when

negotiations   between  their  unions   and   their

employers are concluded. This figure, however, does

not  include those non-unionised workers,  many  of

whom,  I  am  informed, have also been  given  wage

increases  by  their  employers.  As  long  as  the

employers  are fair and responsible and  the  trade

unions  do  not  make  excessive  and  unreasonable

demands, the future promises better living for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, increasing the wages of the

workers alone will not help to bring about gracious

living  and  higher quality of life.  At  the  same

time, we must also provide the workers with what is

sometimes  referred to as the "psychic income".  By

this,  I  mean we should provide them with a  clean

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



safe  working environment which will  give  them  a

sense  of personal pride and satisfaction in  their

jobs.  Only then can we urge them to give of  their

best.  The  Government  will,  therefore,  ever  be

watchful  and vigilant against those employers  who

neglect the welfare of their workers for their  own

selfish  ends. We will impose yet higher  standards

of  welfare,  safety and health in  the  workplaces

through more stringent and effective enforcement of

the Factories Act and other safety regulations.  We

have   also   re-introduced  in  this  Session   of

Parliament  a  new Factories Bill which  will  give

more powers to the Minister and the Chief Inspector

of  Factories  to deal with recalcitrant  employers

and employees alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to always remember that we in

Singapore  value the welfare, health and safety  of

our  workers. The socialist philosophy of  the  PAP

does  not permit us to achieve economic advancement

by  sacrificing  the workers. Sacrifices  must  and

will   be  made;  but  they  must  come  from  all,

including the employers. Our workers must never  be

subjected   to   the   same  indignities,   inhuman

conditions and exploitations which characterize the

Industrial  Revolutions  of  the  West.  For  these

reasons, we will continue to expand the Labour  and

Factory  Inspectorates of the  Ministry  to  ensure

that  the  standards of welfare, safety and  health

enshrined  in  our  Labour laws are  respected  and

enforced.  In  fact,  these two Inspectorates  have

already  stepped  up  their  inspections  of  work-places.

During  the period from 8th  September  to

21st October this year they successfully prosecuted

69 employers for infringements of the Labour laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, priority will be given to

the  inspections of those establishments that  have

not  been  visited in their life span. The majority

of these establishments are small and non-unionised

organisations  with  high  infringement  and   non-compliance

rate, either because of exploitation  by

employers  or ignorance of the law. A Special  Unit

of  experienced  officers will also be  established

within the Labour







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspectorate to crack down on difficult and

elusive employers. Relieved from routine inspection

duties, these officers will also have more time  to

probe  into  and  help  solve,  whenever  possible,

genuine  difficulties encountered by both employers

and employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Labour has a

very  difficult  task to perform.  We  must  always

ensure  that  a "happy medium" between the  workers

and  employers is maintained or face  an  explosive

build-up  which will ultimately rock  our  existing

industrial stability on which our economic progress

is   founded.   Whatever  the  odds   and   however

unpleasant the task may be, we will do whatever has

to  be  done  firmly but fairly,  without  fear  or

favour.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the speech delivered by the President

at  the  opening  of  the  First  Session  of  this

Parliament  has, to my mind, clearly  outlined  the

concept of development for Singapore in the  1970s.

If,  with the confidence and support of the people,

the  Government  can  implement  its  policies  and

achieve its objectives of nation building, then  at

the  end  of the 1970s, our Republic will  be  more

prosperous than ever before. That is why I am  very

optimistic about our future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly feel that the evolution of our nation

is  unique. To my mind, in the 1950s when the anti-colonial

movement  was  at  its  peak,  the  fight

against colonial forces was not the hardest part in

our  efforts at nation building. This is especially

so after the Bandung Conference in the mid-fifties.

At   that  time  colonialism  was  already  on  the

decline, and the last counter attack by colonialism

was   only   a   dying  struggle.  Following   this

historical development, the anti-colonial  struggle

in  this favourable setup in Singapore was able  to

keep up with the trend of the time and thus by  the

end  of the fifties we were able to enter the phase

of  a  self-governing state without any difficulty.

Having crossed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



the  threshold  of  self-government,  as  all  the

Members  of  Parliament here know,  we  could  very

easily  have  wiped  out  the  remnant  forces   of

colonialism  and  achieved  independence.  However,

because  of  our  geographical position  and  other

factors  our  course  of  development  was  not   a

straight-forward one. In other words, in  the  last

twenty  years,  apart from struggling  against  the

oppression of colonialism, we also had to face  the

challenges of Communism and communalism.  Hitherto,

those who touched on the history of the development

of  newly emergent countries used to put the  blame

on   colonialism  for  every  evil,  as  though  by

castigating  the  ugly figure of colonialism,  they

could  help  fulfil  the task  of  nation  building

smoothly. Even now outside this House, the  Barisan

Sosialis is still harping on the outdated old  tune

of anti-colonialism. Fortunately enough, the people

of  Singapore are not as naive and obstinate as the

Barisan  Sosialis, otherwise we would  not  have  a

Singapore as prosperous as we have today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is that as we enter

into  the early 1970s, the threat we may face  from

colonialism  will diminish, while  the  two-pronged

attack  we  may face from Communism and communalism

will  increasingly  be  greater.  However,  of  the

forces of Communism and communalism, the forces  of

communalism seem to become the centre of  attention

of  the world. During the conflict between the U.S.

and  Russia,  the  Russian chief  delegate  at  the

United  Nations made a lengthy speech lasting  some

14  hours, a feat which can hardly be repeated. The

late  U.S. Secretary of State, Foster Dulles' grand

strategy of anti-Communism has gone into the waste-paper

basket by President Nixon's visit to Peking.

Even the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is also

on the decline and now thrown into disarray. On the

other  hand,  the  Czechoslovak  incident  and  the

Hungarian  uprising together with  the  Sino-Russia

ideological  polemics  are the  first  symptoms  of

division in the world Communist movement which  has

led   to   the  dismantling  of  monolithic   world

Communism..







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore, in the new decade of

the l970s, the threat from world Communism that  we

may  face  will be less and secondary  as  compared

with  that posed ten years ago. But this  does  not

mean  that "The Voice of the Revolution of  Malaya"

will be without its latent influence. At least,  in

recent years, the increasing Communist forces along

the Malaysia-Thailand border is a reminder and food

for thought for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a world renowned

historian who tried to revise certain teachings  of

communalism by playing down the destructive  forces

of  communalism. However, in between the  lines  of

his book traces of communalism lurk throughout. The

Biafran war in Nigeria is the most tragic event  in

the  history of civilised man and the tragic  civil

war  in Cyprus between the Greeks and the Turks  is

still lingering on. The May 13th incident resulting

from  the  general  elections in  Malaysia,  though

described by some people as a storm in a teacup  is

by  no means an insignificant cause for concern for

us when compared with the incident of banishment of

British Asians in Uganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the world situation is concerned, the

bipolarisation  of  the world  by  Russia  and  the

United  States has almost become something  of  the

past.  Instead a new complex world has  emerged,  a

world  in which the Chinese, the Russians  and  the

Americans are vying with one another for spheres of

influence, a world which is more radical, amorphous

and complex. Some countries for ideological reasons

try  to broaden their sphere of influence by taking

sides  with other countries; others, due to  racial

conflicts  in certain countries try to  take  sides

with  countries  with closer blood affinity.  Some,

because  of  economic interests or  conflicts,  are

forced  willy-nilly to take sides as their economic

interest dictates. It is by no means clear  who  is

right  and who is wrong in such melee, as  much  as

there  is no distinction between the white and  the

black.  Small nations which try to survive in  such

context   if   not   cautious  or   through   wrong

calculation would easily find themselves involved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



in such entanglement and become victims  of

other powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, this is the real world that we are

facing,  in which we seek survival and development.

It  is  a  world  that is far from ideal.  We  must

contrive to seek our survival and fortunes in  this

world.  For us and for our friends, we must try  to

carve  out a corner in the sun in this part of  the

world.  This  is  the  substance  of  the  national

objective   of   Singapore  as  stressed   in   the

Presidential  address. In the course of  trying  to

achieve  this  objective, the people  of  Singapore

must  always  be  very cautious and  alert  and  be

prepared  for any eventualities. Only then  are  we

able  to maintain, preserve and ensure the survival

and  progress of the international metropolis  that

we  have built up in Singapore. On the contrary, if

we  cannot  ensure achievement of  further  success

upon  success,  or if we allow the  ingredients  of

success   to  become  a  spent  force,   then   the

achievements that we have built up over  the  years

will be gone with the wind, and so will our efforts

in   building   a  better  future  for   our   next

generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree that in the initial stages of

nation building, if the national objectives are not

always kept in the forefront of the mind, then  the

nation  will not be on the way to further  success.

From  the valuable experience of our struggles over

the  last  seven or eight years, the President  has

dealt in his address the most fundamental aspect of

our   nation   building,  i.e, the  Constitutional

amendments  to  provide "that no surrender  of  our

sovereignty,  or  any  part  thereof,  by  way   of

incorporation into, or federation with,  any  other

country is possible, unless two-thirds of the total

electorate vote positively for it in a referendum",

so that no traitors may sell out Singapore. This is

the  most  important key to the  assurance  of  the

Republic's identity, and it also marks a  milestone

in  our  effort from one victory to another greater

victory.  It  is only on this foundation  that  the

national leaders will then be able to further unite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



our  people  to ensure that Singapore will  forever

weather any storm or any turbulence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's address makes special reference

to  the importance of Constitutional amendments  to

the  survival of Singapore, and this is the  reason

why  I  find  it most encouraging. It is  also  the

reason  why  I have chosen in my maiden  speech  to

analyse the international situation in relation  to

its  possible  effects on the future of  Singapore.

Sir,  in the years to come, the rise and fall,  the

success  or failure of Singapore will be determined

more   by  factors  outside  Singapore  than  those

inside.  But,  the  basic factor that  will  enable

Singapore to weather all storms will be the  stable

development  of nationalism in Singapore.  We  must

always bear this in mind, whether it is to be a tri-polar

world  of the Soviet Union,  China  and  the

United States, or whether it is going to be a multi-polar

world of China, the United States, the Soviet

Union,  Japan and Germany, the people of  Singapore

must  always  regard  national  interests  as  most

important. We must always bear in mind the maxim of

not  to  be corrupted by wealth, changed by poverty

or succumbed by force. It is only then that we will

be  able,  with  determination and  capability,  to

combat   against  the  centrifugal  force  of   the

ignoramus  who  are  being manipulated  by  foreign

interests.  It  is  only then that  we  can  ensure

further and more rapid success for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while dealing with the proposed

Constitutional  amendments  as  mentioned  in   the

President's  speech, I would avail  myself  of  the

opportunity  to  make an appeal that  a  patriotism

movement be launched systematically in Singapore to

ensure that the people of the various races will be

able  to become more united under the flag  of  our

Republic so that each one may give of his best as a

member  of  a  united community. The President  has

given  an  example of how selfish  people  in  some

countries  have  tried  to stop  working,  to  stop

making profits when they reach the surtax level,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



and  some  of them have gone overseas to  stay  for

more  than  six  months in order  to  avoid  paying

income  tax  on the dividends they earn on  foreign

investments.  If this kind of deleterious  thinking

is  allowed to take root in Singapore, I am  afraid

it  will  be cancerous to our morale. We have  read

from newspapers that in highly developed countries,

administrators  and executives have  taken  to  the

perfunctory attitude of working a day and living  a

day.  In  relation to their own duties,  they  have

adopted  the  philosophy of seeking  no  merit  and

getting no blame. They become clock-watchers. In so

far  as they are concerned, working more or working

less  means  the same in salary. If  there  is  any

difference,  the difference is: to  do  more  means

more  errors; to do less means less errors; and  to

do  nothing means no errors. So for a small country

like Singapore, which is without a very long rooted

foundation  in  nation building, if such  poisonous

philosophy is allowed to take root, then there will

be endless disasters for our Republic. To put it in

a  nutshell, nationalism has been surging very high

after  the War and it is this spirit of nationalism

that  has  enabled  Singapore  to  shake  off   the

shackles of colonial rule and the various pressures

of  the  big  powers  on our nationalists,  and  to

become   an   independent  sovereign   multi-racial

country.  Hereafter,  the  future  prosperity   and

stability of our country will ensure us a permanent

place in this complex world from which we can  cast

our light around.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the 9th of August, 1965, Singaporeans

have  been  relying on themselves. We  Singaporeans

should  keep  our eyes and ears open  to  gain  the

experiences   from   all  quarters   as   to   what

constitutes   the  driving  force  behind   further

success  and further development. This will  ensure

that we will become honourable Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the motion in the name of

the Member for Bukit Batok.

<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  four years and five months ago we met in this

Chamber  on  a  similar occasion  and  focused  our

attention  on  a  number  of  problems,  the   most

important  of  which  was the anticipated  economic

recession  resulting  from the  withdrawal  of  the

British forces by the end of 1971. We set ourselves

three  objectives. First, to build up an  effective

defence  capability.  Second,  to  achieve  greater

economic   growth,  more  export  markets,   higher

productivity, sound labour management relations and

more jobs. And third, to develop in our society  an

enhanced   national   consciousness   of   problems

affecting  the  nation  whereby  the  people  would

accept  the  subordination  of  their  personal  or

sectional  interests to those of the  nation  as  a

whole. The return of 65 of us to this Parliament by

the people is an acknowledgement of our achievement

of the objectives we set ourselves in 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected economic recession was averted by

the considerable foreign investment in our economy.

Our  economy went on to register remarkable  growth

rates. In March this year, the Finance Minister  in

his  Budget Statement was able to disclose  a  14.1

per cent Gross National Product average growth rate

from  1966 to 1970 and a growth of 14 per  cent  in

1971 over the preceding year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The per capita income in 1968 was $1,987. In 1971

it  stood  at $3,029 registering an average  growth

rate  of  13  per cent through the five years.  Our

external trade, which in 1968 was $8,974.5 million,

has  grown to $14,395.5 million in June this  year.

Our  country's  overseas assets  had  increased  13

times  in the past 13 1/4 years, and stood at $4,200

million  in August this year. Internal and external

assets stood at $10,000 million after depreciation.

More jobs have been created by an increasing number

of  industries and through expansion in the service

and manufacturing industries. The economy is viable

and  provides reason for considerable  optimism  in

the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Finance, it is

stated that our fast rate of economic growth can be

sustained  through a policy which will  ensure  the

availability of adequate capital, land and suitable

labour,  i.e, the essential factors of  production.

Capital accumulation resulting from more savings by

the  populace will occur if saving from our  income

becomes  a social habit. Towards this end the  mass

media  and, in particular, television, can make  an

important  contribution. Land reclamation  has  to-date

added 1,538 more acres to the country's total

land area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pace of industrialisation mounts, the

demand  for  the  necessary industrial  skills  and

expertise  will be increasingly acute.  Fortunately

plans  to  make available such skills and expertise

have    been   implemented   and   our   vocational

institutes,     industrial    training     centres,

Polytechnic  and  Universities  are  producing  the

required  skilled manpower. Perhaps there could  be

greater  emphasis  in the policy  to  persuade  our

womenfolk to take to industrial work. The provision

of   suitable   creches  near  industrial   estates

combined with reasonable wages may secure a sizable

portion  of  the  200,000  industrially  employable

female  workers  for the manufacturing  industries.

The  plans for human resources development proposed

by   the   Labour  Ministry  are  crucial  to   our

industrial progress in view of the estimation  that

our industrial labour force should reach 375,000 if

it  is  to  effectively support our  industries  in

1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told of the Ministry's intention to be

discriminating in its selection of industries so as

to encourage those industries which in turn set off

other  supporting industries, those  which  upgrade

manpower  skills and those which do  not  ruin  our

environment.  This policy is imperative  as  it  is

fairly  evident today that we must survive  in  the

future  as  citizens of a city  state  -  a  highly

industrialised  global city. To do  so,  our  chief

resource, our human resource, must keep apace  with

the  more  developed  societies  of  the  world  in

technological, flair, skill and expertise. Such







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



skill  and expertise may indigenise in our manpower

through   management   supervision   and   tutelage

conducted  by foreign technocrats in certain  major

industries  which  has been induced  to  invest  in

Singapore. However, we need to be cautious with the

multi-national companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A characteristic feature of the multi-national

company   is  that  its  subsidiaries,  which   are

established  in  the  manufacturing  and  marketing

centres  of the globe, take on different  roles  in

the  production  of  the final  product.  Not  much

technological   or  managerial   skill   would   be

transmitted  to our manpower if the  subsidiary  of

the  multi-national company in Singapore  takes  on

the  role of producing simple component parts while

the  integration and assembly of the final  product

which  calls  for much technological  expertise  is

done in another country. The multi-national company

is  the corporate organisation of the times. It  is

gigantic  and  wields much power, it can  determine

the price of raw materials, components and finished

products  at  which its subsidiaries buy  and  sell

between     themselves.    Transactions     between

subsidiaries at different buying and selling prices

can result in money leaving the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our city will soon be a manufacturing and

marketing centre and a strategic location  for  the

multi-national. There is much to know of the multi-national,

the   scope  of  its  operations,   its

technique  and  its power if we are to  enter  into

dealings with it beneficially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant point to note is that the interests

of  Government  which are organised on  a  national

basis  might run counter to the interests of multi-national

companies which are organised on a  global

scale  for  the  interests of a limited  number  of

people  outside the country. In this  connection  I

came  across in my reading what purports  to  be  a

definition of the proper duty of an executive in  a

multi-national company, formulated by its chairman.

I  must admit that I was disturbed. This definition

of  the  proper  duty  of a multi-national  company

required the executive to:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`set aside any nationalistic attitudes and

appreciate that in the last resort his loyalty must

be  to the shareholders of the parent company,  and

he  must protect the interests of the company  even

if  it might appear that it was not perhaps in  the

national  interest of the country in which  he  was

operating  despite  apparent  conflicts,   as   the

transfer of funds at a period of national crisis, a

transfer  of  production  from  one  subsidiary  to

another, or a transfer of export business'.



<br><br>In  view  of  what I have said, I  would  urge  the

development of the proper expertise in the Ministry

of  Finance  which  can adequately  cope  with  the

activities of these corporate organisations, so  as

to  ensure in the future that the Government is all

the time in control of the multi-national companies

which choose to operate in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that in his Address the President has

stressed the need for work ethic. Our acceptance of

the  work  ethic  has carried us through  difficult

times.  Its  rejection now will push  us  down  the

slide.  The caution is timely. A new generation  of

adults  is in employment and its capacity for  hard

work  is being tested. There are distractions.  The

general  affluence of members of  this  generation,

the  availability  of varieties  of  entertainment,

their independence and the self-hypnotising ballads

which  preach  opting out of society in  preference

for   "constructive  prostration",  whatever   that

means.  But  if we carefully watch the excesses  of

this  generation and provide direction and example,

we  should continue to succeed in bringing to  bear

upon  our  people  the meaning of the  advice  that

"nobody in Singapore owes anybody a living."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addendum to the President's Speech on the

Ministry   of  National  Development  projects   an

environment  which  is  most  welcome.  It  is   an

environment of high-rise dwelling which  takes  the

man,  the individual, the person in our society  as

the  measure of development and progress,  and  not

statistics   of  housing  achievement.   The   more

spacious  and  better designed flats,  recreational

and  social facilities, the gardens and parks,  all

these   will   go  a  long  way  in   meeting   the

expectations of the young flat dwellers who do  not

have the experience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



of  the sordid slums of  the  mid-50s  to

appreciate the progress in the transition from slum

to flat dwelling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not possible for me to

comment  on  all  the  policies  described  in  the

addenda  of the various Ministries. I am sure  that

on   reading   them  our  people  will   have   the

satisfaction  that the Government has  meticulously

planned for our security and welfare well into  the

years ahead including, Sir, the improvement of  the

address  system in this Chamber. However, assurance

of  our continued success must be qualified by  (a)

the  absence  of a world monetary crisis;  (b)  our

collective will and effort to succeed; and (c)  the

absence of disruptive international events  in  the

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1968 a series of dramatic events have taken

place  in East and Southeast Asia, the full results

of  which have yet to unfold. Within a period of 11

months,  the  United Nations admitted the  People's

Republic of China to the world community; President

Nixon   visited  Peking  and  later  Moscow;  Prime

Minister  Tanaka  visited Peking, followed  by  the

cessation  of  diplomatic relations between  Taiwan

and  Japan  and  the  impending  normalisation   of

relations  between Japan and the People's  Republic

of  China.  At  the moment an end  to  the  war  in

Vietnam   might   not   be  an  improbability.   In

international  politics we are not so  remote  from

these  events  that  they have no  bearing  on  our

position. What has to evolve in the region is a new

structure   of  tensions  which  will   give   some

definition  to  the alignments of super  and  major

powers  interested in the region. But whatever  the

outcome of these events, the Government will act to

ensure  our  survival as a people of an independent

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last elections, self-acclaimed leaders of

political   parties  opposing  us  campaigned   for

government of the country on the promise of release

from  so-called  social and political  restrictions

and  the  start of a new style of life. The  people

put  paid  to these leaders. It is likely  that  an

attempt will be made again in the next elections to

fool the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



young   electorate.   These   advocates   of    the

inalienability  of  human rights  are  prepared  to

beguile  our  people while in countries  around  us

governments have, through the imposition of martial

law,  shelved constitutional and inalienable rights

in  bulk  to  attempt  a  reconstruction  of  their

societies and countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all of us understand that the priority of the

issues  for  our nation is first how to keep  alive

and  then how to live and not any other combination

which reverses the issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be confronted with more challenges in the

next  five  years. However, we may draw  confidence

from  the  fact that through the present  political

leadership  there is gradually being  generated  in

our social dynamic a national instinct for survival

- an instinct which can recognise a national threat

and  can respond to the need for a realistic course

of  action  to  adequately deal with  it.  For  us,

vigilance,  hard work, the will to  succeed  and  a

sense  of  realism  is the price of  our  survival.

There is no other way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have pleasure in supporting

the  motion  calling for a vote of  thanks  to  the

President for his Address to the House.



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on  behalf of the  people  of  Paya

Lebar,  I would like to support the motion  in  the

name of the Member for Bukit Batok. The standard of

living  of  our  people in Singapore has  increased

with  the  rapid economic development and progress.

Although  it has only been a short space  of  eight

years  since our independence, the people  are  now

enjoying  political stability and economic success,

thereby  posturing us as one of the most  fortunate

people in the whole of Southeast Asia. While we are

making  rapid  progress in the economic  front,  we

must  also  realise  that  there  are  always   two

versions  of  a story. Therefore, while  we  cannot

expect our leaders to catch up immediately with the

standard of the advanced countries in the world, we

can, however, be assured that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



with  continuing drive and dynamism, together  with

concerted  efforts on the part of  the  people,  we

will  gradually  be  able to  keep  pace  with  the

advanced  countries. If we take two steps when  the

advanced  countries take only one, and if  we  take

one  year to do what they need to do in two  years,

then  if  we can move at this pace we will soon  be

able to narrow the gap between our own country  and

the  advanced countries. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in  the

Presidential  Address, we have been told  that  the

pace of our economic growth is to be maintained and

accelerated in the years to come. Only then will we

be able to maintain high standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same Address, reference is also made to

the  salary structure of the civil servants,  which

will  come  under  review. This, of  course,  is  a

matter for rejoice. But I feel that while the terms

and conditions of service and remuneration of civil

servants  are  being reviewed, supervision  of  the

civil  service and the correction of their attitude

to  work should go on at the same time. Sir, proper

work  ethos should be created in our civil service.

This was obtained some years ago when we first took

office. For some time past, the civil servants  had

been  working  very well with the correct  attitude

and the right spirit. This won them the acclaim  of

the people. But after a lapse of several years, the

old trouble took a relapse. Perhaps this is because

in  the  early  stages of our nation building,  our

Ministers were too occupied with the many  problems

so   that  they  were  not  able  to  devote  their

attention to this aspect of the civil service, i.e.

to maintain a correct attitude towards work and the

right spirit to be adopted in the civil service. In

view  of this, Sir, when reference is made  to  the

restructuring of the civil service salary scales, I

feel  that the inculcation of the correct  attitude

towards work should be made at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that remuneration must be compatible

with  the  responsibilities of the job in order  to

attract  and  retain  the right  calibre  of  civil

servants. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



at the same time there is a small minority of

civil servants who are guilty of very poor service,

particularly  the plain-clothes Health  inspectors,

or    building   inspectors.   These   people   are

discourteous and bureaucratic in the performance of

their duties, particularly when they deal with  the

public.  They  are pompous and throw  their  weight

around  especially among those people in the  rural

areas  who are ignorant. I therefore feel that  the

Government  should  wield  the  big  axe  and  take

immediate  action  to chop down  these  people.  We

cannot  allow  the  good reputation  of  the  civil

service  and  the  Government to  be  spoilt  by  a

minority  of  these  pompous and discourteous  "bad

hats"  or black sheep. If these black sheep in  the

civil  service  are allowed to throw  their  weight

about  among  the  people, particularly  the  rural

folk,  then after some time the people will have  a

very  bad impression of the civil service  and  the

Government. As a result of this, whatever efficient

service  that  has  been given  to  the  people  in

general will be written off. I therefore appeal  to

the  Minister  concerned to deal with  those  civil

servants who are bringing the entire civil  service

into disrepute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of education, we

all  know that Singapore is multi-racial and multi-lingual,

an international metropolis. The people of

Singapore should not only know their mother tongue,

but  also a second language, particularly when  the

second language is English. This, Sir, has been the

consistent policy of the Government, and  is  being

implemented by the Ministry of Education. Steps are

also being taken to improve the methods of teaching

in  the  hope  that  our next  generation  will  be

sufficiently  proficient  in  two  languages  after

completion of their secondary education. Sir,  this

policy  has  always received the strong support  of

the Singapore Chinese School Teachers' Association,

of  which I happen to be the President. When I read

the  motion, standing in the name of the Member for

Bukit Batok, who is also the Minister of State  for

Education, I felt rather sad when he made reference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



to  some  teachers in his speech.  Perhaps  it  was

because  he  is  still  in the  Nanyang  University

campus  and  has  not  quite  realised  the  actual

conditions.  But,  let me come back  to  the  topic

under  discussion.  The  Singapore  Chinese  School

Teachers'  Association has always  been  supporting

this  policy of the Government. There is  no  doubt

about  this.  In  our memoranda  submitted  to  the

Ministry of Education, we have stated our views  on

how  and  what  to  do to improve  second  language

teaching,  i.e, the teaching of English in  Chinese

schools.  In  this regard, Sir,  I  would  like  to

express  my  humble opinion, and that is  that  the

Government should try to ensure that every child is

educated  first in his own mother tongue, while  at

the  same time learning a second language. Children

educated in this way will be much better than those

who  are  educated  first  in  a  second  language,

because they may not know or may know only a little

of  their own mother tongue. This is, of course, my

humble  opinion and is subject to the  scrutiny  of

the hon. Members in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while still on the subject of

education,  as  a representative of the  people  as

well  as  the  President of the  Singapore  Chinese

School Teachers' Association, I would like to bring

to your attention the grievances of the teachers in

Singapore.  In this particular regard, I  have  one

aspect  to  concentrate on. For many years  in  the

past, the Chinese School Teachers' Association  has

taken up the matter with the Ministry of Education.

After the fourth Minister has assumed office, I  do

not  know  whether  the new Minister,  or  the  new

Minister of State, or the new Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  has  taken  note  of   their

grievances and is prepared to look further into the

matter. This has been going on for a long time  and

is  quite beyond the comprehension of many  people.

Even  those  teachers who have  retired  are  still

grumbling.  They go to the extent  of  saying  that

they  will  not "close their eyes even  after  they

have kicked the bucket". So I would like to take  a

little  time  of  the House to  elaborate  on  this

matter for the benefit of the Minister of State, in

the  absence  of the Minister. It is also  my  hope

that by airing such grievances here, I will be able

to get an explanation for the delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, obligations and privileges must

be  equal,  and rules must have equal  application.

That   is  common-sense.  But  in  Government-aided

schools, there is this anomaly in this common-sense

philosophy, and that is, under the same  Government

and  in  the same school, teachers are governed  by

two different sets of rules.
