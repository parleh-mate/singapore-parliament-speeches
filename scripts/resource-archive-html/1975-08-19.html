<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 196 of the Companies Act deals with the

appointment  of inspectors to investigate the  affairs

of  a  Declared Company. The Bill now before the House

seeks  to  amend  this section  so  as  to  enable  an

inspector to inform the Minister of any matters coming

to  his  knowledge  as a result of  the  investigation

tending  to  show that an offence has been  committed.

The Minister may then take such steps as he deems fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law as it now stands, an inspector may only

disclose  such  information to the  Minister  when  he

makes  his report. The law in Singapore is in  exactly

the  same  state as it was in England prior  to  1967.

When  a  revised Companies Act was introduced  in  the

United  Kingdom in 1967, the corresponding section  of

the  English Act was amended so that now an  inspector

may,  without  the  necessity  of  making  an  interim

report, inform the Department of Trade (which  is  the

appointing  authority for inspectors  in  the  UK)  of

matters disclosing the probability that an offence has

been committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with a view to achieving the same result in our

laws that the proposed amendment to section 196 of our

Companies Act is now before the House. When this  Bill

becomes  law,  an inspector may, at any  time  in  the

course of his investigation, without the necessity  of

making  an  interim report, make disclosures  of  such

matters.   Honourable  Members  will  appreciate   the

importance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



of  this  Bill  which would enable prompt  and  speedy

action to be taken whenever an inspector whose duty it

is  to  investigate the affairs of a  company  obtains

incriminating evidence in the course of his duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just wondering whether the Hon.

Minister would care to inform the House of the  reason

for  the  urgency in taking the Bill through  all  its

three stages today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, while I did not mention it, I think the reason

is  perfectly clear. There is now an investigation and

I  would like to be given information on matters which

the  inspector  may be able to give,  because  in  the

course  of  his investigation he may have come  across

matters  which might suggest that an offence has  been

committed.  This Bill would then enable  him  to  make

such disclosure to the Minister without having to make

an interim report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need of this particular piece of legislation was

discovered  when  in  looking  through  Our  Act,   in

comparison  with the English Act, we  found  that  the

deficiency  in  our  Act prevented information  to  be

given  except  by  way of an interim report.  This  we

thought was not necessary and, therefore, I felt  that

this  particular Bill should be introduced  and  taken

through all its stages in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-[Mr. Hon Sui Sen].

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four main amendments proposed in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to add a new Part VA to

the  Act to make special provisions governing the sale

of  flats,  houses or buildings sold by the PSA  under

its  housing scheme. Any property sold by the PSA will

be  subject to restrictive conditions prohibiting  the

dealings  in  such property without the permission  of

the   PSA   and   to  special  rules   governing   the

transmission  of  the property on  the  death  of  the

owners. For example, no property sold by the PSA shall

be  sold,  leased, mortgaged, transferred  or  charged

without  the  written consent of the  PSA.  This  will

safeguard  the  PSA's  interest and  ensure  that  the

living accommodation is not transferred to undesirable

persons  or  disposed of to make  quick  profits.  The

Authority  will  also  be  empowered  to  compulsorily

acquire  the property if the owner or his  spouse  has

not complied with certain provisions laid down in this

Part. These proposed provisions are broadly similar to

those  of  the Housing and Development Act. The  PSA's

legal  officers  will  be  empowered  to  certify  and

register  documents  relating  to  the  sale  of   PSA

properties on behalf of the employees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to repeal and reenact sections 45 to

49  of  the principal Act which relates to the keeping

of accounts, the appointment, powers and duties of the

auditor, the preparation of financial statements,  the

submission of the financial statements, audit  reports

and   annual   reports  to  the   Minister   and   the

presentation  of  these  reports  and  statements   to

Parliament.  This proposed amendment is in  compliance

with the Auditor-General's request to standardise  the

procedures  of  auditing for all quasi-government  and

statutory  bodies. The PSA has already been  following

these  procedures and the amendment is only to reflect

the actual position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to amend section 52 of the Act. Under

the  existing section 52, goods dues shall be paid  by

the  owner or occupier of private wharves or premises.

The  PSA  has experienced difficulty in some cases  in

collecting  goods  dues  from  operators  of   private

wharves  or  premises. The amendment will empower  the

PSA  to  collect goods dues either from the  owner  or

occupier  of private wharves or premises or  from  the

owners  or agents of the vehicles or vessels  carrying

such goods into or out of the wharves or premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends the existing section 100 which,

though  it  provides  for penalties  for  offences  in

connection  with  the  safety  of  vessels,  does  not

include  cases  of  overloaded  or  improperly  manned

vessels.   The  proposed  amendment  will  include   a

provision to make it an offence to use or permit to be

used  a  vessel which is unsafe or overloaded  or  not

properly manned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my Ministry has been fairly successful in

taking  enforcement  action against  the  erection  of

unauthorised  structures and is able to  contain  such

illegal   activities,  however,  there  has  been   an

appreciable increase in unauthorised change of use  of

premises, both within and outside the city area.  Many

trades  and  small  industries, offices,  stores,  and

workshops have moved into premises which are not to be

used  for such purposes. This is especially so in  the

residential   areas.  Sir,  such   unauthorised   uses

invariably  affect  the amenity and the  environmental

quality   of   the  area  and  create   nuisance   and

disturbance to the neighbourhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, change of use of buildings or land

is  permitted  where the proposed  activities  can  be

logically and naturally integrated into the prevailing

activities of the area. In such cases, the  change  of

use  usually  results in more intensive usage  of  the

premises and land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Planning

Act so as to give specific powers to permit the change

of  use  of buildings and land where conditions allow,

to  grant  such permit for a specific period of  time,

and  to impose a development charge which will be  set

out in subsidiary legislations. It is also intended to

intensify  enforcement action against all unauthorised

changes of use

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the scheme to restrain non-essential

usage  of  private  cars in the  Central  Business

District,  it  is  necessary to  increase  parking

charges in public and private car parks. This Bill

seeks  to impose a surcharge on parking places  in

designated areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered to designate areas or

places  by  order in the Gazette and to  impose  a

surcharge  on  parking places  in  the  designated

areas  (clause 3). Different rates may be  imposed

in  different designated areas, and the rates  may

be based on the number of parking lots or on other

basis. The surcharge collected shall be paid  into

the Consolidated Fund (clause 6).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not apply to parking places used

exclusively   in  connection  with   any   private

dwelling  houses (clause 8). The usual  penalties,

exemption and rule-making powers are provided  for

in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may wish to know that the area to be

designated  will  be the present Restricted  Zone.

For  the  purpose of the surcharge,  a  Core  Area

within   the   Restricted  Zone   will   also   be

designated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



This  Core  Area roughly covers the heart  of  the

Central   Business  District  and  will  be   more

accurately described in the Order to be made  when

the  Bill is passed by Parliament and brought into

force. I can also inform Members of the House that

the rates of surcharge will be $20 per parking lot

per month in the Core Area and $10 per parking lot

per  month in the rest of the Restricted  Zone  as

recommended   by   the   Road   Transport   Action

Committee.  The surcharge will apply  to  all  car

parks  in  the  designated  area  including  Urban

Redevelopment  Authority  car  parks.   Designated

areas  and  the rates of surcharge may  be  varied

from  time to time to achieve the desired traffic

restraint objectives and policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Dr Tan Eng Liang].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administration of Muslim Law (Amendment)

Bill,  1975, was introduced in Parliament on  29th

July, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, under the

Administration of the Muslim Law Act (Cap. 42) has

certain  responsibilities. One  of  these  is  the

administration of all mosques in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress in Singapore involves change. The

numerous   development  schemes  such  as   public

housing, road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



development, etc, require the best possible use of

land.  Wherever  possible, alternative  sites  for

religious   buildings  are  provided  within   the

framework  of  a  rational utilisation  of  scarce

land.  This applies to all religions in Singapore.

The  process of urban renewal has resulted in  the

moving of population from one area to another  and

the concentration of people in satellite towns. In

recognition of the religious needs of the  Muslims

who   have  been  resettled,  the  Government  has

provided  the  Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura  sites

for  mosques at the satellite towns of Jurong, Toa

Payoh  and  Queenstown. Mosque sites at  Woodlands

and  Chai  Chee  are also made  available  to  the

Majlis. At Chua Chu Kang, a new mosque has already

been  built by the Government at the site  of  the

new cemetery. At Geylang Serai, two mosques had to

be  demolished as a result of a new road  project,

but  both  were  re-built nearby  at  Government's

expense. The re-built mosques at Jalan Rebong  and

Lorong Ungku Aman are bigger and are provided with

better modern facilities. Moreover, the Government

has  already  publicly announced in November  1973

that  its  policy in the process of urban  renewal

and development is to reserve adequate sites for a

temple, a mosque, and a church in each of the  new

towns  or concentrations of population into  which

people  are moving. Depending on the size  of  the

community  in  each  of  these  housing   estates,

adequate  space will be reserved for each religion

in every new town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims in Singapore have experienced

difficulties  in  raising  funds  for  the  mosque

building programmes. To-date, not a single  mosque

has  been erected at the sites in satellite  towns

provided  by  the Government, despite the  efforts

made   by  Muslim  groups  in  various  parts   of

Singapore  to raise funds for the construction  of

mosques. The difficulty and the slow pace in fund-raising are compounded by the escalation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



in  building costs. A number of  appeals  for

assistance  have  been made  to  the  Majlis  Ugama

Islam  Singapura  and this has led  the  Majlis  to

approach the Government to help solve the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House seeks to amend the

Administration  of Muslim Law Act  to  provide  for

the  establishment of a Mosque Building Fund to  be

used  for building one mosque in each new town.  In

the  course of the next three to eight years,  four

new  mosques,  each  varying  between  $500,000  to

$800,000  in  costs, will be built  in  Toa  Payoh,

Queenstown,   Jurong  and  Woodlands.   Two   other

mosques  will  also  be built, one  in  Chai  Chee,

another in Telok Blangah or Pasir Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mosque Building Fund will be administered by

the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) and

contributions to the Fund will be voluntary. The

MUIS will appoint their own agents to collect

contributions from Muslims who are employers or

are self-employed, since these people do not have

CPF accounts. For this purpose, Ketua Amils and

Amils will also be appointed during each fasting

month. The Central Provident Fund Board will be

the collecting agent for the contributions payable

in respect of Muslim employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will observe that the Bill

makes  it compulsory for every employer of a Muslim

employee to pay monthly contributions to the Mosque

Building  Fund of an amount set out in the Schedule

to  the  Act  on  behalf of  his  employee.  He  is

empowered  to recover such contributions  from  the

wages of his Muslim employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realising that there may be Muslims who are

financially  unable  to  afford  to  contribute,   the

scheme  has  been  designed  as  a  voluntary  scheme.

Since  contribution  to the Mosque  Building  Fund  is

voluntary,  a  Muslim employee who does not  wish  his

employer  to  contribute to the Mosque  Building  Fund

on his behalf can exercise an option not to contribute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



under the Act. A Muslim employee who does  not

wish   to   contribute  could,  therefore,   file   an

application  for  a  Certificate of  Option  with  the

Majlis  Ugama Islam which is responsible  for  issuing

Certificates  of Option which are valid for  a  period

not exceeding 12 months. Whilst the Certificate is  in

force, his employer need not pay contributions on  his

behalf. However, on the expiry of the period for which

the  option is in force, the employer shall be  liable

to  pay  the  contributions unless the employee  again

exercises an option to absolve him from this liability

for a further period of time not exceeding 12 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as there may be Muslims who are financially

unable  to contribute, there may be those who wish  to

contribute  more  than the minimum  amount.  For  this

purpose,   the   Bill   also   makes   provision   for

contributions in excess of the minimum  amount  of  50

cents  per  month  to  the Mosque  Building  Fund.  An

employee  who wishes to contribute more than 50  cents

per  month  can  notify his employer by  submitting  a

Notification  Form stating the desired  amount  for  a

period of six months. Self-employed Muslims can notify

the MUIS in like manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUIS is also empowered to receive contributions

for  the Mosque Building Fund from non-Muslim persons.

Non-Muslim  well-wishers are, therefore,  welcomed  to

contribute to the Mosque Building Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the Majlis to make rules

with  the approval of the Minister for Social  Affairs

for  the  purpose  of collecting contributions  direct

from  those  who  do  not have  CPF  accounts,  either

because they are employers or self-employed, and  also

for  the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the

Act relating to the Mosque Building Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, following the Prime Minister's

announcement  concerning the provision  of  sites  for

mosques  in new satellite towns, statements were  made

concerning  the voluntary deductions of 50  cents  per

month  from Muslim employees through the CPF.  Muslims

in  Singapore have now become more than ever convinced

of   the   Government's   policy.   Prior   to   these

announcements,  complaints  and  grievances  could  be

heard from many Muslims in Singapore, and their target

was the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Muslims in Singapore accepted, in

principle,  the  demolition of old  mosques  on  those

sites   which   are  affected  by  urban  development,

nevertheless  their  feeling  of  suspicion  could  be

discerned   because   those   mosques   affected    by

development  have already been demolished  whilst  the

building  of  new ones has yet to commence.  With  the

spiralling costs of building materials consequent upon

inflation,  it  is even more difficult  to  build  the

mosques  which  are  being  planned  because  of   the

shortage  of  funds. It would seem that these  mosques

will  never be built so long as building costs do  not

return to normal levels as in 1972 and 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Bill, however, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Muslims

now  feel  that  the Government is really  sincere  in

wanting to assist and cooperate with them towards  the

progress of Muslims in Singapore, so that they can  be

put, on the same level as the other communities,  not

by  providing a subsidy but by practical  means,  like

giving them facilities to collect and raise funds from

the  Muslims themselves. The Muslims in Singapore also

realise that although they are left far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



behind in all fields of endeavour, they do not want to

depend solely on assistance from the Government.  They

do  not  want to be a social burden to the  Government

and to the other communities in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been informed that, since the commencement of

the  deductions in May, 1975, the net amount  received

by  the  Muslim Religious Council of Singapore through

the CPF was $51,000 and in the subsequent month it was

$53,000. From the total number of Muslims in Singapore

only 40 do not wish to have their pay deducted for the

purpose. This means that the number of such people  is

negligible. I believe that this Bill will produce  the

desired benefits for the Muslims in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say something on the new

section  75B  in clause 3 regarding the provision  for

the payment of any costs of administering this Fund? I

believe   this   Fund   will  be  maintained   through

computerised  collections by the CPF. I  also  believe

that  the  cost  of administering this  Fund  and  the

salaries  of  those who administer this Fund  will  be

paid  out of the contributions. May I suggest  to  the

Minister  in  charge that similarly  contributions  to

this  Fund be used to pay the Imams and the caretakers

of the mosques built out of this Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the new section 7SF, which empowers

the Majlis to make rules, I would ask the Minister  to

give careful attention to this power. I would like  to

draw  the attention of the Minister to the power given

to the Majlis Ugama Is/am to award scholarships met by

the  collection of tithes. From my experience  I  have

discovered  that  some Muslims in Singapore  who  have

gone abroad to further their studies and are no longer

Singapore  citizens still continue  to  receive  these

scholarships.  Furthermore students who  are  studying

abroad and who have since married foreigners in  their

places   of   study   are   still   receiving    these

scholarships. I think this is most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



inappropriate. Again, recipients of these scholarships

have  been  known  to drive in Opel  1700s  to  attend

classes  whilst  applicants for such scholarships  who

are genuinely in need of financial assistance, as they

are fatherless and depend solely on their brothers who

themselves   have  their  own  responsibilities,   are

deprived of these scholarships. I hope the Minister in

charge  will  give serious attention  to  this  matter

concerning  the power to make rules to pay  out  money

from  contributions  by  Muslims  towards  the  Mosque

Building Fund.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to point out to

the  Member  for Kampung Kembangan that this  Fund  is

established for the purpose of building mosques in the

new  towns  only, and not as he has stated  just  now,

i.e, whenever a mosque is pulled down  a  new  mosque

will  be built on the site. The Fund is not meant  for

that  purpose.  It is specifically  set  up  to  build

mosques  in  the new towns which I have  named  in  my

Second Reading speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point about utilising monies in the Mosque

Building  Fund under the new section 75B, in clause  3

of  the  Bill, I wish to reiterate that  the  Fund  is

established for a specific purpose only, that  is,  it

shall be used for:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a)the purpose of building any mosque in Singapore;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)the payment of any costs, charges and expenses of

maintaining  and administering the Mosque  Building Fund.'



<br><br>I am afraid the monies cannot be used

for any other purpose than what is stated in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his third point about the powers given to the

MUIS,  I can assure him, Sir, that I will keep an  eye

on whatever the MUIS is doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Encik Othman Bin Wok].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Bill appears to introduce a large

number of amendments to the Act, the bulk of them  are

merely consequential amendments, and I shall deal with

only the main ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Titles (Strata) Act, enacted in 1968,

enables  purchasers of flats for which  strata  titles

have  been issued to manage and maintain the  building

containing  the flats and its related common  property

such  as  common  corridors,  staircases,  garden  and

lifts.  However,  in  recent  years  there  have  been

attempts   made  by  the  developer  of  a  subdivided

building  to  control the management of  the  building

after the issue of the certificates of strata title by

issuing  leases  of the flats to the  purchasers  with

terms  entrenched  in  the leases  in  favour  of  the

developer. To ensure that these purchasers,  who  have

been  granted a leasehold interest of a  term  of  not

less  than  21  years,  should  have  a  say  in   the

management  and  maintenance of  the  common  property

pertaining to the subdivided building, it is necessary

to  amend the Act to allow such purchasers to exercise

fully  the rights of management conferred upon  Strata

title  owners  as if the leases were not created.  The

Bill before this House seeks, inter alia, to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the issue of strata titles for

condominium  developments. Perhaps  I  should  explain

briefly  what a condominium development is. A  housing

estate   which   is   classified  as   a   condominium

development  will  have  the  usual  bungalows,  semi-detached  houses, terrace houses and,  perhaps  flats.

The estate looks no different from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



usual   housing  estate.  However,  in  a  condominium

development, the developer will be required to provide

recreational facilities for all the residents  in  the

estate. As soon as the strata title plan of the estate

has  been registered with the Registrar of Titles  the

owners of the housing or flat units in the estate will

constitute  the management corporation of the  estate.

The  management  corporation will then be  responsible

for the maintenance of all the recreational facilities

and the common property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest which an owner of a housing unit in such

an  estate acquires is contained in a strata title. He

owns what is within the confines of his bungalow, semi-detached house, terrace house or flat as the case  may

be.  The land on which all the housing units are built

is  vested  in all the owners as part of their  common

property  in  accordance with the shares  allotted  to

them as shown in the strata title plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an estate, owners of bungalows, semi-detached

houses   and  terrace  houses  may  also  own  private

gardens.  The  land comprising the garden  also  forms

part  of the common property but an "accessory" strata

lot  will be created for the garden so privately owned

and  such  "accessory"  lot can  only  be  transferred

together  with the strata lot comprising the  dwelling

unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the issue of strata titles

for  a condominium development as and when part of  it

is  completed. In a very large housing project, it  is

desirable to allow the developers to convey the  legal

title of completed housing units even though the whole

housing  project  has  not been completed.  This  will

enable a developer to divest himself of his title in a

completed housing unit while the construction  of  the

remaining part is still in progress and a purchaser to

obtain  a  good title to his individual  housing  unit

much earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill some significant changes have been

proposed for the pur-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



pose  of  enlarging the powers, duties and obligations

of  a management corporation established under Part IV

of  the  Act  in  respect of subdivided buildings  and

condominium developments. These changes are  necessary

because  every owner of a strata lot in  a  subdivided

building or a condominium development participates  in

community living. It has been found necessary to amend

the  law  in  this respect to ensure that every  owner

plays his part in maintaining a subdivided building or

the condominium development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will affect the rights and interests of

a  large  section  of  our  public.  It  is  therefore

proposed to refer it to a Select Committee so that all

interested parties can air their views and  make  such

representations as they may deem necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify

a  few points. The Bill provides that condominium land

is  common  property.  In  other  words,  it  is  land

commonly  owned by the owners of the houses.  However,

if the buildings in this condominium estate have to be

rebuilt,  will this condominium land still  belong  to

the  owners of the housing units? In other  words,  if

there is rebuilding on this site and if the owner of a

flat  on this condominium property is unable to  carry

out  the  rebuilding of his flat, what will happen  to

him?

question is: if a block of flats has to be pulled down

and  rebuilt,  what happens if certain owners  of  the

flats are unable to rebuild, although they still  have

their share of the land? What is the position of  such

flat owners?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is simple. All that the flat owner owns is

a  part  of the land. If the flat owner owns,  let  us

say,  Flat  A on the 16th floor, then if the  flat  is

demolished all he owns is a little portion of the land

in the proportion in Which he owned it before.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if the land area measures 10,000 sq.ft. and there

are 20 housing units on it, then if this piece of land

is  subdivided  into 20 parts, it will be  wasted.  If

certain  owners do not want to rebuild their flats  on

this piece of land and if you subdivide this land into

20 lots, it will be a waste.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, I agree with the Member that it will be a waste.

But  what  is  his point? The owner of a strata  title

owns  his  particular flat. All these flats are  on  a

piece of land. If there are 20 flats of equal area, he

owns  one-twentieth of that land. Obviously you cannot

divide 10,000 sq.ft. by 20, as there will be not  much

left to build. Hence the condominium idea.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th September, 1973, a Government press statement

made  it  known  that as from the  day  following  the

announcement  only  citizens  of  Singapore  would  be

permitted to purchase residential property without any

restriction.  This  decision  was  arrived  at   after

considerable thought. For many months before that, the

cost  of  real estate had been sharply on the increase

and   had  almost  doubled  over  the  previous  year.

Government  was concerned about the rise  and  decided

that it should confine its efforts at keeping down the

cost of residential property, leaving the market value

of  commercial and industrial properties to find their

levels  by the interaction of factors governing supply

and demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land is a precious commodity in Singapore. Of

Singapore's total area of about 596 sq, km, or 230 sq.

miles, about 65% is State land or is held by statutory

boards.  Only 34% or 20,540 hectares or 78 sq, miles,

is still in private ownership. We, therefore, need not

only to husband land more carefully but also to ensure

that,   in  so  far  as  residential  properties   are

concerned, citizens of Singapore are able to  purchase

their own houses. While those eligible for Housing and

Development Board flats are catered for, and the well-off  can  afford the more choice residential property,

it is for the middle income groups who find housing of

reasonable   standards  beyond  their  means   -   our

teachers,    administrators,    lawyers,    engineers,

executives, civil servants, etc., those serving in the

Police  and  Armed Forces and others - for whom  every

endeavour should be made to enable them to enjoy  home

ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 11th September, 1973, administrative control in

respect  of residential properties has been  exercised

by   the  Registrar  of  Titles  and  the  Residential

Property Advisory Committee under my supervision. This

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



given  us  an opportunity of observing the  effect  of

control  and  of working out necessary procedures  and

rulings  so  that the sum total of all this experience

has  gone  into  the drafting of the Bill,  which,  in

consequence,  has  been revised  and  amended  several

times.  Government has felt that it  should  not  rush

headlong into a legislative measure of this nature and

that  account  should be taken of the  effect  of  the

restriction  on the property market. Thus,  16  months

after  the restriction was imposed, it was found  that

the  curbs  on non-citizens could be relaxed  to  some

extent.  Consequently, on 9th January, 1975, a  second

Government press statement was issued stating that  as

from   the  following  day  Government  would   remove

restrictions on the purchase by non-citizens of  flats

or  apartments  in  buildings of  not  less  than  six

storeys,  including the ground floor,  and  that  such

flats  or apartments could be bought and sold by  non-citizens  in the same way as commercial and industrial

properties.  Non-citizens wishing  to  purchase  other

types  of  residential property would have to continue

to   seek   approval   in  accordance   with   already

established procedures. Sub-clause (3) of clause 2  of

the Bill expressly states this particular exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the second press statement in January

the   Residential  Property  Advisory  Committee   had

considered  and  approved 220 applications  from  non-citizens  to  purchase  residential  properties.  Sub-clause  (4)  of clause 30 provides that all  approvals

granted from the 11th day of September, 1973,  to  the

11th  day of September, 1975, shall be deemed to  have

been made under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been drafted in general conformity with

the  guidelines laid down by the first press statement

but  departs from it in certain particulars where this

has   since  been  considered  necessary.  It  is  the

intention  of the Government to refer the  Bill  to  a

Select Committee so that all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



interested bodies and members of the public will  have

an  opportunity to present their views which  will  be

carefully assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill sets out in

some  detail the nature of the provisions of the Bill,

and  I  do  not therefore propose to discuss  them  in

detail. However, I would like to touch on some of  the

more salient points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill expressly prohibits the transfer to, or

purchase  or  acquisition  by,  "foreign  persons"  of

"residential property". These as well as a  number  of

other expressions are defined in the Bill. It is  also

provided  that no estate or interest many  residential

property belonging to a deceased person who dies on or

after   11th  September,  1973,  shall   pass   to   a

beneficiary who is a foreign person. In the case  of

such  residential property which would otherwise  have

passed   to  a  foreign  person,  the  legal  personal

representatives of the deceased person are required to

sell  such  property to a citizen of Singapore  or  an

"approved purchaser" within five years of the death of

such  deceased  person  and  pay  the  proceeds,  less

expenses,   to  the  foreign  person  so  beneficially

entitled. It has been found necessary to include  such

a   provision  as  its  omission  would  constitute  a

loophole  or  a method of circumventing  the  proposed

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill require "foreign

companies"   to   dispose  of  all   the   residential

properties  owned by them at the date  of  the  coming

into  operation of the Act, i.e. 11th September,  1973

(or  within  such  period as may  be  allowed  by  the

Minister) by transferring these residential properties

to  citizens  of Singapore or approved purchasers,  un

less  such  foreign companies are permitted to  retain

them  by  virtue  of clause 16 or are  exempted  under

clause  .22.  Where  such  foreign  companies  do  not

dispose  of  such properties within that  period,  the

Minister  may  direct  the Controller  of  Residential

Property to attach



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



and  sell  such  properties at any  time  after  three

months  of  the  date  of  such  notice.  As  soon  as

practicable thereafter, the Controller is required  to

sell the same to a citizen of Singapore or an approved

purchaser and pay the proceeds of the sale,  less  any

costs, to the foreign company concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to dwell for a moment on clauses 4 and 5

which  are important aspects of the Bill. They achieve

the  object  of  the  policy as stated  in  the  press

statement  of 10th September, 1973, though  the  means

employed  are,  for  good reasons,  different.  It  is

considered that the provisions in the Bill obliging  a

foreign company to dispose of Its residential property

provide a more workable, less cumbersome and much less

restrictive  legislative framework  than  an  approach

which  involves the disposal of shares held by foreign

shareholders   as   envisaged  in  the   first   press

statement.  The  Bill provides that  where  a  foreign

company holds residential property, it must dispose of

such  residential property within a  period  of  time.

However,   the   Minister,   after   considering   the

recommendations  of the Residential Property  Advisory

Committee, would have discretionary power to allow the

foreign company to retain its residential property  as

provided in clause 16 (4) (a).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very early drafts of the Bill, an attempt was

made  to implement the modus operandi outlined in  the

press   statement  by  adopting  the  device   therein

suggested  which involved requiring foreign  companies

to  dispose of shares held by foreign shareholders and

by  making it mandatory for foreign companies to alter

their  memorandum or articles of association so as  to

prohibit non-citizens from becoming directors and also

to  limit shareholdings to Singapore citizens or local

companies.  But this approach, apart from  leading  to

certain  unintended  results  would  create  a  rather

untidy situation whereby the Controller of Residential

Property would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



obliged to dispose of many millions of shares  on  the

Stock  Exchange.  This approach was finally  abandoned

for  a  number of reasons. For one thing, banks  which

have  many millions of shares held by foreign persons,

and  which  might  wish  to retain  their  residential

property  would  be faced with having  to  dispose  of

their  foreign  shareholdings. Further, the  procedure

suggested could lead to large numbers of shares  being

disposed  of  on  the stock market, which  could  well

result in the artificial depression of share prices in

leading  counters and in the Stock Exchange generally.

That   procedure  would  also  cause  the  unnecessary

disposal  of  foreign shares by foreign investors  who

acquired   the   shares  because  of   the   intrinsic

investment potential of the foreign company. It  would

seem   to  be  harsh  and  unfair  to  oblige  foreign

investors  to  dispose  of their shareholdings  merely

because  the  foreign company in which  they  invested

happened  to hold residential properties in Singapore.

Such   properties  would  constitute  only   a   small

percentage of the total assets of the foreign company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also a number of other reasons for

abandoning the original approach which I do  not  now

propose to discuss, but what finally persuaded us  to

adopt the approach in clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill  as

now  drafted were the advantages of this method which

are threefold, namely:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the forced sale is in respect of residential

properties  only (which is, in fact,  the  Government

objective); foreign shareholdings in these  companies

would   not,   therefore,  be   affected   once   the

residential properties are sold as required by  these

clauses; further, under clause 16, the Minister would

have   a  discretion,  where  the  circumstances   so

warrant,  to  permit foreign companies  with  foreign

shareholders  to  acquire,  purchase  or  retain  any

specific residential properties;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, administratively it would be much easier

for  the  Controller of Residential Property  to  deal

with  property  transfers rather than share  transfers

which  it  would  be best for a civil servant  not  to

handle; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is generally likely to cause less

dislocation  and  upheaval in  the  foreign  companies

concerned and in the stock market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that foreign companies only, but

not foreign natural persons or societies, are required

to dispose of residential properties vested in them as

at  11th  September,  1973. Such natural  persons  and

societies will be required to obtain approval for  the

purchase  of  properties  after  that  date.   Foreign

persons  who  are permanent residents or  who  are  of

economic benefit to Singapore or who have professional

qualifications or experience advantageous to Singapore

may   be  granted  approval  to  purchase  residential

property for their own occupation as dwelling  houses.

Similarly,  foreign companies which  are  of  economic

benefit to Singapore and intend to purchase or  retain

residential  property  for  occupation  by  their  key

personnel, may also be granted such approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to clause 14, we find that it follows the

intent of the first press statement in providing  that

residential   properties  may  not  be  purchased   or

acquired  by a citizen or an approved purchaser  as  a

nominee  of  a  foreign person, but departs  from  the

press statement in not providing in the Bill that  the

nominee  citizen is to be charged income  tax  on  the

value of the property. Apart from anything else,  such

a  "taxing" provision could be rendered ineffective or

easily circumvented by the Singapore citizen disposing

of  the residential property in question and pocketing

the  proceeds and there would be no means whereby  the

Government  could  recover  such  proceeds.  A  better

approach,  it  is  thought, is  to  provide  that  any

citizen,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



approved  purchaser or foreign person who  contravenes

this provision should be liable to the general penalty

set out in clause 25.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will thus be seen that Government's initial

thoughts on the method of implementation have not been

carried  through where more appropriate  methods  have

subsequently emerged. Further amendments may  also  be

necessary  in  the  light  of fresh  information  laid

before  the Select Committee. Representations  thereto

on every aspect of the Bill would be welcome as we are

anxious  that the legislation which is finally enacted

should be workable and beneficial to the Republic as a

whole.   It   is   possible,   for   instance,    that

representations may be received on the effect  on  the

property market of the implementation of clauses 4 and

5.  Could  all  the  relatively expensive  residential

properties appearing on the market within this  period

as  a result of this provision be beyond the reach  of

most  Singapore citizens, particularly in this present

recessional  state which is so vastly  different  from

the  economic situation obtaining in 1973?  Could  our

economists  and financial and property experts  advise

whether  there  is  or  is not  a  danger  of  foreign

companies  being  unable  to sell  choice  residential

properties  they  are  legally  required  to  sell  to

Singapore citizens within the required period?  Should

we  therefore exercise caution and keep in abeyance or

suspense clauses 4 and 5 and related, clauses and  not

bring  them  into  operation until a later  date?  The

commencement clause, that is clause 1, would then need

to  be  amended and some tidying up done at the Select

Committee   stage  to  render  that  clause  accurate.

Perhaps   these  are  unnecessary  fears  but  changed

economic  conditions do warrant  some  caution  and  a

careful appraisal of these and other provisions in the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of diplomatic and consular missions and

religious groups in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  (as stated at clause 20) is that they  will

not  be  required to follow the formal  procedure  for

obtaining  approval as required under  clause  16  but

will  nonetheless  have  to "seek  the  permission  in

writing of the Minister" before purchasing residential

property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 sets out the position of housing developers

who,  before purchasing an estate or interest  in  any

residential property, will be required to obtain  from

the Controller of Housing a "qualifying certificate".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's power to exempt, which is contained in

clause  22, would be exercised in circumstances  which

warrant exempting any person, body or property who  or

which  would otherwise come within the ambit  of  this

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings provision at clause 23 makes it clear

that  the  Act  is not applicable in certain  specific

instances.  For  example,  foreign  persons  are   not

prevented  from entering into a tenancy agreement  for

the  occupation of residential property so long as the

agreement does not exceed a term of seven years at any

one  time. Further, a permanent resident married to  a

citizen  is not precluded from purchasing  a  flat  or

house   sold   under  Part  IV  of  the  Housing   and

Development  Act  (Chapter  271)  if  the  Board   has

consented to such purchase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general penalty provided in the Bill for any

contravention  or failure to comply with  any  of  the

provisions  of  the  Bill  for  which  no  penalty  is

expressly  provided  is,  on conviction,  a  fine  not

exceeding  $5,000  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  not

exceeding  three  years  or  to  both  such  fine  and

imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude I would, once more, like to

emphasize that the Bill is to be referred to a  Select

Committee,  that adequate time will be given  for  the

Bill to be studied, and further that all represen-

tations  made  to the Select Committee will  be  given

very careful consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the combat of crime it is essential to have

not  only  an  effective police force  to  detect  and

arrest  criminals  but  also  an  adequate  system  of

punishment  and  rehabilitation of the criminals  when

convicted.  Those who are convicted of serious  crimes

such  as  armed  robbery,  criminal  intimidation  and

rioting should be sentenced to corrective training for

periods  of  three  to  seven years.  Such  corrective

training  is  provided  for in  section  3(1)  of  the

Criminal  Justice (Temporary Provisions) Act,  but  it

applies only to persons who are not less than 18 years

of age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disturbing trend has now emerged in that more and

more young persons between the ages of 16 and 18 years

are committing serious crimes. However, this trend  is

not  peculiar  to Singapore. It is a trend  which'  is

prevalent the world over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, the number of criminals within this age

group who were sent to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



penal   institutions  totalled   186.   This   number

increased  during the following four years,  that  is,

1971-74. In 1974, the figure had reached 377. However,

in  the first six months of this, year, the number has

already reached 377. Expressed as a percentage of  the

total  number of criminals sent to penal institutions,

those who were within the age group of 16-18 years  in

1970  accounted for 6.5%. In the first six  months  of

this year the corresponding figure has already reached

9.1%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Reorganisation Committee recommended that

the  minimum  age for corrective training  be  lowered

from  18 years to 16 years to enable the District  and

High   Courts   to  sentence  younger   criminals   to

corrective  training.  This  recommendation  has  been

accepted  by  Government and clause 2 of the  Bill  is

intended to give effect to this recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to make certain minor consequential

amendments to the First Schedule to the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Reorganisation Committee which was set up

to examine the reorganisation of the Prisons Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



had recommended that work should be the  primary

medium for the rehabilitation of prisoners. Work helps

to  develop  discipline. It also equips  the  prisoner

with  skill in a particular trade or vocation so that,

when  he  is discharged upon serving his sentence,  he

could  be gainfully employed and be a useful digit  in

society.  This  would  help the prisoner  to  readjust

himself  on  his  return to society. Work  in  prisons

would  also  enable every employable inmate  to  be  a

productive unit instead of letting him waste away  his

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the Prison Industries has been responsible

for  organising work programmes for prisoners. It  was

started  in  1965  as  a separate section  within  the

Prisons Department. It provides facilities for various

trades  including woodworking, metalworking, printing,

bookbinding,  tailoring, footwear and  leather  craft,

canework, timber processing and cement work. But it is

only able to cater for a work force Of 1,900 prisoners

out  of  an average of 4,000 prisoners. Even the  work

force of 1,900 prisoners are not optimally utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prison Industries as presently constituted is

handicapped  by  a  number of  major  problems,  which

include  problems  of staff, operational  difficulties

and inadequate work facilities. As on 31st July, 1975,

there   are   18   vacancies  out  of  an   authorised

establishment  of  74  posts for instructors.  It  can

barely  cope with its present work programme and  much

less carry out a programme of expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the prison industries in an efficient manner

there   must   be   sufficient  flexibility   in   the

recruitment   and  promotion  of  key  marketing   and

production   staff,   purchase   of   raw   materials,

contracting of work and so on. There will  also  be  a

need  to  expand or install new facilities  and  these

should  be  done  promptly. Such flexibility  .is  not

available  to  the Prison Industries  Section  of  the

Prisons  Department  because it  has  to  comply  with

administrative and finan-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



cial    regulations   like   all   other    Government

departments.   Without   the   flexibility,    private

industries   competing  with  the  Prison   Industries

Section will have a decided advantage. On a number  of

occasions the Prison Industries Section was unable  to

meet orders because it was unable to maintain adequate

stocks  of raw materials. There has also been  a  high

turnover  and poor recruitment of skilled  instructors

owing to the more attractive salaries offered by other

industries in the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to put the organisation of

the  productive work in prisons on a new footing.  The

Prisons Reorganisation Committee examined the idea  of

forming a private company to run the prison industries

but  considered  it unlikely that such an  arrangement

would achieve the desired results. Also there would be

other problems, such as the heavy capital outlay, high

turnover  and the special nature of prison labour  and

the need for physical security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee therefore recommended that a statutory

board  be  formed  to  run the  prison  industries.  A

statutory board has more flexibility than a Government

department  and  it is not precluded  from  Government

help  in  the  form of a subsidy or a  grant.  It  was

therefore  decided that a statutory  board  should  be

established   to   run  the  prison  industries.   The

statutory   board   will  be  called   the   Singapore

Corporation  of Rehabilitative Enterprises,  in  brief

SCORE.   I  shall  hereafter  refer  to  it  as   "the

Corporation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Reorganisation Committee also found that

the existing prisoner-earning scheme is inadequate and

does  not provide sufficient incentive for hard  work.

At   present,   even  the  most  highly  skilled   and

productive  worker in prison earns not more  than  $40

per  month.  Moreover, these wages do  not  allow  the

prisoners  to contribute towards the upkeep  of  their

dependants outside.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the establishment of the Corporation,

the  Government  has decided that the prisoner-earning

scheme will be revised to take into consideration  the

prisoners' skill. They will be placed on salary scales

which  would  be  comparable to  those  in  the  other

industries. The revised earning scheme, which will  be

considered  further  by  the Corporation  once  it  is

established,  will range from $2.40  per  day  for  an

unskilled  prisoner to $6.80 per  day  for  a  skilled

artisan, depending on the product which he is  making.

Thereafter, prisoners will have to contribute  towards

their upkeep of board and lodging in prison. Prisoners

will,  however, be permitted to use a portion of their

wages  for  canteen purchases. The remaining  earnings

would  be  credited  to a compulsory  savings  account

which  would be opened for each prisoner at  the  Post

Office  Savings Bank. The prisoner's dependants  would

be  permitted  to  draw  upon his  savings  while  the

prisoner is serving his sentence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to mention the salient points in the

Bill.  The Bill is modelled on the Industrial Training

Board  Act.  It  provides for the setting  up  of  the

Singapore  Corporation of Rehabilitative  Enterprises.

The functions of the Corporation will be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to manage and maintain the industrial or

vocational  training institutions transferred  to  the

Corporation  and  such  other  institutions   as   the

Corporation  may  establish  for  the  employment,  or

industrial or vocational training of prisoners;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to provide or secure the provision of such

employment  or  facilities for such  training  and  to

organise programmes therefore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to provide technical training in skilled trades

for suitable prisoners;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to promote the vocational skills of prisoners;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to require any prisoner to work pursuant to

section 50 of the Prisons Act; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) to advise the Government on all matters relating

to  the provision of industrial or vocational training

and technical training in trades for prisoners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation shall be governed by a Board whose

members  will be appointed by the Minister. The  Board

comprises:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a Chairman;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a Deputy Chairman who shall be the Permanent

Secretary,   Ministry   of   Home   Affairs   or   his

representative;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a representative each from the Ministry of

Finance,  the  Ministry of Labour and  the  Industrial

Training Board; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) not less than two but not more than ten other

members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that a successful entrepreneur will be

appointed  as  the  Chairman and that  there  will  be

sufficient representation of the private sector on the

Board. It can be seen from clause 16 of the Bill  that

the Board will have adequate powers and flexibility to

perform the functions entrusted to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial or vocational training institutions, for

the   purpose  of  training  prisoners,   which   were

established  by or vested and held by the  Government,

will be transferred to the Corporation as provided  in

clause 10. Government employees in these industrial or

vocational training institutions, and other Government

employees which the Minister may determine, will  also

be  transferred  to the Corporation.  These  employees

will  be  given the option of remaining in the service

of  the  Government. Their rights to pension, gratuity

or  other  allowances payable by the. Government  will

also be preserved

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation will have a Chief Executive Officer

who will be responsible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



to  the Corporation for its proper administration  and

management.  The  Minister  may  also  appoint   other

employees  on terms and conditions determined  by  the

Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 stipulates that the Corporation may, with

the approval of the Minister, make regulations for the

establishment  of pension and provident  fund  schemes

for its employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 confers personal immunity upon members and

officers  of the Corporation for any action  taken  by

them  for  the purpose of carrying out the  provisions

under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bi1l contains provisions dealing with

the   Corporation's  financial  year,  the   financial

procedure to be adopted by the Corporation, the audit,

preparation  and publication of annual  statements  of

accounts  and  reports. Under clause 27, the  Minister

may  make  grants,  approved  by  Parliament,  to  the

Corporation to enable it to carry out its functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII of the Bill contains miscellaneous

provisions  dealing with such matters  as  the  common

seal  of  the Corporation, the execution of documents,

and  the  power  to make regulations relating  to  the

appointment,  promotion,  dismissal  and  disciplinary

control of employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passing of this Bill a major step forward

would  have  been  taken towards reforming  our  penal

system.

may point out a few examples. For instance, in respect

of salary scales for its employees, the Board can work

out its own salary scales which need not be approved

by the Establishment Division of the Ministry of

Finance. It can carry out business dealings or

organise the sale of the products of the Prison

industry without having to follow Government

procedures, and so on and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Reorganisation Committee in its Report

submitted to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



Government  last  year  observed  that  sentences   of

corrective training on young offenders who show  signs

of  embarking on a lifetime of crime and sentences  of

preventive detention on habitual criminals are  rarely

passed   by  our  courts.  The  Committee  recommended

therefore  that  judicial  officers  in  dealing  with

offenders  should be compelled to consider  passing  a

sentence  of either corrective training or  preventive

detention. The Committee further recommended that  the

courts  should also be empowered to impose  caning  in

addition  to  sentences  of  corrective  training   or

preventive detention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee noted that, under the existing section

12  of  the  Criminal Procedure Code,  a  sentence  of

corrective training could range from two to four years

but   under  section  3(1)  of  the  Criminal  Justice

(Temporary Provisions) Act, the permissible range of a

sentence  of  corrective training is  three  to  seven

years. The Committee recommended that the range  of  a

sentence  of  corrective training under  the  Criminal

Procedure Code should also be three to seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also recommended that the Criminal

Procedure Code be amended so as to -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) enhance the jurisdiction of the District Courts

by  empowering District Judges to pass sentences of up

to  five years for first offenders and up to ten years

for habitual offenders; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) empower the Magistrates' Courts to pass sentences

of up to two years on first offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill seek to amend the

Criminal  Procedure  Code  to  give  effect  to  these

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience has shown that determined criminals are

not  sufficiently  deterred by  merely  enhancing  the

punishments for various offences. A greater  deterrent

would be to increase the chances of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



conviction when they are apprehended and, with this in

mind, it has been decided through this Amendment  Bill

to   adopt  certain  of  the  recommendations  of  the

Criminal Law Revision Committee of the United  Kingdom

whose  report was presented to the U.K. Parliament  in

June 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to restrict greatly the so-called

"right   of   silence"  enjoyed   by   suspects   when

interrogated  by the police or by anyone charged  with

the  duty of investigating offences. By the "right  of

silence"  in this connection I mean the rule  that  if

the  suspect, when interrogated, omits to mention some

fact  which  would exculpate him but keeps  this  back

till  the  trial,  the court may not  infer  that  his

evidence  on this issue at the trial is untrue.  Under

the  proposals contained in clauses 5  and  6  of  the

Bill, it will be permissible to draw this inference if

the  circumstances justify it. The accused will  still

have the "right of silence" in the sense that it is no

offence  to  refuse to answer questions  or  tell  his

story  when interrogated; but if he chooses to  remain

silent,  he  will  risk `having an  adverse  inference

drawn against him at his trial and the failure may, on

the basis of such inference, be treated as capable  of

amounting  to  corroboration  of  any  evidence  given

against  him.  The Criminal Law Revision Committee  in

its report remarked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In our opinion it is wrong that it should not be

permissible for the jury or magistrates' court to draw

whatever inferences are reasonable from the failure of

the  accused, when interrogated, to mention a  defence

which `he puts forward at his trial. To  forbid  it  seems to us to be contrary  to  common

sense  and, without helping the innocent, to  give  an

unnecessary   advantage  to   the   guilty.   Hardened

criminals often take advantage of the present rule  to

refuse  to answer any questions at all, and  this  may

greatly  hamper  the  police  and  even  bring   their

investigations to a halt. Therefore the  abolition  of

the restriction would help justice.'



<br><br>It  is  as  much in the public interest that a  guilty

person  should be convicted as it is that an  innocent

person should be acquitted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the proposal to allow adverse inferences to be

drawn  from  the  accused's silence  is  accepted,  it

follows that the requirements of the so-called Judges'

Rules   contained  in  Schedule  E  to  the   Criminal

Procedure  Code to caution a suspect that  he  is  not

obliged  to say anything must be abolished or replaced

by  different  kinds of warnings or  intimations.  The

Bill  therefore  proposes that after the  accused  has

been  charged with an offence he should be served with

a   notice  in  writing  advising  him  that   adverse

inferences may be drawn from his failure to mention  a

fact on which he is going to rely at his trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom Government has not taken any steps

to  introduce legislation based on the recommendations

of  their  Criminal Law Revision Committee  but  their

report has been debated in the House of Lords, and the

Council of the Law Society and the General Council  of

the  Bar of England and Wales have submitted memoranda

on  it.  The recommendation to restrict the  right  of

silence and to abolish the Judges' Rules attracted the

most  severe criticism. Some of the comments contained

in  the  memoranda  of  the Law Society  and  the  Bar

Council  have  been found to be not  relevant  in  the

Singapore  context. In this context I must  point  out

that  we  have  no jury in Singapore and  we  have  to

assume  that our magistrates and judges can empathise.

it  is relevant to note here that whereas a very  high

proportion  of  the  criminal  cases  heard   in   the

magistrates' courts in England and Wales are tried  by

lay  justices,  all the magistrates in  Singapore  are

today legally trained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism is that there is little to protect

the  vast majority of alleged offenders who are to  be

required   in  a  situation  of  stress  to  formulate

defences  to  as  yet an unspecified charge,  or  risk

having  adverse  inferences drawn against  them  at  a

later,  and perhaps more critical stage. But clause  S

of the Bill requires the accused to be served with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



notice  in writing setting out the charge to which  he

has  to answer. He does not have to formulate defences

in  relation to anything else he may have  done.  This

provision  does not appear in the draft Bill  prepared

by   the  Criminal  Law  Revision  Committee.  Another

criticism is to the effect that it is quite wrong that

the  accused's  silence when interrogated  or  charged

should  be  capable of being regarded as corroborative

of  other  evidence implicating the accused.  However,

under the present law the suspect who tells a lie  may

be  regarded  as  providing  cogent  evidence  against

himself  capable  of  amounting to  corroboration.  An

extension of this rule to cover the accused's  silence

when  confronted  with a specified charge  should  not

therefore cause undue alarm. Whether his silence  does

or does not amount to corroboration must depend on all

the  circumstances of the particular case and this  is

precisely  what  the  Bill  states.  However,  serious

consideration has been given to these criticisms,  and

the  proposals of the Criminal Law Revision  Committee

have  been  modified  to suit the system  of  criminal

justice  operating in Singapore and to provide further

safeguards. For instance, clause 5 of the  Bill  seeks

to amend section 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code in

such  a  way  that  even though an accused  person  is

advised to disclose his defence, if the making of  any

statement by an accused person appears to the court to

be   caused  by  an  inducement,  threat  or   promise

proceeding from a person in authority, the  court  may

in  its  discretion refuse to admit such statement  or

allow  it to be used in cross-examination or  for  the

purpose of impeaching his credit. And clause l6 of the

Bill does not seek to adopt the recommendation of  the

Criminal  Law  Revision Committee that  the  accused's

failure to give evidence on oath or affirmation at his

trial should be capable of providing corroboration  in

law of any evidence given against him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another long standing practice which the Bill seeks

to abolish is the accused's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



right  to make an unsworn statement from the  dock  in

his own defence instead of giving evidence on oath  or

affirmation. Although the legal status of  an  unsworn

statement  is  that  of  a kind of  inferior  evidence

because  it  is  not given on oath or affirmation,  an

accused who has something to hide and does not wish to

be  subject to cross-examination would invariably take

advantage  of  his right to make an unsworn  statement

from  the  dock.  However, if an  accused  who  has  a

criminal record wishes to make imputations against the

character of the witnesses for the prosecution, it may

be  to  his  advantage  to make an  unsworn  statement

instead of giving evidence on oath; for in the  latter

case,  but not the former, he will be liable  to  have

his criminal record brought out by the prosecution. In

England,  the  right  to  make  an  unsworn  statement

derived from the time when the accused was not allowed

legal   representation  (except   in   the   case   of

misdemeanours), but for some years before the Criminal

Evidence Act, 1898, the accused was allowed to make an

unsworn statement about The facts whether or , not  he

was  legally represented. It might have been  expected

that,  when the 1898 Act allowed him to give  evidence

on  oath, it would have abolished the right to make an

unsworn  statement  as no longer  serving  any  useful

purpose. Instead the Act expressly preserved the right

in  keeping  with the policy of the Act that  pressure

should not be put on the accused to take advantage  of

the  new  right to give evidence on oath. The  learned

members   of  the  Criminal  Law  Revision   Committee

observed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We think that the time has come to reverse this

policy....  We  are strongly of the opinion  that  the

right  to  make an unsworn statement about  the  facts

instead  of  giving  evidence on oath  or  affirmation

should be abolished. Whatever justification there  may

have  been for preserving the right in 1898: we  think

that  nowadays  the  accused, if  he  gives  evidence,

should do so in the same way as other witnesses and be

subject to cross-examination.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not only followed the English practice by

giving  the  accused  the right  to  make  an  unsworn

statement.  We  have gone even further  than  that  by

allowing  him to tender or read out from  the  dock  a

written statement prepared by his lawyer. It does  not

appear  to  be  in  the interest of justice  that  the

accused  should  have  the  advantages  I  have   just

mentioned, for what they may be worth. Clauses 10,  14

and  16  of  the  Bill therefore seek  to  change  the

procedure in trials before the Subordinate Courts  and

the High Court, abolishing the right of an accused  to

make  an unsworn statement about the facts instead  of

giving evidence on oath or affirmation. If the accused

refuses  to  give evidence on oath or affirmation  the

court  may draw inferences as appear proper  from  the

refusal,  if without good cause. However, the  accused

shall  not  be compelled to give evidence on  his  own

behalf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 proposes to require the accused to give

notice  to  the  Court or to the Public Prosecutor  of

particulars  of any alibi, if such is his defence.  If

he does not give such notice, he shall not without the

leave  of the court adduce evidence in support of  the

alibi  at  his  trial. In 1972 the Criminal  Procedure

Code  was amended so as to require an accused to  give

notice  of his alibi at a preliminary inquiry, but  no

such  requirement was imposed in respect of a  summary

trial in the Magistrates' and District Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 of the Bill seeks to make radical changes

to  the  rule against hear say evidence. This rule  is

summarised  in the third edition of Professor  Cross's

"Evidence" on page 387 as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Express or implied assertions of persons other than

the  witness  who  is testifying,  and  assertions  in

documents  produced to the court when  no  witness  is

testifying, are inadmissible as evidence of the  truth

of that which was `asserted.'.



<br><br>The  rule,  however, is subject to a large  number  of

exceptions,  the  best  known of  which  are  informal

admissions   and   confessions,  dying   declarations,

statements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



in  public documents and some statements admissible as

being part of the res gestae. But there are many other

exceptions,  some by common law and some  by  statute.

Professor Cross has pointed out that the admission  of

certain  kinds of evidence "can only be  explained  on

the footing that there are many more exceptions to the

hearsay rule than is commonly supposed".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law has caused a great deal of trouble

owing   to  the  difficulty  of  deciding  whether   a

statement  is  hearsay, and,  if  so,  whether  it  is

admissible  under any of the exceptions to  the  rule.

The   difficulty   is   further  compounded   by   the

differences  between the English law of  evidence  and

our law which is based on the Indian Evidence Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme that the Bill proposes has the following

purposes:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to admit all hearsay evidence likely to be

valuable to the greatest extent possible without undue

complication or delay to the proceedings;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to ensure that evidence should continue to be

given  for  the  most part orally by allowing  hearsay

evidence only if the maker of the statement cannot  be

called  or  it  is  desirable to supplement  his  oral

evidence; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to include necessary safeguards against the

danger of manufactured hearsay evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals in this Bill relating to hearsay

evidence  adopt many of the recommendations  contained

in  the  Criminal  Law  Revision Committee's  Eleventh

Report. Certain modifications have been made to  these

proposals after considering the views expressed by the

General  Council of the Bar of England and  Wales  and

the  Council  of the Law Society of England  in  their

memoranda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to amend other

sections of the Code to correct existing mistakes  and

anomalies as well as to expedite the administration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



justice as when an accused wishes to plead guilty  in

the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to refer the Bill to Select Committee

where   all  representations  will  be  given  careful

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today no less than four Bills are

being  debated, which are intended to make substantial

amendments  to our judicial system. We have  just  had

the    Criminal    Justice   (Temporary    Provisions)

(Amendment)  Bill  passed. Now  we  are  debating  the

Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill, and later we

shall  be going through the Evidence (Amendment)  Bill

and    the   Criminal   Law   (Temporary   Provisions)

(Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sudden introduction of amendments to so many

of  our Criminal Law Acts, one begins to wonder if all

these   pieces  of  legislation  were  defective.   No

evidence has been advanced so far to substantiate  the

need  for  radical changes which the passing of  these

Bills will have on our judicial practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are so many hon. Members in this House

with  legal  training,  I  would  leave  to  them  the

intricacies of the debate in respect of legal matters.

However, I would like to touch on two clauses  of  the

Bill, namely, clauses 5 and 6 which, even as a layman,

I feel I can comment on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 deletes the legal requirement to give a

caution  to  a  person  under  arrest  before  he   is

interrogated  by  the police. Instead,  he  is  to  be

served   with  a  notice  advising  him  that  adverse

inferences may be drawn from his failure to mention  a

fact  on which he is going to rely at his trial. This,

to  me,  means  a person arrested, even before  he  is

charged,  has  to  spill the beans.  If  he  does  not

mention a fact that is later brought out in his trial,

then adverse inferences would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



drawn. During the course of a lengthy trial, all sorts

of  minor  as well as major facts are brought  out  in

court. If any one of the facts that is brought out  in

court has not been mentioned by the accused during the

arrest  and interrogation by the police, then,  it  is

going  to adversely affect the accused. This, I  feel,

is a fundamental deviation from the existing law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 6, the accused cannot even remain

silent. While being interrogated, the silence  of  the

accused  is  to be taken as amounting to corroboration

of   any  evidence  against  him.  When  he  is  being

interrogated  by a police officer who  could  even  be

just  a  police constable, the accused must  be  in  a

position to make up his mind immediately what line  of

defence he is going to take during the trial and  must

inform the interrogator the facts he is going to  rely

on  for  his  defence. He has to make a decision  even

before he has an opportunity to consult legal counsel.

There is no question of legal advice that he may  have

to seek in order to put up his defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure there are many other points in this Bill

that  need  further and more important comments  which

hon.  Members from the legal profession in  the  House

would no doubt make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, these two clauses are sufficiently important

as fundamental changes from the present procedures. To

me, it means that if the police cannot secure evidence

through detective work, they can get evidence by  just

arresting  an accused and interrogating him.  What  he

says or what he does not say is to be used as evidence

against him. Are we trying to promulgate laws to cover

up   for  police  deficiency?  Are  our  laws  to   be

promulgated to rectify the ineffectiveness  of  police

investigations? Is Parliament asked to do police work?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this Bill is being committed to a

Select Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the report of the

Criminal Law Revision Committee, I take the view that

this Bill will have the effect of changing or removing

altogether time-tested legal concepts and practices in

criminal law. What is more, it will construct new

instruments of prosecution for the prosecuting power

of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Bill are not selective

provisions, selective in the sense that they relate to

certain  offences.  They are blanket  provisions.  The

meaning  and implications of the changes described  in

the  Bill are extensive and are not obvious. How  they

relate  to  criminal practice and the conduct  of  the

court  in  its  function of administering  justice  is

highly important. The possibilities of clause 6 of the

Bill,  for  example, where the accused's  silence  can

corroborate the evidence against his own silent person

are  not  easily  discernible. The  Member  for  Telok

Blangah  has  also made reference to this clause  with

some expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 abolishes the right of an accused to make

an unsworn statement and he runs the risk of having an

adverse  inference made against him if he  refuses  to

give evidence, on oath without good cause. Whatever is

contemplated   by  "good  cause"  is  left   extremely

indefinite  good cause for the court, good  cause  for

the  prosecutor  or good cause for the accused  person

himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the Bill are indeed far-reaching and I

am  therefore  glad that this Bill  and  the  Evidence

(Amendment)  Bill  are  being committed  to  a  Select

Committee  where  they  will be  examined  in  greater

detail. But at this stage. Sir, I wish to express  the

hope  that  all  these changes which  will  facilitate

prosecution of the criminal by apparently constricting

the defence of the accused will not have the result of

blunting  the  effectiveness of criminal investigation

which  ends  with the apprehension of the criminal  in

the very first place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I thank both Members for their criticisms and

interest  in  this  Bill  which,  as  the  Member  for

Serangoon Gardens says, makes radical and far-reaching

changes. It is for this reason that the Bill is  being

sent  to a Select Committee where, as I said, we would

welcome  representations  which  will  be  given  very

careful consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage I do not think I should take on both

Members  except that perhaps I should welcome them  to

the Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early days of Singapore's drive towards

industrialisation,   one   of   the   more   effective

instruments of investment promotion has been exemption

from  income tax granted under the Economic  Expansion

Incentives  (Relief from Income Tax)  Act.  Under  the

Act, companies implementing new and desirable projects

could  be  granted pioneer status which  exempts  them

from income tax for a period of five years. By the end

of  April,  1975, there were a total  of  411  pioneer

enterprises,   investing  some  $3,100   million   and

manufacturing a wide range of products in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we strive towards higher levels of skills

and  technology  in our industrialisation  effort,  we

have found that the existing tax relief period of five

years  is  too  short  to  provide  an  effective  tax

incentive   for  the  more  sophisticated   types   of

industries  which  we  are now trying  to  attract  to

Singapore. These new industries such as machine tools,

diesel   engines,   precision  instruments,   aircraft

components,   specialised  electrical  equipment   and

industrial  machinery  involve  much  heavier  capital

investments  in plant and machinery and  require  more

sophisticated  manufacturing  skills  which  are  only

acquired   after   long  periods  of  training.   Such

industries have long gestation periods and  take  much

longer  time to become profitable, some breaking  even

only in the fourth or fifth year of production. A five-year  tax  relief period would therefore  not  benefit

them  to  any  extent and a longer period  of  pioneer

status   is  now  necessary  to  encourage  such   new

industries to establish in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, section 6 of the Act is being amended to extend

the tax relief period of a pioneer enterprise from the

present fixed period of five years to a maximum of ten

years.  The  longer period of tax relief  will  enable

desirable  industries with long gestation  periods  to

effectively  enjoy  pioneer tax  incentives  and  thus

provide  a  more effective promotional  tool  for  the

further   upgrading   of  manufacturing   skills   and

technology  in Singapore. The maximum ten  years'  tax

relief  will  only  be granted to the  most  deserving

cases   involving   large  capital   investments   and

sophisticated technology and manufacturing skills. The

longer  period  of pioneer status will only  apply  to

pioneer  certificates  awarded after  the  date  these

amendments come into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to encourage the establishment of small

but  highly specialised supporting industries, section

5  of  the Act is also being amended to dispense  with

the requirement that a company



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



must  incur  a fixed capital expenditure of  not  less

than  $1  million  before it is eligible  for  pioneer

status. With the establishment of a widening range  of

large  scale manufacturing plants in Singapore,  there

is  an  increasing  need  for  specialised  supporting

industries  to  supply  parts and  components  to  the

larger    manufacturing   plants.   Such    supporting

industries often involve sophisticated technology  and

skills  but  owing to their smaller size  their  fixed

capital  investment may not reach $1 million.  Removal

of  this  minimum investment requirement  will  enable

pioneer  tax  incentive  to be  used  to  promote  the

establishment of such desirable supporting  industries

which  are now playing an increasingly important  role

in  the  further  integration and development  of  our

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequential amendments are also being made to

sections 10 and 25 of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill which seeks

to provide greater and better tax relief incentives to

certain types of industries which help to promote  our

industrialisation programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the world economic recession and the fact

that  its  effects are still being felt, and that  the

Government  is trying its best to revive our  economic

activity,  the  Economic Development  Board  has  more

important  tasks  to perform. Foreign  investments  in

Singapore have decreased this year, amounting to  only

one-third  of that of last year. This shows  that  our

economic  position  has  been affected.  The  Economic

Development  Board, therefore, has the immediate  .and

urgent task of attracting more foreign investment into

Singapore   so   as   to  promote  our   economy   and

industrialisation programme, thus creating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



more  jobs  for our people. In this respect,  I  would

like  to raise certain Un-favourable comments  on  the

Economic Development Board for the information of  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received certain complaints from foreign

investors  who  wish  to  invest  in  Singapore.   One

complaint  is that an applicant normally has  to  wait

for  half  a  year to one year before he receives  any

reply. This delay in replying will discourage foreign'

investors from investing in our local industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that the staff in the relevant

department  have  not  been  giving  good  advice   or

direction to foreign investors. Perhaps it is  due  to

the  lack of commercial knowledge on the part  of  the

public  servants concerned. If that is  the  case,  we

should  train  them properly so that they  can  better

handle  inquiries from foreign investors.  This  is  a

very  important  aspect  of  our  effort  at  economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to safeguard our industrial

sector  the  Bill before the House is  a  timely  one.

However,  in  order to attract fresh  investment,  the

Government  should continue to give  every  assistance

arid  encouragement to existing manufacturers, whether

or  not the nature of their particular operations  has

stepped out of line with our long range objectives  on

account of shift in emphasis. For example, the current

emphasis  is on higher technological and less  labour-intensive type of operations. However, we should  not,

because  of  this, leave those less sophisticated  and

labour-intensive type of operations  uncared  for,  or

even let them feel that they are unwanted. While costs

and other market factors will most probably force some

such operations to close down ultimately, we should in

the  meantime  continue to give them every  assistance

and  support wherever possible so that their exit will

be made less painful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying so, I am not being sentimental. I am only

concerned with the impression that has been created  - that our attitude appears to be one of wooing the new,

deserting  the old, in our endeavours to attract  more

investments in our industrial sector.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for the advice which

both  Members  of the House have given  in  regard  to

investments in Singapore. We realise the necessity for

more   investments  not  only  from   people   outside

Singapore  but  also  from  people  who  are   already

manufacturing here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, a bit taken aback by the suggestion

of   the   Member  for  Sembawang  that  the  Economic

Development  Board is falling down on its job  because

the  applications have been left undecided for half  a

year  to  one  year.  I would have  thought  that  the

general  period of time taken for a decision  is  more

like  half  a  month to one month. If the  Member  for

Sembawang has any information of such applications,  I

for  one would certainly be very glad to hear of these

cases  because  with  the emphasis  that  we  are  now

placing  upon  industrial  investment  and  with  more

intensified promotion efforts by our offices  I  would

be  very  surprised  that there are  any  applications

which have been left undecided for one year or so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other criticism that some of the staff

have  not  been giving good advice, again I  would  be

very interested in knowing the kind of advice which is

considered  unsatisfactory,  and  I  can  assure, the

Member   for  Sembawang  that  if  his  criticism   is

justified it will certainly be corrected by  not  only

the  Economic Development Board itself but also by,  I

think,  an admonition from the Ministry of Finance.  I

do  not,  however, anticipate that there can  be  very

many  of  these  cases. The EDB is generally  regarded

even by foreign investors as being very efficient, and

I am surprised to hear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



about  this.  It  may be that this criticism  emanates

from existing manufacturers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta suggested that we are neglecting

the  existing  manufacturers. I can  assure  him  that

there is no intention of doing so and if they have any

interest  in  investing more money  or  if  they  need

advice in any way, whether financial or technical, the

EDB and the Ministry of Finance (Development Division)

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, let me give an example for the

information and reference of the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, I think it is best you give your example

to the Minister in writing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think it is better to say a few words here. It

is  about  the  guidance given by  the  staff  of  the

Economic Development Board on the proposal to set up a

textile  industry here. If such an enquiry is made  to

the  staff  of the EDB, they would say that there  are

too  many  textile factories here. The investor  would

then  say, "Please give me the kind of guidance as  to

what  type  of  industry would be welcome  here."  The

reply  would be: "You can make your own assessment  as

to  whether  or not there is an international  market,

and  then  we will approve your plan." As a matter  of

fact  the staff of the EDB should give guidance as  to

what  types  of  industry  would  be  more  favourably

received here, together with certain useful hints.  If

the  applicant has taken several months to draw  up  a

proposed  plan and it is not accepted in the  end,  he

will  be  wasting  his time in addition  to  incurring

great inconvenience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the very short answer is that we are

prepared to give the advice, but perhaps what has been

misunderstood is that we cannot make the decision  for

the   investors.  They  have  to  decide  whether  any

particular industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



which they want to set up is likely to succeed.

Where  it  is obvious that there is really not  enough

market,  say,  for textile goods, at  this  particular

period of time, the EDB is right in advising them that

perhaps textile manufacturing is not an industry to go

into now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes to repeal the Rubber Estates

Assessment  Act  (Chapter 145) and the Rubber  Estates

(Surcharge on Assessment) Act (Chapter 146) and to tax

all rubber estates under the Property Tax Act (Chapter

144)  and the Property Tax (Surcharge) Act, 1974, with

effect from 1st January, 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of rubber estates is a relic of the

past.  In the present circumstances, it would  not  be

appropriate  to  perpetuate the practice  of  charging

rubber   estate   assessment   according   to   yield,

particularly when this is less than what is payable as

property tax. Moreover, all other land in Singapore is

subject to property tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed measure would achieve equitable tax

treatment  on  all  land. There would  be  no  adverse

effect  on  the economy as the production  of  natural

rubber  in  Singapore is on the decline and is  rather

insignificant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 enables the Chief Assessor to amend, as soon

as  possible,  the  Valuation List to  include  rubber

estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that any outstanding liability or

any  legal  proceedings in respect of  such  liability

shall   not  be  affected  by  the  repeal  of   these

enactments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is a transitional provision. Owners of

rubber  estates are allowed to continue  paying  taxes

levied under the repealed enactments. Such payment  of

assessment shall be deemed as property tax.  When  the

Valuation  List  is authenticated, the Comptroller  of

Property  Tax  shall make the necessary adjustment  of

property tax payable on the rubber estates with effect

from  1st  January, 1976. This may  result  in  owners

having  to pay more taxes or to claim refund of excess

taxes paid, as the case may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, no less than 1,230,000 visitors came to

Singapore  compared  with 580,000  visitors  in  1970.

Earnings  from tourism increased from $280 million  in

1970   to   $758   million   in   1974,   contributing

respectively  4.8% and 5.9% of Gross Domestic  Product

in these two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Tourist Promotion Board is empowered

by the Tourist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



Promotion  Board  Act (Cap. 205) to  license  only

travel  agents  engaged  in  inbound  travel.  But

instances of malpractices by agents handling  out-bound travel have been reported. It is, therefore,

proposed to license these travel agents as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Travel Agents Bill, 1975, will empower the

Singapore Tourist Promotion Board to regulate  the

activities  of  all  travel agents  in  Singapore,

whether handling in-bound or out-bound tours.  All

tourist  enterprises will have to be licensed.  In

considering the grant of a licence, the Board will

take into account the character and reputation  of

the  applicant. Any applicant previously convicted

of  any offence involving fraud or moral turpitude

will  be  denied  a licence. The Board  will  also

impose any condition as is reasonable, and to vary

or  to revoke any licence so granted. However, any

person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Board

may,  within a month, appeal to the Minister whose

decision will be final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Compensation Fund will be created to mitigate

the  difficulties of travellers cheated,  or  left

stranded, by their travel agents. It will be  made

up  of levies to be imposed on tourist enterprises

as   a  condition  of  licensing.  The  Board  has

proposed  that the levy be made up of  two  tiers,

comprising  a  first-tier  primary  cash  levy  of

$5,000 and a second-tier of acceptable instruments

or guarantees for a value of $20,000. In the event

of  default,  the  second-tier guarantee  will  be

invoked first so as not to drain the cash reserves

proper of the Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is satisfied that the Compensation Fund

Scheme will be welcomed by the tourist industry as

one effective way of relieving problems caused  by

malpractices of unscrupulous travel agents.  Major

travel agencies, which assisted in the formulation

of the Scheme, do not consider the proposed $5,000

cash  payment  and  $20,000 securities  as  unduly

onerous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Compensation Fund Committee, with powers to

make  payments, will be appointed by the Minister.

The assets of the Fund, though the property of the

Board,  will  be  kept  separate  from  all  other

property,  and  will be held in trust.  The  Board

may, after consultation with the Committee, invest

funds not immediately required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any licensee who fraudulently converts to his own

use,  fares  or  other monies paid  by  travellers

shall  be  liable, on conviction, `to imprisonment

for a term not exceeding three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, therefore, provides some safeguards

against  malpractices by travel  agents.  However,

those  who travel would be well advised to  always

exercise  their  judgment in  purchasing  services

from  travel  agents, even if they  are  licensed.

Disbursements from the Compensation Fund will  not

compensate  in  full measure for losses  of  money

and, more important, time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand the purpose of this

Bill.

While   appreciating  the  rationale  behind   the

introduction of the Bill, I am a little  perturbed

as to the consequences that this Bill will have on

Singaporeans who wish to travel as well  as  those

who are in the travel agency business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt, as a result of the Bill, that

the  cost of travel is going to increase. Although

the intention of the Bill is to see that there are

no  fly-by-night  travel  agencies  and  that  the

travelling public is protected, the cost of travel

is bound to go up. This protection that we hope to

offer  will  no doubt ensure that travel  agencies

are properly organised and managed. The control we

try to ad-minister will stifle the free enterprise

economy  that we have in Singapore. The additional

expense that is to be borne by the travel agencies

will certainly be passed on to the customers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the Bill, there will be two financial

commitments on the part of the travel agencies. One is

the  licensing fee and the other is the payment to the

Compensation Fund. How much the licensing fee is going

to  be  and how much the travel agencies have  to  pay

towards  the  Compensation Fund will be  left  to  the

Board to decide, although the Minister mentioned  just

now  about  the  primary cash levy of $5,000  and  the

other  payment to be in the form of a bank  guarantee,

if  I  understood him correctly. The  payment  to  the

Compensation  Fund  could  consist  of,  according  to

clause 32(f) an initial contribution as well as annual

contributions.  If these contributions  are  to  be  a

deterrent  to  the  setting  up  of  mosquito   travel

agencies,  then  they  should be substantial.  If  the

payments are not substantial, then they would not be a

deterrent  to anybody to set up a travel agency.  This

would,  as I have said earlier, increase the  cost  of

running  a travel agency and the additional cost  will

be passed on to the travellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the purpose of the Compensation Fund is to

safeguard   the  welfare  of  Singaporeans  travelling

abroad, if they are stranded and lose financially as a

result of the shady business of the travel agency, and

not  to  increase  the funds of the Tourist  Promotion

Board,  then I would suggest that the licensed  travel

agencies be required to provide a bank guarantee of  a

sum  to be decided by the Tourist Promotion Board  and

not pay such sums into the Compensation Fund. The bank

guarantee  should  be a sufficient  deterrent  and  it

would not be an excuse for travel agencies to increase

their fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contend, Sir, that it is a good thing to encourage

Singapore  citizens  to travel abroad,  especially  to

other  countries in Asia. When the greatest critic  of

Singapore comes back after a trip



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



abroad,  he  appreciates  Singapore  more  than   ever

before.  Let me quote the example of a politician  who

was  the  greatest critic of the Singapore  Government

and  its  way of life. When he came back after  having

been away for a short while from Singapore in 1972, he

said   that   "there  is  no  place  like  Singapore".

Therefore,  these  restrictions  imposed   on   travel

agencies will result in an increased cost of running a

travel agency which no doubt will be passed on to  the

travelling  public  and  will  reduce  the  number  of

Singaporeans going abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contend that the same safeguards for Singapore

travellers   can  be  obtained  by  other   forms   of

registration of travel agencies, prosecuting them when

they  fall  foul of the law or when they  cheat  their

clients    by   not   fulfilling   their   contractual

obligations. Sir, there are reputable, well-run travel

agencies  as  well as not-so reputable ones.  But  the

enforcement of this Act will penalise the good  travel

agencies as well as the bad agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to clauses 20, 21, 22 and 23 which

deal  with  the  power to search  premises,  power  to

arrest, power to investigate, and powers of the Board.

Under  the  provisions of these  clauses,  any  police

constable has a right to search all persons found in a

travel  agency,  seize all documents, detain  persons,

arrest  any  person without a warrant, take possession

of all articles, etc, if the police constable suspects

that  the travel agency has committed an offence under

this  Act. This, I am afraid, with due respect to  our

Police  Force,  gives  a  police  constable  unlimited

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this Bill also cover those airlines that are not

registered as travel agencies but offer package tours,

which  include  travel,  transportation,  sightseeing,

hotel accommodation, etc.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this Bill is being cornmitted to a

Select  Committee,  and  I am  sure  that  the  travel

agencies will, make the necessary representations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not propose to make a lengthy reply since

the Bill is going to Select Committee, but some of the

comments  by  the  Member for  Telok  Blangah  can  be

considered now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all agreed that there is a necessity for some

kind  of  regulation.  We are also  agreed  that  this

should  be maintained at the lowest possible  cost  to

the  traveller.  At the same time, we are  all  agreed

that  there  should be a maximum fund to compensate  a

traveller in case of any malpractice by travel agents.

Some  of  these objectives are in conflict  with  each

other  because  obviously we cannot  have  the  lowest

possible  cost  to the traveller if we insist  upon  a

very high compensation fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only comment on one suggestion that there

should  be a bank guarantee instead of cash.  That  is

already  taken care of in my speech, i.e, the  second-tier  of  acceptable instruments or guarantees  for  a

value of $20,000 could possibly take into account  the

bank  guarantee instead of cash. The two tiers consist

of a first-tier of a cash levy of $5,000 and a second-tier  of  acceptable instruments or  guarantees  which

would  be  to  the value of $20,000. Of course,  these

sums  can be varied and I have no doubt that in Select

Committee  full  consideration can  be  given  to  any

representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other comment which the Member has made about

the  powers of the police constable to arrest  and  to

seize documents and so on, I have no doubt again  that

these can be considered in Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the existing Tourist Promotion Board Act (Cap.

205)  empowers  the Tourist Promotion Board,  with  my

approval,   to   regulate  standards   which   tourist

enterprises are expected to maintain, these powers  do

not  extend to tourist enterprises providing  services

to out-bound travellers. It is proposed, therefore, to

amend  section  2 of the Act, so that the  conduct  of

tourist  enterprises engaged in providing services  to

both   inbound   and  out-bound  travellers   can   be

regulated.  This is a consequential amendment  of  the

Travel  Agents  Bill which I have  earlier  moved  its

Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with international practice of identifying a

national tourist organisation through the name of  its

country,  the  name of the Board will be changed  from

"Tourist   Promotion  Board"  to  "Singapore   Tourist

Promotion    Board".   This   not   only   facilitates

international  communication but also  gives  official

authority    for   the   already   widely   recognised

abbreviation "STPB".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 16 of the Act is also to be amended so that

more closely the financial procedures laid down by the

Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Evidence Act needs to be amended to bring it

into  line  with  the  changes  proposed  for  the

Criminal  Procedure Code. The Bill also  seeks  to

clarify  certain sections of the Act  relating  to

the accused's character and his right to claim the

privilege  against self-incrimination and  against

incriminating his spouse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the

admissibility of statements produced by computers.

It  seems  desirable to include this provision  in

the  Bill  because the increasing use of computers

by  the  Post Office, statutory bodies, banks  and

business   firms   to  store  certain   kinds   of

information will make it more difficult  to  prove

certain matters, such as cheque frauds, unless  it

is   made  possible  for  this  to  be  done  from

computers.  Admissibility  is  subject  to  strict

conditions,   necessary   to   ensure   that   the

information is reliable, as to the regular  supply

of  information to the computer and to its  proper

working. Subsection (4) of section 34A in clause 3

of the Bill allows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



evidence  by  certificate in order to  identify  a

document  produced  by the computer  and  to  give

particulars of its working, but subsection (5)  of

section  34A enables the court for special  reason

to  require  oral evidence to be  given  of  these

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34B in clause 3 contains various

supplementary  provisions  relating  to  proof  of

documents, to the drawing of inferences,  for  the

purpose   of  deciding  admissibility,  from   the

circumstances in which a statement  was  made  and

from  the form and contents of a document, and  to

the   weight   to  be  attached  to  a   statement

admissible  under section 34A. Subsection  (3)  of

section  34B  provides  that  in  estimating   the

weight,  if  any, to be attached  to  a  statement

produced by a computer, regard shall be had to all

the  circumstances  and,  in  particular,  to  its

contemporaneity or otherwise and to  the  question

whether any person who was in a position to do  so

had  any  reason  to conceal or  misrepresent  the

facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, section 54 of our Evidence Ordinance was

amended  to take away the accused's immunity  from

cross-examination  about his other  misconduct  if

the  accused has personally or by his advocate and

solicitor asked questions of the witnesses for the

prosecution  with a view to establishing  his  own

good  character, or has given evidence of his good

character,  or  the  nature  and  conduct  of  the

defence is such as to involve imputations  on  the

character  of  the  prosecution  witness,  or  the

accused  has  given  evidence  against  any  other

person  charged  with  the  same  offence.  Modern

criminals,  however, have developed a practice  of

giving  the  impression that they are  respectable

persons  while  avoiding taking any  course  which

clearly enables the court to hold that the accused

has  personally or by his advocate  and  solicitor

asked  questions of witnesses for the  prosecution

with   a   view  to  establishing  his  own   good

character, or has given evidence of his good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



character  within  the meaning of  subsection  (2)  of

section  54 of the Evidence Act. Moreover, section  54

of the Act does not make it clear that the prosecution

can  adduce evidence to prove that the accused is  not

of good character and at what stage of the proceedings

it  may  do  so.  Clause  4 of  the  Bill,  therefore,

proposes  to  clarify the situation and to  deal  with

cases  in  which  it  is hinted indirectly,  that  the

accused  is a respectable person. The clause makes  it

clear  that  a co-accused, as well as the prosecution,

may cross-examine the accused to rebut his claim to be

of  good  disposition  or reputation  and  may  adduce

evidence  for this purpose. However, clause 6 proposes

to  restrict the right of the prosecution or of a  co-accused to cross-examine the, accused about misconduct

other than that involved in the offence charged on the

ground  that  he  has  made  imputations  against  the

witnesses  against him. The court shall not  permit  a

question  tending  to  reveal  that  the  accused  has

committed  or  has been charged with or  convicted  or

acquitted of any offence or that he is a person of bad

disposition or reputation unless it is the opinion  of

the  court  that  the  question  is  relevant  to  the

accused's  credibility  as a  witness.  However,  this

restriction  does not apply to a question  tending  to

prove  that  the  accused has  committed  the  offence

charged  or  to  a question which will  enable  a  co-accused to reveal a fact which would prove that he  is

not  guilty  of any offence with which he  is  jointly

charged with the accused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 restricts in two ways the right of the

accused,  if he gives evidence, to claim the privilege

against  self-incrimination or  against  incriminating

his  spouse.  The proposal is that the accused  should

have  no privilege against self-incrimination  in  the

case  of a question about the offence charged or about

any  other  offence  which is admissible  as  standing

directly  or indirectly to show that he committed  the

offence  charged  but  should have  the  privilege  in

respect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



of   other   offences  which  are  relevant   to   his

credibility as a witness. But no privilege  should  be

allowed  if  the accused has claimed  to  be  of  good

disposition or reputation. On the same principle,  the

accused   should  be  allowed  no  privilege   against

incriminating  his  wife  except  in  relation  to  an

offence going to his credibility as a witness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 8 and 10 of the Bill seek to abrogate the

common  law rule, making it obligatory for a judge  to

give  a  warning  of the danger of convicting  on  the

uncorroborated   evidence  of  an  accomplice.   Since

corroboration is not required as a matter of  law,  it

follows that the conviction will not be quashed merely

because of absence of corroboration; but if the  judge

does  not warn himself the conviction will be quashed,

even if there is corroboration, unless the appeal  can

be  dismissed  on the ground that "no  miscarriage  of

justice  has  actually occurred".  Since  evidence  in

corroboration  must  be "independent  testimony  which

affects  the  accused  by  connecting  or  tending  to

connect him with the crime", it follows that a witness

cannot  corroborate himself. A witness whose  evidence

requires corroboration, or in whose case corroboration

has  to  be  looked  for under the common  law  rules,

cannot  be corroborated by a similar witness. Thus  an

unsworn  child  cannot  corroborate  another  and  one

accomplice cannot corroborate another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may well ask, who is an accomplice? There is

no  legal  definition of the word. But  on  any  view,

persons are accomplices who are participes criminis in

respect  of  the  actual  crime  charged,  whether  as

principals or accessories before or after the fact  or

persons  committing, procuring or aiding and abetting.

This  is  the natural and primary meaning of the  term

"accomplice." But persons falling strictly outside the

ambit   of  this  category  have  been  held   to   be

accomplices;  e.g, receivers have  been  held  to  be

accomplices of the thieves from whom they received the

goods although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



the  receiver  was  not necessarily  a  party  to  the

substantive crime of theft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law rules have the great disadvantage' of

being  sometimes difficult to apply owing to technical

distinctions, for example as to what kinds of evidence

may he corroboration and as to whether a person is  an

accomplice.   These  difficulties  have  caused   many

mistaken rulings at trials and consequent quashings of

convictions. One disadvantage in particular is that  a

conviction  may have to be quashed if the judge  holds

that   a  piece  of  evidence  is  capable  of   being

corroboration but the appellate court holds that it is

not capable of being so. Convictions have been quashed

even  in  cases  where  there was  ample  evidence  to

convict  the  accused  because  the  appellate   court

considered  that the judge might have found  that  the

evidence was corroborated when in fact it was not, and

so  have  thought that the danger referred to did  not

exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for exercising caution in accepting the

evidence of accomplices are obvious:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the accomplice being a criminal, his evidence is

impugned;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an accomplice has a strong motive to remove

suspicion from himself by fixing it on another;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if he has a spite against the accused, then,

knowing  all the circumstances of the crime,  he  will

have  little  difficulty  in making  convincing  false

charges against him, although the accused is innocent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as long ago as 1836 when it was only a rule of

practice  that a special direction should be given  as

to  the evidence of accomplices, Henry Joy, Lord Chief

Baron  of the Court of Exchequer in Ireland, published

a  book, On the Evidence of Accomplices, in the course

of which he wrote:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How the practice which at present prevails, could

ever  have  grown into a general regulation,  must  be

matter  of surprise to every person who considers  its

nature. Why the case of an accomplice should require a

particular  rule for itself: why it should  not,  like

that  of every other witness of whose credit there  is

an  impeachment, he left to the unfettered  discretion

of  the judge, to deal with it as the circumstances of

each  particular case nay require, it seems  difficult

to  explain.  Why  a fixed unvarying  rule  should  be

applied  to  a  subject which admits of  such  endless

variety  as  the  credit  of witnesses,  seems  hardly

reconcilable to the principles of reason. (But, that a

judge  should  come prepared to reject altogether  the

testimony  of  a  competent  witness  as  unworthy  of

credit,  before he had even seen that witness;  before

he  had  observed his look, his manner, his demeanour;

before  he  had  an  opportunity  of  considering  the

consistency  and probability of his story;  before  he

had  known the nature of the crime of which he was  to

accuse himself, or the temptation which led to it,  or

the  contrition  with which it was followed;)  that  a

judge,  I  say,  should  come prepared  beforehand  to

advise  the jury to reject without consideration  such

evidence,  even  though  judge  and  jury  should   be

perfectly  convinced  of its  truth,  seems  to  he  a

violation  of  the  principles of  common  sense,  the

dictates  of morality, and the sanctity of  a  juror's

oath.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view that the present requirement is wrong is

also  in  accordance  with the views  of  the  learned

members of the Criminal Law Revision Committee of  the

United  Kingdom  whose  Eleventh  Report  on  Evidence

(General)   was   presented  to  the  United   Kingdom

Parliament in June 1972. It is felt `that it should be

a  matter for the judge's discretion whether or not to

convict   on   the  uncorroborated  evidence   of   an

accomplice and as long as the judge recognises who are

the  accused's accomplices in the case before him  and

treats their evidence with caution there should be  no

danger of a miscarriage of justice. There appears also

to be no real need for retaining the rule that certain

witnesses   are   incapable  of  corroborating   other

witnesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 proposes that a previous statement made by a

witness  should be admissible not only to  support  or

impugn his credibility as a witness but as evidence of

the  fact  stated in it. The present  law  has  caused

difficulty when evidence is given that a witness  made

a previous statement inconsistent with his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



evidence given in court. Evidence that the witness did

so  is admissible but it is admissible not in order to

prove  the  truth  of what was said  in  the  previous

statement but only in order to neutralise, the  effect

of  the  evidence given in court by the maker  of  the

statement.   Many  regard  this  as   too   subtle   a

distinction.  Similarly, where a document  used  by  a

witness  to  refresh  his  memory  is  proved,  it  is

proposed that the statement in that document shall  be

admissible as evidence of the facts stated in it.  The

law  at present requires the witness who has refreshed

his  memory  to produce and show to the adverse  party

the document used by him to refresh his memory and  he

may be cross-examined on the contents of such document

but  the  document shall not be admissible as evidence

of  the  facts  stated therein. The  above  proposals,

however, are subject to certain safeguards for  it  is

provided in subsection (5) of section 145 in clause  9

that  in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached

to  a  statement admissible under this clause,  regard

shall  be  had  to  all  the  circumstances  and,   in

particular, to its contemporaneity or otherwise and to

the  question whether any person who was in a position

to do so had any reason to conceal or misrepresent the

facts.   Subsection  (6)  proposes  that  a  statement

admissible  by  virtue of this  clause  shall  not  be

capable  of  corroborating the evidence given  by  the

maker of the statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)

Bill, it is the intention to refer this Bill to Select

Committee  where representations will be  welcome  and

will be given careful consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these four Bills that we have before

us in this House today relate to the administration of

criminal  justice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



in our courts. Whilst the provisions of   the   Criminal  Justice  (Temporary   Provisions) (Amendment)  Bill  do  not affect  the  substance  and character  of criminal trials, the provisions  of  the

Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill, the Evidence

(Amendment)  Bill  and  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions) (Amendment) Bill do. They make substantial

alterations,  among other changes, to the  law  as  it

stands now relating to caution statements made to  the

police  by an accused person before he is interrogated

by  the police, corroboration of the testimony  of  an

accomplice,   confession,  and  they  also   introduce

further refinements to the rule against hearsay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One's first instinctive reaction to the proposed

changes is one of suspicion born of the fact that this

is an instance of an already powerful executive branch

of  the  State seeking to increase its powers  in  its

dealings  with the citizens. But a closer  reading  of

the  provisions of these Bills would show  that  apart

from  removing  some of the fetters, presumptions  and

inferences that hamper the prosecution in proving  its

case  against  an  accused person, they  also  in  the

process    augmented    the   judicial    power    and

responsibility in ascertaining the truth or  otherwise

of  evidence  sought  to  be  proved  in  court.  This

tendency to grant greater judicial flexibility to  the

judge is to be welcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law relating to caution statements made by the

accused   to   the  police  and  to   the   need   for

corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice has  so

got  into  such  a  morass of  technicalities  that  a

caution  required  to  be  administered  by  a  police

officer   to   an   accused  person  before   he   was

interrogated  had become a piece of catechism  and  it

failed wholly to achieve the purpose that it was meant

to   achieve.  The  voluntariness  of  the   accused's

statement  was  not  enhanced and  the  prevention  of

police brutality during interrogation of witnesses was

not thereby automatically guaranteed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, Mr Speaker, Sir, that no crime would be

solved and no criminal brought to book on the basis of

purely voluntary statements made by accused persons or

witnesses to the police over cups of tea. It is a hard

fact  of  life  that due to the power  of  terror  and

reprisal  wielded by the secret societies in Singapore

no  witness to a violent crime would voluntarily  come

forward  to give evidence against a miscreant.  It  is

small  wonder that in approximately 70% of the  murder

trials,  convictions were obtained  on  the  basis  of

caution  statements  that were promptly  disavowed  in

court  amidst  allegations of police  brutality.  This

must  mean  that despite such allegations  our  judges

were  satisfied that the offences against the  accused

had been proved probably true beyond reasonable doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In human affairs even when the subject of inquiry was

susceptible  of  legal  proof,  certainty  is  usually

unattainable.  The substitute is probability  and  the

tribunal of fact had to decide which case was probably

true  and  in  a criminal trial probably  true  beyond

reasonable doubt. I must also point out that the  laws

relating  to hearsay, corroboration and the  reception

of  caution  statements were originally fashioned  and

laid down by the great judges of the common law in the

context of jury trials when juries had at all times to

be  guided  by judges on how to decide fairly  without

caprice or prejudice. Now that we do not have juries a

greater  latitude should be left for the free exercise

of  judicial reasoning and discretion and, insofar  as

this Bill achieves this; this House should welcome it,

particularly  so where over the years we have  enacted

laws that have in some measure taken away the business

of  judging  questions  dealing  with  rights  of  our

citizens  from the judiciary and placed  them  in  the

hands of the executive. This is a derogation from  the

judicial power under our Constitu-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



tion  and  may  well be ultra vires  and  void.  This,

however,  is  a different question and  I  shall  have

occasion  to  expand  on  it  in  this  House  at  the

appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if all of us do our work properly

under   these  Bills,  it  is  conceivable  that   the

provisions we seek to introduce today may work out  to

be  more humane to an accused person than it otherwise

is today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I suppose the hon. Member for Kuo Chuan, who is

well-versed in law, is right in his pronouncement that

under  these Bills things may work out better than  it

is  today. However, may I just have my own reservation

on at least one clause in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the judicial practice now that at a trial

it  is  obligatory for the court to warn itself  about

convicting an accused on the uncorroborated  testimony

of  an  accomplice.  In  this Bill,  if  clause  8  is

accepted,  then  it is obligatory  for  the  court  to

accept  the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.

An  accomplice, to save his own skin,  will  give  all

sorts   of  evidence  in  order  to  convict   others.

Acceptance of this uncorroborated evidence is  a  move

that leaves much to be desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having lost faith in the investigative

capabilities of the police force, we now have to  rely

on the evidence of only collaborators and accomplices.

If I may say so, the Bill wants to take a short-cut to

justice.  There  is no such thing as  a  short-cut  to

justice.  The  way  to justice is always  a  long  and

burdensome  one.  Does  this  mean  "Prosecution  made

Easy"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I do not propose to deal with the arguments here

but to leave them to the Select Committee. But I would

like  to correct a misapprehension held by the  Member

for  Telok Blangah who says that it is obligatory  for

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



court  to  accept the uncorroborated testimony  of  an

accomplice,  and  he quotes clause 8.  Clause  8  says

nothing of that kind. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An accomplice shall be a competent witness against

an  accused  person; and any rule of law  or  practice

whereby  at a trial it is obligatory for the court  to

warn  itself  about  convicting  the  accused  on  the

uncorroborated  testimony of an accomplice  is  hereby

abrogated.'



<br><br>What is abrogated is the requirement of a warning.  It

does  not  make it obligatory for the court to  accept

the  uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. It can,

but it is not obligatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank both Members for their

contribution and hope to see them in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Evidence (Amendment) Bill be committed to

Chairman  and  seven Members to be  nominated  by  the

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 14(1) of the Criminal Law (Temporary

Provisions)  Act  (Chapter  112)  empowers  a   police

officer  not  below  the rank of a  sergeant,  without

warrant, to enter and search any premises, vehicle  or

individual  if  he suspects that any evidence  of  the

commission of an offence is likely to be found on such

premises,  vehicle or individual, and  may  seize  any

evidence so found. It is proposed to amend the proviso

to the section to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



enable a police officer below the rank of sergeant  to

exercise  similar  powers if he has  good  reasons  to

believe  that,  by reason of the delay  which  may  be

caused  by referring the case to his superior officer,

any such evidence is likely to be removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 22 of the Act to

bring it in line with a proposal to amend the Criminal

Procedure Code (Chapter 113), which has just also been

read   the   Second  time,  by  deleting   the   legal

requirement  to give caution to a person under  arrest

before he is interrogated by the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the other two Bills which had their Second

Reading today, Sir, it is also proposed to refer  this

Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in the light of an increasing crime rate, the

intention of this Bill before the House is obviously a

good  one  and  will make the job of the  police  much

easier  in  bringing criminals to book. By  delegating

the  power  of  search,  without  warrant,  to  police

officers below the rank of sergeant as provided  under

clause  2,  it  is  to  my  mind  important  for   the

Government  to ensure that there will be no  abuse  of

such  power and that all junior officers do understand

that  the  power delegated to them will  be  exercised

only   with   very  good  reasons  and   under   fully

justifiable circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in implementing the law it will perhaps be

desirable  for proper guidelines to be laid  down  and

their  practical implications fully explained  to  all

junior officers so that in the course of carrying  out

their  duties  they would not, by their  rash  action,

antagonise members of the public unnecessarily and  so

lose  the confidence and support of the public,  which

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4  of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the

reclamation  by  Government of  approximately  10.93

hectares of the foreshore and seabed at Pulau  Damar

Laut,  Jurong, as shown coloured green on  the  plan

marked  "LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN  NO.  10/75"

which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Pulau Damar Laut, about 15.7 hectares in area

and  shown coloured yellow on the plan marked as "LAND

OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO 10/75", a copy of which  is

displayed  in the Library of this House for the  infor

mation  of  hon. Members, was alienated to the  Jurong

Town  Corporation  in 1962 for the  extension  of  the

Jurong Industrial Estate. The Corporation now proposes

to  reclaim about 10.93 hectares of the foreshore  and

seabed  at this island as shown coloured green on  the

plan for the future extension of the Jurong Port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation, which is the first stage of the

development of the island,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



will be undertaken by the Corporation as agents of the

Government. It is expected to take about 1 1/2 years  to

complete  at  a cost of about $2.5 million.  Fill  for

this  reclamation  will be obtained by  levelling  the

existing hills on the island. The second stage of  the

development  is still under study by the  Corporation.

Under  the second stage, it is envisaged that  further

reclamation  may  be  necessary  and  wharves  may  be

constructed at the periphery of the reclamation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed land

will be proclaimed as State land and will be alienated

to  the  Corporation  on terms and  conditions  to  be

agreed with the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of

the   Foreshores  Act  (Chapter  270),  approves   the

reclamation  by  Government  of  approximately   10.93

hectares  of  the foreshore and seabed at Pulau  Damar
