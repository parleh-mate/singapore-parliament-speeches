  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider introducing legislation to provide for anti-noise measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by the Prime Minister to reply to this question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present there are existing regulations enabling several Ministries and departments to act on certain aspects of noise pollution. For instance, the Registrar of Vehicles can take action against
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the owner of a vehicle which emits excessive noise. The Ministry of Culture limits the noise coming from outdoor performances and from loudspeakers in record shops, and the Ministry of the Environment can require the occupier of a trade and industrial premises which creates excessive noise to abate the noise. Administratively, the Government pursues a policy against noise pollution. Members are probably aware that Radio and Television Singapore, for instance, regularly makes announcements together with slides encouraging the people to tune down the volume of their TV and hi-fi sets. The police also often acts against persons making excessive noise at unreasonable hours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no quick and easy answer to the problem of noise pollution in Singapore. Community noise is a particularly difficult problem due to our high population density and the cultural background of our people. However, it can be minimised by inculcating in our citizens a greater sense of civic consciousness and consideration for others. At the present moment, there are no plans to introduce further legislation to provide for anti-noise measures.

   <b>(Extension of age limit)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he will consider extending the age limit of stevedores to 65 years for the issue of Port of Singapore Authority passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all stevedores, employed either by the PSA or private firms, require a pass from the PSA to work at the wharves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of a stevedore requires heavy physical exertion and quick reflexes. Those who are over 60 years of age are generally slow in their physical responses. This could endanger their own safety and the safety of those who are working with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, the PSA does not propose to extend the age limit of stevedores beyond 60 years, regardless of whether they are employed by the PSA or the private companies.

   <b>SUBSIDY FOR COMMUNITY CENTRES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will increase the subsidy for the building of new community centres in view of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lee Khoon Choy) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government revised its subsidies for the building of new community centres in October 1977. The total revised subsidy of up to $550,000 was more than 3 1/2 times the previous subsidy of $150,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, because of rising building costs, the People's Association has urged a further revision. A decision will soon be made by the Finance Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. If a request for subsidy is not approved, will the Government consider giving a loan to the Building Fund Committee to be repaid in instalments? If a loan can be granted, it will not only help to combat inflation but it will also help certain constituencies to build community centres which are most urgently needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I were a Backbencher I would not pre-empt the decision of the Ministry of Finance. In any case, the suggestion put forward by the Member will be considered.

   <b>AIR POLLUTION IN INDUSTRIAL ESTATES</b>

   <b>(Measures to reduce)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Prime Minister whether the air pollution in industrial estates, such as the Jurong Town, and urban areas has reached the state of affecting the health of the residents of those
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> areas and what steps have been or will be taken to reduce air pollution generally.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, air pollution is being monitored daily by the Anti- Pollution Unit, and we find that the air pollution in industrial estates and the urban areas is normally higher than in the residential or rural areas. However, the pollution level is well within the level set by the World Health Organisation and at present it does not pose a danger to our health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main sources of air pollution are emissions from industrial premises and motor vehicles and there are existing measures to check air pollution. The Anti-Pollution Unit conducts regular tests on the emissions from factories to check for compliance with existing regulations. Some factories are required to instal anti-pollution equipment. The Registry of Vehicles periodically inspects goods and public service vehicles to ensure that their engines do not emit pollutants excessively.

   <b>INCINERATOR AT TOH TUCK ROAD</b>
  </div>

   <b>(Particulars)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for the Environment (a) how long the incinerator at Toh Tuck Road has been in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> operation; (b) how much refuse it is burning per day; (c) how much electricity it is generating; (d) whether there is any excess of electricity generated and how it is utilised; (e) how much refuse is still being dumped at the Tampines disposal ground; and (f) whether and when the Tampines disposal ground will be closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the incinerator at Toh Tuck Road has been functioning since January this year at full capacity, that is, operating three furnaces, and it will be able to burn 1,200 tons of domestic refuse per day. It generates an average of 8.2 megawatts of electricity daily. It uses about 2 megawatts and the surplus of 6.2 megawatts is sold to the Public Utilities Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity of refuse disposed at the Tampines disposal ground has been reduced from an average of 1,300 tons per day to 680 tons per day. The dumping ground will continue to be used because we collect daily an average of 2,400 tons of refuse. Out of the 2,400 tons of refuse, 1,200 tons are burnt. About 680 tons of refuse are now being disposed of at the Tampines ground and the rest at another dumping ground. The refuse will also have to be disposed when the incinerator is shut down for repair or maintenance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to inform the hon. Member that the Tampines disposal ground will therefore not be closed at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the present incinerator at Toh Tuck Road is able to produce 8.2 megawatts of electricity, with an excess of 6.2 megawatts which is sold to the PUB, will the Hon. Minister consider building one or two more incinerators so that the question of having to dispose of refuse at an uneconomic cost at the Tampines dumping ground can be resolved?

  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most economic way of disposing refuse is to dump it at the dumping ground. But that is not our only consideration when we talk about the disposal of refuse. The question is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whether dumping will inconvenience members of the public. We think that further large scale dumping of refuse at Tampines is undesirable. The Government has therefore spent about $90 million to build the incinerator. It is likely that its capacity will be expanded to save the residents of Tampines from further pollution.

   <b>(Flood control measures)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for the Environment (a) whether his Ministry had anticipated the recent floodings at Jalan Eunos in the vicinity of the Pan-Island Expressway flyover, and, if so, why the flood control measures were not effective; (b) what steps are being taken to remedy the flooding problem; how effective those measures will be; and, if they are not effective, whether he will recommend that the families affected by the floodings be resettled immediately; and (c) whether draining flood water into the Siglap Canal will cause overloading of the Canal thereby aggravating the floodings in Pachitan, Changi Road and Frankel Estate; and, if so, whether his Ministry will revise its plans by diverting flood waters elsewhere or into new drainage networks instead of into the Siglap Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the piece of land between Jalan Eunos and the Pan-Island Expressway flyover now under construction is a part of the low-lying area of Geylang Serai, and it is always prone to floods. There are 20 squatter huts there. The residents there do know that this area is very prone to floods and so out of the 20 huts, 10 are on stilts. The Ministry does not run a weather bureau, but it does know that this area is prone to floods. Part of this low-lying area has been filled up to build the Pan-Island Expressway and, as a result, the rest of the area has become more prone to floods.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately we have been experiencing unusually wet weather and this has led to frequent floods in this area. The Ministry is aware of the plight of the residents there and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> has taken remedial measures. Unfortunately, they have not been very effective. Since this is a very low-lying area, flooding cannot be alleviated unless the whole area is filled up. It is not possible to offer resettlement terms to the residents there because the land is privately owned. It does not belong to the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other part of the question, that is, draining the storm water along Jalan Eunos into the Siglap Canal, there is no plan to drain the water from other catchment areas into the Siglap Canal. Therefore, it will not be overloaded and it is unlikely to flood the surrounding area.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Supplementary questions, Sir. Was the Drainage Department notified in advance about the construction of the Pan-Island Expressway flyover? If so, did the Drainage Department indicate specifically what drainage measures should be taken to ensure that flooding would be minimised?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: why is it that the area now suffers from flooding? For example, the area was flooded on the 27th April and 3rd May, 1979, when the rainfall recorded was only 40 mm and 43.6 mm respectively. Yet in January 1978 when the maximum rainfall for that month was 86 mm the area was not flooded. In making this comparison we have to bear in mind that the construction of the Pan-Island Expressway flyover commenced in March 1978 and the major earthworks were somewhat completed in September/October 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been trying hard to follow closely what the Member said. I am no surveyor. However, I think that the collapse of the flyover has made it more difficult for the water to drain away from this low lying area. As a result, even a slight rainfall would have flooded the area. It is only after the completion of the fly-over and the road that permanent measures to relieve the area of flooding can be considered and undertaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, I do not wish to appear persistent on this issue. But I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have received petitions, more than four times over, from the constituents there. The question is: was there prior consultation between the Drainage Department and the PWD, so that the Drainage Department could instruct the PWD of the drainage control measures that should be provided before the earth-works started? I raise this question because I understand that this is part and parcel of the code of practice in the Drainage Department before they approve major projects and give clearance before a project can commence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, normally there is consultation between the departments concerned to try and alleviate any inconvenience that may occur. In this instance, it is not desirable nor possible to undertake all the drainage measures that are required to alleviate this area from flooding before completion of the flyover and the adjacent section of the Pan-Island Expressway. What was done was only a temporary measure. Unfortunately, we have been having unusually wet weather resulting in more flooding than usual.

  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng</b> asked the Minister for the Environment (a) who are the largest single group of energy users in Singapore; (b) is this group responding well to the "Save Electricity Campaign" recently launched by the Public Utilities Board, and (c) are there any other deterrent measures that the Board intends to adopt to discourage this group from further wastage of electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, electricity consumers can be grouped under three headings. They are industrial, domestic, commercial and other users. The industrial users form the largest group. They use 50% of the electricity generated, followed by commercial and other users, 33%, and domestic users, 17%. It is too early, however, to tell whether there has been a significant drop in the consumption of electricity by the industries, as the "Save Electricity Campaign" was launched only in April and it will be some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> time before we can compile the necessary statistics to make a comparative study.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board is not considering any deterrent measures yet. The emphasis now is to advise the consumers on how to conserve energy and to seek their co-operation. There has been some good response. Some factories are responding. They are studying energy conservation measures. However, these measures again will require modifications to the factory infrastructure. Time, therefore, is required for such modifications, and savings in power can only be seen after the modifications have been effected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, electricity consumption can be classified according to usage. Air-conditioning uses 26% of the electricity generated; lighting 11% and others 63%. It is possible to economise electricity consumption for air-conditioning without affecting production and efficiency. The PUB is working together with the Ministries of Finance and National Development to encourage owners to improve the insulation of their buildings. This would reduce the heat load on air-conditioners.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, first of all, drug trafficking and drug addiction are two different offences. Drug trafficking is a criminal offence in the sense that a person is trying to sell drugs to drug addicts; in other words, to make money out of human misery. Drug addiction is another matter. Although it is a crime, it is, of course, of a much lesser degree. In fact, as far as drug addiction is concerned, instead of prosecuting the drug addicts in court, we prefer to send them to drug rehabilitation centres for treatment and rehabilitation. In other words, they would not be convicted of a criminal offence, particularly the first offenders. In fact, from the figures I have mentioned, the vast majority of the drug addicts have been sent to drug rehabilitation centres for treatment and rehabilitation instead of prosecuting them in court for sentence and imprisonment.

Such an offence may also be dealt with under the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Rules and the Road Traffic Act where a fine of up to $1,000 or an imprisonment of up to three months can be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police and the Registry of Vehicles will ask the School Bus Owners' Association to cooperate by reminding school bus drivers not to misuse the horn as this will cause noise nuisance, particularly in the early morning hours in housing estates. Action will be taken against those who persist in this inconsiderate act.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings out the point that I was trying to make earlier on to the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan who asked about the flooding at the junction of Jalan Eunos and the Pan-Island Expressway. Here is a case where it is unwise to spend money on something temporary. It is only after completing the deepening and widening of Sungei Kallang that we should begin to widen and deepen the six canals which drain water from Ang Mo Kio through the Kampong along Lorong Kinchir to Sungei Kallang.

  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the difficulty of the majority of wage-earners to pay their income tax due to the rising cost of living and if he will consider raising the present rate of income tax relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, so soon after the Budget session, when the same question of tax relief was asked and debated, the Member for Thomson surely cannot expect any answer than that the present rate of income tax relief will not be increased.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the first part of his question is concerned, the answer is that I am not aware that there has been much more difficulty in paying income tax recently because of the rising cost of living. The new Consumer Price Index shows that from the base of 100 for the period June 1977 to May 1978, there has been only a 3% rise in prices. The majority of taxpayers have surely had a greater increase than this in their earnings in the comparable period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the cost of living is not a major consideration in deciding our tax relief policy. An objective of taxation policy is to increase our tax base, to spread the load of taxation over as many people as possible, so
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that the cost of public services, including social and security services, will be more evenly borne.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, 90% of the workforce in the US are taxpayers, in Australia, 95%, in Japan, 60%. In Singapore only 30% pay tax. Any increase in the income tax relief will have the effect, therefore, of reducing further the number of taxpayers.

  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for Finance what are the plans to enlarge our tax-base to include those people who are self-employed and should be paying taxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the answer to this is related to the last one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax evasion by the self-employed is a universal problem which challenges the ingenuity of all tax administrators. My Ministry has examined the statistics more closely and estimated the magnitude of this problem in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Labour Force Survey of 1977, there were 903,900 persons in our labour force. Of these, 132,602 persons or 14% of the labour force were self-employed. 77,200 of them appear to have incomes in the taxable brackets. Allowing for 25% under-disclosure, probably 97,000 or more were earning incomes that would put them in the tax-paying bracket. However, Income Tax records show only 42,900 of our taxpayers as self-employed. This means that at least 54,100 or 56% of the self-employed persons who have taxable incomes are not paying tax. By comparison with persons in the labour force who are employees and taxable, out of 247,800 such persons, only 1,000 or 0.4%, escaped the tax net. Therefore, the self-employed persons have not, as a class, been shouldering their fair share of the tax burden. My Ministry plans to bring these people into the tax net.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several measures have been taken to check tax evasion by the self-employed. Firstly, the Anti-Evasion Unit in the Inland
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Revenue Department has been paying increasing attention to the problem and stepped up its efforts particularly against evasion by self-employed persons. Secondly, income tax assessment forms were sent to identifiable self-employed persons, such as hawkers and taxi drivers. Thirdly, an exercise matching car-owners with taxpayers was carried out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the three measures taken, 18,425 new taxpayers have been netted up to 30th April, 1979. The next step will be to ensure a proper assessment of their incomes so that they will be paying their fair share of the tax. This is a bigger problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three measures have been directed mainly at tax evasion by the more easily identifiable self-employed persons. However, a large number of self-employed persons need not be registered or licensed to carry out their trade or business. These will cause greater difficulty, but my Ministry will also study measures against tax evasion by them.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we hope to be able to make a decision after the Phase III study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if the Ministry cannot take any definite decision after three phases of study have been completed, has the Minister not taken into consideration the question of rising costs? In other words, if a firm decision cannot be taken, then I do not foresee any decision to be taken at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, for the information of the Member, the Government is very much aware of the effects of rising costs. We ourselves would like to have a decision made as early as possible, but the project cost is of such a magnitude that we have to make a careful study before a decision can be made. As I have mentioned earlier, I sincerely hope that a decision will be made soon after the Phase III study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I would like to know from the Minister how much money will go to waste in the end, if this MRT project cannot materialise?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> If the Member considers the money spent in carrying out these studies as a waste, then perhaps I should give him some indication as to how much the studies will cost us. The Phase I and Phase II studies have cost us $4 1/2 million. The Phase III study will probably cost us another $3 1/2 to $4 million. So if the decision eventually is not to proceed with the MRT system, then the money wasted would be about $8 to $9 million.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is being looked into.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study group, comprising officers from the Public Works Department, Traffic Police, Registry of Vehicles and SBS, is now examining the feasibility of giving priority to buses leaving bus bays.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, is the Minister not aware that such a scheme, if implemented, would cause hazards to other road users?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> On the contrary, Sir, it will not. The present practice of motorists not giving way to buses leaving the bus bays has caused much inconvenience and congestion to impede traffic flow; thus bus drivers are reluctant to pull in to the bus bays. As we know, when a bus pulls in to a bus bay, it will have great difficulty in getting out of the bus bay because motorists along the carriageway are reluctant to give way to buses pulling out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this scheme is to encourage bus drivers to pull their buses in to the bus bay when loading and unloading passengers in order to free the carriageway for other traffic to flow. I am not suggesting at this stage that we have decided on it. A number of traffic studies are being carried out to determine what the effects will be and until the result of the studies is known, we will not implement the scheme. We will have to wait until the outcome of the studies.

  <b>Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture if he will request the Singapore Bus Service Ltd (i) to consider re-routing SBS feeder service No. 222 from the Bedok Interchange to cover Bedok South Avenue 1, as there are no feeder services to

  <br> the Bedok Interchange from Bedok South; (ii) to provide a special service from the Bedok Interchange to East Coast Road via Bedok Avenue 1 so as to make up for services No. 152 and No. 3 which were removed from Bedok South Road on 11th March, 1979, under Stage III of the New Bus Plan for Bedok; and (iii) to increase the number of buses for service No. 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes. Some of the buses for Service No. 222 will be re-routed to cover Bedok South Avenue 1.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hon. Member's second part of the question, SBS has provided a service, i.e. Service No. 32, from the Bedok Interchange to East Coast Road recently. This service, which terminated at the Chai Chee terminal previously, was extended to the Interchange on 7th May, 1979. Residents along Bedok Avenue 1, like those living in other parts of Bedok Town, can enjoy this service by taking a feeder service to the Interchange.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third part of his question, since Stage III of the New Bus Plan for Bedok was introduced on 8th April, 1979, SBS has put in three more buses for Service No. 12 during peak hours. SBS will continue to add more buses according to demand.

  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he will state the reasons why the Building Control Division would not approve the change of use of the first floor of postwar buildings into offices for some clans and associations, and whether he is aware that this rigid attitude is jeopardising the development of the cultural activities of those civic organisations which the Ministry of Culture is at the moment vigorously promoting.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, applications for change of use are evaluated according to the Master Plan Zoning, prevailing ground conditions and the effect on traffic and the amenity of the neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities with loud musical content, like lion dance practices, disturb neighbouring residents. Another complaint is about the use
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of residents' car parks by members and visitors of an association. For these reasons, associations which adversely affect the peace and quiet of the neighbourhood cannot be permitted in residential buildings, whether on the ground or on other floors. In areas where privacy and quiet is not an important consideration, associations may be allowed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of the importance of cultural organisations and where these are affected by resettlement, alternative accommodation have been offered. So far, 20 associations affected by clearance schemes have accepted alternative accommodation in HDB complexes. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has reserved 12 units in its Murray Street Rehabilitation Block specially for association use. There are still two vacant units in the Block.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, when the Minister receives complaints from neighbours that their sweet dreams have been disturbed by the sound of music from such clans and associations, has he tried to help by calling them to reduce the volume so that the complainants could continue to enjoy their sweet dreams? Also, is the Minister aware that the cultural activities of the civic organisations could in this way be fostered and further developed? Or does the Minister just assume a bureaucratic attitude and orders all those cultural organisations to get out?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the complaint is not so much that the sweet dreams of residents have been disturbed by the music practice in the early morning hours. The music practice is usually held in the evenings, and the residents have complained that it disturbs their children who are studying and that it disturbs them when they are watching television. That is the complaint that we have received. It is not so much that the music practice in the morning has disturbed them and so they have to get up early.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ciations to reduce their noise level on the one hand and, on the other hand, also tried to give them other alternatives so that these cultural organisations can be allowed to continue with their activities? Has the officer ever tried to help them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the solution is not to send an inspector to monitor the level of noise generated by these cultural organisations during their music practice sessions. The solution would be to give them appropriate accommodation so that these cultural associations can continue with their music practice without disturbing the residents. In certain practices, the noise level has to be loud. If you ask them to tune it down, they will find that it is very difficult to practise their music. So the solution is to provide alternative accommodation rather than trying to ask the residents to allow these associations to carry on with their music practice with lower level of noise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this kind of a complaint will continue to be received, but it would be very difficult to station an inspector there to keep on asking the association to tune down the volume of their music practice. I do not think that is a practical thing to do. A better solution would be to provide suitable alternative accommodation for these cultural organisations. This is what the HDB and URA are doing. Perhaps I would ask the Planning Department to look further into this. For example, in certain areas, like Geylang, where these associations prefer to go, certain blocks of flats could be set aside for them. We may allow these clans and associations to occupy the whole block of flats so that they will not disturb the residential neighbourhoods.

  <br>

  <br>
  <br> provide an outline of the blueprint and state when it will be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is doing some preliminary research into the institutional framework and the measures needed to stimulate technological development in Singapore. We hope to develop the ideas further into a plan for implementation next year. Nevertheless, I would like to share with the House some tentative thoughts on how we can stimulate technological development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the fastest way is to encourage technological transfer from abroad. We must therefore continue to promote foreign investment, especially in higher technology products. These products include machine tools, industrial machinery, optical instruments and other precision engineering products, aircraft and automobile components, industrial electronics and computer-related products, petrochemicals and fine chemicals. Secondly, existing industries must be encouraged to automate and upgrade their operations to increase their technological content. Thirdly, we must continue to expand and upgrade our industrial training facilities as manpower development is an integral part of technological development. Fourthly, local industries must also upgrade their technology. The Economic Development Board can help by assisting them to form joint ventures with foreign partners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the thrust for our industrialisation in the 1980's will still be largely dependent on technology transfer from abroad, we must consider how to promote engineering research and development (R &amp; D) work by industries and institutions in Singapore. A modest start has been made with the Product Development Assistance Scheme. Companies are also allowed to deduct R &amp; D expenses for income tax purposes. In addition, we are now examining a proposal for Government to set up a proper institutional framework, such as a high level national body, to spearhead and coordinate our drive on R &amp; D. This body will examine our R &amp; D
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> manpower development, identify R &amp; D needs and capabilities and coordinate our R &amp; D efforts both in the public and private sectors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some broad steps that we can take to stimulate technological development in Singapore. I would welcome other suggestions from the hon. Member.

   <b>THE SINGAPORE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Trade and Industry)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by the Prime Minister to deliver a Statement on the Singapore Administrative Service on his behalf.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of a nation depends on the quality of its people and government. Good government requires political and administrative leadership of indisputable integrity, ability and dedication.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector needs a fair share of the best brains to tackle the complex economic and social problems Singapore will face in the next two decades. The thrust of our economy will continue to depend on the entrepreneurial vigour and business acumen of our private sector but its management will require sophisticated skills and administra-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tive excellence in the public sector. Singapore's rapid development in the last two decades has opened up career opportunities hitherto unavailable for persons with talent outside the public service. The Singapore Administrative Service, as the premier service in the public sector, must therefore be attractive enough for it to recruit and retain a fair proportion of the cream of our graduates. The terms and conditions of the Administrative Service must match the best in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has compared the incomes of graduates in the public and private sectors. This was done by constructing a comprehensive income profile of the graduate population in Singapore from a number of authoritative sources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the income comparison between graduates in the public and private sectors suggest that while the average officer in the Administrative Service earns as much as the average officer in the private sector, the remuneration of the outstanding Administrative Officer is much less than that of the top 5% of the salaried graduates in the private sector. The starting remuneration in the Administrative Service is generally more attractive than in the private sector but the outstanding executive in the private sector soon outstrips his peer in the Administrative Service. Although those who reach the top echelon of the private sector earn far more than the top Administrative Officers, the skills, drive and dedication required of both in the respective sector are comparable. This disparity in rewards puts the highflyers in the Administrative Service at a disadvantage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this study of incomes of graduates in the private sector and the public sector, the Government has concluded that the immediate problem is not one of inadequate financial rewards for the average Administrative Officer. It is the problem of gross disparity between what the outstanding graduates are earning in the private sector
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> compared to what the highflyers are earning in the Administrative Service. This revision to the salary structure of the Administrative Service is to put right this gap in earnings of top graduates. For the present, a general salary revision is not necessary. Whether a revision will become necessary in 2 - 3 years' time depends on the growth of private sector incomes for the average graduates compared to those in the public sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outstanding officers in the Administrative Service can best be rewarded through (a) the creation of additional Time-scale, Superscale and Staff Grades, and (b) frequent promotions within the revised salary structure to enable the outstanding officers to maintain parity with their peers in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>New Salary Grades</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, therefore, decided to create the following grades in its Administrative Service: -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Three Staff Grades I, II and III above Superscale A;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Two Superscale Grades D1 and C1; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A Senior Administrative Assistant grade between Administrative Assistant and Assistant Secretary grades.
  <br>
  <br>I would now like to table the revised salary structure for the Singapore Administrative Service. [Annex A (Cols. 375 - 376) handed in to the Clerk and distributed to hon. Members] Mr Speaker, Sir, from the table you will notice that, henceforth, only Superscale Grade C and above will be known as Permanent Secretary grades. The salaries for the various Staff Grades, Superscale Grades D1 and C1, are all indicated in the table which has just been circulated to Members.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1979/19790515/19790515-HA-0390375.htm">Annex A (Cols. 375 - 376)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three new Superscale Staff Grades will demonstrate beyond doubt that the most outstanding civil servants can aspire to levels of remuneration approximating those of the chief executives of large private enterprises. These Staff Grades will act as an incentive to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> serving officers and as an attraction to the bright young graduates commencing or contemplating a career in the civil service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Staff Grades I, II and III will be brought into operation in stages in three promotion exercises, once every 15 to 24 months. They will be filled only if there are deserving officers. Thus, at the earliest, Staff Grade III will be filled only in 3 3/4 to 6 years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Accelerated Promotion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Senior Administrative Assistant grade will enable the Public Service Commission (PSC) to accord promotion to promising officers in the Timescale grades more quickly. Outstanding Administrative Assistants, particularly those who have completed full time National Service, can expect to be promoted to this grade within their first few years of service. These are the officers who are more likely to leave the service if they feel they are not making sufficiently quick progress in their career. Promotion at shorter time-intervals confers recognition and a sense of forward movement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the two Superscale Grades D1 and C1, together with the existing Super-scale Grade B1, will give the PSC flexibility in promoting meritorious and dedicated officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the attractiveness of the Administrative Service, in future officers in the Timescale and Superscale Grades E and below can be recommended for annual promotion. The ablest may be allowed to jump grades. Promotion will not depend on vacancies but on merit alone. Officers will not be forgotten even if posted to what are generally regarded as mundane jobs. Talent will be spread over all Ministries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ability recognised through frequent promotions, it should be possible for an outstanding officer to advance rapidly from cadetship to the grade of Permanent Secretary, Superscale C, in 12 to 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Future Salary Review</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries in the Administrative Service will be reviewed periodically in the light of per-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> formance of the economy and comparable opportunities and remuneration levels in the private sector. Adjustments, apart from those through annual National Wages Council (NWC) increases, will be made if the rewards for the best in the public sector get out of line with those enjoyed by outstanding executives in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next review will be made in 2 1/2 - 3 years' time. It will be preceded by a thorough study of rewards in the public and private sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Professional Services</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Ministerial Committee headed by the Minister for Trade and Industry has been set up to look into the terms and conditions of the Professional and Other Services, It will submit its recommendations to the Cabinet within three months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must add that whatever changes there are to the Professional or Other Services, the pre-eminence of the Administrative Service will be the cornerstone of all services. This is our premier service. Top administrators help Ministers to formulate and to decide on national policies. These policies affect all sectors of society. Therefore, we must have our best and balanced minds as top administrators.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one smaller group of officers is more important. They are the SAF scholar officers. They will have career prospects as good as, and rates of promotion faster than, top administrators. The reason is compelling. In an emergency, they are responsible for the lives of more than 70% of our young men in the active and reserve service. In ordinary times, they help decide how we spend 5% of our GDP or about 16% of our Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we recognised this and insisted on high calibre administrators and SAF scholar officers 20, or even 10, years ago, Singapore would have been better off today. It is better that we put this right forthwith than leave our spread of talent to chance. We would then end up with talent in the wrong places, ill-adjusted and ill-suited to the needs of our future.

  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, since such a move will benefit only a small group, namely, the ablest or, as the Hon. Minister has just mentioned, the highflyers at the top echelon in the Singapore Administrative Service, would the implementation of this new policy not discourage or bring about dissatisfaction or even frustration to the average Administrative Officers and lesser peers in the Administrative Service?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. If Government's recognition of the service of its officers is based on merit or performance, why is the annual increment of an Honours degree graduate twice as much as that of the general degree graduate?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the average Administrative Officer needs feel frustrated by the revision to the salary structure. As a comparison of the incomes of graduates between the public sector and the private sector shows, the incomes of the average Administrative Officers in the public sector are comparable to what their peers are earning outside. The existing salary range of the Singapore Administrative Service allows sufficient flexibility for the average officer to move at a rate which is commensurate with the rate of progress of his counterpart in the private sector. I do not think that in our effort to attract the best into the Administrative Service, the average Administrative Officer needs to feel frustrated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the disparity in annual increments between the Honours graduate and the general degree graduate is because generally one would expect an Honours graduate, given the better formal qualification which is a reflection of his talent and ability, to contribute more than the general degree graduate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Does the Minister mean to say that the merit or performance does not matter?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Merit or performance matters a lot, Mr Speaker, Sir. But
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the officers would move upwards within their own salary scales or the Service in which they are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, whilst I agree that we have to introduce such a policy to retain the ablest and the best within the Administrative Service, we must also not forget that the Executive Officers as well as those in the Clerical Service also play an important role in the civil service. In that respect, Sir, would the Hon. Minister consider looking into the statement I have posed?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, the head and the legs must function together, and I take the point that the Executive Service and the Clerical Service are important to the proper functioning of the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is whether the salary scales of the Executive Service and the Clerical Service are such that we are not able to attract suitable officers to serve in these two particular services. I understand that up to now there is no great difficulty in recruiting the necessary personnel for these two services. Therefore, it would seem to suggest that at this particular moment there is no need for us to look into these two services with a view to a general revision of their salary scales. There is no compelling reason why we need to do so at this stage anyway.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we can agree in general with the observations made by the Senior Minister of State -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Minister for Trade and Industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I am sorry. It is a slip of the tongue, Sir, but it is easily explained. Sir, we seem to be in the habit of demoting people by creating new grades. So even if I had demoted the Hon. Minister for a moment, it may come in the future if there is a super Ministerial post being created.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody in the civil service has been demoted because of the additional grades created at the top. Those who thought they were already at the top of the ladder now are three rungs below the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention this, Sir, because at the University people are reacting this way. The Professors who are already at the top now find another rank above them, super Professor or Senior Professor. There is no guarantee that in the years to come there might even be higher ranks of civil servants or Professors.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not detect a question in the comment made by the hon. Member. Nevertheless, I would give a reply. For the University, I do not know whether the Member would prefer that there is no creation of new posts. I thought the creation of new posts above the existing highest grade is to allow them a further opportunity to move upwards. I am surprised if the University Professors do not appreciate that this is to allow the ablest of the Professors to move upwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, what you get as a result is a demotion in terms of status. Money is one thing but status is another. If you just measure everything by the amount of money you get, then I think we are a very sorry kind of society indeed.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical students who commenced their course in 1978 signed a bond before enrolment to serve the Government for five years. Those who had commenced their course before 1978 were given the option in 1978 of signing either a bond or an undertaking to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> serve the Government for periods ranging from one to four years. The majority signed the undertaking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student agrees in the undertaking to serve the Government diligently during his housemanship and for a prescribed period after full registration under the Medical Registration Act. He also agrees to cease the practice of medicine and surgery if he fails to fulfil his obligation to serve the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the effective enforcement of the undertaking, the Medical Council should have the power to remove from the register the name of any person who defaults his undertaking. The Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide the Medical Council with such power. A similar Bill will be introduced soon to cover the Dental students.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Registration of Deeds Rules which was first promulgated in 1934 and last amended in 1968 needs revision. Hence, the present Registration of Deeds Rules of this year which has been presented to Parliament for approval pursuant to statute. In the revision, opportunity has been taken to adjust the fees payable in respect of two items, items 5 and 9, shown in the First Schedule to the Rules. The fee under item 5 has been revised from $3 to $5 and that under item 9 from $2 to $5. These are considered fair as the existing fees are low and not commensurate with the work involved.

  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade> *The motion reads as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and sea-bed at Sentosa containing a total area of about 30 hectares as shown coloured yellow on the plan marked "RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/79" which is deposited in the land Office, Singapore.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the major recreational facility on Sentosa is the 18-hole golf course. This golf course has reached its optimum playing capacity because of the large number of tourists playing on it. The opening of a first-class resort hotel on the island in July, 1978, and the possible development of more hotels
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> on the island in the near future necessitate the addition of another 18-hole golf course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) therefore proposes to reclaim the foreshore and sea-bed east of the current reclamation at Kuchin Creek Estuary, which was approved by this House at its sitting on the 31st of January, 1978. The reclamation is shown coloured yellow on the plan marked "RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/79". A copy of this plan, which I have just handed to you, Sir, is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority, as agents of the Corporation, will undertake the reclamation works which are expected to be completed in about 15 months' time and cost about $9.4 million. The fill for the reclamation will be obtained from Beting Kapal, Sisters' Shoal and Mount Serapong.
