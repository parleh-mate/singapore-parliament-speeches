<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether he will consider setting up a Commission of

Inquiry into the trade union movement with specific

reference  to  infiltration  thereof  by  political

parties, whether registered or unregistered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I will certainly consider setting  up

a  Commission of Inquiry. I think most Members will

agree  that  the  Member for Thomson  rendered  the

country a great service by accidentally proposing a

Commission  of  Inquiry  for  the  Chinese  Schools

Examination   Boycott,  as  a   result   of   which

Communists ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Member for Anson and not the

Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Anson - I beg

your pardon. The Member for Anson is still standing

on the same side of the line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of that Commission of Inquiry, a

certain  number of Communists and Communist  united

front



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



operators working in the guise of educationists and

protectors of culture and language were exposed and

discomfited.  I  agree  with  the  Member  that   a

similarly useful role can be played by a Commission

of  Inquiry  in respect of Communist activities  in

the trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, at the moment, another Commission

pending  at  the request of the Singapore  National

Union  of  Journalists. It is to inquire  into  the

improper  manner  in  which the Singapore  National

Union  of  Journalists  was  exploited  by  certain

Communist  united  front  operators  and  into  the

manner  in  which  their  funds  were  misused  for

Communist front ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the general investigation can be joined

with  this  specific investigation which  has  been

asked  for.  The question is to find  when  a  High

Court  Judge  will be free to undertake  what  will

undoubtedly become a long, protracted and sometimes

perhaps  acrimonious proceedings. The  Member  will

remember  that the former Chief Justice retired  in

January  this  year and we are at  the  moment  one

Puisne Judge short. However, the Chief Justice  has

assured  me that he will make a Judge available  as

soon as the Court's list makes it possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> A supplementary

question, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Prime Minister,  in

indicating that he accepts the suggestion  for  the

appointment of this Commission, left it limited  to

the question of Communist subversion. I ask whether

the  Prime Minister did that by accident or whether

it  is  intended in the spirit of the  question  to

appoint  a Commission to inquire into all political

activities and all political infiltration of  trade

unions,  whether  registered political  Parties  or

not - the "not", of course, being the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

distinction  between Communist operators  and  non-Communist  infiltrators  does  not  lie  in   their

belonging   to  a  registered  or  an  unregistered

society. Many of the Communist operators belong  to

a  registered  society, and one  of  the  political

Parties is adequately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



represented in this Chamber. That is in the  nature

of  things  in Singapore. I take it that the  point

the Member for Anson wanted to make was - have I,  in

framing  this  reply, taken into consideration  his

other point, to investigate the activities of  non-Communist  political leaders in the  trade  unions.

But   hypothesi,   if   they  are   non-Communists,

therefore it cannot he for subversive ends.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question is

"setting  up a Commission of Inquiry with  specific

reference to infiltration", and the aim is to  free

the  working-class movement from  its  thraldom  to

political Parties. That would be the aim of such  a

Commission. My enquiry is: does the Prime  Minister

accept  the position that the trade union  movement

should be free from slavery to any political Party,

and  that  a  Commission would  help  immensely  in

clarifying the position and in probably paving  the

way for legislation for their protection?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that opens

up  an  entirely  new aspect  of  the  case.  As  I

understand it, the Member for Anson is now thinking

in  terms  of  legislation to free the trade  union

movement  from thraldom - is it thraldom? I have  not

got  the  Oxford  Dictionary with me  here,  but  I

assume,  by  that, that the Member for Anson  means

that  one is held enthralled by the other. If  that

is   so  and  if  the  purpose  is  then  to   make

recommendations for legislation so  that  no  trade

union  can  either subscribe to, belong to  or  pay

subscriptions  to  a political Party,  I  am  quite

happy  to consider that. But infiltration  by  non-Communists  into  trade  unions  and  trade   union

committees    is   just   like   some   businessmen

infiltrating    into   direct   directorships    of

companies. It goes on regularly. The same man,  for

instance, turns up in 20 different companies-Fraser

& Neave, Malayan Breweries, Red Lion, etc. By sheer

persistence  and great skill in the  management  of

committees, the same person appears over  and  over

again  in the directorship lists of many companies,

thereby   no  doubt  invoking  a  great   deal   of

confidence amongst the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



public   and   the   consumers   of   the   various

commodities.  So  too  with  trade  unionists.  One

becomes an adviser, a general affairs officer,  and

so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the objection to these persons is not that

they work in trade unions but that they should work

for  the  purposes of the Communist Party in  trade

unions.  [Interruption] No, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  Any

other  political beliefs by all means. I sympathise

with  the  Member for Anson. Twice he has lost  his

Party  whilst  he is still in this Chamber.  I  can

quite  sympathise with his point of view  that  one

should  not work for any political Party at all.  I

think  there is reason and logic behind that  point

of  view  after one has had the bitter  experiences

that  he  has  had. Twice the painful  business  of

bringing  a political Party to fruition; both  came

into  life;  one assumed power and one looked  like

coming to power and ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister is

now wandering and inciting a debate. I do not think

we  should allow that at Question Time. Perhaps  he

will cut his answer short.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see no

harm  whatsoever  in  Members opposite  working  in

trade  unions  provided they are not doing  it  for

Communist  ends.  I see no reason  at  all  why  no

Members on this side of the House should not  slave

for trade unions if they feel so inclined.

objections  to  any  monetary  contributions   from

Singapore  residents to assist the victims  of  the

<div align="center"><b>DISTORTION OF COURT PROCEEDINGS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Law whether he will consider introducing

legislation to amend the Courts Ordinance to enable

District  Judges to commit persons  to  prison  for

contempt  during  proceedings, as well  as  persons

guilty of malicious distortion of court proceedings

through  radio, rediffusion, television  and  press

reporting.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the

Criminal  Procedure  Code, the  subordinate  Courts

have  certain powers on acts of contempt  committed

in  the presence of the Court. These powers are not

as  wide  as those enjoyed by the High Court.  This

follows  precedents  in the  United  Kingdom  where

subordinate  Courts  do  not  enjoy  the  extensive

powers of the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the High Court which has general

superintendence  over the proceedings  of  inferior

Courts  not  only  to prevent them  from  exceeding

their jurisdiction or otherwise acting contrary  to

the   law,   but  also  to  prevent  persons   from

interfering  with  the course of  justice  in  such

Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Superior Court to punish for

contempt  has  been under critical  examination  in

England, and it was considered that such wide power

should not be given to the subordinate Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with the Member for Anson that

our circumstances are different and I would welcome

concrete proposals from members of the Bar and  the

Bar Committee itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons guilty of malicious distortion of court

proceedings through radio, rediffusion,  television

and  press  reporting can be dealt with  adequately

under  the  present  laws for  contempt  under  the

existing provisions of the law.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICABILITY OF PRINCIPLE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF "OMBUDSMAN" TO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Law whether he would consider the report

of   Sir  John  Whyatt  on  "The  Citizen  and  the

Administration"   and   the   legislation   arising

therefrom  in  New Zealand in the  context  of  the

possibility  of the applicability of the  principle

of "Ombudsman" to Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the report of Sir

John Whyatt on "The Citizen and the Administration"

and   the  legislation  arising  therefrom  in  New

Zealand  have  been carefully considered,  but  the

view  of the Government is that it is premature  to

apply the principle of "Ombudsman" in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already in existence in Singapore

departments  that  cover  to  a  great  extent  the

powers, sphere of operations, rights and duties  of

an  Ombudsman. The Central Complaints Bureau can be

referred to in any case where the citizen complains

of   maladministration  or  delays  in  the  public

service. The Bureau has already helped to create  a

better understanding and appreciation of the duties

of  the  civil service in serving the needs of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Disciplinary Proceedings Regulations have been

framed  so  that Civil Service Disciplinary  Boards

comprise  not only civil servants but also  members

of the public. This will ensure that all matters of

discipline  will be enquired into  and  dealt  with

without prejudice and with due regard to the public

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau works

independently  of the police and is responsible  to

the   Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and  the  State

Advocate-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some practical difficulties in the

institution  of  Ombudsman  which  have  not   been

completely solved even in Denmark where it has been

in  existence  for about six years.  One  of  these

difficulties is the right of the Ombudsman to  look

into  secret  files of Ministers as well  as  State

departments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



While   the  Whyatt  Report  recommends  that   the

Parliamentary Commissioner should have security  of

tenure  in  the same way as the Auditor General  in

Great Britain, in New Zealand he holds office  only

for  the duration of Parliament. In the context  of

British  parliamentary government and the principle

of  ministerial responsibility, it is difficult  to

demarcate   the  extent  of  the  powers   of   the

Ombudsman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whyatt Report has been criticised in Great

Britain  and its recommendations have not yet  been

adopted by the British Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position will, however, be kept under review.

Last year, a legal officer made a special study  of

the   system   of  Ombudsman  in  the  Scandinavian

countries.  While the Government feels that  it  is

better  to allow existing institutions in Singapore

to  develop  both by experience and  activities,  a

close  study  will  continue  to  be  made  of  the

experiments in other countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to

islands who have to attend schools in Singapore. In

the  case  of  Pulau Brani and Pulau Blakang  Mati,

there  are  in  existence 3 primary  schools  which

cater  for nearly 750 pupils. The problems of daily

transport  across the seas affect about 120  pupils

only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st February, 1963, a petition was received

Kampong Pulau Blakang Mati.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has endeavoured to solve the problem

by  seeking  the co-operation of the War Department

by   adjusting  the  time-tables  of  their   ferry

services.  Likewise, the assistance of  the  Master

Attendant's Department and even that of the Straits

Trading   Company   were   sought.   However,   the

commitments  of  these bodies  have  limited  their

ability  to provide all the transport required  for

pupils   and   at  times  convenient  for   pupils.

Therefore,  the Ministry can Only do  its  best  to

alleviate  the  situation  by  resorting   to   the

following measures:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Increasing the awards for Island

bursaries valued at $600 per annum from 14 in  1961

to 21 in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Initiating a new scheme of transport

bursaries  for  Island pupils  attending  secondary

schools  in  Singapore valued at  $360  per  annum.

Circulars  to this effect were issued to principals

on  15th  March, 1963, and applications  are  being

processed. The vote approved by Treasury  for  1963

is $49,800.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To build more rural type schools on

islands  if  and  when demands and availability  of

site justify such building. As in the case of Pulau

Blakang Mati, which will be answered separately  as

a result of another question raised hereafter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising on Tuesday, the 9th April,

1963,  this Assembly do stand adjourned to the  7th

of June, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister already explained to the House on Friday why this Assembly cannot sit on the 10th and 11th of this week. At some later stage this afternoon I will sound the mood of this House as to whether it is desirable or not to continue today's sitting to midnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

another  shameful episode of the abuse of power  by

the  Government. We have already had a  holiday  of

eight months ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have not recovered yet!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- since the middle of July

and,   but   for  a  few-hour  affair   after   the

referendum,  we have had no occasion whatsoever  to

debate matters of national importance. And now just

when the Government has been forced by pressure  of

public   opinion   to  reconvene  the   Legislative

Assembly, they now decide again to postpone the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



sitting for another two months. What does it  mean?

It  means that in one whole year, Sir, we will have

hardly  a  couple  of sittings of  the  Legislative

Assembly.  Is  this  the way the  P.A.P. wants  to

practise parliamentary democracy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister says that the Prime Minister has already given reasons. Yes, we have heard the reasons, Sir. He said he had to attend certain meetings. But they are no good reasons. If the Prime Minister has to go and conduct meetings with some person or other, does it mean that we in

the  Legislative Assembly cannot sit?  Or  does  it

mean  that should the Prime Minister go on  a  tour

somewhere,  all government business must  stop?  Is

that  the reasoning which the Deputy Prime Minister

wants to put forward?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, this is already a holiday of

eight  months  and  it  is  time  that  we  in  the

Legislative  Assembly be given  an  opportunity  to

discuss matters which have direct concern with each

and  everyone of us in Singapore, and even  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya and the Borneo  territories.

The  Prime Minister gave an assurance only two days

ago  that,  if  necessary, he would  reconvene  the

Legislative Assembly after the Easter holidays. Why

has  the  Government broken its promise so quickly?

If  it  is  so absolutely necessary for  the  Prime

Minister to be present at the debate, why cannot we

reconvene  immediately  he  comes  back  from   the

Federation? Why are they all so afraid?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the newspapers can, to a certain

extent,   be   considered  a  department   of   the

propaganda  bureau  of  the P.A.P.  Everytime  some

branch  or  other of the P.A.P. makes any  move  to

have a meeting, news of this straightaway is in the

newspapers. If other organisations hand in  scripts

to the newspapers ready for print, somehow or other

they  never  see the light of day. When  the  Prime

Minister  pays  a  visit to the constituencies,  at

least two full pages in the Chinese newspapers  are

devoted  to what the Prime Minister said  here  and

what   he   said  there.  Beautiful  pictures   are

taken - all  staged, in order to give the  impression

that there are people who want to welcome the Prime

Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



No, Sir. Let the P.A.P. Government give us a decent

chance   to   have  our  say  in  this  Legislative

Assembly.  We are having debates after a  lapse  of

eight months on very important issues. We have  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, and normally, Sir,

the  speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  will  be

debated  for five days, six days, one  week  or  10

days.  Yet  the Government wants everything  to  be

over in less than two days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, there are, as we can see on the

Order  Paper, very important motions which we  have

tabled  and which the Prime Minister has  tried  to

anticipate.  We  do not mind that. We  will  debate

them  later. But let not the Government try to  cut

us  all short with no chance even to say our bit in

the   Legislative  Assembly.  The  matter  of   the

arrests,  the matter of the treatment of  detainees

are  very important matters, Sir. In fact, they are

the  concern  of not only Singapore, but  also  the

Federation,  South-East Asia and the  whole  world.

The  very  people  who  backed  the  Lee  Kuan  Yew

Government are today condemning them for what  they

have done in Singapore. Of course, the Lee Kuan Yew

Government would not like all these exposures to be

brought  forward. They do not like us  to  say  our

bit.  They  are  so afraid of the Barisan  Sosialis

that they do not want to allow us a chance even  to

have a say in the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All your ghost writers have

disappeared!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In which case, Sir, why should

the  Prime Minister be scared? Yes, let us  have  a

debate and see what happens.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> What

happens to the ghost writers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, Sir, this idea of

cutting  short  the  debate to two  days  and  then

postponing it to June is to deny us the opportunity

of  saying  our bit. As I have already  said,  Sir,

there  is already enough restriction of freedom  of

expression and publication in Singapore.  We  as  a

Party  have not been banned; neither have our Party

organs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



been banned. But attempts have already been made to

ban  our  organs  indirectly  through  threats  and

intimidation of the printers. The printers  of  our

publications  - the Plebeian, the  Barisan  and  the

Raakyat - were  intimidated by  the  Special  Branch.

They  were  told  that  they  must  not  print  our

publications. They had their licence suspended  for

10  days. They have been given back their printing-press  licence, but they somehow or  other  do  not

print  our  publications any more. Even today,  the

composing  and setting of the printing has  been - the printers have been -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the trouble. No

script.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - intimidated from even composing

and setting our scripts for printing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is hardly any chance for us to have our

publications  for  the  people  to  read  and   for

distribution. The newspapers somehow or other  come

under great pressure not to print our publications.

It  looks as if our only venue of free speech  left

is  the  Legislative Assembly. For things  said  in

this  Assembly,  the papers will  probably  give  a

certain  amount  of space. This  will  allow  other

people  to  read what we have said. But surely  the

Government   need   not  fear  this   because   the

newspapers  are devoting two-thirds of their  space

to  the  P.A.P.;  only one-third of  the  space  is

reserved   for  all  the  Opposition  Members   put

together.  So  the  Government need  not  fear  our

speaking  our minds in the Legislative Assembly.  I

would  ask the Government not to make a mockery  of

democracy  and guillotine the debate  in  order  to

suppress   still   further  whatever   freedom   of

expression there is left in this Assembly.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is some

validity in the suggestion that the session  should

be   permitted  to  continue  for  as  long  as  is

necessary  to  complete the  work  on  the  matters

legitimately on the Order Paper. It was  originally

suggested by the Government - and it seemed  a  fair

suggestion - that  there should be midnight  sittings

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



Friday, Saturday, and Monday to Thursday inclusive.

I  do not quite know why there has been a change of

views because, on the original plan as indicated by

the  Leader  of  the  House, there  was  reasonable

probability  of the completion of the  work  before

the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Leader of the Barisan asked a rhetorical

question,  whether the work of the Assembly  should

stop  because the Prime Minister has  to  attend  a

conference elsewhere. It is a legitimate  question,

and  probably it is a legitimate answer that in  so

small a House where the Prime Minister needs to go,

perhaps with some other Ministerial colleagues, for

a  major conference, it is necessary to adjourn the

House during the period of that conference. But  is

it  necessary  to adjourn it for  as  long  as  two

months?  I  can understand, Sir, the  need  for  an

adjournment when they are away if, in fact,  it  is

going to be more than one Minister who is going  to

be    away,   perhaps   with   some   parliamentary

Secretaries involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plea that I would like to make here, to a

sense    of    responsibility   to   constitutional

procedure,  is that the Government majority  should

not  be  used to foreclose discussions  on  matters

legitimately before the House where there has  been

no  suggestion at all of any abuse of time  on  the

part  of  the Opposition, any seeking unnecessarily

to  lengthen the proceedings. So I should  like  to

see  some suggestion made whereby we could  perhaps

reconvene at an earlier date until the business  on

the Order Paper is completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I made the

position of the Government quite clear when I spoke

on  Friday  afternoon.  We  were  prepared  to  sit

Friday,   Saturday,  Monday,   and   Tuesday   till

midnight,  an  extra  four  hours  everyday  or  an

equivalent of an extra thee full-day sittings.  But

I  think  Members of the Opposition  must  realise,

particularly  the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis,

that they are not the whole world and if some other

sections  of the Opposition do not desire  sittings

on Saturdays, there is no reason why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  should force its way  through  and

have  a  sitting on a Saturday. Hence the  Saturday

sitting  went by the board. We were quite  prepared

and  ready  to  go  on  from half-past  two  to  12

midnight.  Today, as the Leader  o  the  House  has

stated, we are quite prepared to sit till midnight;

so also tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday morning, as the Member for Queenstown

knows, the Minister for Finance, I and a few  other

colleagues  plus all the important  officials,  the

State Advocate-General in particular, will have  to

be  in  Kuala  Lumpur.  I do  not  think  there  is

anything  on the Order Paper - I say this with  great

respect to the Member for Queenstown - which is more

important  than  what we are going  to  discuss  in

Kuala  Lumpur.  If I had thought  it  otherwise,  I

would have stayed here and postponed the meeting in

Kuala  Lumpur. I would share his concern if I  were

him. I would be deeply grieved to see the Communist

united   front  somewhat  inert  because  all   the

transistors  have been pulled out. The loudspeakers

are  there; the network of wires is there, but  the

thing  that  gives out the sound  is  missing;  and

until  the  underground  decides  to  put  in   new

transistors,  the  set  is  inert.  I   share   his

breavement but I cannot, in any seriousness,  admit

his  purely formulastic motion of condemnation,  of

no   confidence  in  the  Government,  because  the

People's  Action  Party has pro-colonial  policies.

Are we to stay here and listen to old recordings of

things  said and done with? And worse, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am quite convinced that if we were to  sit

till  midnight  today and tomorrow, we  would  more

than  likely  finish  the business,  for  the  very

simple  reason as was illustrated, I think vividly,

just  now. Without the transistors, there  is  very

little sound coming out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Member for Anson to gather the

Opposition   together  and  vote  for  a   midnight

sitting.   The   Government  has  no   overwhelming

majority  to  force its way through. In  fact,  the

Government can be defeated. We can have  a  general

election  all  on a motion for the adjournment.  We

are  quite prepared for that. There is no  bullying

possible. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



completely at the mercy of the Opposition and we do

just  as  the  Opposition  pleases,  provided,   of

course, it is in the interests of the country. I do

not think it is in the interests of the country for

my  colleagues  and I to leave uncompleted  matters

which  concern the future of Singapore in Malaysia.

However grave the problems of the detainees,  their

food,  their reading material and their  recreation

may  be  to  the  Member for Queenstown,  I  cannot

concede  that that is a more important subject  for

us  to  concentrate on and to bend our energies  to

than  to  the  future  welfare  and  well-being  of

Singapore in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision is in the hands of the

Opposition. They can sit tonight till midnight  and

tomorrow  till midnight. We will adjourn  till  the

7th  of  June  formally. But  the  moment  we  have

finished these negotiations, and they are intricate

negotiations,  Sir - in fact, in the middle  of  this

sitting I will have to be excused for a few minutes

from  this  Chamber in order that I can go  through

certain  Defence estimates - defence of Malaysia.  We

must   properly  appraise  ourselves  of  our  fair

contribution. Is there to be a power vacuum in this

region?  If there is not, who is to take the  place

of  the  British forces who will no longer  play  a

part  in  internal security? Are we to  raise  four

battalions and at what cost? Who is to pay for  the

four  battalions? Who will buy arms for  them?  All

these   are   matters   of   great   cogency    and

importance - not  of  academic  importance.   Members

opposite may talk of revolution in academic  terms,

but  the people who manipulate, the people who  are

now    rendered    inert,    are    not    academic

revolutionaries. They are capable of  mounting  the

barricades. So we want to be quite sure that  there

are the right number of men in the right number  of

places with the right quantity of equipment to meet

these  people when the time comes. Without  wishing

to  offend the House, I say I do not think we  have

any  serious business on. We reconvene  this  House

for  one  simple  reason - but  not  because  of  the

pressure   of  public  opinion.  The  public   were

relieved that for once there was peace and quiet in

Singapore  for  a  good solid  seven  months  while

construction and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



progress forged ahead. People wanted to see the end

of  all  this  acrimony, these  long-winded  futile

debates.  We reconvened because the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  had  to  go on Haj, and we  must  have  the

Assembly  in  readiness for  the  moment  when  the

treaty is ready, because that is the moment when we

will  have  to  adopt  formally  all  the  amending

provisions of the Constitution before I can  attach

my  signature to it in London. It is as  simple  as

that.  The  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech  is  a

broad  outline of what really can only  be  another

four  and  a half months of Singapore as  we  know.

After  that, it will be Singapore against  a  wider

perspective, a larger horizon, where the  sound  of

small  crackers in a confined room will be lost  in

the infinity of the spaces of Malaysia - and I do not

advise  firing  crackers  unnecessarily  at   wrong

people  in Malaya. That is the reason why  we  have

reconvened. There is nothing of urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, who is the first to press

for  the  rights  and liberty of  men,  freedom  of

speech,  never  wrote to the Leader  of  the  House

asking  for an emergency sitting over the  arrests.

There was no excitement and ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Prime Minister permit a

point of explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Because the Member for Anson, it

seems  unlike  the  distinguished  lawyers  on  the

Government  Bench, was conscious  that  you  cannot

call   an  emergency  sitting  before  the   Negara

convenes the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I thought so too, Mr Speaker,

Sir, over a Press conference, and I thought perhaps

at  least  he could register a point and  call  for

one. The Member for Hong Lim made a bit of noise in

the  Press  about  reconvening. He  never  formally

wrote  to  the Leader of the House for an emergency

session. What would he say if there was one? A very

difficult moment for him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



Would he side with the Barisan and end up like  the

Barisan  in the gutter? Can he distinguish  himself

so finely apart from the Barisan that when one part

of  the  wheel crashes into the gutter,  the  other

part  still  goes  on  to the straight  highway  of

success?  These are things only possible for  trick

cyclists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody was really excited.

We  reconvened  this sitting for no special  reason

than that we must have the Assembly in readiness to

adopt  the constitutional provisions which  are  at

this  moment  being  drafted and  which  cannot  be

finalised  until  the financial  arrangements  have

been tied up. In between this session, I shall have

to  sit  down  with certain military gentlemen  who

know  more about these matters than I do, and  find

out  what  would be a fair share of the defence  of

Singapore  in  Malaysia. This  is  very  important,

because upon that turns the question of whether our

annual   surpluses,  which  we  have   deliberately

contrived every year of over $100 million, shall go

into Toa Payoh and build 50,000 units; build houses

for  50,000 people at Outram Prison, reclaim 20,000

acres  of  land from Bedok to Nicoll's Highway.  Or

are   we   to  sink  it  buying  guns,  submarines,

helicopters, waiting for a war with neighbours with

whom  we  want to be friends? These are  important

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry to appear harsh to the Member for

Queenstown.  I do not think he has anything  really

worth  saying or the papers would have printed  it.

If  he had some startling analysis of the political

future  of  Singapore, surely he would have  caught

the attention of some newspaper editor or a foreign

journalist. In fact, I know several. I know one who

asked  for an interview with him and he refused  to

give  an  interview. He is shy of  reporters  these

days,  Mr Speaker. He has found out that  charging

head-tong  like a rugger forward into a brick  wall

can be a very painful business. I tell him that the

best  thing  he can do in the circumstances  is  to

submit  with good grace. Malaysia is coming.  There

is  just four and a half months to go. Let  us  not

have any fuss. As the cop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



says,  "Come  along quietly now.  Let  us  have  no

trouble, please." And that is what we want. 7th  of

June - formally.  We have to meet anyway  immediately

after National Day. The deadline is the end of June

for  the  signing of the treaty.  If  it  is  ready

before the 7th of June, we shall meet before  that.

For  tonight  and tomorrow night,  I  leave  it  to

Members of the Opposition. I can assure the  Member

for  Queenstown,  having slugged it  out  blow  for

blow, word for word, through all these months  with

his mentors over the radio, on the public platform,

that we will offer him now ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Television!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> --- television too if he likes.

Then the agony of the moment, Mr Speaker, Sir,  if

I  may just recount this, because I think posterity

would  be  the poorer for it if I did not tell  you

this.  The Member for Anson was there. If  only  we

had  both the sound and the vision! I remember  one

famous  occasion.  Though that was  the  time  when

really  the  moment for decision  was  coming.  The

battle  was won, fought or lost - fought and won  or

lost  there.  The  Member for  Queenstown  dithered

whether  he  was  to appear or  not  to  appear.  3

o'clock  came.  We  were waiting  for  him  at  the

studio. His mentors were not certain. To be or  not

to  be! Suddenly he appeared - at quarter-past three.

And   he   belched,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir!  Oh,   the

excitement  of it! I offered him a carminative.  He

was so angry that I should think that he, a doctor,

did  not carry a carminative with him, and said  he

had it in his pocket. I thought, if people want  to

go  to  battle, they must be prepared for all this,

and  they  must  know when the bells  have  already

rung.  The  referee  has said the  round  is  over.

Malaysia  is  coming. And I advise Members  on  the

other  side - they have refused to take my advice  on

many   a   previous   occasion,   much   to   their

discomfiture.  I  hope they will not  find  me  too

troublesome. But I do offer this advice.  There  is

only  four  and  a  half months to  go,  so  please

contain  themselves. If they believe they are  good

enough to fight for the heavyweight championship of

Malaysia - they  could not even win  the  heavyweight

championship of Singapore, but now they want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



fight   for   the   heavyweight   championship   of

Malaysia - I say just wait till the time comes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak? The

Deputy Prime Minister, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I just want to add a

little  to  what has already been said. The  Member

for  Queenstown  obviously has forgotten  that  the

Barisan  likes very much mass meetings  and  street

meetings.  The  Government  has  not  at  any  time

stopped  them from holding any meeting.  Therefore,

he  was speaking with his tongue in his cheek  when

he  said  that all freedom of expression  had  been

curtailed. The Prime Minister has already  repeated

the  offer  of a radio forum, and now a  television

forum, to the Member for Queenstown. Previously  he

has absented himself from the radio forum, and I do

not  believe that he will accept a television forum

too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to appeal to the House that

it  is with sincerity that when we say we could not

meet  on the 10th and 11th, it is for reasons which

are of national importance, and this supersedes the

rest of the motions on the Order Paper moved by the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising on Tuesday, the 9th April,

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Fourth Report of the Committee of Privileges deals with a certain Inche Hussein Jahidin who was responsible for sending copies of a letter to Government Back-benchers. Subsequently a report was made to the House that this was a breach of privilege and that this letter contained intimidating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



tones  which  sought  to  influence  the  work   of

Government   Back-benchers.   The   Committee    of

Privileges  has  met  and has found  Inche  Hussein

Jahidin  guilty of a breach of privilege.  However,

Inche   Hussein  Jahidin  has  apologised  to   the

Committee  for  dispatching  this  letter.  He  has

admitted breach of privilege and the Committee  has

decided not to take further action in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[5th  April, 1963], "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying

on   Friday  evening  that  the  state  of  affairs

described  by  two hon. Members, from the  Southern

Islands  and  Kampong Kembangan, were  in  fact  an

indictment against our society. For a poor  man  to

risk  $700  to  $1,000  of his hard-earned  savings

buying  a  house which he knows may well be  pulled

down  - and  often he is asked to go into occupation

in  the  middle of the night - he must be in a fairly

desperate   position.   The   problem   has    been

considerably alleviated in the urban areas, in  the

city areas, as a result of massive building of low-cost  housing by the Housing and Development Board.

But there is no obvious solution to the problem  in

the rural areas. This Bill seeks summary powers for

the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malays in particular have not taken to

flat dwelling, except when they have moved together

en  bloc either as part of the Regiment, or as part

of  the  Police  Force, or as part of  the  Customs

Unit.  But in the city where they have so  adjusted

themselves, the problem can be alleviated. However,

in  the  rural  areas, they have shown  a  definite

preference for a house with a piece



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



of land attached to it, which means a piece of land

on which chickens and ducks and birds and so on can

be  kept.  I  am sorry to say that the Housing  and

Development Board has not as yet developed or found

a plan which will allow maximum utilisation of land

for such purposes. The lands which the Malays would

like  to have for settlement are too near the  city

for us to gazette as settlement areas. They are too

valuable for just the ordinary kampong house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands we have available they consider are too

far  from  the  city. It is really  a  sociological

problem the answer to which must be found in either

developing   a  kind  of  house  which   would   be

economical or multi-storey houses with a  piece  of

land nearby - which has been done in other countries;

they  live in flats and they all have little  plots

of  land on which they keep their chickens or  grow

their vegetables - or we must reconcile ourselves  to

this constant repetition of illegal structures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Kampong Kembangan on Friday

evening  drew my attention to three or four  houses

in  particular in his constituency, and I have  had

investigations made into these houses. In the first

place,  Mr Speaker, Sir, before any building  plan

can  be  passed, the owner of the land must signify

his  consent  that he allows this  building  to  be

erected  or to have been erected on his land.  Part

of  that land in Kampong Kembangan belongs  to  the

Alsagoff  Estate.  One  of  it  is  known  as   the

Perseverance  Estate and the beneficiaries  are  at

this  moment  in the process of litigation  in  the

High  Court and nobody can give any consent to  any

building.  The three families that I  was  referred

to,  I  am  sorry to say, knowingly undertook  that

risk  when they built. When they put wood and  zinc

together,  they  knew that the  beneficiaries  were

squabbling  at the High Court over the  Estate  and

they  run the risk of having it smacked down. I  do

not  know what the exact position is at the moment - whether  the house is still standing or has already

been  demolished - but I give this assurance  to  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan, that I will look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



into the matter and treat it with as much

consideration as I can because of the loss that

they have incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it gives me no pleasure in moving this Bill, but I think Members will agree that it is a necessary one. We must, however, try and find a solution to this, and I hope that Members opposite whose constituents always express their preference for the Malay-type of kampong

house  would  help  us  in finding  this  solution.

Having  gone  into  the matter at  some  length  on

several  occasions with my Parliamentary Secretary,

I  do  not see any sizable piece of land acceptable

to  the Malays as sufficiently near the city to  be

gazetted  as a Malay settlement. There  are  little

bits and pieces in Sembawang; a little bit more  in

Kaki  Bukit  near  Kampong Kembangan;  then  it  is

exhausted. Then they have to go really out into the

ulu. Then there is the problem of children going to

school; the problem of roads, light, water  and  so

on.  Alternatively, if they will give this  Geylang

Serai project, where we are putting up some 500 odd

units meant primarily for the people in the area, a

real try and if they will take to flat dwelling, we

can  arrange  to give them bits of land  for  their

chickens and fowls and other animals nearby. That I

think  is the only possible solution to what  is  a

very difficult situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, to leave out lines 16 to 18 inclusive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 deals with the offence of having put

up  a building and then selling it to some innocent

victim.   Sub-clause  (2)   deals  with  an  offence

committed  in the course of putting up a  building.

While the building is still in the process of being

put  up,  the  offender tries  to  sell  it  to  an

innocent victim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these offences are clear-cut - putting up a

building  and then selling it, or having put  up  a

building   and  wanting  to  sell  it.   I   cannot

understand  why prosecutions for offences  of  this

nature should receive the sanction of the Minister.

Sir,   there  have  been  cases  where   before   a

prosecution could be instituted, it must  have  the

sanction  of  the State Advocate-General.  One  can

understand  and  appreciate and support  that.  But

where  the  sanction has to come from the Minister,

it is all wrong, because he can play politics. That

has  happened, Sir. There is loss of faith  in  the

P.A.P.  Ministers. "So long as  you  are  a  P.A.P.

member,  tidak apa, lah. I will not prosecute  you.

And  if  you  are  not already a member,  become  a

P.A.P. member  quickly, and we will not  prosecute

you."  That  is why we are objecting on the  ground

that this leads to political abuse.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would just like to

*The motion reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of section 4 of the

Nature Reserve Ordinance (Chapter 235), resolves -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the said Ordinance be deleted

and the following substituted therefor:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2. All those two pieces of land situate in Mukim No. XVI,

Bukit Timah, in the State of Singapore, known as the Bukit Timah Forest

Reserve comprised in lots 354 and 357, and estimated to contain approximate

areas of 1a.3r. 20.9p. and 162a. 0r. 00p. respectively, the boundaries of which

are more particularly delineated and edged pink on Certified Plan No. 10623

filed in the office of the Chief Surveyor, Singapore";

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that paragraph 6 of the Schedule to the said Ordinance be deleted

and that such deletion shall be deemed to have taken effect as from the

19th day of October, 1962.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion deals with two areas, namely, one area

in  the Bukit Timah Forest Reserve and the other in

the  Labrador  Forest Reserve,  off  Telok  Blangah

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the first area, there is a small

piece of land of approximately 1.8 acres, which the

Nature  Reserves  Board proposes  to  exchange  for

another  piece  of  land of similar  size  situated

adjacent  to the Reserve and which belongs  to  the

Public  Works  Department. This  proposed  exchange

will  be of mutual benefit to both parties  as  the

area to be transferred from the Forest Reserve will

provide  a  large working face of rock  which  will

enhance the yield of granite from the Public  Works

quarry. The land to be offered by the Public  Works

Department to the Nature Reserves Board in exchange

is  of potential benefit to the Forest Reserve  for

nature  conservation. This proposal will involve  a

re-definition of the Bukit Timah Forest Reserve and

paragraph  2 of the Schedule to the Nature  Reserve

Ordinance  will  need amendment as proposed  in  my

resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second area referred to in my

resolution,  it  is  intended  to  de-gazette   the

Labrador Forest Reserve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



which  comprises an area of approximately 11 acres,

3  roods,  4  poles, adjacent to the Pasir  Panjang

Power  Station. There is an urgent need to  release

an  area  of  land within this Reserve  immediately

adjacent  to  the  existing Power Station  for  the

purpose  of constructing a new Power Station.  Work

on  this has already begun to enable the new  Power

Station to be in operation by December 1964. Recent

industrial  developments round the Labrador  Nature

Reserve  has resulted in isolation of this reserve,

and  we  are led to the conclusion that  this  land

would better serve the needs of Singapore as a site

for  future  industrial expansion  rather  than  to

continue as a Nature Reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nature Reserves Board has also been consulted

regarding  this proposal. The Board  has  also  put

forward the view that it is quite possible that the

effluence  of  noxious gases from the  Maruzen  Oil

Refinery  will  seriously  disturb  the  biological

balance  in  the reserve. The Board is prepared  to

release  the whole of this area and have asked  for

another  area in exchange. My Ministry  is  looking

for  suitable sites in conjunction with the  Nature

Reserves Board, and as soon as agreement is reached

by  all  concerned,  a further resolution  will  be

moved in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity consumption has shown increased trends

and  it  is expected that demand will exceed supply

in  the  first  quarter of 1965. It  is  essential,

therefore,  that  the new Power Station  should  be

completed  and  in operation before  that  happens,

otherwise  we  will  face yet  another  episode  of

blackouts and rationing of electricity. In view  of

this urgency, I had authorised the City Council  in

October  last year to begin clearance of  site  and

building, and also for engineering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



works to begin at once. I feel sure  that  the

House  will endorse and support this action  on  my

part in anticipation of the approval of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore, propose to this House to agree

to the deletion of the Labrador Nature Reserve with

retrospective effect from 19th October,  1962,  the

date  on  which the City Council was informed  that

the work could commence immediately on the site.

Negara  for his speech to this  Assembly*. The  years  since June 1959 have been eventful  and

fateful. There were moments in 1961 when the lesser

spirits amongst us in this Chamber thought that the

battle  was  lost,  that all that  we  stood  for - a

democratic,  non-Communist, socialist society - would

be  swept  under  the relentless onslaught  of  the

Communists.  Not wanting to be on the losing  side,

they made the necessary personal

*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech of the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of Singapore, express

<hr size="2" noshade>

adjustments.  But there were many others,  in  this

Chamber  and outside, who never doubted the outcome

of  the  struggle  and who stood firm  to  see  the

country  through to peace, security and  prosperity

in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are less than five months to go before

Malaysia.  The  moments  of  doubts  are  gone  and

anxiety  has vanished as people bend their energies

to  planning and construction for the stable  years

ahead.  I  do  not  say that we have  put  all  our

troubles  behind us. Indeed, it would be disastrous

to  ignore  the  underground  organisation  of  the

Communists,  the  constant battle  for  hearts  and

minds, the relentless process of attrition as  wits

and  strategy are matched and encounters fought and

won or lost temporarily, while the long-term battle

goes on - a battle that can be decisively won only by

a  better  life for the people in a more  just  and

equal society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think it is fair to say that even the most

optimistic  of  Members on the other  side  of  the

House - or perhaps I should say on the other side  of

the   nation - know  that  there  is   no   hope   of

establishing  a  Communist  Malaysia  in  the  next

decade. Their dreams can only come true if and when

a  Communist Indonesia were to emerge, and  if  and

when  a  Communist Indonesia becomes a success.  We

hope  that  will  never  happen.  Anyway,  for  the

present,  we  must gird ourselves for the  constant

pressure  and pin-pricks that they will exert  over

any  issue that would excite any group of men  that

they could get together to bolster their cause.  If

they  cannot get the people at large excited,  they

try  to  get  the families of detainees excited  by

squatting  outside my office. If  they  cannot  get

parents and students to stage boycotts, strikes and

protests,  they  try to get young men  involved  in

political rallies like the one they held on  Sunday

24th  last  month. We were interested to  know  who

attended  that rally. But what was interesting  was

that the Chairman of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis  and a number  of  his  committee

members  were surprised at the organised attendance

of  young  school boys, who, unknown to  them,  had

been  separately organised to attend by people  who

ultimately  control  the  people  who  control  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  We must never  make  the  grave

error of the last Government in believing that  the

neutralization  of  a  few united  front  activists

could  mean  the end of the Communist  capacity  to

organise  and  agitate  when  the  time  comes  for

elections.  This has been a temporary  setback  for

them  in  what  is  a grim long-term  struggle  for

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add this note of caution for them.

It is our duty between now and the 4� months before

Malaysia  to  ensure  that  nothing  is   done   in

Singapore  contrary to the verdict  of  the  people

given  on  1st September last year. Had  they  been

wise  and accepted that verdict, they might perhaps

have  not  precipitated the  decision  taken  at  a

meeting in Kuala Lumpur on 1st February.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met a friend recently - a personal, and not a

political  friend - Mr  James  Puthucheary - in  Kuala

Lumpur.  It was for old times' sake. He is  one  of

their  bright minds. He would not mind  my  telling

this  to  Members on the other side of  the  House,

particularly the Member for Thomson, that the  most

stupid  thing they had done was to keep on fighting

against  Malaysia after the people had  decided  in

the referendum that Singapore was for Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sham!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Let me tell the Member for

Thomson what Mr James Puthucheary said, and he  is

a brighter mind ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He is not here to say it.

reading all this tomorrow in the newspapers. He was

one  of  the brighter minds. He said that  whatever

the  rights  and  wrongs of the  referendum - and  he

found  many things wrong with it - once the  decision

had  been  taken, that should be  the  end  of  the

matter. I think it was a pity that

he  did  not express this wisdom more cogently  and

effectively  to  the other leading members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis earlier, particularly during  the

period just before the Brunei revolt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between now and 31st August, we have one paramount

responsibility,  that  is,  to  ensure   that   the

situation  does  not  deteriorate,  either  in  the

efficacy  of  the  organs of the State  or  in  the

overall calm and stability of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we will forge ahead with our

construction.  We have some massive  schemes.  They

should  be  all well on their way before  the  31st

August. Members already know from the speech of the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara that Outram Road Gaol  will

be  demolished  soon. In fact, I am  informed  that

demolition operations have already begun on part of

the old gaol. A new modern gaol is being planned in

Bedok  and Changi. The whole site of 36 acres  will

be  ready  for building by the end of the year.  On

this  hill  of  some 36 acres of  hard  land,  some

beautiful  buildings  for  50,000  people  will  be

built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another massive project that has been started by

the  Land  Office  working  with  the  Housing  and

Development  Board is to re-claim 20,000  acres  of

land  stretching  from Bedok  right  up  to  Nicoll

Highway, extending half a mile out to sea along the

shore-line. Land is valuable in our little  island.

An  increasing  population makes it  necessary  not

only  that  we build upwards but also that  we  re-claim  all  available land at present partly  under

water  from  prawn ponds to building lots.  In  the

first phase of this project, some 50 acres will  be

ready  in  three  months' time near  the  Fisheries

school at Bedok 8� m.s. This is the beginning  and

will   be   an  open  park  for  the  time   being.

Eventually,  20,000 acres, nearly three  times  the

size  of  Kreta  Ayer  constituency,  will  be  re-claimed,  partly  to  be used by  the  Housing  and

Development Board for building and partly for  sale

to  private  builders - to pay for the  cost  of  the

reclamation of the whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this increase in building, of course, means an

accelerated   demand  for  public  utilities - water,

electricity and gas. It is not only the increase in

population



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



but  the  increase  in  consumption  of  water  and

electricity per head of population because of  more

homes  and  also  because of  more  standpipes  and

electricity supplies to the kampongs and the  rural

areas. It becomes urgently necessary for us to plan

ahead  for new sources of water and power to ensure

that supply always exceeds demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give a brief illustration of the rate

of  increase. The Housing and Development Board was

building at the rate of 12,300 units per annum last

year,  and  15,000 units per annum  this  year.  In

other words, one unit, every 45 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, private developers, reflecting the

general  prosperity over the last  two  years,  are

building multi-storied flats all over the City. The

Planning  Department under my charge  have  had  to

make  some adjustments on density control  to  take

into account the realities of urban development  in

Singapore. An estimated 6,000 units per  annum  are

being put up at present by private developers.  All

this means an enormous increase of over 21,000 more

homes  per annum all making demands on the  pub-lie

utilities, water, electricity and gas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been fortunate in avoiding water

rationing   so  far,  in  spite  of  the  prolonged

drought,  and  in  spite of  the  large  number  of

standpipes that have been installed. There  are  at

the moment 2,400 public standpipes, all giving free

water.  One-third of these were put up in the  last

two years - 600 of them. The standpipes alone account

for more than 12 per cent of the average user of 72

million  gallons a day. I am sorry,  Sir,  that  in

some  places, through lack of education and a sense

of civic responsibility, taps have been left to run

throughout the whole night, at a time of  prolonged

drought. I would like to urge all householders  who

live  near  standpipes to take upon themselves  the

responsibility to help the community  to  see  that

standpipes  are  not running to  waste  during  the

night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have avoided water rationing was

because  of  the  ample stocks of  water  built  up

before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



the  drought,  about  70  per  cent  of  our  total

capacity.  Another reason was the increased  output

in  Tebrau  after  extensions at the  Tebrau  works

completed  in  the middle of last year,  increasing

the  daily output from Tebrau from 30 to 45 million

gallons  per  day. However, I must warn  the  House

that  if there is no break in the dry spell in  the

next week, we may have to introduce ration' ing  in

order  to  conserve stocks in preparation  for  the

normal  dry  weather expected  in  June,  July  and

August,  as our stocks have gone down from  70  per

cent  to  54 per cent in the impounding reservoirs,

the  16  per cent having been used to make  up  the

daily shortage from Tebrau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will already have known that we are

planning  an extension pipeline to take water  from

Scudai  River at a cost of $16 million. This scheme

will  be completed in the course of 1964. The first

phase  has  already  started, and  when  operations

commence  towards the end of this year, 15  million

gallons  a  day can be added to our water supplies.

In  the  course of next year, when the whole  works

are  completed,  a  total of 30 million  additional

gallons per day can be extracted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may know that last year we invited a firm

of  water consultants approved by the World Bank to

advise  us.  The  World Bank will only  give  loans

after advice of water consultants approved by them.

A fee of nearly half-a-million dollars was paid for

a  thorough  survey of our water needs.  They  have

made  certain recommendations thereon, one of which

was that we should proceed with the Scudai project,

whilst  work  commences on the  main  Johore  River

project.  Johore River - first phase to be  completed

by  the  end  of 1967 - will bring an additional  30

million  gallons  per day and,  when  completed  in

1976,  will bring 60 million gallons per day.  This

scheme is expected to cost a total of $70 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A World Bank loan for the Scudai River, Johore

River and the Jurong Reservoir for industrial water

is being negotiated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, I would like to quote the figures of

daily  consumption  of water  in  1959  as  against

1963: 1959,  64  million gallons per day;  1963,  73

million gallons per day - an increase of some 15  per

cent  in the short space of 3� years. Members  will

realise, therefore, the urgent necessity of getting

on  with  the  waterworks  to  ensure  that  supply

remains greater than demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, too, with electricity. Plans have been

completed  and orders placed for a 22,500  kilowatt

additional generating plant to be installed at  St.

James' Power Station comprising two 11,250 kilowatt

gas  turbines meant primarily to increase operation

over  the  peak  load  periods  and  scheduled  for

production  in December this year. This  will  take

care  of  the interim increase in demand while  the

second  power  station  at  Pasir  Panjang -   Power

Station "B" of 60,000 kilowatts - is being installed

to be ready by the first half of 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, we can look back with some

satisfaction on the progress that has been made  in

the past year. Despite all the obstacles placed  by

Communist   united-front  organisations   on   land

clearance  and squatter resettlement, we have  been

able to resettle on fair terms several thousands of

squatters.  Now  all the major projects  are  under

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of this year the earthworks for Toa

Payoh  would be completed and 50 acres of  building

site  will be available. The excess earth from  Toa

Payoh  will  be  transported to  Kallang  Basin  to

reclaim another 50 acres for industrial sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to give Members some perspective of these

figures, may I mention that on the 50 acres of land

at  Toa Payoh, an estimated 100,000 persons can  be

resettled and the Toa Payoh scheme, when completed,

will  be able to house 350,000 people in a properly

laid out satellite town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also know that recently when

operations  to clear the roads started, the  Member

for  Toa  Payoh  aided and abetted,  or  perhaps  I

should say, he, aiding and abetting some Communist-front operators in Toa Payoh, tried to sabotage the

machines that were used in the operations. I  think

the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



for  Toa  Payoh  realises now the  gravity  of  the

situation.  If people are determined to  embark  on

unlawful activities, then they must be prepared  to

take  the consequences and it is no use complaining

about  bad diets and bad rations. All these  things

should  have been carefully considered  before  one

mounts    an    anti-the-people,    anti-the-nation

campaign.  Once  the battle has been  joined,  then

they   must   expect  it  to  go  to  its   logical

conclusion. One cannot, Sir, run with the hare  and

hunt with the hounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the demolition of the Outram Road Prison has

already begun and will be completed by the  end  of

this  year. This is a take-off for the main project

of  urban  redevelopment which will begin with  the

help  of a team of United Nations experts who  have

been invited to Singapore to advise on central city

redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, all this would be impossible if

the  economic prosperity to pay for all  this  were

not  there.  Members will have noted the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech that our reserves have gone

up from $87 million in June 1959 to $335 million - an

increase  of  $250 million, even after  substantial

capital  outlays had been made from the Development

Fund of $100 million per year or about $300 million

in  three  years. In other words, the  increase  of

funds  available for development was  somewhere  in

the region of $550 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will always be ups and downs in our economic

prosperity, Sir, but we have been able  to  put  by

sufficient reserves and are continuing  to  put  by

enough  each year to see us through all  our  major

projects: the Jurong industrial site (9,000 acres),

the    Toa   Payoh   scheme,   and   Central   City

redevelopment, and we shall build a new skyline for

Singapore  Harbour, in the words of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara  "a  new  city   of   beauty   and

distinction, worthy of the industry and  enterprise

of  our people, and in keeping with our position as

the financial, industrial and commercial centre  of

South-East Asia".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.  I  just want to clarify  a  certain

point before the Member begins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did a bit of mental arithmetic just now and

came to tae wrong answer. The area of Kreta Ayer is

only  16  acres, and I am told 20,000 acres divided

by 16 comes to 1,400 times [Laughter] Kreta Ayer. I

beg your pardon.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad the

Prime Minister has made the correction, because all

his  talk  of grandiose schemes and new cities  and

skylines should be similarly corrected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, the policy speech this year has a

very  hollow ring. There is a great deal of padding

put  on, but this does not deceive the people that,

in fact, all is empty inside. You will notice, Sic,

that  in the speech of the Prime Minister, he talks

of  nothing  but the number of standpipes  and  the

number  of  housing units - with a full list  of  the

number  of  housing units, the number of standpipes

and  even the number of post offices with which the

P.A.P. leaders  hope  to  impress  the  people  of

Singapore with their ability, efficiency  and  good

work  as a government. And it does look as  if  the

incorporation  of  the old City  Council  with  the

Government departments has its usefulness  for  the

P.A.P.  Government, otherwise the P.A.P. would  not

even  have standpipes to crow about. But take  away

all  these  governmental and departmental summaries

which  we  can  find in all the yearly departmental

reports, what is left of the policy speech? What is

there which tells us of the real Government policy?

In  fact, Sir, the whole policy speech is merely  a

dreary  repetition  of what the  P.A.P. propaganda

machine  has  been mass-producing for  many  months

past.  It  is only a re-hash of Government handouts

to the Press which nowadays are issued after visits

of  the  Prime  Minister to the constituencies,  in

order  to deceive the people that but for the Prime

Minister's visits to the rural areas the people  in

those areas would not have got the improvements  in

the areas and it is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister  himself who is looking  after  all

their  interests. But take away, as I say, all  the

Departmental Reports, figures and statistics  which

impress no one: what do we find after four years of

P.A.P. rule? (Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is supposed to be a policy

speech but there is curiously no mention of how the

Government  intends to help people solve  the  most

pressing  and urgent problems of our society  today

and,  with only four and a half months to go, after

four  years  of  office, there is no  mention,  for

instance,  of how the P.A.P. Government intends  to

help  the  people  get  rid  of  poverty,  disease,

ignorance and want. There is no mention of how  the

Government  intends to help the people get  rid  of

exploitation and oppression. There is no mention of

how  the  Government intends to genuinely  help  to

unify  the workers and the trade union movement  in

order to further strengthen the bargaining power of

the workers and the interests of the working class.

There is no mention again of the basic struggles of

the   people - the  anti-colonial   and   the   anti-imperialist struggles - and the urgent necessity to

get rid of colonialism and imperialism in all their

shapes  and  forms.  There is  no  mention  of  the

struggle  for  a  truly equal and just  society -  a

socialist society which the Prime Minister  boasted

so  much  about  in the first year of  office.  And

there is no mention of the struggle for the genuine

reunification of the Federation and Singapore  into

a   truly  independent,  democratic  and  socialist

Malaya, free of foreign troops and foreign control.

For  a  Government that professed to fight for  all

these  aims  and  objects when it  was  elected  to

office   in   1959,  it  is  simply   amazing   and

unbelievable that there should be no mention of all

these  aims and objects after nearly four years  of

office,  and what steps the Government proposes  to

take  to  achieve them. Instead we get  a  mass  of

words,  words and words, all camouflage and  P.A.P.

propaganda with nothing to help us solve the  basic

problems of our society today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> --- such as housing!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is still this talk of

their   Four-Year  Plan  and  even  of  departments

bending   their   energies  to  carry   out   their

development projects. But what has happened to  the

Common  Market?  Nothing, not a word  is  mentioned

about the Common Market. And, in fact, how many  of

the  unemployed masses have found employment, as  a

result of P.A.P. work after assuming power? Would the

Government  tell us the actual number of unemployed

in the State of Singapore and the actual number who

have  got jobs following development projects? They

may  have millions and millions of dollars  in  the

kitty,  but  how does that help the  poor  and  the

unemployed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is this frequent boasting of "P.A.P.

dynamic  effort" which says that they  have  broken

the  back of the housing shortage. True, there  are

more  housing flats today than in 1959. Well,  what

is  there  to  boast about? Is  that  not  part  or

Government's duties and responsibilities? But  more

to  the  point is this: how many housing units  are

there  that are mere "standing monuments"?  In  the

words     of     the    Prime    Minister - "standing

monuments" - due  to  the  inefficiency   of   P.A.P.

planning  or  rather  due to  the  lack  of  P.A.P.

planning.  Anyone can build any number  of  housing

flats  as  long  as  he has money  to  do  so.  Any

contractor, any Housing Estate can do that;  we  do

not need a Government to do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ha!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But what do we build houses

for?  Why  do  we  build houses?  That  is  a  very

important  question.  Are we to  build  houses  and

flats  just  for  the sake of building  houses  and

fiats - a  matter of art for art's sake? Do we  build

houses  and  flats  without  consideration  as   to

whether  or  not the people can afford to  stay  in

them?  What  has  happened to the  P.A.P. election

pledge  to build low-cost housing for the  poor  in

Singapore? Does the P.A.P. Government not know that

the  majority of the people in Singapore  are  poor

and  cannot  afford  high-cost  housing?  Yes,  the

P.A.P. has  built  a  number of  low-cost  housing

units.  But  that is not enough, far  from  enough!

There are too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



few  of  these low-cost housing flats. Most of  the

housing  units built are beyond the  reach  of  the

ordinary worker and many people just cannot  afford

to  stay  in the Housing Board flats built  by  the

Government, and especially so when these flats  are

built  far  away from the centres of  communication

and  far  away from schooling facilities for  their

children  and  from  their places  of  work.  As  a

result, though thousands of flats have been  built,

thousands  also  are unoccupied, in  spite  of  all

types  of  offers and inducements by the Government

to  get  the people to live in them. To all intents

and  purposes, these empty housing units  are  mere

"white  elephants". Many of these flats go abegging

and no one wants to stay in them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should this be so when there are slums all

over  Singapore  and when people have  to  live  in

insanitary  attap huts and in the kampongs?  Is  it

because  the people want to live in attap huts  and

kampongs?  The  Prime Minister in the  U.N.E.S.C.O.

Opening in Singapore a couple of months back  said,

"Yes".  He said the Malays prefer to live in wooden

houses   on  stilts.  He  said  this  is   due   to

psychological   reasons:  that   the   Malays   are

satisfied  with kampong life and that  they  cannot

adjust themselves to living in Housing Board flats.

These  are the reasons given by the Prime  Minister

of  Singapore, in a country that is undeveloped and

in  a  country where all the people are  poor!  For

example, does the Prime Minister know that many, in

fact,  almost all the kampong folks, cannot  afford

to  live in the Housing Board flats, and that  they

live  in  kampongs  because economically  they  are

bound    to   the   kampongs   and   not    because

psychologically they like to stay in kampongs? Give

them the money, give them the wherewithal, and  the

Prime Minister will see that the kampong folks  are

ready to live in the most beautiful and the best of

houses; that they will be able to adjust themselves

as well as anyone can.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And now we see so many housing

to live in - just cannot afford to live in and do not

care to live in, unless compelled to do so by other

circumstances. Worse still, when through  force  of

circumstances some people do apply for flats,  they

are  denied them and offered instead only the  most

undesirable  ones, like those in the  very  top  of

multi-storeyed flats.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What is wrong with that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> "What is wrong with that?", he

asks. Is that why we have a Housing Board, to build

flats with the taxpayers' money and turn them  into

barracks for the police and the troops? Troops used

not  to protect the people of Singapore and not  to

fight the external enemy --- ?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> --- and the internal one too!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- but to oppress the people

of  the  country? [Laughter] They are  laughing.  I

suppose they think that they can take pride in this

work: to use our taxpayers' money to build barracks

for  the  police  and  the troops  to  oppress  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You want us to let you riot

around with the people!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is this something to be proud

of, to crow about? Does the Prime Minister know  of

the hardships of the people who have been compelled

to  live  in  these housing flats  which  they  can

hardly afford? I do not need to touch on the  water

shortage ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the trouble.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- that seems to be perpetually

plaguing Singapore these days under P.A.P. rule. No

one would believe, Sir, that there could be a water

shortage  in  a  country that  is  blessed  with  a

plentiful supply of rainfall every year. [Laughter]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is happening here in Singapore and from

the  way the P.A.P. Ministers are laughing, we have

to thank the P.A.P. for it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are lucky the general

pressure is still good.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, this is merely

another instance of poverty in the midst of  plenty

under P.A.P. rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there is this National Theatre which

the  P.A.P. is  so eager to open  officially  that

night  work is introduced and overtime  has  to  be

paid. Of course, we understand the urgent necessity

to hurry up the completion of the Theatre while the

P.A.P. is still alive, while our Prime Minister  is

still sitting opposite, while he can still sip beer

in this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I did enquire from the

Prime Minister whether beer was being sipped by him

in  this House. He said it was something which made

him  think clearly and speak clearly. I must accept

the  word  of the Prime Minister that  it  was  not

beer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir,I  may apply for a chemist's report for  this

Chamber tomorrow! [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But I do not think there is any

reason  for  laughter and merriment in  this  House

today.   The   whole  of  Singapore   is   mourning

[Laughter]  and  only the Prime  Minister  and  his

other hirelings are smiling and laughing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of order. The hon. Member

has used the word "hirelings". I think it is out of

order,  being  unparliamentary language.  Will  the

Member withdraw it, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> From the way the Minister for Finance

has  risen  on  the  point of order  and  from  the

laughter   that  is  arising  from  the  Government

benches, it seems to me as though that word has not

offended. Therefore, I cannot in this context  rule

that word as being unparliamentary. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was talking about the

National Theatre, Sir, Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



course, the P.A.P. hope to shine in the bright T.V.

lights   at  the  grand  opening  of  the  National

Theatre.  Extra money has to be spent,  night  work

has to be pushed forward and pressure has to be put

on  the  contractor and the workmen to  finish  the

work on time - all to please P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it the Member will be

taking  some time. This is the time to  suspend.  I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

House rose, I was speaking on the National Theatre.

Now,  of  course,  we have this  new  P.A.P. craze

called television. Why is the P.A.P. so anxious  to

have television in Singapore? So anxious, Sir, that

the  Government is asking every family in Singapore

to buy T.V. sets with all sorts of inducements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Have you got your set?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is well known that the

P.A.P. wants desperately to have T.V. to serve  the

Ministers  as a vehicle for their propaganda.  They

have  learned  from experience that the  radio  and

television  can play a very great part  in  shaping

public  opinion.  Their shameless scare  propaganda

during  the  last  week of the referendum  campaign

depended  greatly  on  the radio  and  Rediffusion,

assisted by the Press and police vans to carry  the

threats  and  intimidation of  the  Prime  Minister

about  the los3 of citizenship, if the people  cast

blank  votes,  into  the homes  of  the  people  in

Singapore.  That is why the rural areas  which  are

not  so  well  served with radios  and  Rediffusion

returned  a higher percentage of blank votes.  This

has been admitted as much by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the P.A.P. wants to build hundreds and

hundreds  of  community centres in the rural  areas

and  install in them radio and television sets, all

with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



hope   of   soaking   the  audience   with   P.A.P.

propaganda,  because television is  a  novelty  and

many  people will go to community centres to  watch

television  out  of curiosity.  The  P.A.P. is  so

anxious for everyone to come under the influence of

its  propaganda that the Permanent Secretary to the

Minister for Culture had to write letters to coffee-shop  owners - under  instructions  from  the  P.A.P.

Ministers  no  doubt - to  request  them  to  install

television sets in their premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times, on 29th March, 1963, reported

that  the  Singapore  Government  had  launched   a

campaign  to  get  T.V. sets  installed  in  bars,

restaurants  and coffee-shops. Letters,  signed  by

Mr W. S. Woon, Permanent Secretary to the Minister

for  Culture,  had  gone out  to  owners  of  those

establishments. I have a cutting, Sir, of  what  it

says. To each of them Mr Woon says ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated in the past

that  if an extract from a newspaper is to be read,

the newspaper itself should be produced and not the

mere cutting, and if the hon. Member can assure  me

that  he  can  produce a copy of the Straits  Times

before the rising today, he can read the extract.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will produce that copy, Sir,

a little later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am to request you to consider the installation

of  a  television set in your business premises  if

you have not already done so.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask, is this part of the duties of a civil

servant  to  request coffee-shop owners to  install

T.V. sets?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Is it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If it is not the duty of civil

servants  to  do  these things,  what  disciplinary

action   does   the  Government  intend   to   take

concerning  such  gross  indiscipline  by  a  civil

servant?  I  am  glad the Minister for  Finance  is

listening  to this, and I would like him  to  state

what  action he intends to take when he  speaks  on

this debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation. Sir.

Since  the Member for Queenstown alleges that there

has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



a  breach of discipline, could he please inform  me

which  General Order or which Government Regulation

the official has been guilty of breaching?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think it is the business of

the  Government to inform us, and let the  Minister

answer that afterwards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are asking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All I want to know is, what if

they   do  not  install  T.    V. sets  in   their

premises? Is the Government going to suspend their

coffee-shop and eating-house licences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is this not intimidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is already an example in

the case of the printing presses, and such requests

from  Government  officials are  nothing  but  pure

intimidation of the poor people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, Sir, is that the Government, in its

eagerness to push T.V. for P.A.P. propaganda,  even

went to lee extent of instructing civil servants to

install  T.  V. sets in their homes,  telling  them

that  the  Government would be ready to  give  them

interest-free loans to buy T.V. sets and to  deduct

monthly repayments from their salaries. Let me ask,

what business is it of the Government to ask coffee-shop owners and civil servants to buy T.V. sets? Is

this an election pledge of the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.

Will  the Member for Queenstown please let me  know

on which date the alleged circular was issued? I am

in  charge  of the Ministry which would issue  such

circulars  and, so far as I know, nothing  of  this

sort has ever come out of my Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Lies!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  who has used the word "lies" knows  that

it is unparliamentary. He must now apologise to the

House and withdraw the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I apologise, Sir, and withdraw

the word.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance knows

that   the  P.A.P.  Government  likes  setting   up

Commissions.  Let  them  set  up  a  Commission  of

Inquiry  into  this  and they  will  know  all  the

details. Let the Minister reply when he speaks. Let

me  ask, why should the P.A.P. Ministers go out  of

their way to promote the sale of T.V. sets? Do  the

Ministers  and  the  Permanent  Secretary  to   the

Minister   for  Culture,  Mr  W.  S.   Woon,   get

commissions  from the T.V. firms  and  the  foreign

manufacturers  for the sales promotion?  Otherwise,

what  interest  have the Ministers  and  government

servants to act in the way they have?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the programme in T.V., to my knowledge, is

all lousy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Is what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And once the novelty has worn

off, it is very unlikely that many would bother  to

pay  too  much  attention to P.A.P. propaganda  via

T.V. To the P.A.P., of course, T.V. is going to  be

their  life-line. Not being able to get  a  sizable

audience  in mass rallies, the P.A.P. hopes  to  be

able to reach tens of thousands in their homes. The

P.A.P. hopes to compel the people, willy-nilly, to

listen to speeches and party propaganda from P.A.P.

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the P.A.P. not misuse public money for its own

party propaganda. The P.A.P. has pledged to husband

all  available resources to help raise  the  living

standards  of  the people and not to  fritter  away

money   for  the  promotion  of  private  sectional

interests and of their colonial masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, sir, let me refer once again to the

boast  of the P.A.P. about the increase in  revenue

and   accounts.  May  I  refer  you,  Sir,  to  the

Financial Statement for the year 1959? On page



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



44,  in  the  last column, you will  see  that  the

surplus funds, market value on 31st December,  1959

amounted  to $93,524,577.46. We will just  call  it

$93  million. Let us turn to page 48  of  the  same

Financial Statement for the year 1959. We see  that

the  net  value  in  Dollars  of  Development  Fund

Investments  is  equal  to $46,124,666.90.  Let  us

briefly  call it $46 million. $93 million plus  $46

million equal $139 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now may I refer you to the 1960 Financial

Statement,  and draw your attention to  the  figure

that  is printed in page 45? Against Surplus Funds,

on    31st   December,   1960,   the   figure    is

$164,004,002.18.  Let us call it $164  million.  If

you   turn   to  page  49,  the  Development   Fund

Investments  on  31st December,  1960  amounted  to

$85,148,387.36. Let us call it $85 million.  If  we

add  $164 million to $85 million, we get the figure

of  $249 million. We see, Sir, therefore, that from

1959  to  1960 the amount that was invested  abroad

has  increased from $139 million to $249  million - a

difference of $110 million. Let me now refer to the

Financial Statement for the year 1961. On page 210,

in  the  last column, you get the Surplus Funds  on

31st December, 1961. The figure is $199,119,196.29.

You see, Sir, these investments have - I do not think

I need run through all of them - all been invested in

Aberdeen   Corporation,  Australia,  British   Gas,

Huddersfield  Hull,  etc, which  are  all  foreign

firms.  The  next figure to which I would  like  to

draw your attention is on page 215, which tells  us

of   the   particulars  of  the  Development   Fund

Investments on 31st December, 1961. The  figure  is

$117,019,572.83. If we were to add the $199 million

of  the  Surplus Funds to the $117 million  of  the

Development Fund Investments, we get the figure  of

$316 million. Sir, all this money has been invested

not in Singapore, but in some foreign lands to help

other people and not the people of Singapore.  That

money  has been used to help the colonial interests

and not the people of Singapore. From 1959 to 1961.

we   see  that  the  amount  invested  abroad   has

increased from $139 million to $249 million to $316

million. Every year it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



has  been  increasing, and yet the P.A.P.  wants  to

boast that there is so much and so much and so much

in the kitty. As I have already asked, Sir, what is

the  point of having so much in the kitty  and  not

making  use  of  the money for the welfare  of  the

people  of  Singapore?  There  are  millions   and

millions  of  dollars, as we know,  in  the  United

States  and elsewhere, but what good is that  money

to us? I wish the Minister for Finance will explain

all  this  to us. We are very dense in  matters  of

finance,  but  probably the Minister will  care  to

enlighten the people of Singapore as to why so much

of our money has been invested abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the hospital services. I would

like  to  ask, what provisions have the  Government

made  for the increasing number of patients who  go

to  hospital  for treatment? There are  reports  of

shortages  of all sorts of medicines and  materials

for  the use of patients. Why should, I ask,  there

be  shortages? Is it because we do not have  enough

money  to  look  after  the  sick?  I  have   just

mentioned  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars

invested abroad. When the Government claims to have

millions of dollars in the kitty, and when millions

of  dollars  has to be spent on advertisements  for

the  promotion of Malaysia and T.V., why should the

hospitals   run  short  of  medicines   and   other

materials needed to look after the sick? And why do

outpatients   in  the  Government   Polyclinic   in

Queenstown  have  to  pay  50  cents  per  patient?

Patients  get free treatment in other  clinics  Why

should   it  be  different  in  the  case  of   the

Government Polyclinic in Queenstown? Is it a change

of policy, or is it pure discrimination?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding education, the Government can never

again claim that there is equal treatment for  four

streams  of education in Singapore. We do not  know

how  much  connection  there is  between  the  mass

arrests on 2nd February and the `Torch Campaign' to

encourage parents and schoolchildren to pay serious

attention  to the study of their mother tongue  and

language. But the P.A.P. education policy has  been

shown  to  be  discriminatory.  For  instance,  the

question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



Nantah   University   has  until   today   remained

unsettled.  The  number  of  students  joining  the

Malay, Chinese and primary school classes for  1963

has  dropped  very steeply in comparison  with  the

number of students attending primary classes in the

English stream. If we compare the number of primary

students for the various streams in 1963 with  that

of  previous  years, there is a shocking  contrast.

This  alone is enough to show how successful  PA.P.

policy  has  been  in  its  discrimination  against

Malay, Chinese and Tamil education. Indeed, Sir, so

scared  is  the  P.A.P. of the people  knowing  the

actual  situation that the Permanent  Secretary  to

the  Minister for Education has to clam up and  not

answer  enquiries  in several letters  from  me.  I

enquired for the figures of primary students in the

various  streams of education for 1963, as well  as

for the previous years, in my capacity as Member of

the  Legislative Assembly for Queenstown, but there

was not even a letter of acknowledgement to all  my

letters.  Let the Government take serious  note  of

this discourtesy on the part of civil servants, and

take   appropriate  disciplinary   action   against

whoever is responsible. [Laughter] The Minister for

Finance  laughs,  but  let the  P.A.P. remember  its

election pledge to run a courteous civil service in

1959.  What has happened? Are civil servants to  be

discourteous   to  the  people  by  not   answering

enquiries from the public and from Members  of  the

Legislative Assembly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to touch at length on many of

the other subjects. I shall lease most of the other

subjects  to my other colleagues. They are subjects

like  the pro-colonial policies of the P.A.P. which

will  be the subject of another motion standing  in

my name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Legislative Assembly have had an

enforced  long  vacation and, but for  the  popular

pressure - in  spite of what the Prime  Minister  has

said - for the recall of the Legislative  Assembly,

the  P.A.P. would have given us a longer  enforced

vacation.  An  air of uncertainty is ever  present,

and  it  is  more so today than yesterday,  because

repression



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



has  come,  and  there may be more  repressions  to

come. The P.A.P. says that there will not be an air

of  excitement and uncertainty, but on the contrary

I say that the air is full of uncertainty, and that

this   uncertainty   increases   with   the   daily

development of the international situation.  It  is

so  uncertain,  in fact, that millions  of  dollars

have  gone  to  Hongkong  already.  This  has  been

reported in Newsweek and in the Straits' Times. How

can such uncertainty give rise to any confidence in

the  people, as is mentioned in the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's speech? In column 4 of Hansard dated  27th

March,  1963, it says, "All is calm and  tranquil."

Obviously then, Sir, there was no justification for

the  recent  mass arrests. That the P.A.P. had  to

resort  to  arrests clearly shows  that  the  P.A.P.

cannot  compete with the Barisan Sosialis  for  the

support of the people. The P.A.P. has failed in the

open argument, and has not, as is alleged in column

5, won the open argument. If there was seven months

of peace and tranquility, as is mentioned in column

5,  and yet there were arrests two months ago, then

it clearly exposes the deceit and Fascist nature of

the  P.A.P.  The sham referendum on 1st  September,

1962,  merely exposed the deceit of the P.A.P. yet

further.  The  colonialists and their PAP, stooges

have  made  use  of the false result  of  the  sham

referendum  to  deceive the world  about  the  true

situation  in  Singapore.  And  similarly  has  the

Internal  Security Council made use of  this  false

result  as  an  excuse and pretext  for  repressive

action against uncompromising anti-colonialists and

anti-imperialists,   and  against   all   prominent

leaders who oppose Malaysia and the P.A.P. The  Prime

Minister  talks of the verdict of the  people.  But

let us see how the verdict was obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, the referendum was carried

out merely as a facade of democracy and of allowing

the  people  a  choice of alternatives  offered  to

them.  But  you will remember also. Sir,  that  the

people  were not allowed to say no, and  they  must

choose  one  of the three alternatives. And  voting

being compulsory, the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



had no way out, no means of abstention. Tearing  up

of  the  paper  would have meant imprisonment,  and

putting in a blank paper would also have meant  the

blank  paper  being considered as a  vote  for  the

Government.  Of  course, all this was  because  the

P.A.P.'s  intention was to coerce the  people  into

choosing the P.A.P. proposals and never to  give  a

chance  to  those  people who  opposed  the  P.A.P.

merger proposals. You will remember also, Sir, that

we  in  the Opposition had called on the people  to

cast  blank  votes in protest, and as the  campaign

proceeded,   it  became  obvious  from   the   huge

attendances   at   Opposition  parties   referendum

rallies and the empty attendances at the Government

Party  rallies that the vast majority of the people

would  cast  blank  votes in  protest  against  the

undemocratic  and  dishonest referendum.  Then  the

P.A.P. Government, knowing that they would fail and

would  morally lose at least, came out with  a  new

gimmick.  They  stated that blank votes  would  not

necessarily mean Government votes, but  could  mean

the  loss of citizenship for more than half of  the

people  of Singapore. Big headlines, Sir,  screamed

"Blank  votes mean loss of citizenship". The  Prime

Minister made a speech in Fullerton Square  and  it

was  broadcast and re-broadcast over  Radio  P.A.P.

and  Rediffusion  four  or  five  times.  Moreover,

rumours  were started by the P.A.P. that  the  vote

was not secret because of the number on the back of

the  ballot paper, and discovery of those who  cast

blank  votes would mean loss of citizenship rights,

like loss of jobs, 1icences, passports, housing and

schooling  facilities, welfare aid and  other  such

like dire consequences. Finally, to cap it all,  on

Polling Day voters were directed by supervisors  of

polling  stations  specifically  to  put  a   cross

against  one of the three alternatives. The  voters

were  told that they must cast votes with  a  cross

and not cast blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, Sir, the result of the

referendum was a foregone conclusion. Nevertheless,

despite all this, 25 per cent came out courageously

in  the  face of Government intimidation  and  cast

blank  votes. Later many who had been coerced  into

putting in votes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



for  Alternative  A came to tell us  of  the  split

voting in families. Parents had to vote Alternative

A  and sons and daughters voted blank. Husbands had

voted  A  and  wives had voted blank. This  was  to

insure  against the Government really carrying  out

its   threats.  Thus,  if  one  was   deprived   of

citizenship rights as a result of casting  a  blank

vote, the other member of the family would be  able

to  say that he or she had voted for A and so would

still  be able to claim facilities that could  only

be  claimed by citizens. The result of 70 per  cent

for Alternative A, therefore, did not truly reflect

the will of the people of Singapore. They voted for

A  not  because  they wanted A,  but  because  they

feared  B. And thus the P.A.P. Government  achieved

its  purpose through the undemocratic and dishonest

referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am a bit puzzled about this

expression,     "undemocratic     and     dishonest

referendum". The hon. Member does know, of  course,

that  the  referendum was held under the provisions

of the Referendum Ordinance, and if this expression

"undemocratic   and   dishonest   referendum"   has

reference  to that referendum, in other words,  has

reference to the referendum as provided for by that

Ordinance, and the hon. Member is alleging that the

Ordinance    laid   down   something   which    was

undemocratic  and dishonest, then he is  casting  a

reflection  on the Assembly, and is completely  out

of  order. I ask him to be very careful about using

the expression in the course of his speech.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention, Sir, of

casting  any  aspersions on the House,  but  it  is

quite  clear  that to many of the  people  outside,

their opinion of the referendum is just what I have

said,  and  I am merely reflecting the opinion  and

views  of  the  vast  majority  of  the  people  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In that case, if the hon.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, to prove that the

result  of the referendum was false, let me  inform

the House of two referendum surveys carried out  by

Nanyang  University students and the University  of

Singapore  Socialist Club students. Two  referendum

surveys  were  carried  out - one  was  in  Tanjong

Pagar.  We  had  referred to that earlier.  In  the

referendum  survey of Tanjong Pagar,  one  straight

question  was posed to the people. They were  asked

whether  they would accept or reject the Government

White  Paper merger proposals. All they were  asked

to  do  was  to say yes or no. And the result  came

back,  90 per cent no, 6 per cent yes, and a 2  per

cent  here and a 2 per cent there. That was in  the

case  of  Tanjong  Pagar, the constituency  of  the

Prime  Minister  himself. But I do not  think  this

House  has  a  record of the results of  the  other

survey  referendum  that was  carried  out  in  the

constituency of Kreta Ayer, the constituency of the

Finance  Minister.  In that referendum  survey  the

questions posed were exactly as those posed by  the

Government on Referendum Day. That is to say, three

questions were posed to them - A, B and C.  And  this

is  the  result  of  that survey carried  out  just

before the referendum in 1962. Those who voted  for

Alternative A, that is, the White Paper  proposals,

106  votes,  and  it works out to  1.26  per  cent.

Alternative B, 93 votes, 1.10 per cent. Alternative

C, 16 votes, and it works out to 0.19 per cent. The

blanks 8,186 votes, and that works out to 97.13 per

cent.  Spoilt votes, 27, and it works out to  0.32

per  cent.  The  total number of votes  was  8,428. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> From this, Sir, you will see

that  the referendum that was actually carried  out

on  the  1st of September, 1962, never did  reflect

the  will and desire of the people freely expressed

as  stipulated  in  the United Nations  Resolutions

1514  and 1541, for the ascertaining of the  wishes

of  the people on their constitutional future.  The

majority  opinion  of the people in  Singapore  has

never   been   truly  ascertained   in   the   sham

referendum, and we urge the Government to ascertain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



honestly  the  views of the people of Singapore  on

their constitutional future in accordance with  the

United Nations Resolutions 1514 and 1541.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of the various efforts of the

colonial power to form pro-Malaysia parties in  the

Borneo  territories  and now  even  a  pro-Malaysia

Grand  Alliance, it is clear that the  majority  of

the  people  do not want Malaysia. In Sarawak,  the

Sarawak  United  People's Party  is  still  solidly

against  Malaysia in spite of the arrests  and  the

attempts  to  brand the Party as a  Communist-front

organisation.   In   Brunei,   the   intensity   of

opposition to Malaysia has already resulted in open

revolt and guerilla warfare. Only in Sabah can they

claim  some support for Malaysia, and this is  more

apparent  than real. The people in Sabah have  been

intimidated  by communal fears into  voicing  their

support  for  Malaysia following  the  Philippines'

claim to Sabah and the uprising in Brunei. Even  in

the Federation itself, Sir, there is today a united

opposition  to  Malaysia, comprising all  political

Parties in the Opposition. I mention all this  only

in  passing to show that, in truth and in fact, the

majority of the people oppose Malaysia not only  in

the  Borneo territories, but also in Malaya itself.

The  powers-that-be can easily ascertain the  views

of  the  people. The Borneo territories have  asked

for  a plebiscite, and neutral bodies, like Malayan

student   bodies  in  the  United   Kingdom,   have

similarly  asked  for a plebiscite,  to  truthfully

ascertain the views of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In column six of the Hansard of 27th March, 1963,

Sir,  it says that the Afro-Asian nations have  now

understood what Malaysia is all about. I can assure

you,  Sir, since my recent trip to London,  all  or

most of the Afro-Asian nations know the true nature

of  Malaysia.  Previously colonial and  P.A.P. and

Federation  propaganda has been telling  the  world

that  there is very little opposition to  Malaysia,

that  the  majority of the people are for Malaysia.

When  I  showed them pictures of rallies  that  had

supported  us, they were simply shocked.  I  showed

them the pictures of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



battle of rallies where the P.A.P.-dominated unions

had  a  rally in the Happy World stadium and  where

our  unions had a rally in the Jalan Besar Stadium.

They just could not believe it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Have another one!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Now that he says it, let the

Government  give  permission to us  early  and  not

delay us when we ask for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read to you, Sir, the resolution of the

Afro-Asian nations in Moshi, Tanganyika, the  place

where the P.A.P. tried to gate-crash uninvited into

the   Conference.  And  the  resolution,   although

watered  down to a certain extent, still says  very

interesting things, and I read it out here for  the

record. This resolution is on North Kalimantan.  It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The 3rd Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference

meeting  in Tanganyika Town of Moshi from  February

4th  to  11th, 1963, fervently greets the delegates

of  fighting North Kalimantan people and  expresses

full  support  for the just struggle of  the  North

Kalimantan  people  against  the  neo-colonialists.

This  Conference appeals to Afro-Asian  governments

and peoples in general to render their full support

to  the  struggle of the people of North Kalimantan

against   any   federation  which  is   now   being

intensively  imposed  by the  imperialists  in  co-operation  with their agents and to  recognise  the

newly proclaimed full independence of the people of

North Kalimantan.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more paragraph, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We appeal to and urge all freedom-loving peoples

of  the  world to take definite measures to  oppose

the  reactionary actions of the British  Government

in  sending  armed troops to fight and repress  the

struggle  for  full independence of the  people  of

North Kalimantan.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is one of the resolutions in Moshi,

where the P.A.P. tried, so unsuccessfully, to gate-crash into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why point -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Minister can have

plenty  of time to reply. He need not be so anxious

and so eager.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia, as admitted by the P.A.P. in the

speech   here,  has  already  given  rise  to   the

confrontation   policy  of  our  great   neighbour,

Indonesia,  and  instead of  peace  and  stability,

there is already repression, strife, and threats to

peace  in  South-East Asia. Malaysia is  a  British

plot  to  prolong colonial domination in South-East

Asia. Malaysia is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



only  the  political aspect of the British Military

Far  East Unified Command, which covers exactly the

same five territories. It is, in fact, an extension

of  the  working  room of SEATO,  and  consequently

Malaysia is opposed by Indonesia and the other Afro-Asian  nations.  The only way to  restore  friendly

relations with Indonesia, and also the Philippines,

and  to  maintain peace and security in  South-East

Asia is to scrap Malaysia, abandon Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we know that this is not within the

power  of the P.A.P. Government. The P.A.P. leaders

have  only  found  this Malaysian  Plan  attractive

because  of selfish and personal reasons. The  role

of the P.A.P. Ministers all along has been the role

of stooges and flunkeys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in column 6, it says in the last paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... our destiny is irrevocably interwoven with that

of Malaysia.'



<br><br>Sir,  let me say this: the destiny of Singapore  is

not  irrevocably interwoven with that of  Malaysia.

But  for  the  fact  of being  ruled  by  the  same

colonial power, the Borneo territories have nothing

in  common with Malaya, that is, the Federation and

Singapore.  The  Borneo territories  are  separated

from  Malaya by 300 miles of sea. The eastern  part

of  Sabah  is  more than 1,000 miles  from  Malaya.

Apart  from  British colonial rule, therefore,  the

Borneo  territories  have  little  in  common  with

Malaya.  Their  natural links-if we  must  talk  of

links-are  more  with Indonesia.  And  as  for  the

people  of Singapore, our demand, ever since  1948,

when  Britain separated us from the rest of Malaya,

has  been for re-unification. But unfortunately the

present  White Paper merger proposals and  Malaysia

do  not give us a brotherly reunion. They are meant

to  accentuate differences, and may even create new

ones,  amongst us and amongst the various  communal

components of our country. They are meant to  delay

still  further the re-unification of Singapore  and

the Federation into a genuine Malayan nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already colonial repression has taken place as a

result  of the Malaysian Plan. Surely this  is  not

what the people had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



elected  the  P.A.P. in 1959 for. The P.A.P. leaders

should  forget  their own vested  interests.  Those

words, Sir, are in column 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have a vested interest in Malaysia...'.



<br><br>I  ask  the  P.A.P. leaders to  forget  their  own

personal  vested interests and really endeavour  to

help  the people to fight the basic problems facing

Singapore today, the problems of poverty,  disease,

ignorance, and want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. must admit that in spite of all their

opening  of new industrial enterprises every  other

week  they  have not done anything to  relieve  the

unemployment problem in Singapore. I do not have to

repeat  again the arguments which completely expose

the  false propaganda claim of "prosperity  through

Malaysia", "Independence through Malaysia".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kee Hui, Chairman of the Sarawak United People's Party, and one-time member of the Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee, and a one-time active supporter of Malaysia, today calls the slogan of "Independence through Malaysia" a myth. Many who have been misled by colonial propaganda, and today support Malaysia, will also one day wake

up  as Mr Ong Kee Hui has woken up. They will then

see  through  the falsity of P.A.P. propaganda  and

curse the P.A.P. for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as a result of party interests having been

involved,  the P.A.P. leaders already realise  that

they  have  sold Singapore to the Federation  lock,

stock and barrel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Federation financial control will limit

and  restrict Singapore's development, both of  new

enterprises and of expanding recurrent expenditures

of  the Government. The Prime Minister has admitted

as  much.  There is no promise of a Common  Market,

but  there  is already a call for extra burdens  by

the powers that be in the Federation. This call can

only  mean  ultimate  extra burdens  also  for  the

people  of  Singapore. As more and more expenditure

is used on the armed forces, this extra burden will

become  more  and  more  extra.  And  so  will  the

difficulties of the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



Singapore become more and more acute. Both rich and

poor will have to bear this extra burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of propaganda, the transfer of

television from the Ministry of Home Affairs to the

Ministry of Culture does not in any way prevent the

overall  Federation  control  over  the  radio   in

Singapore. The people of Singapore will not be able

to have a voice of their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In column 20, Sir, the Government says that "no

more  great issues divide the people". This is  not

true-completely not true. A great issue divides the

people. There is no greater issue that divides  the

people  today than the issue of Malaysia.  Malaysia

divides not only Members in this House but also the

people  in  the factories and in the workshops,  in

Government offices and business-houses, in  coffee-shops  and  eating-houses,  in  flats  and  in  the

streets, in town and in the country. [Interruption]

Malaysia  divides the people not only in  Singapore

but  also in all the other territories that  go  to

form  the proposed Malaysia. It divides the  people

in  the  whole  of South-East Asia - 140  million  of

them. With such a division - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been listening to

unseemly noises coming from the Front Bench of  the

Government side. I would suggest that the Ministers

give  the  Member for Queenstown an opportunity  of

saying what he wishes to say without interruption.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you, Sir,I was saying,

with  such a division of the people, national unity

is  not  possible. Moreover, the sense  of  oneness

disappears  when barriers are erected  between  the

various territories to limit freedom of travel  and

to   prevent  so-called  Malaysian  citizens   from

participating fully in the political  life  of  the

nation  as a whole. Instead, there is today  mutual

suspicion,  mutual  fear and  even  hatred.  Should

Britain  so unwisely still impose Malaysia  on  the

people against their will it can only last so  long

as  there are British bayonets and jets around. But

this  will mean a heavy price in blood and material

for all concerned. I ask the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Ministers,  "Is  this  necessary:  is  this

wise?".  The failure of the Federation  of  Central

Africa clearly shows us that without the support of

the   majority  of  the  people,  Malaysia   cannot

succeed: it must fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great talk of Communism in the Prime

Minister's  speech. It is a talk which  the  P.A.P.

has  always been interested in. I think I might  as

well  leave this subject to the motion for the mass

arrests  when  the  question of Communism  will  be

fully  discussed. But I say, with all  the  ominous

danger signals before us, let the P.A.P. not  drift

still  further  away from the straight  and  narrow

path   of  service  to  the  people.  The  national

interests of the people must come before Party  and

personal   interests  and  before  foreign   vested

interests. The people of Singapore have  no  vested

interests  in Malaysia. It is the British  Imperial

Chief-of-Stall  and the Forces he  represents  that

have  vested  interests in Malaysia.  General  Hull

publicly stated that Britain is 500 per cent behind

Malaysia.  This alone shows whose vested  interests

are involved in Malaysia - definitely not the vested

interests  of the people of Singapore.  The  vested

interests  of the people of Singapore  lie  in  the

reunification,  as I have said, of  the  Federation

and   Singapore   into   a  genuinely   democratic,

independent Malaya, free of foreign troops and free

of  foreign control. All of us in Malaya, that  is,

in  Singapore  and the Federation, irrespective  of

race,  colour or creed, are members of one  family.

Therefore, before finally committing the  fate  and

destiny  of  1.7  million people  to  the  British-sponsored  Malaysian  Plan, let  the  P.A.P. first

pause  and  genuinely  and honestly  ascertain  the

views of the people on their constitutional future.

Better  still, let the House demand that the United

Kingdom  Government abandon the Malaysian Plan  and

proposed transfer of sovereignty over Singapore  to

the  Federation  as  part of  that  Plan.  Let  all

political     detainees    be     forthwith     and

unconditionally released and let this  be  followed

by   general   elections   fairly   conducted   and

supervised not by the P.A.P. ---

constitutionally only so long as  there  are  means

look  as if the P.A.P. is trying its level best  to

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we Members of this

Assembly, over the past six months, have not had  a

chance  to  debate  like  players  playing   in   a

badminton or a golf game. Similarly, it is with  my

case,  because of lack of practice it  is  possible

that  I  am  a  bit  rusty today.  However,  in  my

opinion,  to quote from the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, the most important thing which  we

are  faced  with at the present moment is  not  the

question  of  how many houses and how  many  stand-pipes have been put up or roads built, but the most

vital  thing is the problem of Malaysia. If it  was

important last year, it is even more important this

year  because  at the latest, by the  31st  August,

Malaysia  will  be  formed. However  much,  however

bitter, the opposition by political Parties in this

country, particularly from the Barisan Sosialis and

its   colleagues  in  the  united  front  Communist

organisations.  I am confident that  Malaysia  will

positively be formed. At the same time,  a  feeling

of  regret has emerged, not only from my Party  but

from  all  the  people of Singapore, after  hearing

speeches  from  the Government over  the  past  few

months   which   have   created   a   feeling    of

provincialism towards Singapore. Such  speeches.  I

think,   should  not  have  been  uttered  by   the

Government,  because if we are really keen  to  see

Malaysia come into being at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



this  moment,  we should avoid such  sentiments  of

provincialism because it Will create  an  unhealthy

atmosphere  and  may  lead to a  chaotic  state  in

Singapore. I do not know the reasons why the  Prime

Minister has uttered such a note, but I am sure  he

must  have reasonable grounds for doing so.  On  my

part, however, I feel that questions of eggs, ducks

and  poultry  and  so  on do not  affect  Singapore

alone, because in the future Malaysia, what happens

in Singapore will be the responsibility of not only

the   Singapore  Government  but  also  the  future

Malaysian  Government. If the people  of  Singapore

face  hardships, or the people of Brunei  or  North

Borneo  face  similar hardships, that problem  will

not only be borne by the respective Governments but

will  also  be  the  common responsibility  of  the

Central  Government.  And we  should  assist  every

citizen  in  that particular territory to  overcome

his difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the speeches made by the Prime

Minister  which  I have read in the newspapers,  to

the effect that because the stand of the Government

of  Singapore  is correct, therefore  there  is  no

dispute between the Government of Singapore and the

Republic of Indonesia, bring no good at all  except

to  widen the gap between the position of Singapore

vis-a-vis  the Federation Government. I go  to  the

Federation frequently and I mix not only with their

leaders but also with the people of the Federation.

The  people there doubt the stand of the Government

of  Singapore. I would like to advise the Singapore

Government,   when  making  speeches  relating   to

Malaysia or to any aspect of the administration  of

the Singapore Government not to make speeches which

will  lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction not only

from  the  people of Singapore but  also  from  the

people  of  the  territories  which  will  comprise

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech I was pleased to hear that the financial position of the Government today is healthy to the extent that it has a surplus of millions of dollars, which is all for the good of the State. Therefore, I wish to appeal to the Government, just as I had made a similar appeal last year, to

reconsider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



the  question of the arbitrary cuts in C.O.L.A. of

Government servants which was carried out in  1959.

Although   the  Government  has  made   a   partial

restoration in the allowances, in my opinion, there

should be a full restoration. If the P.A.P. and its

leaders, especially the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the Minister for Culture who is also the leader  of

the  trade  unions, are brave enough to  fight  for

increased wages and better conditions of  work  for

workers,   then   it  follows  that   it   is   the

responsibility of the Government to look after  its

own  public  servants.  I appeal  because,  in  the

speech of His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

mention  is made of the financial position  of  the

Government  of  Singapore which  is  in  a  healthy

state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, concerning education, I wish

to  draw  the  attention of the Government  to  the

subject of textbooks. Each year at the beginning of

the  school  session parents are  unhappy  because,

firstly,  they  find it difficult to buy  textbooks

for  their children; but the most important is  the

change of the textbooks. If a pupil this year is in

Form 3, the books which he uses this year cannot be

used the following year in the same form. New books

will  be used. This not only applies to one  school

but to all schools throughout Singapore. Therefore,

it  means that every year textbooks are changed. If

in Form 3 a white-cover book is used, for instance,

next  year  Form  3 will use a book  with  a  black

cover.  This  is cause for concern to parents  from

the  financial point of view, especially those with

a large number of dependants to support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns housing.

Although Government has erected thousands of houses

and  such houses are beautiful, there exists a more

important   and  urgent  problem  which  Government

should  give  attention to and that  is  the  lands

belonging  to landowners in Singapore for  building

houses for sale. The position in Singapore is  that

landowners  prefer  to build multi-storeyed  flats,

and  they will make huge profits out of such flats,

so  that the result is that the squatters will have

to be evicted and these squatters face difficulties

and they have no place to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



put  up  their  grievance.  This  has  happened  in

Kampong  Amber where a landowner is about to  build

flats  and  the squatters there have to be  evicted

and  they have no alternative accommodation. I hope

the  Government  will have them all  assistance  by

whatever  means. If I might be permitted to  put  a

suggestion  to the Government, I suggest  that  the

Government set up a Re-housing Board just  as  they

have  set up a Rent Conciliation Board, where  such

matters  can  be  thrashed out and that  board  can

become the third party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important matter, Mr Speaker. Just now I

was dwelling on general matters and not on specific

matters. Now I would like to deal with the position

of   the  Malays  in  Singapore  and  I  hope   the

Government  will give serious consideration  to  my

speech.    Mr   Speaker,   Singapore   has    been

administered according to the Constitution which we

approved  in  1958  where there is  enunciated  the

special   position  of  the  Malays  in  Singapore.

Although  it is contained in the Preamble  that  it

shall  be  the responsibility of the Government  of

Singapore  to care for the interests of the  Malays

in   all  spheres  and  to  assist  them  in  their

language,  economy  and culture - Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

four  years have elapsed since the P.A.P. came  to

power in Singapore - but in my opinion, what has been

enshrined  in the Preamble of the Constitution  has

not  been  fully implemented by the Government  and

has been the cause of dissatisfaction to the Malays

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to debate the subject one point at a

time.  First,  on the subject of Malay settlements.

In addition to the settlement at Jalan Eunos, there

are other areas which have been gazetted, including

Kaki  Bukit, Sembawang, Pasir Panjang, Ayer Gemuroh

and Jurong. In these areas which have been gazetted

as  Malay settlements, only one area, that  is  the

Kaki  Bukit  area,  has been  fully  developed  and

building lots allocated to Malays. However, in  the

case  of Pasir Panjang, Ayer Gemuroh and Sembawang,

nothing  has  been done and I know that  many  have

submitted their applications, but it is unfortunate

that Government have made no attempt to develop the

land and allocate building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



lots  to applicants on the waiting list. The  Prime

Minister has said that the Malays prefer to live in

houses  with compounds where they can rear poultry.

He  has further stated that in areas which are near

the  City area, land cannot be made available,  but

land can be made available in the rural areas.  But

I  know  the areas I have mentioned, such  as  Ayer

Gemuroh, Pasir Panjang and Sembawang. Although they

are  a  great  distance from the city,  many  Malay

applicants  have  submitted their applications  but

Government  has no immediate programme to  allocate

building  sites.  Also on the subject  of  housing,

this  has  been touched upon by the Prime  Minister

who says that the Malays have no liking to live  in

fiats  and  they  prefer to live in  kampongs.  The

Malays  like  to live in flats in Singapore  if  we

observe the housing estates built in Queenstown and

Mountbatten  Road.  I  see  that  many  Malays  are

occupying these flats. They are military and police

personnel; so that, to me, I think the Malays  have

no  objection to living in flats. But there is  one

major obstacle. The Malays are of Islamic faith. If

they  live  in fiats, they have to mix freely  with

non-Muslims  like  Chinese  or  Indians.   If   the

Government  can give an assurance that out  of  ten

blocks  of  fiats,  one or two  can  be  set  aside

specially for the Malays, I am confident  that  the

Malays  will live in them; the idea being that  the

occupants of a complete block of flats will  be  of

Muslim religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point concerning special rights is

education. I congratulate the Government on  having

built  two Malay secondary schools, one at Aljunied

Road  and the other at Mountbatten Road.  It  is  a

long-term  programme  of  which  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Prime Minister is aware. But these

secondary schools pose a big problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the problem of textbooks. Parents are not

only  unable to afford textbooks, but there is also

the  problem  of  making available  to  them  Malay

textbooks.   This   difficulty   is   also    being

experienced  by schools in the Federation.  I  hope

the  Government,  with the formation  of  Malaysia,

will co-operate with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



the  Education Ministry, Federation of  Malaya,  so

that  the  standard  of  textbooks  used  in  Malay

secondary  schools will be of the same standard  as

that used in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point concerns language. Here also it

is  a  matter  of regret. One of my colleagues  has

already  raised  this  problem.  That  is  to  say,

although the Government have declared publicly that

Malay  has become the national language and one  of

the official languages in Singapore, the Government

have  not  taken positive steps whereby  Malay  can

ultimately  be  the national and the sole  official

language.  For  instance,  in  the  Federation   of

Malaya, annual monthly language campaigns are being

conducted  for  the  purpose  of  promoting   Malay

especially to non-Malays, but here in Singapore  no

such campaigns have been planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point concerns assistance to Sekolah

Rakyat.  This  has been in force from the  previous

Government,  which  had rendered  help  to  Sekolah

Rakyat  (people's  schools). The  rules  then  were

slightly relaxed. The requirements insisted upon by

the  Education Ministry now are rather  rigid.  For

instance,  the  provision of  sanitary  and  health

conditions.  The  school building must  conform  to

certain  standards. There have  been  many  grouses

from  the  management  of  these  schools  because,

before  Government could give assistance  to  them,

strict  conditions were imposed to the extent  that

the  money given to such schools could not be  used

for  the purpose of defraying the salaries  of  the

teachers.  When  the accounts of  the  schools  are

submitted to the Education Ministry, it is required

that  the  auditors must be qualified auditors.  We

know  that  qualified auditors charge a minimum  of

$100 for fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerning the special privileges of

the  Malays  is  aid  in the  economic  field.  Mr

Speaker,  everyone who reads the Utusan Melayu  and

the  Straits Times during the past week  must  have

noticed  that there has been heated debate  between

the  Utusan Melayu and the Straits Times as to  how

to  help the economy of Malays in the Federation as

well  as  in Singapore. Even more so the Malays  in

Singapore because it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



is  enshrined in the Constitution of Singapore that

the  Government  should  help  the  Malays  in  the

economic   field.   For  four  years   the   P.A.P.

Government have assumed office, but the question of

aid  to  the Malays in the economic field  has  not

been  given  proper  attention,  except  that  free

education has been given to the Malays from primary

to university level, and of course the distribution

of  goats to the people in the Southern Islands.  I

hear  that on one island only male goats have  been

distributed.  There is not a single  she-goat.  Mr

Speaker,   the   question  of  Malay   economy   is

important. My suggestion is not aimed at  producing

more  Malay directors of this or that company,  but

with  a view to assisting, to uplifting the economy

of   the  Malays.  The  Government  can  raise  the

economic status of the Malays and one way of  doing

this  is for the Government, if possible, to  train

Malays  in factories which are being built  on  the

Jurong Industrial site. I hope the Government  will

use  their  good  offices to persuade  the  factory

directors to take in more Malays so that  they  can

be   trained   to   hold   top   posts   in   these

establishments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way by which Government can help the

Malays is to build small factories where Government

can  provide capital on a 50-50 basis. Let  us  not

think  that the Malays in Singapore cannot  provide

the  capital needed. On the whole, the earnings  of

the  Malays  in  Singapore are favourable  compared

with  those of the Malays in the Federation, if  we

observe  ten  houses  occupied  by  Malays  in  the

Federation,  we  see  that only  two  have  radios,

whereas in Singapore, out of ten houses occupied by

Malays, ten of them have radios: and now television

too, so that the income of the Malays in Singapore,

in  fact,  is more than that of the income  of  the

Malays  in  the  Federation. If the Government  can

build  small-scale factories where Government  will

provide  the capital on a 50-50 basis, I  think  we

can   encourage   the  Malays  to  participate   in

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another method whereby we can promote Malay

economy  is - I  refer  this  to  the  Minister   for

Finance - to   set  up  investment  firms.   In   the

Federation  this  has  been done  and  it  has  the

support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Government.  The  directors  comprise  two

Government   servants  and  two  or  three   others

nominated by the Government from among the  Malays.

In  Singapore  the Malays cannot use such  benefits

because  we  are not citizens of the Federation  of

Malaya. If the Government can set up such firms,  I

think  this will certainly go a long way to  assist

the  Malays  in Singapore. Certainly the Government

will  tell  us - will tell me because I put  up  this

proposal - that the P.A.P. is a socialist Government

and  according  to the principle of  socialism,  it

cannot  engage itself in a capitalist  system.  Mr

Speaker, I think it is true. But if I may speak  on

facts,  the  P.A.P. claims itself to be  socialist.

But the policies that have been implemented are not

socialist;  they  are a mixture  of  socialism  and

capitalism.   The   P.A.P. is  fraternising   with

capitalists  from abroad in order to persuade  them

to  invest  their capital here. From the  long-term

point   of   view,  the  efforts  that  have   been

undertaken by the P.A.P. Government to promote  and

to  raise  the standard of living of the Malays  in

Singapore, especially in respect of education,  are

good  but  we can see the fruits, say, in the  next

10, 15 or 30 years. At this crucial moment, what do

the  P.A.P. Government intend to do to promote  the

Malays  economically? Let the Government not  think

that  because  they  claim  they  are  a  Socialist

Government,   they  cannot  engage  in   capitalist

activities.  If the Government are not  willing  to

give  serious consideration to this problem,  I  am

afraid    there   will   arise   a    feeling    of

dissatisfaction  among  the  Malays  in  Singapore,

which  will in turn create problems which we cannot

overcome.    I   would   like   to    advise    the

Government - after they have been in power  for  four

years,  because  I know that the  P.A.P. are  also

awaiting  the  formation of Malaysia - to  adopt  the

suggestions I have put forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning my own constituency, Geylang Serai,

originally  there  were  many  objections  to   the

Geylang Serai Project because the inhabitants  were

not  aware  of  the true object of the  Government.

However, those people who supported the Project did

so on certain conditions. One of the conditions is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



that  the hawkers who have been plying their  trade

will  now  be assured of a pitch after the  Geylang

Serai   Project  materialises.  Secondly,   evicted

families   from   Geylang  Serai  must   be   given

accommodation in the flats to be built.  This  also

has  been  promised by the Government. Thirdly - and

this  is most important - when evicted persons have

been  allocated  flats or shophouses,  I  hope  the

Government will give an opportunity of ranting  the

unallocated flats or shophouses to the Malays. As I

explained  earlier, the area has been predominantly

a  Malay area for decades, and, therefore,  I  hope

the  unallocated stalls or flats will be  allocated

to Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, if you, Mr Speaker, have been

following  the position of the Malays in  Singapore

from   the   point   of  view  of   the   Singapore

Constitution,  I regret to say that the  Government

have not carried out their responsibilities towards

the  Malays in Singapore as is required of them  in

the  Singapore  Constitution. However,  on  my  own

part,  I  wish  to  say that, on  the  question  of

education,   I  congratulate  the  Government   for

carrying  out  their responsibilities  towards  the

Malays as they have promised - the only one.

nearer to the closing scenes, we cannot help

feeling  touched to see the last days of this  once

us  that no miracle can save this P.A.P. Government

from  doom,  not  even  a  miraculous  victory   in

Sembawang - and victory is doubtful - nor a  second

mass  swoop of political opponents, even  detaining

<br><br>7.23 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government's policy speech reads like a funeral oration. There was not the bounce and the note of absolute confidence that were in the speech in the First Session of the Assembly, with 43 seats on the Government side. The tone and the language have changed with each

subsequent  Session. During the  beginning  of  the

Second Session, the number of Government seats  was

reduced  to  40;  at  the beginning  of  the  Third

Session,  13 Members defected from the P.A.P.;  and

in  this final Session, the P.A.P. Government  with

only  25  Members, having lost their  mandate,  are

living from day to day on the charity of the S.P.A.-Alliance which it despises. The last policy  speech

of  the P.A.P. Government was empty, lifeless,  but

full  of  veiled  threats. It was  couched  in  the

language and the tone of a Government that has been

defeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are finished. The flock might now know

where  the  future lies, but not the  shepherd.  We

must   give  the  shepherd  some  credit  for   his

political  knowledge and his grasp  of  the  ground

position,  however  superficial  it  may  be.   The

shepherd knows that the P.A.P. ship is heading  for

the rocks. Once the ship is piloted along the wrong

course,  it  will eventually hit the rocks  and  no

amount of whitewashing of the ship can save it from

disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ground position is this. Being

responsible  for  the  assessment  of  the   ground

position  for  the  City Council  and  the  general

elections, I think I can speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



with some authority on the situation. There is  now

not  one single constituency in Singapore that  the

P.A.P. can claim as a safe seat - not even one,  Sir.

Not  even  Sembawang can be claimed as a safe  seat

despite  its being nurtured for nearly  four  years

with  the  greatest investment  per  voter  in  the

provision of water, light, street-lights, telephone

booths, rural roads and various other amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of the P.A.P. are therefore numbered. One

thing with the P.A.P. leadership is that they  talk

of  democracy  but never practise  it.  The  P.A.P.

leadership  is incapable of tolerating a democratic

Opposition and of gracefully withdrawing  from  the

scene  when  their time is up. The irony  that  the

democratic  Opposition can survive in Singapore  is

because   there   are   three  Governments   making

decisions  upon our future, namely,  the  Singapore

Government,   the   British  Government   and   the

Federation  Government. Whatever we might  disagree

with   the   policies  of  the  present  Federation

Government, we must say that it is more capable  of

tolerating  a  democratic  Opposition.  The  P.A.P.

leadership  is different. It comprises of  men  who

refuse   to   understand  the   true   meaning   of

competition  for  political leadership  within  the

democratic  framework. Never  have  we  seen  in  a

democratic  system  the vast array  of  weapons  of

oppression, suppression and victimisation being  so

fully developed and deployed to crush all political

opposition. The Lim Yew Hock Government looks  like

a  dwarf in this respect. Therefore, in this three-power control over Singapore, the mockery of it  is

that  the Singapore Government is the most vicious.

Personal  feelings  are mixed with  differences  of

Party  policies;  political treachery  is  combined

with  ruthlessness: arrogance is blended  with  the

capacity to twist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this background that we should read

into  the deeper meaning of the Government's policy

speech. It painted to us a gloomy picture of  black

clouds  hanging  over the horizon. The  self-styled

"saviour   of  democracy"  was  in  the   forefront

fighting to save us from the "enemies of democracy"

like Saint George fighting the Dragon in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



save  England. Sir, it was this same Saint  George,

as  late as March 1961, before he was canonised, in

his  own  self-confession, who told us he regularly

held  meetings  with the Dragon.  Although  I  have

known Saint George before he was canonised, it  was

the  first time I heard of the Dragon. The  picture

of  darkness  and  gloom  outlined  in  the  policy

speech,  is in our opinion, meant to condition  the

minds  of the people, and lay the spade-work for  a

second mass swoop before the general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming months will be interesting as we watch

events   unfolding  themselves  with  even  greater

speed.  If  in  the by-election of  Sembawang,  the

P.A.P. by a stroke of good fortune happen to  win,

then  we  can  expect  general  elections  for  the

Singapore   State   Assembly,   under    the    new

Constitution  within the Malaysian Plan  framework,

to  come  soon after, but if the P.A.P. lose  this

seat in the by-election, then we can expect to  see

more  P.A.P. mischief and more magic  shows  being

directed  and performed, and the general  elections

indefinitely  postponed, until  the  S.P.A-Alliance

considers it-ripe enough, in its own interests,  to

withdraw  its  support, topple the  Government  and

force the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore time for us to draw a balance-sheet of the P.A.P. Never has a Government lost

popular support within such a short space of  time.

Long  before the defeat of the P.A.P. in  the  Hong

Lim  and Anson by-elections, they had already  lost

the  masses. The results of rolling of the two  by-elections were only manifestations of the  shifting

of  ground which happened long before the  two  by-elections.   The  P.A.P.  Government  lost   public

confidence  very  rapid1y  after  they  formed  the

Government.  The  masses voted the  P.A.P. on  the

record of the City Council work. It turned out that

the  Lee  Kuan Yew government was not much  better,

after  all,  than the Lim Yew Hock Government.  The

masses  soon  lost  their confidence.  They  became

disillusioned.  Political parties are  like  banks.

Once  a  bank  publicly cheats  its  customers,  no

amount of publicity or inducements will be able  to

restore  public confidence for customers  to  place

deposits  with  it.  Despite the  Prime  Minister's

visits to the rural constituencies,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



despite   the   fanfare,    despite    the

entertainment and the publicity, all  these  things

will  not  be able to revive the PA.P.  The  P.A.P.

leaders   may  be  able  to  deceive  the   British

representatives  that it commands popular  support.

The British representatives are not in contact with

the  ordinary men who make up the sum total of  the

electorate.  The British might be easily  persuaded

to  believe  that once the Member for Hong  Lim  is

detained, though ridiculous it would seem to be  as

he  has  also  been a former member  of  that  most

exclusive club, the Internal Security Council,  the

ground  is open for contest only between the  Prime

Minister and the Member for Cairnhill, and in  this

contest the P.A.P. thinks, but with which I beg  to

differ from them, that it will win.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the elections to come, people will vote

for  any other Party, or even Independents, but not

the  P.A.P.  The  ability to twist  and  turn  both

inside  and  outside this Chamber is no  substitute

for  consistency  in politics. In this  connection,

Sir,  it  must be remembered that once the  British

supported the Progressives. The Progressives  lost.

It  later  switched its support to the  S.P.A.  The

S.P.A. lost. Now it is betting on the P.A.P. and,

from  the  nature  of things, he whom  the  British

supports  will  lose. I must say that  the  British

have great powers of auto-suggestion. They read the

Straits  Times.  They listened to sweet-honey  talk

between   cocktails.  Unfortunately,  unlike   King

Midas,  whatever the British touched did  not  turn

into  gold,  but  instead relics for  the  national

museum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, let us take a lesson from

the failings of the P.A.P. Government. It tries  to

be  too  smart.  I has no consistent  policies.  It

plays  all sides. Having worked with the Communists

until  and  during  the Hong  Lim  by-election,  it

played   them  out.  Then  leading  the  Federation

leaders  up  the garden path, it tries to  sour  up

things at the last minute, trying to challenge  who

should   be  the  rent  collector  in  the   future

Singapore Government and making a big issue out  of

it, I would say for electioneering purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the P.A.P. Government is now fighting against

the  Federation  Government is  the  right  of  who

should  be  the rent collector. The P.A.P. is  now

having  false dreams after its visits to the  rural

constituencies that it can continue to be the  next

Government,   and   having   surrendered   to   the

Federation the meat earlier, namely, the  right  to

regulate  and decide our own financial and economic

policies,  it now wants to fight for the bones - to

be  a  rent collector, in other words. For it seems

to  them  now that unless this is being  done,  its

present Minister for Finance would lose his post if

the  P.A.P. really can have a second go. The P.A.P.

Government  is  now getting famous,  Sir,  for  its

double  talk  and its double face. There  are  many

examples  of this double face policies, and  double

talk  is  a dangerous game which is sure  of  being

caught in the end. I would not be surprised if  the

British  lion  one day got played out  too.  Double

talk, zigzagging, is a characteristic of the P.A.P.

leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the example of Malayan and Indonesian

relations.  What is the open and unequivocal  stand

of  the  Prime Minister of Singapore on this issue?

Indonesia's  verbal opposition to Malaysia  is  one

thing. But suppose Indonesia's confrontation policy

becomes  hot, and suppose it decides to  resort  to

military   force,  would  the  Prime  Minister   of

Singapore  still sit on the fence as  he  is  doing

now,  or would he openly come forward to rally  the

people of Singapore against any militant action  by

Indonesia?  What  happens to  our  so-called  great

patriot?  Why  is he so equivocal and non-committal

and   double-faced?  I  say  I   have   contributed

substantially  to  the  establishment  of  friendly

relations between Singapore and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in our Party programme, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  to  maintain friendly relations with all  our

neighbours. But I say that in the event we are ever

threatened with military action from Indonesia,  it

is  a  different  matter  altogether,  and  we,  as

Citizens of this country, no matter whether we  are

Malays  or Chinese, Indians or Eurasians,  must  be

prepared  to  stand up and defend it.  We  must  be

prepared  to state unequivocally our stand  despite

our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



opposition  to the terms and conditions of  merger.

Nothing. Sir, can save the P.A.P. now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talk of the Prime Minister just now of his

gigantic  projects - the  Outram  Gaol  scheme,   the

Johore  River  scheme, the Bedok  land  reclamation

scheme, this scheme, that scheme, brought in during

this final phase of the P.A.P. reign, are meant  to

deceive the people for electioneering purposes. The

lease  of life of the P.A.P. Government is so short

now  that  it can talk big, can talk of huge  giant

projects    without   having   to    assume    the

responsibility of implementing them or to  complete

them. None of this talk can deceive the people  and

help  to  resuscitate the P.A.P. There is  not  one

single  section   of the population  in  Singapore

which  now supports the P.A.P. Let us ask ourselves

which   section  of  the  population  in  Singapore

supports  the  P.A.P., whether they be  workers  or

farmers,  trishaw-riders or hawkers, civil servants

or shop-keepers, rich or poor. No single section of

the population has any more trust in the P.A.P. The

P.A.P. might  have  isolated support  from  a  few

individuals  in each section, from those  who  have

obtained   personal  benefits   from   the   P.A.P.

Government,  but the P.A.P. now has  lost  all  its

base.  Not  one section of the people is its  base.

Not  one single constituency among the 51 is a safe

seat for the P.A.P. It is, therefore, easy, Sir, to

understand the reasons for the recent mass arrests

and  maybe possible future mass arrests before  the

general  elections  are  to  come.  But  all  these

actions  would only bring the P.A.P. further  down

the drain. The P.A.P. can have sweet dreams and can

force  the people to go to the polis, but it cannot

force  the  people to vote for it in spite  of  its

community  centres  and  Work  Brigade,  radio  and

television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, despite its much publicised massive

construction,  it has little chance  of  staging  a

come-back. It genuinely believes that if the ground

can  be  cleared - and that the P.A.P. thinks is  its

last hope - for a fight only between two contestants,

the  Prime  Minister and the Member for  Cairnhill,

the  P.A.P. will therefore win first,  because  it

will try to pose itself as being a socialist Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



again. As I see it, the P.A.P. is determined to win

at  all  costs. Never have all the rules of conduct

in  the  democratic system been so  much  violated.

Detention laws, the P.P.S.O., and the Criminal  Law

(Temporary  Provisions) Ordinance,  have  all  been

used   to   deal  with  personal  adversaries   and

political opponents of all shades of colour.  Never

have  detention  laws, which were promulgated  with

avowed  objectives  to keep the  democratic  system

working, been so grossly abused and will be abused.

Let  the political Opposition never deceive  itself

as to the extent the P.A.P. Government is prepared to

go.  We  were  aware of this since our  break  with

them. We knew the P.A.P. leaders too well and  that

is  why  they  were never able to out-manoeuvre  us

even  once  either inside or outside this Assembly.

The  final  course,  and this is  if  the  Internal

Security  Council approves, may be  to  detain  the

Member for Hong Lim and put him out of the race.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Now you are pretty safe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> But would that ensure the

victory of the P.A.P.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have little faith in the P.A.P. Government

and  its  profession to work the democratic  system

because  we  are convinced that the detention  laws

have  been  grossly abused by the P.A.P.  Government,

and  we ask that the detainees be brought to  trial

or set free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is still some time left before the

curtains  are  finally  drawn.  Before  the  P.A.P.

leaders  continue  with the final  phase  of  their

heinous plans, why not those in the P.A.P. who make

the  decisions  and who are now  absent  from  this

Assembly  go away to some lonely and pleasant  spot

like Raffles Lighthouse where there are nice little

rooms for some self-searching thoughts before it is

too  late? Do the P.A.P. leaders genuinely  want  the

democratic system to survive? Or what they want  is

merely  to maintain their personal power, no matter

what the cost?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the traditional

splendour that marks the opening of the new Session

of the Legislative Assembly was dimmed and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



marred   this  time.  The  air  of  hypocrisy   was

apparent. There was, of course, the usual  din - the

ceremonial highlights, the guard of honour, the 21-gun  salute,  and above all, Sir, the usual  annual

march  of  the P.A.P. legislators. As in  the  case

last year, they all marched in their whites, led by

the Prime Minister who incidentally was also in his

white  uniform.  Nonetheless,  Sir,  there  was   a

difference. There was a bitter taste. The hypocrisy

of   the  whole  show  was  evident.  There  is  no

democracy in Singapore. The so-called parliamentary

democracy  is merely in form and not in  substance.

Democracy   in  Singapore  is  a  farce   that   is

prostituted by the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let there be no illusions about this. It is

no  use pretending that this traditional debate  on

Government policy is a reflection of any democratic

system   in  Singapore.  After  a  long  spell   of

prorogation the P.A.P. finally decided to call  for

a Session for its own ulterior motives, among which

is  to  show the people in Singapore and also those

outside Singapore that there is still democracy  in

Singapore, and that there is still such a thing  as

the constitutional method of open argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent events have proved that parliamentary

democracy  in  Singapore  is  as  good   as   dead.

Parliamentary   democracy,  as   such,   has   been

thoroughly  discredited and exposed by  the  P.A.P.

which  claims  to safeguard the whole  system.  The

blatant  abuse  of the system by  the  P.A.P.,  the

denial  of  democratic liberties  and  rights,  the

complete control of the Press, the radio,  and  now

T.V.; the shameless rigging of the referendum,  the

arbitrary arrests, the banning of publications, and

even  the  P.A.P.'s  conduct in this  Chamber,  all

expose the hypocrisy of the P.A.P. who claim to  be

defenders of democracy. Parliamentary democracy has

been  made  a  mockery of by the P.A.P. Suppression

and  reprisals  by  a  vindictive  and  dictatorial

P.A.P. clique, whose deceit and dishonesty surpass

that  of  all  previous governments, including  the

colonial government, is the order of the day. While

we have this debate, Sir, let us also bear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



in  mind  that  all this is farce  because  of  the

background and because of what goes on outside this

House. This Assembly sitting is just a pretence  of

democracy in an otherwise complete police State: we

are   perhaps  just  one  step  behind  a  complete

dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the emasculated P.A.P. report delivered by

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  is  tantamount  to  a

plaintive appeal for approval of the P.A.P.'s  past

and  present  failures. This  is  hardly  a  policy

speech.  The speech contains an introduction  which

says  nothing,  and a conclusion which  is  equally

eloquent  in  saying nothing. In between,  Sir,  we

have   an   impoverished   review   of   Government

activities which are terribly inadequate even as  a

record  of P.A.P.'s "achievements" in the past  one

and a half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is suggested that the Barisan Sosialis has

lost the open argument this time. What argument and

when did we lose it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Radio Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Government's fear of our opposition

has  driven them to take arbitrary action to remove

forcibly  their  political opponents  in  Left-wing

organisations from the arena, and to deprive us  of

our   inherent   right   to   organise   opposition

constitutionally. Forms of constitutional  struggle

that   are   common  in  countries  which  practise

parliamentary   democracy  are   not   allowed   in

Singapore.   Even  this  Assembly  was   given   an

unprecedented long recess thereby ensuring complete

erasure of any form of opposition. The Sembawang by-election  has not been held. Sir, all these  things

are  done because the P.A.P. know that it  is  they

who  have lost the open argument. The magnitude  of

the repressive measures adopted by the P.A.P. is  a

clear  indication of the strength of the opposition

the  Government  faces, it is the Government  which

has  lost  the  open argument, and hence  finds  it

necessary  to resort to taking repressive measures.

The  Barisan, however, Sir, is very confident  that

notwithstanding   any  repressive   acts   of   the

Government, it shall eventually crush the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is no longer a political force. It

does not represent the Right, nor does it represent

the  Left.  It is an opportunist force. Today,  the

P.A.P. is  still  surviving  because,  and   only

because,  it has the use of the State machinery  in

its hands. It is a force only in the sense that  it

has  the  use  of State organs. It has  the  radio,

T.V., the police, the Work Brigade, and it has  the

Press completely subjugated. It survives because of

these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introductory portion of the speech with

its  "quiet note of confidence" is fallacious.  The

P.A.P.  Government  has  no confidence  in  itself;

neither  does  it  have the confidence  of  anybody

other than colonial and reactionary forces. Sir,  I

understand that even these reactionary and colonial

forces distrust the P.A.P., for they are aware that

the  P.A.P. will stab them in the back one of these

days.  Only  53 days before the formal  opening  of

this  Session  of  the  Legislative  Assembly,  the

Government   arrested  133   of   their   political

opponents and banned 10 publications which had been

critical of Government policies. This arbitrary and

undemocratic action was that of desperate  men  who

were  not  confident of their future in a fair  and

open fight. These actions were the direct result of

the   lack  of  confidence  on  the  part  of   the

Government to continue the so-called open  argument

even  though  they  have the Press  under  complete

control. The P.A.P. resorted to arbitrary detention

of  political opponents because they did  not  have

the confidence of winning the constitutional fight.

Sir, it was because of this lack of confidence that

the   P.A.P. continues  to  take  all   forms   of

undemocratic   actions   and   to   impose   severe

limitations  on  the  Opposition.  The  people  are

denied  civil liberties, publications  are  banned,

meetings  are  restricted,  meetings  of  Left-wing

trade  unions  are  banned,  the  S.A.T.U. is  not

registered,  the  S.A.T.U. annual  conference  was

banned,  the  referendum was  legally  rigged.  All

these  were  done, Sir, not because the P.A.P. was

confident,  but because these measures  were  their

only means to hold on to power. Perhaps, Sir, after

the mass arrests they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



are  trying  to feel confident and this  desire  to

feel  confident could have crept into the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech. Perhaps  they  feel  that

there  is  a short breathing spell for them.  This,

Sir,  we can assure them is a mere illusion and  no

amount  of  wishful thinking on  the  part  of  the

P.A.P. is going to change realities. The P.A.P. is

doomed to die sooner or later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction also refers to storms and

tempests.  This  sounds more like  a  leaf  from  a

Mickey  Spillane  thriller.  There  is  a  definite

attempt  on  their  part  to  give  the  impression

amongst  the public that Singapore had  been  faced

with  some  impending catastrophe  which  they  had

averted by their recent actions. There was no  such

situation.  This bogey is presented to  the  public

merely   to   justify  their  recent   undemocratic

actions, to hide the evil machinations and  further

repressive measures which they have in mind  for  a

future  date.  The storm, if any,  was  only  in  a

teacup.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is

solely aimed at over-emphasising routine activities

of  the  P.A.P.  Government in the past  year.  The

P.A.P. have  certain  obligations  to  perform  by

virtue  of  the fact that they are the  Government.

The  routine opening of schools, community centres,

etc., are about the minimum obligations that can be

expected  from a government whose members are  paid

out of public pockets in the expectation that these

obligations will be fulfilled so as to  ensure  the

continuity of the normal livelihood of our  people.

The P.A.P. seek to play up these routine duties  of

the  Government which they themselves described  in

the  previous policy speech on the 31st of  August,

1961,  as  mundane matters; obviously, Sir,  in  an

attempt  to  win public sympathy. This  is  exactly

what  the  previous Government under the leadership

of  the Member for Cairnhill did in its last stages

just before the elections in 1959. Sir, it will not

be  out  of  place to remind the P.A.P. that  this

stunt did not deceive the people in 1959, and there

is  no  doubt  the P.A.P. also cannot deceive  them

this time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the substance of the speech even as a review

of  Government  activities is inadequate.  Further,

the speech does not even outline the basic features

of  Government's general policy. Under  every  head

the  activities of the past year are recounted  and

any  future plans vaguely left behind. Future plans

are  completely vague and are in the form  of  very

generalised  statements. Column 5 of  the  Hansard,

for  example, Sir. We are told that there are funds

to  see  us through all the major projects for  the

immediate  years ahead. Sir, what are  these  major

projects?  When we seek to look for them,  we  find

that  we  are given the oft-repeated Toa Payoh  new

town,  the  rebuilding of the  old  city,  and  the

Jurong  industrial base. Three projects  which  the

P.A.P. have  been talking about for a  very,  very

long time. Column 6 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Most significant and gratifying of all has been

the  quiet  and steady expansion of new  factories.

Every  other  week  sees the opening  of  some  new

industrial  enterprise. Every month  sees  a  major

project  take shape in the Jurong Industrial  Site.

The future augurs well.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again, Sir, is a vague and generalised

statement which does not specify Government  plans.

We  are  not even told how many workers  have  been

employed as a result of these ventures. We are  not

told  to  what extent the unemployment problem  has

been  relieved  us a result of these so-called  new

industries.  Sir, the omission is  because  of  the

fact  that new employment as a result of  this  has

been   almost  negligible.  Column  9  is   another

example, Sir, of vague generalised statements  from

a bankrupt Government which has no definite policy.

I quote, Sir, from the second paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The whole task of rebuilding our city is one of

monumental  proportions. It will  need  finance  of

more  than  a  thousand million  dollars  and  will

engage  our energies over several decades.  But  at

the  end  of it, we shall have built a new city  of

beauty and distinction, worthy of the industry  and

enterprise of our people, and in keeping  with  our

position   as   the   financial,   industrial   and

commercial centre of South East Asia.'



<br><br>Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  "the  whole  task   of

rebuilding  our city is of monumental proportions."

You will note



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



that  there is absolutely nothing said except  what

everybody knows. We know that the rebuilding of our

city  is of monumental proportions. We do not  have

to  have  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech,

which   is  supposed  to  be  the  policy  of   the

Government, which is supposed to contain  definite

Government proposals and programmes for the future,

telling  us  this,  instead of explaining  how  the

policy of the Government is directed to tackle  the

problem and how do the Government propose to  raise

more than $1,000 million. Besides this much-talked-about  Outram site, which other site have  they  in

mind?  The  Government do not even  say  when  they

propose  to begin this Outram scheme and when  they

expect to complete it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are only two paragraphs devoted to the

subject  of  labour  in the policy  speech  of  the

Government  which professes to be  pro-labour.  One

refers  to the Industrial Arbitration Court -  just

one  sentence.  And the other, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

refers to the Labour Research Unit - two sentences.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How many sentences do you want?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Labour Research Unit is a

P.A.P. outfit,  financed by  the  Government.  All

those  who are attached to this unit are well known

for  their  P.A.P. affiliations. Public  funds  are

used  to further P.A.P. interests. This unit  helps

P.A.P. trade unions, provides materials, etc.  Even

actual  negotiations are done by some of  them  for

the  P.A.P. unions. When the arrests were  carried

out,  some  of  these men who are attached  to  the

Research  Unit  and who are paid by Government,  on

behalf  of  the  P.A.P., approached the  non-P.A.P.

unions  and  offered to negotiate for them  because

their leaders were in detention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is significant to note that a Government

which  professes  to  be  pro-labour  has  made  no

mention of its labour policies in its speech.  Sir,

it  is  also significant to note differences  among

the references to labour in 1960, 1961 and 1963. In

1960,  Sir, there was the assurance that the  Trade

Union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



Bill,  which passed through this Assembly and which

was  prevented  in  an  unprecedented  manner  from

having  the  assent of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,

will be re-introduced. In 1961, Sir, there was  no-mention  of this Bill at all in the policy  speech.

And again, this year, there is no reference to this

Bill.  It  is now three years since the  time  this

assurance was given in 1960. The unification of the

trade union movement was an election pledge of  the

P.A.P. Up to now, the Government have not kept  its

pledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, the Government talked about a Labour

Advisory  Committee.  We  hear  nothing  about   it

anymore.  In  1960,  the  Government  promised  the

Employment  Bill  which would  revise  the  Clerks,

Labour  and  Shop Assistants Employment  Ordinances

and  include  protection for  other  categories  of

workers not covered by existing labour legislation.

I  quote  the exact words from the Hansard,  Volume

13, No. 1, column 14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An Employment Bill will be introduced which will

repeal  the  three  Ordinances  dealing  with   the

conditions   of   labourers,   clerks   and    shop

assistants.'



<br><br>That was on 20th July, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, Sir, they also said that they would

introduce this Employment Ordinance. This is Volume

15, column 23, dated 31st October, 1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A new Employment Ordinance which will consolidate

the  existing  Ordinances pertaining to  labourers,

clerks  and  shop assistants will he introduced  in

the coming year.'



<br><br>That was 1961. 1963 finds no such reference at  all

in the policy speech. The Government again have not

kept  their  election pledges, and  in  the  speech

before the House we find no reference at all to the

revision   of  the  existing  outdated   Employment

Ordinances,  and  also  to  the  need  for   proper

legislation to protect large groups of workers  who

are  not  given  safeguards under  existing  labour

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have broken every pledge they made

to  the  workers on whose votes they  were  elected

into  office. It is hypocritical for the P.A.P. to

profess



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



to  be pro-labour. Sir, we find all over  the

P.A.P. report  a  complete  absence  of  specific

Government policies and programmes for the  future,

except very vague generalised statements, with  one

or two projects repeated over and over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise that the more urgent and immediate

problems  facing our people are those  of  housing,

schools,  hospitals, etc. Sir, to be able  to  meet

the increasing needs of our people, the Government,

in  the  first  place, must have a  sound  economic

policy.  Since 1959, when the P.A.P. took  office,

our  economic ills, far from improving,  have  only

worsened.  Notwithstanding the number of industries

that  have  been given pioneer status, the  present

unemployment  figure is no doubt  higher  than  the

1959   figure.  We  are  certain  that  the  P.A.P.

Government cannot solve the basic economic problems

if they continue to work within the framework of  a

colonial  economy. Singapore's economy is dependent

on its entrepot status, and this is insufficient to

meet,  as  has been proved, the increasing  demands

for employment opportunities. Apparently, everybody

is  agreed  on  the  need for industrialisation  to

reduce unemployment and to increase prosperity. Yet

it  is strange that the P.A.P. have made no mention

of    their    approach   to   the    problem    of

industrialisation in the speech  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. Since 1959, the P.A.P. have not, in

fact,   outlined   their   basic   policy   towards

industrialisation, apart from following up  on  the

previous   Government's  policies  of   encouraging

private investment. This is clear evidence that the

P.A.P. have deviated from their election  pledges.

In  1959, the P.A.P. said that "we should not  face

our economic problems in an era of freedom with the

mental attitude appropriate to colonial servitude."

However,  today they are still openly depending  on

the   entrepot  economy  of  Singapore,  and  their

bleating  about foreign capital for  investment  is

still   an   attitude   appropriate   to   colonial

servitude. Everyone - the capitalists included - knows

that  the P.A.P.'s economic policy in practice  has

been a failure. Their industrialisation projects so

far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



carried  out have been of little significance.  The

tendency  of the P.A.P. has been to blame  militant

trade  unionism  for  the  insufficient  inflow  of

foreign  capital  to  meet  our  requirements   for

industrialisation. We have time and  again  pointed

out  the  fallacy  of blaming labour  for  economic

stagnation.  If  industrialisation  has  not  taken

place  at  the  rate required, then the  Government

must  admit  their own failures instead of  looking

for  a scapegoat. Sir, the availability of capital,

markets,  etc, are  far more important  conditions

that  are necessary as pre-requisites to facilitate

industrialisation. The P.A.P., apart  from  blaming

militant labour - particularly the Left-wing trade

unions - for   the   P.A.P.'s   failure   to   effect

industrialisation on a scale necessary,  have  done

nothing positive in terms of acquiring capital  and

expanding   markets.  In  1959,  they  said   "they

profoundly disagreed that the survival of Singapore

depends    on    foreign   capital   and    foreign

capitalists", but today the emphasis  is  still  on

foreign capital and foreign capitalists. Today, the

P.A.P.  have  done  nothing  to  remedy  the  lack  of

sufficient  capital  for  industrialisation,  other

than depending on a few foreign capitalists to open

industries, whose impact is insignificant. Contrary

to   P.A.P. pledges  in  1959,  the  Government's

overseas investments have more than doubled.  Vague

suggestions have also been made that Malaysia  will

mean economic prosperity for Singapore. Today,  the

Singapore  Government,  or the  Government  of  the

Federation of Malaya, have not explained  how  this

economic prosperity is to be brought about. It  is,

however,   implied   that   Malaysia   will    mean

industrialisation, expanded markets, etc. I  notice

the  Minister  for  Finance has  left  the  Chamber

obviously, he has no answer to these things, it has

been  suggested  that Malaysia will  mean  economic

prosperity,  expanded markets,  greater  employment

opportunities,  etc.  One would  have  expected  to

find,  in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,

some clear indication as to the future of Singapore

in  the  context  of Malaysian economic  situation,

especially in view of the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



that the Governments concerned appear determined to

push  through this neo-colonial plot regardless  of

the   strong  opposition  of  the  people.  To  our

surprise,  we find hardly any reference. There  are

only  two  insignificant references in the  speech.

One  is at column 7. There is only one line. It  is

so   insignificant  that  I  cannot  even  spot  it

straightaway. The last paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The establishment of Malaysia on 31st August this

year  will  give an added impetus to our industrial

growth.'



<br><br>A meaningless statement which is general and vague.

Another  reference is at column 8: "With  Malaysia,

our  opportunities will be greater." Sir, these are

the  only  two references, and you will  note  that

these are completely bankrupt statements which mean

absolutely  nothing. They are merely high-sounding.

What we would like to know is, how will there be an

increase   in   industrial   growth   and   greater

opportunities  in  the  context  of  Malaysia,   as

proposed  by  the Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya  and  the  P.A.P.? We  would  like  to  know

whether there will he an automatic expanded  market

as  a  result  of Malaysia. We would like  to  know

whether   goods   manufactured  in  Singapore,   on

entering the Federation of Malaya, will he  subject

to  tax  after Malaysia, as is the practice at  the

moment.  We  would like to know whether Federation-manufactured goods will continue to enter Singapore

tax-free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the eve of the neo-colonial British-sponsored Malaysia which the P.A.P. whole-heartedly

support,   we  still  have  no  answers  to   these

questions.  The P.A.P. lie has been  that  Malaysia

will mean greater employment opportunities. This is

a  falsehood  propounded by  P.A.P. propagandists.

Because of the inequality and discrimination in the

citizenship status within Malaysia, which adversely

affect Singapore citizens, they will not be able to

have employment in the Federation of Malaya or  the

Borneo   territories.  How  then  will   there   be

increased employment opportunities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another lie is that Malaysia will mean a

market   of   10  million  people  for   Singapore-manufactured goods. So far, there has been no clear

statement on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



this.  As  far  as  we can understand,  even  after

Malaysia, the present practice will continue,  that

is,   Singapore-manufactured  goods  entering   the

Federation of Malaya will be subject to tax, whilst

Federation-manufactured  goods  will  continue   to

enter Singapore tax-free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

on 31st October, 1961, we were told in column 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Without economic co-operation and a common market

between Singapore and the Federation, there can  be

little  hope  of  a  rapid economic  expansion  and

industrialisation  that will bring  more  factories

and more jobs for the thousands of our young people

leaving our schools and seeking employment.'



<br><br>In  1961, the P.A.P. admitted that without a common

market  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya, there was little hope. Up to date, Sir,  as

far as we know, there is no concomitant arrangement

for  the  setting up of a common market of  Malaya,

Singapore and the Borneo territories, in  spite  of

the  fact  that they are on the verge of bulldozing

through  Malaysia. Sir, in the absence of this,  it

is reasonable to expect that conditions will remain

the same, in the 31st October, 1961 speech, we were

also told in column 12:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With merger now in prospect, the assumptions on

which   the  original  economic  policies  of   the

Government were based must be reviewed.'



<br><br>It  is now 1� years since this speech was made.  In

the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara this year,

we  still find not even an indication of the  basis

on  which Government's economic policies are to  be

reviewed and devised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, even assuming

that  some arrangements will be worked out,  it  is

necessary for us to bear in mind the state  of  the

economy  of the Federation of Malaya as it is  now.

The   economy   of  Malaya,  as  it  is   presently

constituted, can hardly be relied on.  The  Malayan

economy  is almost totally dependent on rubber  and

tin,  whose  export  markets  fluctuate.  This  has

caused  serious  disturbances in the  past  and  no

doubt  will  continue to cause  much  more  serious

disruption  in  the future. The Government  of  the

Federation  of Malaya recognise the seriousness  of

their over-dependence on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



these  two commodities and they are now engaged  in

attempts to speed up industrialisation, However, in

the   field   of  industrialisation,  a   realistic

appraisal  shows that the rate of progress  in  the

Federation of Malaya is insufficient even  to  meet

the  growing  demands  of  the  population  of  the

Federation   of   Malaya,  let  alone   the   whole

population of the Malaysia region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., which was elected on a socialist

platform as a Left-wing Party, makes no mention  of

its  economic  policies outside the status  quo  of

colonial and free enterprise economic system.  This

is  conclusive proof that the P.A.P. have  changed

colours and are now pursuing policies which are pro-colonial  and which are contrary to their  election

pledges.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

we  listen to the speeches from both the P.A.P. and

the  Barisan speakers, we are reminded of the  kind

of uneasy political climate Singapore has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



had to go through for the last four years. There is

so much confrontation about the speeches, Sir, that

many people in Singapore have become bewildered. In

fact,   some  have  even  thought  that  all   this

confrontation is a makebelieve, and that some  time

in  the future the P.A.P. and the Barisan will join

up again as they did in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we compare conditions generally in

1959 with those of today, perhaps we can arrive  at

somewhere  near the truth. We can better appreciate

the  real  strength and weaknesses  of  the  P.A.P.

administration during the last four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, four years ago, when His Excellency the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara made his first speech  here,  he

said   that  the  prime  task  of  the  new  P.A.P.

Government  would  be  to build  up  a  climate  of

confidence   under   which  trade   expansion   and

industrial growth could take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following year, on 29th September, 1960,

the  Minister  for Finance, in his  Budget  speech,

referred   to  the  rapid  population   growth   in

Singapore    and   the   prospect    of    mounting

unemployment,  and said that the Government  viewed

this with grave anxiety and would strain itself  to

the  utmost  to avoid this situation of  increasing

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree wholeheartedly with the P.A.P. in

these  two major objectives. Here at least are  two

milestones  by  which  we can  measure  Singapore's

progress during the P.A.P. administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I listened to and read again the

speech of His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

this year, I found that there was a strange silence

on  these  two major aims, except a bare  reference

that  new  factories would give more  jobs  to  the

people. When we examine the situation more closely,

we  find the real damaging truth: in spite of their

good intentions, the achievements and the hard work

of  the P.A.P. leaders, they have failed to achieve

success  in these two major aims which they  stated

to  be theirs in 1959. They have not only failed to

build up the climate of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



confidence  but  they  have  also  aggravated   the

problem of mounting unemployment. In fact, it would

be  true to say that the situation has deteriorated

since 1959 as regards these two major aims and that

if it were not for the timely prospect of Malaysia,

the deterioration would have been even worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Barisan speakers have also

been   crowing  over  the  failure  of  the  P.A.P.

Government  to  solve the problem of  unemployment,

but  they  must realise that they have  to  take  a

great  portion of that blame. Basically,  both  the

P.A.P. and  the  Barisan  have  made   the   same

fundamental mistake in their policy, and  that  is,

they  think  they  can build a  better  society  in

Singapore    by   fomenting   class   hatred    and

perpetuating the class struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they also take delight in inflicting on the

people    of    Singapore    their    confrontation

tactics - confrontation in the schools, confrontation

in   factories,  confrontation  in   the   offices,

confrontation  in the Singapore Harbour  Board  and

confrontation in the Assembly. In an atmosphere  of

confrontation  almost  everywhere,  with   students

being roused up against teachers, employees against

employers,  one  group  of  trade  unions   against

another  group, how can we expect a better  society

to emerge?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us have forgotten the lesson we learnt

when we were young in school: whatever we sow, that

shall we reap. How can we sow hatred and expect  to

reap  something good? We must then expect  to  reap

violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that there are able men in both the

Barisan and the P.A.P., and if they can only  purge

themselves  of  this hatred of class against  class

and  race  against race and person against  person,

they will be in a better position to give Singapore

that better society that we all aim for, and a more

peaceful and prosperous Singapore. We can only hope

that  in  Malaysia we shall take not  the  road  of

hatred  but of goodwill and continuing co-operation

to build something better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has produced a very good show-piece in the Jurong industrial scheme, but unless

there is a climate of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



confidence with justice and fair play, not only for

the workers, but also for the investors, the scheme

may  turn  out  to be just one big white  elephant.

That  is  the opinion of many who have a  stake  in

Singapore's  future.  For why  should  foreign  and

local  investors be asked to put in investments  in

the Jurong scheme if the Party in power claims as a

matter  of  policy  that in any  dispute  it  would

always  be on the side of the have-nots? The people

who  are  the  haves will be fools if they  put  in

money  in order to lose their investments. But  why

should  it be so? Why should it not be justice  for

all?  Why  should we not let common sense  prevail

over  any  personal  hatred  or  class  hatred,  or

rancour  that may be in our hearts? This deliberate

encouragement  of one class against  another  class

may  win  for one side some votes, but in the  long

run it brings mutual destruction to both sides; not

only to the haves but also to the have-nots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask both the Barisan and the

P.A.P. who the real have-nots are in Singapore.  To

me,  Sir, the real have-nots in Singapore  are  the

unemployed.   Those  in  employment  already   have

something. They have something to live on, to build

on.  The unemployed are the real have-nots, and the

people  who  have done the greatest disservice  and

the greatest harm to the have-nots in Singapore,  I

am sorry to say, have been both the Barisan and the

P.A.P. with their confrontation tactics. The result

has  been that we have less and less jobs for  more

and more have-nots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this situation has been borne out by the

report  published in 1960 of the Labour  Department

under the P.A.P. administration. In September 1957,

there  were  123,000 workmen in  employment.  Three

years  later in 1960 there were 7,400 less  workmen

in  employment. In September 1961, according to the

Digest  of  Statistics, the  total  number  of  men

employed  in  all  industries was still  less  than

110,000.  So,  since  1957, when  the  P.A.P. took

control  of  the  City  Council,  the  climate   of

confidence in Singapore has deteriorated,  and  the

number of jobs available for the have-nots has been

less and less, so that today there are 13,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



less  jobs  for  the have-nots than  in  1957.  The

number   of  unemployed,  the  real  have-nots   in

Singapore,  has probably increased from  60,000  in

1959,  at,  say, an average of 20,000  a  year,  to

about 140,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the tragedy that the Barisan and the

P.A.P.,  who  claim to be the loudest champions  of

the  have-nots, have been the ones who have  caused

the  greatest  suffering to the real  have-nots  in

Singapore - the unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only both the Barisan and the P.A.P.,

would  try a new approach to the problem of helping

the   have-nots  in  Singapore,  rather  than   the

confrontation approach they have been  trying  out,

very   likely  there  would  be  this  climate   of

confidence coming to Singapore and we would produce

more  and  more  jobs  for the  real  have-nots  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not even have to wait for new factories to

produce  new jobs. The present enterprises and  the

present  factories  are  capable  of  expansion  to

provide  the  new  jobs,  provided  there  is   the

assurance  that  there will  be  justice  for  both

sides,  both the workers and the employers, in  the

interests of the citizens of Singapore and  of  the

true have-nots, the jobless of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the P.A.P. looks forward to

Malaysia  as  the  hope for  a  better  future  for

Singapore  citizens, but if we carry into  Malaysia

the  old approach of fomenting class hatred and the

class struggle, then we shall he carrying into  the

new  Malaysia the disease from the old, and instead

of  producing  more jobs and a better  climate,  we

will  simply produce more suffering for  the  have-nots.  In fact in Sabah, North Borneo, the  leaders

are  scared of the people from Singapore. They say,

"You fellows are such trouble makers that we do not

want you here."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they are short of labour and we have plenty

of  unemployed in Singapore, and yet  they  do  not

want  the  unemployed of Singapore because  of  the

poison  that has been put into their hearts,  minds

and souls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may say that I am being idealistic,

but  let us look back to the period in 1946 to 1948

in Malaya. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



was  then a conflict of two principles. There  were

some  who said that the Chinese in Malaya  must  be

organised  to  oppose the Malays,  and  there  were

others  who said that the Malays in Malaya must  be

organised   to   oppose  the  Chinese.   That   was

confrontation,  Sir. There were  others  who  said,

however,  that  the  Chinese  in  Malaya  must   be

organised  to co-operate with the Malays  to  build

something  better  for Malaya,  a  new  nation  for

Malaya,  and  we  are glad to say that  there  were

among the leaders of the Malays those who said that

the Malays must be organised to co-operate with the

Chinese and the other non-Malays to build something

better.  I am glad that those leaders who  believed

not  in  confrontation  but co-operation,  with  no

thought of stabbing their partners in the hack, won

the day. Therefore, Malaya today is able to rejoice

in  having a country where there is racial harmony,

where there is a genuine spirit of co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is only an extension of that spirit of co-operation. To me, that is only something symbolic

of  what the United Nations should be in the world.

It  is  something of which Indonesia  need  not  be

afraid.  If  in Malaysia we organise to  co-operate

with one another, and we are prepared to co-operate

with   Indonesia,   with  the   Philippines,   with

Thailand, and with the other nations of the  world,

we  are not a danger to the others. We will only he

too  happy to produce the right climate.  We  shall

eventually  see  greater world  peace  and  greater

world unity. Sir, this is something altogether  new

for my colleagues in the P.A.P. and in the Barisan,

but  I do appeal to them, for the sake of Malaysia,

to try this new approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to more mundane subject and

congratulate  the  Minister for Finance  on  having

become  a successful State capitalist. He has  been

able  to  report a great increase in the  financial

reserves  of the State - over $200 million.  At  this

point, however, we must become conscious of a  duty

that has not been completely fulfilled - that a small

portion  of  that money was accumulated  under  the

misapprehension that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



country  was facing a serious deficit in  1959.  It

has  since  turned out that there was a surplus  in

1959,  and a bigger surplus in 1960, and there  has

been  a  surplus every year since then, as was  the

case  even before 1959. So, naturally, the question

arises, if the P.A.P. Government are good employers

and  believe in the integrity of honest  employers,

should  they  not now fully restore  the  pay  cuts

deducted   in   1959?  And  they  have   tremendous

resources  now.  This  has  now  become  conscience

money.  That amount wrongfully deducted belongs  to

the  rightful owners - the civil servants  now  under

the  care of the P.A.P. and the refund can be  done

in  a  way  without  damaging the  economy  of  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the field of education I am glad that the

Government has been able to build enough schools to

admit all the Primary I pupils. I am glad also that

the  compulsory six-day week, a very  controversial

issue,  has  been satisfactorily settled  and  many

parents  and children have been made happy  thereby

without  the  examination results  being  adversely

affected. We have heard also that there has been  a

rapid increase in enrolment in the schools, but the

Minister for Education has admitted that there  has

been  some sacrifice in regard to quality. In  many

schools  parents are frustrated because there  have

been  too many failures. I trust the Government  in

the  coming  months will carefully look  into  this

aspect  of education to improve on the quality  and

not concentrate on quantity alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have before me here a copy of a Singapore

Government  Press statement issued on  21st  March,

1963. It begins with the following words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the result of the Prime Minister's visits to

the rural constituencies of Singapore."



<br><br>I repeat, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the result of the Prime Minister's visits to

the rural constituencies of Singapore, an extensive

rural  electrification programme has been  prepared

so  that  the  wishes of the kampong  dwellers  for

electricity in their houses will come true."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this report is accurate and the inference

is  accurate, the implication then is that  if  the

rural  dwellers  want to have  any  improvement  in

their kampongs, they must wait until the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



Minister  has  visited  them,  and  if  the   Prime

Minister does not visit them, they will miss  their

share  of the $30 million Development Fund that  is

going  to  be spent in the rural areas. Further - and

this   is   a   more  serious  implication - if   the

constituents  in  any particular division  are  not

willing  to  welcome  the  Prime  Minister  or  are

against  the  Party  in power, then  they  will  be

deprived  of  what would have been their  share  of

this Development Fund. It is also unfortunate, Sir,

that the Prime Minister is making visits in 1963 so

near election time. People in Singapore are talking

about  it  and  saying that the Prime  Minister  is

going  round  campaigning for the  next  elections,

using  his position and using the Development Fund.

I hope the Prime Minister will give us an assurance

that even in the constituencies that he may not  be

able to visit, if there is a real need and the need

is  brought  to his notice or the notice  of  other

Ministers, it will be given the same consideration

as  requests coming from constituencies  which  the

Prime Minister has visited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment

proposed  by  the  Member for  Queenstown  and  the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon is in two  parts.  The

first  part alleges that the Government has  failed

to  implement its election pledges, and the  second

part that Government should ascertain the views -of

the   people  in  regard  to  their  constitutional

future. I should like to deal with the second  part

first.  There  are people who try to  forget  facts

that  prove uncomfortable and unpleasant  to  them.

However, we will not allow them to forget that  the

people  of Singapore have already decided on  their

constitutional   future,  i.e. merger   with   the

Federation  of Malaya on the basis of  White  Paper

Command  No.  33 of 1961. Over 70 per cent  of  the

people  of  Singapore  voted for  merger  with  the

Federation on the basis of the White Paper. This is

the   verdict  of  the  people.  It  is  final  and

conclusive.  The fact is that the two  Members,  in

whose   names  the  amendment  stands,  have   some

difficulty  in  finding matters on  which  to  join

issue with us, and perforce they must rake



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



up old ones that have already been settled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the charge that the Government has

failed to implement its election pledges, what does

it  really mean? Everyone knows full well that  the

Government  has  carried out its  election  pledges

wherever  it is humanly possible. In many instances

these pledges have been overfulfilled and in others

new  services, amenities and facilities  have  been

made available for the people of Singapore. Let  us

take   the   field  of  housing.  The  Member   for

Queenstown, unless he chooses to go about with  his

eyes  closed,  can see in his very own constituency

the   housing   units  that  we  are  building   in

increasing  numbers day-by day. In just over  three

years, the Housing and Development Board has  built

21,232  units  against 23,019 units  built  by  the

Singapore Improvement Trust in the 32 years of  its

existence.  In 1962 alone, a total of 12,230  units

were  completed  as against the  target  figure  of

9,735  units  laid  down in the  State  Development

Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the achievement of public housing

has  exceeded  the target figure by almost  25  per

cent.  We  have  pledged  to  build  more  low-cost

housing  for  the  poorer  classes  and,  in   this

respect,  with a dynamic and vigorous  Housing  and

Development Board, the target achieved has exceeded

all   expectations.  Sir,  the  present  Government

inherited  from the previous Singapore  Improvement

Trust  a  waiting  list of 13,000 families  on  the

housing   register.  If  we  took   the   rate   of

construction  of  the S.I.T. in post-war  years  of

1,700  units per year, some of these families would

have to wait for five to eight years to get housing

accommodation.  Now,  due to  the  success  of  the

Government's housing development programme,  almost

all the 13,000 families on the waiting list in 1959

have  been  housed, in addition to a further  8,000

families  who  have  newly  registered.  Altogether

about  21,000  families of the lower  income  group

have obtained low-cost housing from the development

programme of the present Government. Yet the Member

for Queenstown was doing his best to belittle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



the achievement of the Government in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority in allocation of public housing is based

on the points system. The Government is now able to

relax   the  qualification  for  registration   and

gradually bring the benefit of public housing to  a

wider  range of families in Singapore.  During  the

S.I.T. period, five persons was the minimum number

required  for public housing, but the  Housing  and

Development Board is now able to reduce this number

to four persons for Queenstown and to three persons

for  the one-room $20 flats. Another relaxation has

been  made on the qualifications to allow  grown-up

brothers  and sisters to be included in the  family

unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now reached the stage where any

family, who has the necessary qualifications and is

not particular about the choice of locality and the

height  of the floors, can obtain accommodation  in

less than a month after registration. In fact,  one

of  the  odd results of the rapid rate of building,

which  has  smashed  the backbone  of  the  housing

problem, is that people are now becoming choosey as

to  the locality and height of floors on which they

wish  to  have accommodation. There have been  many

cases  where a family has been offered and rejected

accommodation several times not because they cannot

afford the rent but because of the locality or  the

height of the floor. Compare this with the old days

of  the  S.I.T. when the building rate  was  1,700

units  per  year  and  the  poor  people  were   so

desperately  in  need  of accommodation  that  they

grasped with eagerness any accommodation offered to

them  in  any locality on any floor! Truly we  have

moved forward compared with those days. Had it  not

been  for the obstruction and intimidation  of  the

Barisan  fellow-travellers in the  Rural  Residents

Association  and the Country People's  Association,

there  would have been even more houses  built  for

the  poorer  people. Thus, by their  very  actions,

these so-called champions of the people are slowing

down  the progress of providing more law-cost homes

for the lower income people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have been pressing ahead with the housing

development,  we  have  not  forgotten  the  social

amenities  that  are necessary for  the  people  in

these  housing estates. As an illustration, I would

like  to  take  Queenstown  which  is  our  largest

estate.  Our plans are to build a total  of  17,500

units  to  house 150,000 people. 11,000 units  have

been   completed,   and  6,000   more   are   under

construction. There are six shopping centres: three

have  been  built  and  the  other  three  will  be

completed   this  year.  Two  cinemas   are   under

construction. A large Polyclinic was completed  and

opened   early  this  year.  In  addition  to   the

community centre already built, we will be building

three more. Of the five markets planned, three have

been   completed.   A  police  station   is   being

constructed  and there are plans to  build  a  post

office.  Many children's play grounds are scattered

over the estate and there is a provision for a  13-acre public park. Of course, there are schools  for

the  children's  education.  In  addition  to  five

primary  schools and three secondary  schools  that

are  now  functioning, we are going to build  three

more primary and four secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have solved the housing problem to such an

extent that we are now able to devote our attention

to  the  much bigger problem of the city  area  re-development. We know that, in the city area  alone,

there are some half a million people living in very

congested,  unhealthy  and  terribly  rickety   old

houses. For various reasons, many of them prefer to

stay  in the city area rather than apply for public

housing  on the outskirts of the town. A start  has

been  made  in the Cantonment Road area. Work  will

start  later in the Sumbawa Road area.  We  realise

this  task is one of tremendous magnitude  but  the

prospects of a revitalised city worthy of our State

is  an exciting one. We are pressing ahead with the

project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like now to mention briefly the various

other  construction projects which  the  Government

has  carried out and will continue to carry out for

the benefit of the people. Let me take flood



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



alleviation  works. Singapore is  generally  a  low

lying country. When heavy rains coincide with  high

tides, the low lying areas are subject to flooding.

The  rapid  increase  in  building  activities  and

levelling of hills increase the rate of run-off and

make  flood  control quite a difficult problem.  In

some  cases, these alleviation works prevent damage

to  properties  and  farms and, in  others,  reduce

inconvenience to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the $3 million Ulu Pandan Flood

Alleviation Scheme is proceeding under full  steam.

This   scheme  envisages  the  reversal  of   flow,

diverting  water from the area near Queen's  Circus

towards the west, instead of towards the east as at

present.  The  triple  culvert  near  Tanglin  Halt

industrial estate was completed in 1962.  When  the

whole scheme is completed, drainage in the Redhill,

Alexandra  Road and Queenstown area  will  be  very

much  improved  and the danger of floods  occurring

there  will be greatly reduced. The last  drain  in

the  Radin  Mas area is now almost completed.  This

will  benefit the residents in the low-lying  areas

in Alexandra Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1962, the concrete drain between Bartley

and  MacPherson Roads was completed. This  year,  a

further  stretch of drain towards Paya  Lebar  Road

will  be  constructed. Drainage  in  the  low-lying

kampong  between Bartley Road and Paya  Lebar  Road

will  be greatly improved. The drainage works  from

Mandai Road to Woodlands Road and the scheme at the

5th  milestone at Pasir Panjang Road is now  almost

completed.  Work will begin soon on the Chong  Pang

Village drain at Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Government will concentrate on the

concrete  lining of the important canals,  such  as

the Kallang, Geylang, Rochore and Alexandra Canals.

Concrete  lining  will not only improve  the  water

flow  but also facilitate cleansing and maintenance

of these canals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure on flood alleviation under

the Four-Year Plan will amount to $10 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in carrying out construction of more houses,

schools, clinics, roads, shopping centres and flood

alleviation  schemes,  more and  more  workers  are

required.  Already thousands and thousands  in  the

rank   of   the  unemployed  are  finding   gainful

employment. Yet the Member for Queenstown and other

Opposition  Members allege that the Government  has

not tried to tackle the question of unemployment. I

am quite sure they are not in their right senses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of animal husbandry, agriculture and

fisheries,  we have provided services and  we  will

provide  even more services as we go on.  The  fact

that we have a healthy and vigorous export trade in

chickens and eggs, and to a lesser degree  in  pigs

because  of  restrictions, bear  testimony  to  the

efforts  of  the Government in providing  more  and

better  services for our people in the rural areas.

Protection  against ranikhet disease  today  is  no

longer  confined  to  the  adult  birds  but   also

extended   to  day-old  chicks.  Thus,  we   render

comprehensive protection against poultry  diseases.

At  present,  more than 15,000 day-old chicks  amid

30,000  adult poultry are vaccinated by  Government

every  day.  In 1962 alone, a total of 11�  million

chickens  were vaccinated against ranikhet  disease

as compared with 6.2 million chickens vaccinated in

1958 and 6.7 million in 1959. We have extended  the

stud  boar  service to provide good  boars  and  to

improve  the  strains  of  pigs  produced  by   our

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we even have artificial insemination for pigs.

Thus many more farmers can receive the benefits  of

having  good pig strains. Apart from Japan, Russia,

Norway  and  one  or  two other European  countries

which    have   already   been   using   artificial

insemination techniques in the breedings  of  pigs,

the introduction of artificial insemination service

for pigs on a commercial scale here makes Singapore

the  first  tropical country in Asia to adopt  this

modern scientific technique in pig breeding  on  an

extensive  scale,  apart  from  Japan  which  is  a

temperate  country. With this service  the  farmers

not only are able to obtain good stock, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



produce  good piglings, but also save a great  deal of

time  and  money  by  simply  telephoning  the Artificial

Insemination Unit which will immediately send  out teams to

carry out the services on  their farms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone beyond

our election  pledges  by building three veterinary extension

centres in  the rural areas. Two more are under construction.

Each of  these centres has a veterinary surgeon, a  team of

assistants permanently stationed in the areas to serve  the

farmers in that particular locality.  We have  brought to the

farmers a service for the sale of   veterinary  drugs  at  cost

on   their   very doorsteps.  Farmers realising the  benefit  of

the services are now increasing their purchase of drugs for  use

under  the  guidance  of  our  veterinary officers. For example,

in 1961 sales of such  drugs totalled  $64 000, and by 1962 sales

have increased to  $80,000.  We  are continuing  research  in  the

production  of  improved chicks  and  piglings  for distribution

to farmers. Last year 47,000  day-old chicks of improved straw were

sold at the specially reduced  price of 20 cents each. At the same

time, 425 piglings were also distributed at $1 per katty. These

improved breeds of piglings and  chicks  are produced   from

carefully  selected  stock   after considerable research work

and are for the  purpose of upgrading and improving the quality of

livestock in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is aware of the Government's effort

to maintain outlets for the produce of our farmers  in the

Federation.  The  successful  result  of  our representations to

the Federation Government in the matter of restrictions on our chickens

and eggs  is only  an  example of our efforts in this direction.

For  about  two  months, the  Prime  Minister,  the Minister  for

Finance and I  paid  visits  to  the Federal capital to seek a

satisfactory solution  to the  problem of restrictions. Our

farmers are aware that  during  the later stage of negotiations,

the Singapore  Government had to resort to  restricting the

import  of  vegetables  and  fish  from   the Federation.

These   endeavours    have    proved successful. Since the

15th February



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



this  year,  our chickens and  eggs  can  move freely

into the Federation without payment of  any licence fee.

The free movement of piglings and sows will   continue.  I  have

been  assured  by   the Federation   Minister  for  Agriculture

and   Co-operatives  that,  after  merger,  there  will

he completely free movement for all Singapore-produced pigs,

be they pigs for breeding or for slaughter.  I am  glad  to say that

chicken and egg prices  which were depressed when the Federation

restriction came into force have now recovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will

remember that I reported  to  this Assembly sometime ago that the

Government initiated a  scheme  in  the Southern Islands  to

distribute goats  free of charge in order to assist the  Malay

fishermen  there  to  diversify  their  sources  of income  and

to improve their livelihood. The  goats which  have been distributed

have been successfully reared by the Malay fishermen and a number

of  kids born  to  these  goats have been  returned  to  the

Government for further distribution to other  Malay fishermen.

The male goats - the Member  for  Geylang Serai  mentioned  earlier - helped  to  make  this possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to increase the

efficiency  of  animal disease  control, the Government will

establish  a veterinary  diagnostic  laboratory  to  carry

out investigation of various livestock diseases in  the State,

so  that control measures can be instituted against  such diseases.

These measures will  reduce farmers'  losses from diseases and

thereby  assist them  directly to obtain better returns  for

their labour. We will introduce a meat inspection service and

provide  new slaughter facilities  of  a  high standard so that

meat and meat products produced in the  State  can  be  exported

to  other  countries. Towards this end, plans for the building of

a  new modern  abattoir are being finalised. Once the  new abattoir

is established, it will not only encourage the  food  processing

industries in the  State  but will  also  benefit our farmers

by  providing  them with a ready market for their products.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of agriculture, we are continuing our tractor

service to provide our farmers with  cheap service at $20

per acre. We are helping our farmers to  combat  the many

agricultural pests encountered in  vegetable  and food production

by carrying  out the  plant  protection service whereby farmers

can ask  the  Government to spray their vegetables  and fruits

with insecticides at low cost. We will  also be  making  available

to the farmers  a  number  of insecticides   and  fungicides   at

low   prices. Following  a  series of successful  experiments

on fertilizers, the Government is selling a cheap  and yet

effective fertilizer mixture to  the  farmers. This   fertilizer

mixture  has  been   very   well received.  The  farmers

are purchasing  increasing quantities.  At present, we are also

studying  the possibility  of  supplying  farmers  with  improved

vegetable seeds as well as fruit planting materials such as rambutan

bud grafts and flower cuttings  in order to assist them to obtain a

higher income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we successfully reclaimed

some agricultural land, a fish pond and a prawn pond  at Sungei

Poyang.  The reclaimed land  is  now  under process  of

desalinisation and, when completed  in the  next few months,

will be used for resettlement purposes.  The  Government is

initiating  a  pilot scheme  in  this area to help organise farmers

and fishermen  to  form a primary produce  co-operative society  for

the purpose of running the  ponds  and fish  ponds and to market the

produce of the  farms as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inshore fishing areas of Singapore

are already fished  to  the limit, and it is now necessary  for our

fishermen  to look towards the offshore  areas for extension of

activities. The Government has had some  success in encouraging

some private companies to  extend  offshore  deep-sea  operations

and  to undertake the training of local personnel.  We  are also

considering the establishment of an  offshore fishery school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established a primary production extension service for

the  purpose  of  solving   specific problems  and  difficulties

encountered   by   the farmers  and fishermen. Field officers  bring

back from  the rural areas the problems faced by farmers and

fishermen. Technical officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



will then devise solutions to overcome the specific difficulties.

The extension service  will  also  be engaged  in  the  dissemination

of  scientific  and technical information to the farmers. Towards

this end,  films  are being produced on the subjects  of agriculture,

animal husbandry  and  fisheries  for showing  to farmers in

the villages in the evening, and  thus bring to them the latest

developments and improvements in farming and fishing techniques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of a large number of community centres

in  the  rural  areas,  primary production  services  are  being

provided  through these centres, bringing these services to the

very doorsteps  of  the farmers. If I may  say  so,  the extremely

wide range and comprehensive  nature  of services that we bring to our

farmers and fishermen in  the  rural areas is without parallel in

South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, everyone in Singapore knows

that the Government has carried out its election pledges wherever

it is humanly possible. In many instances, these  pledges  have

been over-fulfilled  and,  in others, new services, amenities and

facilities have been  made available for the people in the city

as well as the rural area.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No Member wishes to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was expecting the

Opposition to speak after  we  have spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,

we have heard a great deal from the  Member for Queenstown,

the Member for  Thomson and  also the Member for Hong Lim. I

find there was nothing  constructive at all in their speeches  and

some of them were actually very destructive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim

must be still day-dreaming of  his Ong Eng Guan empire during

the City Council days   when  he  mentioned  that  not  one   single

constituency is a safe seat for the P.A.P.  Only  a very  arrogant

man will dare make  such  a  daring statement,  and  I  believe  that

this   type   of statement  was made in desperation. If

the  Member for  Hong Lim is not careful, he may even lose

his own seat in 1964.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come to the Member for Queenstown who seemed to be indulging in fanciful imagination. First of all, not only were his allegations false but some of them were even factually groundless. He mentioned the National Theatre. Sir. He alleged that the Government was paying overtime to rush the

theatre  into  completion. He  forgets  the  simple procedure that

once a contract is let out, it is up to  the contractor to complete

the job when he  has accepted  the  date.  He  alleged  that  a  lot

of pressure  was  put on the builders to complete  the theatre.

I  would remind him to go back  and  read some of the newspapers

about the contract that  had been   given  for  the  building  of

the  National Theatre,   which  was  built  to  commemorate

the attainment  of  self-government of  Singapore.  The theatre

was made possible because of the  generous contributions of the

people of Singapore  and  with the  co-operation of the Government.

Tenders  were called  and  we  gave  a  definite  date  for

the completion  of  the  theatre. As  Chairman  of  the theatre,

Sir, it is my duty to see that the theatre be completed as soon

as possible so that the people who  have  contributed  the  money

would  not   be disappointed.  Singapore is a place of  efficiency.

We  want  things done quickly, and I  am  surprised that the Member

for Queenstown would like to see  a delay  in  the completion of

the National  Theatre. Tenders  were  let  out, as I have  said,

and  the target  was  the end of May. Not a single  cent  of

overtime   was   paid  to  the  workers   or   the contractors

who  have so kindly lived  up  to  the trust  to try to finish

the theatre by the  end  of May,  or at the latest in June.

After that, we hope to  have  the  South-East Asia  cultural

festival. Already many countries in South-East Asia, and even

from India and Pakistan, have agreed to participate in  this grand

festival, which is the first of  its kind in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown also mentioned T.V.

He  alleged that  the  purpose  of putting up T.V. was to do P.A.P.

propaganda. It  is surprising that such a wonderful propaganda machine is

not being used by the Member for Queenstown. He has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



been  repeatedly invited not only over  the  radio,

but  on T.V. We invite him to T.V. and yet he fights shy  of  coming.

If  it  is  a  useful  propaganda machine, he should make good use of

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to education, Sir, he has alleged that the recent arrests

have something to do with the  Torch campaign  which was organised

by their  supporters. The  Torch  campaign,  as it was  claimed,

was  to encourage  and persuade the people of Singapore  to study

their mother tongue. If it is the purpose  of the  campaign  to

promote the study of  the  mother tongue.  We are all for it. But,

Sir, as you  know, we  have had experience of such campaigns which,

in fact,   have  been  engineered  by  the  Communist-inspired

Barisan  Sosialis  for  the  purpose   of political agitation.

It is quite clear that the so-called  Torch campaign was a flop,

because you  can see  that less than three dozen people attended

the opening of the campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also

mentioned discrimination by the Government in  our  education policy.

He seemed to be perturbed at the  decrease of school children in

Chinese schools. I agree with him,  Sir, that it is a fact that

there has been  a decrease in the number of Singapore children

going to  Chinese  schools. In fact, responsible

Chinese educationists  in  Singapore, and particularly  the Chinese

Chamber of Commerce, have been  very  much concerned  and  perturbed

at  this  decrease.  The Chamber  has been receiving memoranda from

various educational  bodies to find out the  actual  reason for

this decrease of pupils in Chinese schools.

I would  like the Member for Queenstown to read

some of the memoranda submitted by the Singapore Chinese Teachers Union,

which represent the majority of the Chinese   teachers,  as  well  as

the   Singapore Students/Parents   Association,  representing

the majority of the parents of Chinese school children. In  the

memoranda submitted to the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce separately,

they pointed out that  one of  then  main reasons for the decrease

of  school children   in   Chinese   schools   was   political

interference  and  agitation  in  Chinese  schools, particularly the middle

schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



I  would go further and say that this agitation was engineered

by the Barisan Sosialis. All law-abiding Chinese  students would

like an atmosphere of  calm without   political  interference  from

political Parties  so  that  they  can concentrate  on  their studies

and not indulge in examination boycotts and other   activities   which

leave   them   nowhere particularly  concerning  their  own   future.

If political Parties can leave the students  alone  to concentrate on

their studies, we will have a better future for the future generation

of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also referred to Nanyang

University. He said, "What have you done  to  solve the  issue?"  The

Member for Serangoon  Gardens  as well as the Member for Upper Serangoon

were members of  the  Nanyang  University Liaison  Committee  of which I

was also a member, and they are fully aware of  the  actual  reason why

the  talks  came  to  a deadlock. It is no use asking the reason when

they know  what was the reason. We have tried our  best, Sir,

with sincerity and a spirit of compromise  to settle  the issue,

but an issue can only be settled if  there is good-will and sincerity on both

sides. The  Minister  for Education has  stressed  in  his recent

speech at the Nantah Convocation  that  the Government's offer of financial

aid to Nantah, that is,  the same equal treatment for Nantah

as we  are giving  to  the  University  of  Singapore,   still stands.

The  door  is still  open,  subject  to  a reorganisation of the University

according  to  the Nanyang  University Review Committee. We  want

the University  to  be  run by people  who  know  about universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown also mentioned about the unity of

the people. He lashed out  that we  have  split the unity of the people

because  of Malaysia.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, he is  very  fond  of saying

"unity", "democracy", but his  argument  is that  the majority of the people

should follow  the minority, then only will you have unity. We held

a referendum  where more than 75 per cent  voted  for the  White  Paper

and less than 25  per  cent  cast blank votes. And now he is accusing us

of splitting the unity of the people of Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



just  because the 75 per cent did not toe the  line of  the  25 per cent.

That is his argument and  his logic,  which is only understandable to the

Barisan Sosialis stooges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the things that we have done in the field of

education. I would like to stress that I  find  that the speakers,

particularly the Member for Hong Lim and those Members in the Barisan,

have never mentioned this time that the P.A.P. have done nothing.

I remember that on previous occasions they were  always fond of saying,

"What have  you  done? The  P.A.P. has  done nothing for  the  people

of Singapore."  It is significant, Sir, that  in  this Session such

accusations have ceased. At least they now recognise that we have done

some things, if not many things, for the people of Singapore. It is for

the  people  of  Singapore,  and  particularly  the Member  for  Queenstown,

to see for themselves  the houses  that  have sprung up. We are  a

Government that believes in action, and not in empty slogans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of democracy, if there is no democracy, the Members opposite

will not be able to speak  so freely  in  this House. They have been

allowed  to hold  protest  meetings, and even  intimidation  in some  cases.

Our Opposition Members  are  fond  of talking  of democracy.

Democracy has not  succeeded well  in South-East Asia because Opposition

leaders have abused it. They do not realise that it is  the duty  of  a

good  Opposition to give  constructive criticisms and not just destructive

criticisms.  As we  know, in a real democracy the Opposition should be

able to substantiate what they have accused, if they  say that the Government

has done this or done that.  They must be in a position to hold power

to replace  the Government and to carry out what  they have  said, and not

just make empty and destructive accusations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the past three

years  substantial progress  has been made in the field of  education. The

education  pyramid  is  fast  taking   shape. Firstly, the defects

in the primary base have  been put  right. In the past, more than 4,000

pupils who were registered in 1958 for Primary I admissions in 1959 could

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



be  admitted  to schools. The picture is,  however, very  different today.

There is a place  for  every child   who  registers  for  admission  in

primary schools. Only a few hundred (i.e., less than 1� per cent)  out of

an annual intake of nearly 60,000  who insist  that they must be admitted

to a  particular school  will  have to wait for another year  before they can

gain admission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent decision to provide six years of free

primary  education for children  between  the ages  of 6 and 14, we see the

welcome move of  many poor  parents,  especially those  living  in  rural

areas,  sending their over-age children to  school; whereas  in  the past

they probably withheld  their children  from attending school because they

would have to pay a monthly fee of $2.50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the stoppage of automatic promotion in 1959 has resulted in a

general improvement in the  work of  schools over the past three years.

The improved results   of  successful  primary  school   leaving examinations

testify to this welcome trend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, once the primary base of education is firmly established,

we have to expand greatly  the secondary sector of our education pyramid.

One step taken in the right direction was the institution of post-primary

classes in 1960, which are  to  become secondary  vocational classes next

year,  when  we expect   workshop  blocks  to  be   completed   and equipment

installed. Another decision also taken in 1960 was to have all secondary

schools running on a two-session  basis.  As  a  result,  we  have   the

reasonably  happy  situation  today  in  that   our secondary

school enrolment is nearly 90  per  cent higher  than that obtained in 1959,

all within  the short space of three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid expansion in secondary school enrolment would not have

been  possible  without   taking simultaneous  action in the large-scale

employment of  University  graduates from  the  University  of Singapore and

Nanyang University, together with the successful implementation of a crash

project scheme of one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



year  special in-service professional training  for nearly  300 graduates

in two-language media by  our Teachers'  Training College during  the  two

years 1960-62. Although  professional  training   of University

graduates has been turned over  to  the School  of Education in the

University of Singapore at  its  request, where a two-year part-time

course is  being conducted in two-language media since the last  academic

year, the valuable experience gained by   the   professional  training

of   University graduates in the T.T.C. from 1960-62 can always

be reinstituted if need be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that more than 5,000 adults, many of whom are our teachers,

have  attained  fairly   good standards  in  public examinations in the

National Language  conducted  by the Ministry  of  Education during  the

last three years is indeed a creditable achievement, which speaks well of

the sincerity and earnestness  of our people to learn  and  propagate the

use of our National Language. Whilst we  shall in  every possible way

encourage the study and  use of  our  National Language, we should at

the  same time  intensify the teaching and study of a  second language

in our schools. This is the quickest  way to  break  down  language barriers

which  are  fast tumbling  down in our many new integrated  schools.

For this year's Primary School Leaving Examination, the  second language

paper will count as  one  unit like other subjects such as Mathematics or

Science. That  is  why  we have decided that classes  for  a second language

will be conducted for as few as  15 pupils,  whereas  formerly the minimum

requirement was  25 pupils, bearing in mind that a normal class can  have

as many as 44 pupils. This new  formula will  mean  employment of more

teachers for  second language  teaching. For example, more  teachers  of

Chinese language in English medium schools will  be required, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already indicated earlier the valuable part played by

our  T.T.C. in   successfully implementing the crash project for the

professional training  of University graduates in a two-language media

during  the  years 1960-62.  This  year  our T.T.C. will launch two new

courses. First, a  two-year in-service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



course for teachers with H.S.C. qualifications. For the first time,

teachers with H.S.C. qualifications are being recruited on an enhanced

salary scale  of $225  per  month.  This is in  keeping  with  their higher

qualifications  as compared  with  teachers with  School  Certificate

qualifications  who  are recruited at $152. They will also undergo a shorter

course  of  training, namely two years  instead  of three years previously.

On completion they will  be placed on a salary bracket of $295 instead of

$240 as  hitherto. Secondly, special two-year  upgrading courses

for Malay teachers with qualifications  of Sultan Idris Training College

Certificate and Malay Women   Training   College  Certificate   will

be conducted.  It is perhaps timely for me to  express my    highest

appreciation   of   the   important contributions made by our Malay

teachers  in  their dedication  in  the task of nation building,  their

strenuous efforts in propagating the study  of  our National  Language,

and at  the  same  time  their resolve  and  determination to  improve

their  own professional standards. This indeed augurs well for the  future of

our Malay schools and for the  rapid development  of  our  National

Language  in  other language media schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise our Adult Education

Board has during  the course  of  the  last  three  years  extended

its activities  in  many ways. One prominent  extension was in the field

of secondary evening classes which have  an  enrolment of about 5,000. The

Board  has initiated   a  number  of  successful  recreational courses  as

well, and plans are in  hand  for  the institution  of workers' extension

classes  amongst trade  union  members in the near  future.  In  our efforts

to   expand  vocational   and   technical education,  we  are fortunate to

receive  valuable assistance  from  U.N.E.S.C.O. and  from  friendly

countries  like Australia, New Zealand,  Japan  and Canada   in  the

way  of  provision  of   valuable equipment, technical teachers, training

specialists and  training places in specialised fields such  as machining,

welding,  arts and crafts,  educational and vocational guidance and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



the  organisation  of  practical  examinations   of technical subjects.

Special mention must be made of technical equipment estimated at nearly $2

million which  the Australian Government has kindly  agreed to  donate  for

equipping four secondary  technical schools  and  12 secondary vocational

schools.  In addition, equipment to the value of about  $200,000 has  been

received from the Canadian Government for our  new vocational institute, the

former Balestier Junior  Trade  School,  where  craft  training   at present

being   conducted   at   the   Singapore Polytechnic will be centralised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members of the House will join me in expressing our deepest

gratitude to the peoples and governments  of  Australia  and  Canada  for

their generous  contributions of technical assistance  at this important

stage of our educational development to  keep  pace with the rapid

industrialisation  of Singapore.  Yet another interesting development

in the  field of higher education in Singapore is  the emergence  of

the Ngee Ann College  at  Clemenceau Avenue. This is a private institution

and will  use Chinese   as   the   chief   language   medium   of

instruction.  The first 400 students  have  already been  selected

and  it  is  understood  that   the official  opening of Singapore's fifth

institution of  higher  learning  will be  held  sometime  next month.

I am sure all of us in this House  and  the people  of  Singapore will

join us in  wishing  the sponsors all success in their endeavours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I briefly refer to the development and construction

of schools  which,  as indicated  in  the  speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara, is expected to reach $10 million this year. During the last three

and a half years, a total  of 28  new schools have been completed - 21 primary

and seven    secondary - with    610    classrooms    and accommodation  for

more  than  50,000  pupils.  In addition, there is a total of another 20

schools at various  stages of construction - nine primary  and 11  secondary.

They should be completed in time for next year's admissions, providing an

additional 425 classrooms or accommodation for more than 35,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



pupils. In other words, by the end of this year, we would have completed

the building of 48 new schools with 1,035 classrooms and accommodation for

no less than  85,000 pupils. It will be noted that  schools are  built

throughout the island from  rural  type single-storey   schools  to

10-storey   skyscraper schools  in  congested city areas with the  aim

of serving the needs of our people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, when merger and  Malaysia  come

into  being  by August 1963, defence  and  internal

security will be the responsibility of the  Central

Government and the Singapore Police Force  and  the

Singapore  Military Forces will be  transferred  to

the   Central  Government.  In  the  meantime,  the

Government  will  continue  to  maintain  the  high

standards  and  efficiency of the Singapore  Police

Force  and  the  Singapore  Military  Forces,   and

proceed   with   their  necessary   expansion   and

reorganisation  to  fit them for  the  increasingly

vital  and  important internal security  role  they

would  have  to play in the emergent Malaysia.  Law

and  order will be effectively maintained  and  the

good  relationship  between  the  Singapore  Police

Force and the people will be developed and built up

by every means possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued pressure against organised crime, in

particular  against secret society  gangsters,  has

successfully reduced the incidence of this type  of

crime. This is only possible because the leadership

of  the  Government  do not  run  around  with  the

criminal  elements  soliciting  their  support   in

political   campaigns.   Other   factors   may   be

attributed to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A greater degree of co-operation from the

people  and  confidence in  the  integrity  of  the

Government and the police which resulted in  better

information    and   more   accurate   intelligence

concerning criminal gangsters;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A more intelligent and effective application

of   the   Criminal   Law  (Temporary   Provisions)

Ordinance; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) More effective preventive action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, so far as the secret society gangsters

are  concerned, there has been a marked decline  in

serious   crimes,  namely  murders,  gang   fights,

riotings,  assaults, extortions and so  forth.  For

instance, in 1962, there were 10 murders as against

18,  10 and 17 in 1961, 1960 and 1959 respectively.

Whilst  there  was only one case of kidnapping  for

ransom  in  1962, there were 4, 13 and 4 cases  for

1961,  1960 and 1959 respectively. The figures  for

extortions  have also been improving very  steadily

over  the past two years, as evidenced by the  fact

that  there were 415 such cases in 1962 as compared

with  467  in  1961  and 730  in  1960,  while  the

incidence of rioting and assaults by secret society

members has also shown a definite decrease in  that

there  were  207 such cases in 1962 as against  211

for  1961,  239  for 1960, and 402 for  1959.  With

regard to crime in general, comparative figures  in

respect  of  seizable offences for the  last  three

years are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,500 cases in 1959

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,700 cases in 1960

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,200 cases in 1961

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15,700 cases in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten vigilante corps consisting of members of the

public living in the rural areas who are anxious to

assist  in  the maintenance of law and  order  have

already  been formed. The Police Cadet Corps  which

was established in schools in 1961 has increased in

strength  from  100  to 560, and  will  be  further

increased in accordance with planned development to

620 members for 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is today a significant and heartening

development  in the relations of the  Police  Force

with  the  people  whom  they  serve,  namely,  the

introduction  of  a new spirit of service  tempered

with  friendliness and approachability, which I  am

happy  to say has eliminated to a large extent  the

previous  feelings  of  distrust  and  fear   which

members  of  the  public used to have  towards  the

police.  Repeated requests have been  made  by  the

residents  in Queenstown, including the Member  for

Queenstown,  over  the last two  years  for  a  new

police  station  to  be built somewhere  nearer  to

Queenstown, a satellite town which will eventually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



cover an area of 600 acres With 17,500 flats

and  schools,  markets, clinics  and  shops  and  a

population  of 150,000. The nearest police  station

at  present  is  the Tanjong Pagar  Police  Station

which  is  too  far  away and inconvenient  to  the

people.  In  view  of  the  rapid  development   of

Queenstown   and  the  dense  con   centration   of

population, it was found desirable to site the  new

station  here  in order to serve the needs  of  the

community in the area. The proposal was included in

the  Four-Year Development Plan in 1961, and  I  am

happy  to  report  that construction  of  this  new

$400,000  divisional police station  has  commenced

early  last  month and is due to  be  completed  in

August  this  year.  The construction  of  the  new

police station here will serve to further the  good

relation between the police and the people in  that

the police personnel who will be working in the new

station  will themselves be living in  the  Housing

and Development flats among the people. Their wives

and  children will be going to the same markets and

attending  the  same  schools  as  the  wives   and

children  of  the people living in the  area.  This

close  social  contact  will  build  up  a  two-way

traffic  of  understanding and  co-operation.  This

living  together  of  police  personnel  among  the

people  is  a new trend which it is hoped  will  be

developed  in  other housing estates that  will  be

built in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raising of the 2nd Battalion of the Singapore

Infantry Regiment is proceeding apace, and will  be

up  to full strength by June this year. There will,

therefore,  be  two  regular  battalions   of   the

Singapore  Infantry Regiment fully  operational  in

addition  to  a  number  of ancillary  units  whose

regular elements, together with those of the  staff

at  Headquarters, have also been raised  so  as  to

give  the  Singapore  Military  Forces  a  balanced

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No government in the past have been so

progressive,  bold and imaginative in carrying  out

prison  reforms  along modern lines of  penalogical

thinking as the P.A.P. Government, and to that end,

has    established   a   newly   organised   prison

rehabilitation  service which would  include  staff

with   diplomas   in   social  studies   from   the

University.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pulau Senang Settlement Scheme for the

rehabilitation of secret society gangsters,  in  an

atmosphere  of  community living, without  security

walls  and  fence, has continued  to  flourish  and

expand,  and has received wide acclaim in its  role

as  the  Government's primary experiment  in  penal

research.  So  far,  375 persons have  successfully

been  rehabilitated at Pulau Senang  and  released.

The  follow-up  scheme of a Work  Brigade  Camp  at

Jalan  Damai  for  detainees  released  from  Pulau

Senang,  as the last lap in their progress  towards

rehabilitation, has also been very successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the modern dormitory system at Ulu Bedok Reformatory Training Centre for young offenders has, since its introduction in 1961, been acclaimed by penal experts visiting the State as one of the most progressive of its kind in this part of the world. It is in this same humane spirit

and  progressive outlook towards criminals that the

Government  has  now  taken  another  bold   stride

forward to demolish the outmoded Outram Road Prison

and  to  construct  new  prison  accommodation   in

Changi. As you know, Sir, the Outram Road Prison is

over a hundred years old and undoubtedly falls  far

short  of the standards expected of modern prisons.

Because   of  its  age,  it  is  not  amenable   to

renovations.  Demolition of some  of  the  existing

prison  premises within the Outram Road Prison  has

already  started,  while the  Reformative  Training

Centre  at Pearl's Bank has already been evacuated,

awaiting demolition at any time. In its place,  new

up-to-date accommodation will be provided at Changi

Prison  and  the Medium Security Prison  at  Changi

Camp  based on the modern dormitory pattern at  Ulu

Bedok.  Extensive structural alterations in  Changi

have  already been put in hand, while new buildings

which will provide the necessary extension and  up-to-date  improvement  in  prison  accommodation  in

Changi  to  replace the outmoded Outram Prison  are

being  carried  out.  When the  new  buildings  are

completed  early  in 1964, the  prison  inmates  at

Outram   Road   Prison,  including  the   political

detainees, will be able to live in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



more  congenial surroundings, with more  fresh  air

and sunshine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to improving the prison accommodation,

the  prison industries - an essential feature in the

rehabilitation   process  of   prisoners - are   also

expanding. Construction of the new $800,000  prison

laundry,  capable  of catering for  all  Government

requirements, will be completed next month,  and  a

further  100  prisoners at a  time  will  have  the

chance to learn a new trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, social welfare problems have been

dealt  with on a patch-work basis. The approach  of

the  present Government is different. We  recognise

that  the  basic  problems are unemployment,  over-crowding  and shortage of proper housing,  lack  of

facilities  for  healthy recreation,  and  lack  of

educational opportunities. To tackle these problems

at  their root, a positive and imaginative approach

is  necessary. Hence, we have chosen to concentrate

our  major  exertions on industrialisation,  merger

and     Malaysia    (which    will     speed     up

industrialisation),  on the  rapid  development  of

housing,  on the development of community  centres,

parks and youth camps, improving and increasing the

educational facilities available to the people. The

more people get jobs, have proper houses to stay in

and places of healthy recreation to go to, and have

schools for their children to attend, the less will

be  the cases needing social welfare help. Positive

social  uplift is always much better than defensive

social  welfare help. Nevertheless, for those  that

still  need social welfare assistance. The  present

Government  has  both  improved  and  extended  the

welfare  facilities obtainable by the  people.  For

example, a new creche has been opened last year  in

Mountbatten area and today working mothers in  that

neighbourhood  are  able  to  leave   their   young

children in this creche in the morning before  they

go  to work and collect them back in the evening on

their  way  home.  Besides this creche,  two  other

creches are in the process of construction - one  in

the  Bukit  Ho  Swee area, and  the  other  in  the

Rochore area - both densely populated areas. A  third

creche is being built on the ground



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



floor of the Housing and Development Board block of

fiats  in  Cantonment  Road,  Tanjong  Pagar.  When

ready, these three creches will together cater  for

nearly 500 babies and young children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of our social welfare service,

from the cradle to the grave, we are not neglecting

the welfare of the aged. Work has already begun  on

a  large rural settlement for old people at  a  30-acre  site  in Woodlands. When the first phase  has

been completed early next year. The settlement will

house  300  homeless destitutes  and  old  men  and

women.  Apart  from accommodation,  there  will  be

facilities  for  vegetable  and  flower  gardening,

animal  husbandry,  sheltered workshop  employment,

recreation and medical attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also continued to provide

assistance  to  victims  of civil  calamities.  For

instance,  in the recent Bukit Ban Kee fire,  which

took  a  toll of approximately 2,000 fire  victims,

the Government stepped in immediately to look after

the  welfare  of  those made homeless.  Within  the

short  space  of five days, the fire  victims  were

housed  in the Housing and Development Board  flats

at  low rentals and close to their former place  of

residence. This is concrete evidence of the success

of  rapid and extensive social development achieved

by  the Government and reflects also the efficiency

of the Social Welfare Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent subsidies scheme, in most cases at a

ceiling  rate of $35 per month, are being  paid  by

the Government for three months. Besides Government

relief, a Bukit Ban Kee Fire Relief Fund was set up

to  appeal for donations for the rehabilitation  of

the  fire victims, and lo date. The total collected

exceeds  $70,000,  the greater part  of  which  has

already been distributed in relief payments to  the

victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the present Government came to power in June

1959,  it  announced that statutory provisions  for

the  protection  of  workers, such  as  payment  of

workers, such as payment of overtime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



wages,  holiday pay, rest day pay,  etc, had  been

evaded  and  that strong action would be  taken  to

enforce those provisions. I am glad to say that, as

a  result  of  action taken in  pursuance  of  this

policy, widespread evasion of statutory obligations

is now a thing of the past, and if it exists, it is

almost negligible. The Labour Department up to date

has  recovered,  through  its  Labour  Inspectorate

alone,  a sum of almost half a million dollars  and

paid  it  over  to the workers concerned.  In  most

cases,  the  employers  paid  willingly  after  the

officials of the department had explained the  law.

Further,  when employers refused to, or would  not,

meet their legal obligations to their workmen,  the

workmen, encouraged by the pro-labour policy of the

Government,  and  in  many cases  helped  by  their

unions, took their claims to the two Labour  Courts

whose services are provided free of charge. One  of

these   Courts  was  expressly  set  up   by   this

Government  to  meet  the sudden  increase  in  the

number  of complaints, so that all claims could  be

dealt  with expeditiously with as little delay  and

inconvenience  to  the workers as  possible.  As  a

result,  from  June  1959 up to  date,  the  Labour

Courts  recovered  a total sum  of  almost  half  a

million dollars and paid it to the workers who came

under  the  Labour Ordinance, the Clerks Employment

Ordinance  and  the Shop Assistants  Ordinance.  It

must  also  be  mentioned  that,  during  the  same

period,  through  the good offices  of  the  Labour

Courts, a  sum of about $50,000 was  recovered  on

behalf of domestic servants who did not fall  under

the above-mentioned Ordinances but who nevertheless

sought the aid of the Labour Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the Government's declared

policy,  the building of a large centrally-situated

Trade  Union House took shape during the year.  The

piling work for the project, which will cost  $4.15

million,  began in August last year after  a  brief

ceremony  at  which  a worker  selected  by  secret

ballot  drove  the  first  pile.  The  building  is

expected to be completed by November 1964. It  will

be  styled "The Singapore Conference Hall and Trade

Union  House." It will have all the facilities  and

amenities which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



such  an  institution  should  have,  such  as   an

auditorium   for   international   conferences,   a

theatrete,  flexible conference roofs, a  reception

hall  and  lounge,  offices  for  trade  unions,  a

research  section and library, canteen  facilities,

etc.  The  building,  when completed,  will  be  an

impressive  symbol  of the solidarity  of  all  the

genuine trade unions in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the split in the trade union movement in

1961,  anti-national elements stirred up industrial

unrest  with  a view to sabotaging the Government's

industrialisation  programme   and   wrecking   the

economy  of  the State. There were 112 strikes  and

four  lock-outs  during the year - the  highest  ever

recorded since 1956. The significant point to  note

about  these stoppages is that 75 per cent of  them

occurred  during the second half of the year,  that

is  after  the  split in the trade union  movement.

From   July  onwards,  industrial  stoppages   rose

sharply and, for the last three months of the year.

There  was  an  average of 19  strikes  per  month.

Further,  a  motion on this industrial  unrest  was

introduced  in  the  Assembly  by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  and debated by the House.  However,  the

Government that caters for the task of raising  the

standard of living of the workers and ensuring that

the  people receive a fair share of the  fruits  of

industry,   went  about  its  duty  of  maintaining

industrial peace with vigour and foresight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of experience of working the

Industrial Relations Ordinance, the Government  has

made  a  number of amendments to it,  in  order  to

achieve   greater  clarity  and  remove   anomalies

arising  out  of its application. It  is  provided,

inter  alia,  that all negotiations  on  industrial

matters  shall be in accordance with the provisions

of  the  Ordinance and penalties are  provided  for

contravention thereof. This amendment was necessary

because  certain  unions were holding  negotiations

outside  the provisions of the Ordinance  and  thus

defeating the intention behind the Ordinance. It is

imperative,  in the interests of industrial  peace,

that  the  machinery provided for  the  purpose  of

settling   trade   disputes  should   be   followed

strictly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the labour situation during

the  past year has improved considerably. There was

an appreciable decrease in the number of industrial

stoppages   and  man-days  lost.  There   were   88

industrial  stoppages  with 165,000  man-days  lost

last year as against 116 stoppages with 411,000 man-days  lost  in  1961. During the last three  months

there  has been a total of only 9 stoppages.  There

was  also an appreciable decrease in the number for

trade  disputes  referred to  the  Department  last

year.  There were, 1,064 trade disputes in 1962  as

against 1,225 in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to obviate any delay in the quick and

speedy  settlement of trade disputes  submitted  to

arbitration and the certification of agreements,  a

second industrial Arbitration Court was set  up  in

October  last year. As a result of this  today  the

backlog  of  cases  has been considerably  reduced.

Last  year  the two Courts arbitrated 31 cases  and

certified 264 agreements, compared with nine  cases

and  121 agreements for the 1960-61 period. At  the

end of last month there were only 30 cases awaiting

arbitration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concrete manifestation of the Government's pro-labour policy has been the creation of the Labour

Research Unit. Trade unionists have complained that

while  employers have excellent research facilities

and  qualified personnel at their disposal to  help

them  with the presentation of their cases  in  the

Arbitration  Court, trade unions  have  been  at  a

disadvantage.  Trade unionists with  the  necessary

experience and qualifications to help trade  unions

are  few  in  number, and trade unions  possess  no

adequate research facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government considered the representation of

trade unions made through the National Trades Union

Congress,  and decided to set up a Labour  Research

Unit  staffed by qualified economists,  accountants

and  legal men. Nine trade union leaders have  been

seconded  from their places of employment to  serve

as  industrial  officers with the  Labour  Research

Unit.  The  functions of these industrial  officers

are to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



help  trade  unions with the formulation  of  their

claims in negotiations with employers and with  the

presentation  of union cases before the  Industrial

Arbitration   Court.   The  Government   has   also

requested the I.L.O. for the services of a research

specialist  to set up the research section  of  the

Unit. Trade unions have majority representation  on

the  Governing Board of this Unit. I may also state

that  the  Government regards the  Labour  Research

Unit  as  an independent body, not subject  to  any

official  control,  and which exists  primarily  to

serve  the  trade  unions. In short,  although  the

Government  pays the piper, it is the trade  unions

who call the tune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services of the Labour Research Unit are open

to  all  trade  unions, whatever their affiliations

may  be.  So  far, however, the S.A.T.U. group  of

unions  have  not cared to call on the services  of

this  Unit. I need not labour the reasons for this.

The  pro-Communist  leaders of the  S.A.T.U. group

cannot  be  expected to conduct  research  for  the

benefit  of  the  workers, and the Labour  Research

Unit,  from their point of view, is bad because  it

only  does research to justify the claims of labour

and  maintains  no connection with  the  Indonesian

Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most encouraging result of the Government's

pro-labour  policy has been the continuous  defeats

inflicted  by the workers themselves  on  the  pro-Communist  leadership of the trade union  movement.

It   is  open  knowledge  that  before  the  P.A.P.

Government took office, pro-Communists in the trade

unions  had  contrived  to secure  almost  complete

control over the non-Communist workers of Singapore

and  to use them not for the benefit of the workers

but for the benefit of the Communist cause. Because

of   the   undeniable  pro-labour  policy  of   the

Government, the Communists have failed this time to

bring  the  majority of workers in Singapore  under

their  hegemony.  For the first time  in  the  last

decade  there  exists  in  Singapore  a  vital  and

expanding  democratic alternative to the Communist-controlled  trade union movement. I  do  not  think

that the pro-Communists at the moment would dare to

deny that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



they  are rapidly losing their hold on the  workers

of  Singapore.  It  is common knowledge  that  ever

since  the split in the trade union movement  there

has  been a one-way traffic of workers of the  pro-Communist S.A.T.U. group to the non-Communist camp.

Up  to  the end of January this year, at  least  37

branches  involving  more than 3,000  workers  have

shifted  over from the S.A.T.U. group of unions  to

the  democratic  side. The process  is  continuing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(20) Wah Hong Manufacturing Co.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(21) Seng Lee Tobacco Co.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the 37 trade union branches that have

left  the pro-Communist S.A.T.U. group to join  the

democratic trade union movement. On the other hand,

a decline in the fortunes of the S.A.T.U. group can

be seen, apart from these 37, from the fact that at

the  time  of  its  formation, the  S.A.T.U. group

claimed to have the support of 80 odd trade unions,

but  it could manage to get only 14 unions to issue

a  joint  statement  on the  eve  of  the  national

referendum calling for blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the Barisan members why the eyes of

the  workers of Singapore have been opened and  why

it  is  that there is a general movement of workers

away  from  them.  In the first place,  it  is  not

possible  for  the pro-Communists to fool  all  the

workers  all the time. No amount of anti-Government

propaganda will be able to convince the majority of

the  workers  of Singapore that this Government  is

anti-labour. Our labour record is there for all  to

see   and   it  is  general  knowledge  that   this

Government  has  been responsible  for  introducing

into   Singapore   the   most  progressive   labour

legislation anywhere in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the workers of Singapore are able to see

that  the  S.A.T.U. group of trade unions  has,  in

fact,   exploited  them  for  pro-Communist   anti-national  purposes. Whenever the S.A.T.U. group  of

trade  unions indulged in industrial action,  their

purpose was not to obtain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



benefits  for  the  workers, but to  convert  every

industrial action into a political campaign against

the  Government.  As  a  result  of  the  Communist

handling of trade disputes, innocent workers  found

themselves embroiled not only with the employer but

also with the law and the police. It is needless to

say that this was precisely the strategy of the pro-communist  S.A.T.U. leaders  to  ensure  that  the

workers  did find themselves so embroiled.  On  the

other  hand,  the  non-Communist  trade  unions  of

Singapore  have  also initiated industrial  action,

but  they  have  always taken care to  ensure  that

industrial disputes remained industrial  in  nature

and   were   not  converted  into  instruments   of

political action. The democratic trade unions  have

also  had  greater  recourse  to  the  conciliation

machinery  provided by the Labour Ministry  and  to

the  processes  of arbitration. One  of  the  major

reasons  why  workers  in  increasing  numbers  are

leaving  the  Communist  fold  is  that  they  have

discovered  for  themselves that the  non-Communist

labour  movement, simply because of its intelligent

and  responsible  attitude to trade  disputes,  has

been  able to secure much better benefits  for  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the S.A.T.U. group are failing and will

continue  to fail for the good reason that  workers

are  beginning to realise that the S.A.T.U. leaders

are not genuine trade unionists but political prize

fighters  in  the  cause of foreign  anti-Malaysian

forces.  The  S.A.T.U. group will  inevitably  fail

because the workers of Singapore cannot be expected

to  trust those who show a greater affinity to  the

Communists  of  Indonesia than to  the  progressive

forces  of Malaysian nationalism. It will not  have

escaped the attention of Members of this House  and

of  the  workers of Singapore that  the  S.A.T.U.

group of trade unionists have not cared, so far, to

publicly  deny their sympathies with the  Communist

Party  of  Indonesia. I can assure the  workers  of

Singapore  that they will not get any  such  denial

from  S.A.T.U. for the good reason that the charges

are true.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the stock accusations of the pro-Communist

S.A.T.U. group  of  trade  unions  is  that   the

Government has failed to support the unification of

the  trade  union movement. When the pro-Communists

talked   about  unification  of  the  trade   union

movement, they mean the control of the movement  by

the front agents of the Malayan Communist Party. It

is  surely  impossible to expect the Government  to

help  the  Communists to gain control of the  trade

union movement on the pretext of unification and to

surrender the non-Communist majority of the workers

of  Singapore  to  the tender  mercies  of  foreign

inspired    anti-national    elements.    In    the

circumstances, it is better that there should be  a

clear  demarcation between pro-Communists and  non-Communists in the trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to encourage the

genuine unification of the trade union movement but

on  the  basis of democratic and independent  trade

unionism. We have no doubt that in the final result

the  labour  movement  of  Singapore  will  be   so

unified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat here the Government's

assurance  that it has not discriminated  and  will

not  discriminate, against those  innocent  workers

who  still find themselves within the pro-Communist

orbit so long as they observe the provisions of the

law  and  press their claims within the context  of

the  Industrial Relations Ordinance. The Government

also  repeats its warning to employers not to  take

advantage  of  the recent arrests of  pro-Communist

trade  union leaders in order to victimise  workers

who  have  the misfortune to belong to the S.A.T.U.

group of trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to ensure industrial

justice to all workers irrespective of their  trade

union  affiliations. However, we have no  intention

of  allowing pro-Communist trade union  leaders  to

mislead the workers into breaking the provisions of

the  law  and will come down with a heavy  hand  on

those leaders if they decide to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single matter in the speech which

could   impress   us   in   connection   with   the

Government's  policies in the  future,  except  for

matters which can be considered routine - old  matter

repeated; for instance, the construction of houses,

installation of standpipes, street lights,  etc.  I

think,  as  I  have said earlier,  that  these  are

normal  matters which can be heard over the  radio,

and quite recently through television, and also can

be  read  from pamphlets issued by the Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing this policy speech, I should like to

stress, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what impresses  me

is  that we discover that at the end of the  speech

there is an appeal to the leaders, particularly to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



Members   of   this   Assembly,   to   share    the

responsibility with the Government to  nurture  the

healthy democratic system in our State. To me  this

is  something relatively new, for the Government to

exhort,  to  appeal  to  Members  of  this   House,

particularly  with  reference  to  the   Opposition

Members.  Nobody can deny that the  Government  for

the past three and a half years or so has, in fact,

considered  the  Opposition Members  as  cannot  be

relied upon to co-operate with the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs to give a full list of persons arrested in Singapore and detained under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya since 2nd February, 1963, stating (i) the name, sex and age of each detainee; (ii) their occupations, or organisations they

belong  to;  (iii)   the date,  time  and  place  of

arrest;  (iv)  their exact places of detention;  (v)

what  time after arrest were the families  informed

of  the whereabouts of the detainees; and (vi)  when

were their families permitted to visit them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The supply of the list asked

for is not in the interest of security. Most of the

names  are  already  known to  the  Press  and  the

public.  A few top-ranking cadres are from time  to

time  discovered and no benefit should be given  to

the Communist organisations in letting them know of

intelligence progress. Members of the  families  of

detainees   were  informed  officially   by   press

notification  on  5th  February,  1963,  that  they

should  contact the Special Branch to  arrange  for

visits  to  detainees. The first of the visits  was

allowed on 8th February, 1963.
