<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Sir, as there are no statutory requirements

under  the Companies Act (Chapter 185) or the  Bus

Services Licensing Authority Act, 1971, for owners

and  management staff of the Singapore Bus Service

Ltd  to  declare to the Ministry of Communications

"their  vested  interests in  finance,  insurance,

motor  garages, motor repair shops, petrol service

stations,  tyre shops, motor spare part shops  and

other  concerns  which have  dealings  with  SBS",

before SBS was issued with licences to operate  on

the   approved  routes  under  the  Bus   Services

Licensing  Authority Act, there was no  cause  for

them to inform me of their interests, if any.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during the course of the weekly meetings

of   the  Bus  Services  Reorganisation  Committee

(BSRC) since October, 1973, SBS's interests in two

companies  which appear to have a bearing  on  SBS

operations did come to my notice, namely:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) At the BSRC meeting on 18th December, 1973,

information was given that two directors of  Green

Bus Company, which Company constitutes part of the

United Bus Co, and which in turn forms a component

part of SBS, would appear to be closely associated

with Soon Chow Corpn. (Pte) Ltd which is known  to

build the bodywork of many new buses for SBS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) On 19th March, 1974, information was made

available  to the BSRC that the Managing  Director

of   SBS   is  also  a  Director  of  Inter-Island

Transport Maintenance (Pte) Ltd, which was  formed

to  enable SBS to maintain its fleet of  buses  as

well as to purchase spare parts more expeditiously

and  get on with the early repair of a large  part

of  its  immobilised  bus fleet,  as  the  present

method  of ordering spare parts through agents  of

17  different makes of buses proved unsatisfactory

because  of  great  price  fluctuations  and  also

inability  to deliver on schedule for  the  orders

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the fact that one of the conditions

for  the  bus  fare  revision  authorised  by   my

Ministry  on  10th  February, 1974,  has  fixed  a

ceiling to the annual profits which SBS would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



allowed to earn over the next three years (namely,

8% of its net assets, i.e, net book value of Buses

less  Hire  purchase obligations) as certified  by

its  auditors,  BSRC has since been instructed  to

request  all  shareholders and  senior  management

staff who have the authority to make purchases  or

authorise  repairs and services for  SBS  to  make

such  declarations of their interests  in  related

business,  to the Bus Services Licensing Authority

within  one  month. Amending legislation  will  be

introduced   soon,   to  make  such   declarations

mandatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang can be assured that all

reasonable  steps will be taken by my Ministry  to

ensure that SBS and its associated companies, when

disclosed,  will  conduct their  activities  in  a

proper  and  business-like manner, and should  any

action   against  public  interest  be  discovered

whoever  responsible will be suitably  dealt  with

under the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Kallang may be aware that

present   legislation   requires   Directors    of

Companies  to  make  full  disclosure   of   their

respective  interests at meetings  when  contracts

with  the  company  are being  dealt  with,  under

section  131  of  the Companies  Act  (Cap.  185).

Failure on the part of directors to disclose  such

material  interests, if brought to the  notice  of

the  Registrar of Companies, can render the person

liable   for  appropriate  penalties   under   the

Companies Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head LK be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1107*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that in the past few

years  the Primary Production Department has  made

useful  contributions  towards  the  promotion  of

agriculture.  For  instance,  the  Department  has

introduced   the  immunisation  of  poultry,   the

introduction of fine breeds and also the  teaching

of  modern  and scientific methods of  agriculture

and  poultry-keeping so as to benefit the farmers.

However,  we  are  faced with the  basic  problem,

namely,  the  shortage  of  land  for  agriculture

development.  Therefore,  we  have  to  depend  on

import  of  vegetables, fish, and other foods  for

which we have to pay foreign exchange. Because  of

this,  the yearly foreign exchange that  we  spend

amounts   to  several  hundreds  of  millions   of

dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of world-wide inflation and high

prices   I   feel  that  the  Primary   Production

Department  should take up more responsibility  in

the provision of daily necessities so as to enable

our  people to buy goods at reasonable prices.  In

what  fields can the Primary Production Department

be  of any service? I feel there are three aspects

of  work  which  it  can  do:  (1)  the  extensive

planting of certain vegetables, including potatoes

and  mushrooms,  in some villages  or  in  certain

islands  so  as to lower the cost of  agricultural

products; (2) to develop fresh water fish breeding

and  deep-sea fishing so as to save some  tens  of

million dollars on foreign exchange: and,  (3)  to

develop a tropical fish market on a large scale in

order  to  get  a  substantial amount  of  foreign

exchange  for  our  country.  At  this   time   of

inflation   I   feel  that  these  schemes   would

contribute  towards  national  savings   and   the

development of new sources of income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that orchid growing is a new industry

which will also bring in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>

substantial income. In recent years we  know  that

orchid  cultivation is making  great  progress  in

rural areas. In our country, the history of orchid

growing goes back to some 40 years. First, we must

give  credit  to  the authorities of  the  Botanic

Gardens  for  their efforts on orchid growing  and

cultivation. Today many people have taken the  cue

and have since been growing orchids. Today we have

many hybrids and varieties of quality orchids  and

we  are  well  known for orchid cultivation.  Even

Hawaiian  orchids are not comparable to ours  now.

Here  the  Primary Production Department has  made

great contributions. There is another aspect which

we  can be proud of. The Currency Board has chosen

our orchids as the design for our currency notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a substantial amount of foreign

exchange  through the sale of orchids. If  we  can

pay  more  attention to the development of  orchid

growing  and a wider market, we will achieve  even

more.  Therefore, I would like to suggest  to  the

Minister  concerned to set up an  organisation  to

help  the  farmers  in the marketing  of  orchids.

According to a survey, Europeans and Americans are

fond  of orchids. For example, West Germany  alone

exports   various  kinds  of  flowers  to  various

countries  amounting to S$850  million  per  year.

According  to  calculation, our  total  export  of

orchids  is about US$6 to US$7 million,  which  is

about 3 per cent of that of West Germany, which is

our  major market. In addition to this, there  are

other   markets  in  West  Europe.  So   we   must

intensively  develop our export markets.  I  would

suggest  to the Minister to set up a special  unit

in  the Primary Production Department and vest  it

with special duties to develop foreign markets for

orchids  and other kinds of flowers. We  may  then

give more attention to our small farmers who plant

flowers, so that they may be cared for and not  be

exploited   by  the  middlemen.  Next,   we   must

extensively   develop  the   methods   of   orchid

planting.  Though  we  are short  of  agricultural

land,  we  still  have a certain number  of  farms

available for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>

the   planting   of  orchids.   This   aspect   of

agriculture has many good points. (1) It does  not

lead  to  pollution  of the  air.  (2)  It  has  a

beneficial contribution towards water. (3) We  can

earn  much  foreign exchange through  the  use  of

small  capital  investment on non-productive  land

and also utilising manpower to our benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister will urge the Primary

Production  Department to  develop  this  type  of

agriculture in order to get more foreign  exchange

for our country.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

because  of  the present inflation  in  Singapore,

what  steps are being taken to produce and to grow

more  crops  locally? We cannot be self-sufficient

in  all types of food products; but we can  be  on

some  of them. What effort is being made to ensure

that  we  are  self-sufficient in  poultry,  pigs,

eggs,  fish, etc.? With proper farming, we can  be

self-sufficient in vegetables too.  If  those  who

live  in  houses with a garden are  encouraged  to

grow  vegetables, the inflated price of vegetables

in  the markets can be lowered considerably.  Just

to  quote an instance, today at the Kandang Kerbau

Market, the cost of two red chillies is 10  cents.

Normally, you can get about 15 chillies  for  that

price. Imagine the difference in real value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that our vegetable gardens are

gradually   being   pushed  out.   What   is   the

possibility  of  putting up vegetable  gardens  in

flatted  farms?  Has  the Minister  thought  about

that?  The roof-top of every housing block can  be

rented out to farmers to plant vegetables.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

some of my farmers in Potong Pasir are affected by

urban  renewal. It is strange that  those  farming

some  0.5  hectare  of land,  or  less,  were  not

considered  bona  fide  farmers  by  the   Primary

Production Department. Because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



of  this, they did not receive compensation

normally paid to bona fide farmers, either in  the

form of cash, a free HDB flat, or alternative land

to   cultivate.  I  cannot  fathom  the  rationale

governing   the  Primary  Production  Department's

determination  of  bona  fide  farmers   and   the

necessity to differentiate farmers. Is one of  the

reasons  that  of avoiding paying compensation?  I

would  be most pleased if the Hon. Minister  could

enlighten me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, a farmer is bona fide, whether he

tills 0.5 or 1.0 hectare of land. He should not be

discriminated against for being poorer. He  sweats

and  toils, just tilling the land, perhaps harder,

to   provide   Singaporeans  with   fresh,   green

vegetables.  He has no other means  of  earning  a

living.  The Primary Production Department  merely

confuses  the poor hardworking farmer  by  telling

him that he is not a bona fide farmer. How can  he

figure   this  out  when,  in  actual  fact,   his

occupation is farming? Imagine the farmer  willing

to  assist  the Government by moving  out  of  the

land,  which provides him with his livelihood,  to

spend  the rest of his days in the confines  of  a

HDB  flat,  and  yet  he is denied  the  right  of

compensation  as a farmer. Why is  the  Government

denying him this right to live and enjoy the  just

rewards of his hard work by refusing to compensate

him as a bona fide farmer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  I  am  the  Member  of  Parliament   of   a

constituency, half of which is rural, I feel  that

it  is  necessary for me to reflect in this  House

the  poor  plight of our farmers.  I  believe  the

Member  for Chua Chu Kang will also have the  same

feeling, although he is not in the House yet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of our farmers are rustic folks of

great    forbearance.   They   are    law-abiding,

hardworking, and their only aspiration in life  is

to  earn  three  comfortable  meals  a  day.  They

neither  play  with power, nor do they  manipulate

our  market.  So  when there is a manipulation  of

prices of farm products in Singapore, the greatest

victims of such manipulation are the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when prices of farm produce fall, who

extends  a helping hand to the farmers?  But  when

there  is a slight rise in prices, everybody tries

to  keep  it  down.  For  example,  a  scheme  was

introduced to stop slaughtering pigs for two  days

a  week, and there was even the lifting of  import

duty  on  frozen  chicken and the lifting  of  the

import  ban  of  pigs from other countries.  As  a

result  of  such measures, our farmers  have  been

very hard hit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the world seems to be unduly

harsh  and unfair to farmers in Singapore. We  are

very  hard hit by imported inflation and we cannot

do  anything  about  it.  The  20,000  farmers  in

Singapore are also affected because they  have  to

pay  more for their daily necessities. In the case

of  employed workers, they have the 9 per cent and

$25 recommended by the National Wages Council. But

who  is  there to look after the poor farmers  and

help them fight inflation? So it is fair that when

there  is  a  little rise in the  prices  of  farm

produce, attempts are made to suppress it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is becoming increasingly difficult to

engage  in farming activities in Singapore because

of  the diminishing returns of farm land. Although

a  lot of land has been acquired from the farmers,

they are resettled in a much smaller plot of land.

Furthermore,   the  rate  of  compensation   still

remains the same, despite the increase in the cost

of  building construction and materials in  recent

years. This has also made it difficult for farmers

affected by resettlement to build their own  farms

and farm-houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our labour shortage has also

affected farmers because it is difficult for  them

to engage help on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



farm.  So  they will have to pay higher  wages  to

engage  farm help. This is another item that  adds

to their burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, furthermore there is the question of the

rise  in  the  price of animal feed.  Animal  feed

dealers  have  not only increased  the  prices  of

their  products but they have also asked for  cash

from  the farmers instead of allowing them credit.

Because of this difficulty, the cost of production

has definitely gone up, and if no help is rendered

to  the poor farmers, I am afraid they will suffer

in   the  end.  Sir,  if  what  is  left  of   our

agriculture  cannot be developed or even  continue

to exist, it will be a great tragedy for Singapore

because  it  will mean that all the  consumers  in

Singapore will have to pay more for imported  farm

products. The situation will then be much worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is quite right that because of

geographical  limitation,  we  do  not  depend  on

farming  and  agriculture for  a  living.  But  it

cannot be denied that farming activities are  also

an  asset to our national wealth because they help

to solve our unemployment problem on the one hand,

and  they  help  to  balance the  prices  of  farm

products imported from overseas on the other hand.

Without  agricultural activities in our farms,  we

will  have  to pay at least 30 cents  for  an  egg

imported  from abroad. Therefore, every assistance

must  be  given to our farmers to enable  them  to

increase   their   production,  so   that   higher

productivity  will help to bring down  prices  and

the  cost  of living in Singapore thereby  helping

our consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our agriculture is now in great

difficulties. It is only the Government that is in

a   position  to  revive  agriculture   which   is

declining in Singapore. I would like to take  this

opportunity  to  ask the Government  to  extend  a

helping   hand   to   the   development   of   our

agriculture. It should not be allowed to  swim  or

to sink by itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Member  for

Jurong  in  regard to his views on agriculture  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past one or two years, many

countries  in  the world have suffered  from  food

shortages. Worldwide inflation has affected all of

us  in Singapore, particularly those who depend on

imported  goods. The cost of living  in  Singapore

has also risen because of this. In respect of food

supply, the Primary Production Department has over

the  years encouraged farmers in Singapore to work

hard  and  to help them with all kinds of  farming

aids.  As  a  result we have been able to  achieve

self-sufficiency in the supply of  pigs,  chicken,

and eggs. But because of the fantastic rise in the

price  of animal feed, the prices of farm products

have  also  been affected. So if we had  neglected

our  agricultural sector, our cost of living would

have risen still higher, because we will then have

to  depend  entirely  on the importation  of  farm

produce  and  other consumer goods as  well.  That

would  add  further  to what is  already  a  heavy

burden on our people. Sir, if this had happened we

would  have  lost  at  least  by  way  of  foreign

exchange. So the contribution made by our  farmers

cannot be denied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem I would like to bring to the

attention  of  the  Minister is  the  question  of

change  of employment of our farmers. We all  know

that  most of our farmers in Singapore are in  the

age  group  of 40 to 50. Because of  a  change  of

circumstances,  such  as  measures  taken  by  the

Government  to  protect our water resources  which

make  it  difficult for farmers to carry on  their

farming  activities, then these farmers will  have

no choice but to change their employment. But with

their  limited  qualification and experience,  and

age, it will be difficult for these old farmers to

change  their jobs. As a result, their  livelihood

will  become  problematic and, from the  point  of

view  of  our  national economy,  that  will  also

constitute a great loss of our manpower.  Sir,  it

is  my belief that our enlightened Government will

not  allow  our small and medium-size  farmers  to

sink or to swim by themselves, and every help will

be given them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Singapore has to import



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



a   good  number  of  agricultural  products  from

neighbouring  countries, and the prices  of  these

agricultural  products  are  rising   higher   and

higher. In view of this fact, I am enquiring  from

the Hon. Minister whether he would care to make  a

feasibility  study of using a  few  of  our  small

neighbouring islands for agricultural farming.  If

it  is  feasible, the farmers will be  interested.

Could the Minister please give consideration?



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  the banning of the importation of livestock

from  neighbouring  countries on  account  of  the

outbreak  of  foot-and-mouth  disease,  there   is

little  or no fresh beef for sale in many  of  our

markets. We have to import most of our frozen meat

from countries like New Zealand, Australia and the

USA.  The  prices  of frozen meat  have  increased

considerably over the past year, thus contributing

to  the  high  cost of living. We are  aware  that

there  is  a  joint project between Singapore  and

Indonesia  on Batam island where cattle is  raised

for  eventual  importation into Singapore.  May  I

know   from   the  Minister  what  is  the   total

investment  contributed by Singapore, and  whether

the  cattle raised in this joint project  will  be

sufficient  to meet the needs of beef  consumption

in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Members have rested well over the week-end, they have come back

afresh. Perhaps we should have carried on until  8

o'clock  on  Friday, but it  is  not  my  wish  to

silence them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply, I shall go backwards and start with

the Member for Toa Payoh, who has complained about

the  lack  of fresh beef in the markets.  This  is

obvious because there was an outbreak of foot-and-mouth  disease sometime back and, as a result,  we

had  to slaughter about 400 head of cattle.  There

have also been complaints why we have stopped  the

import  of  cattle. The answer is obvious:  it  is

because  of the foot-and-mouth disease.  Otherwise

it will spread throughout Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the project on Batam island, we have

invested  nothing. It is completely an  Indonesian

project  with  Australian assistance -  Australian

cattle.  The  cattle is already there.  If  it  is

imported into Singapore, Batam island will be used

as  a  quarantine station. In other words, if  the

cattle there is free of the foot-and-mouth disease

it  can then come straight into Singapore and  not

necessarily into our quarantine station in Jurong.

At  the  moment they are still breeding the cattle

on  Batam island. I do not think they have  enough

head of cattle for export to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, he wants to

know why we do not farm on the islands. There  are

already  some  farmers  in Pulau  Ubin  and  Pulau

Tekong. But it is not easy to get the farmers from

the  main  island  to farm on  the  other  islands

around Singapore because it means transporting the

products  across  the  sea. This  takes  time  and

money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong made his usual speech on

the  Budget.  Can I deal with one point  that  was

raised  by him, and that is, the question  of  the

lifting  of  quota on chickens? This was  done  in

order  to bring the price down. But this  was  not

done  by my Ministry because we are not in  charge

of the quota. However, we have warned the Ministry

of  Finance  of the dangers of leaving that  quota

too  long. Our prime concern, like the Member  for

Jurong,  is the protection of our farmers.  Having

seen  the  poultry industry grow to such a  strong

position that we export chickens and eggs  -  this

was not easily done, but done over many years - we

are  naturally conscious to see that this industry

is  not  affected by foreign competition. We  have

already  warned the Ministry of Finance  of  these

dangers and we are keeping a finger on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir talked about bona

fide farmers. If someone keeps a few chickens  and

a  pig in his backyard for the Chinese New Year or

Christmas,  that  does not make him  a  bona  fide

farmer, especially if he works in Jurong or drives

a taxi. By a "bona



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



fide  farmer", we mean a farmer who genuinely does

farming.  There  are, of course, genuine  or  bona

fide  farmers.  But there are also people  who  do

farming  part-time just to have eggs for breakfast

or chicken for the week-end. They do not depend on

farming completely as a means of subsistence,  and

that is why we say they are not bona fide farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wants the Primary Production

Department to grow vegetables on the roof-tops  of

Housing Board flats. It is an ingenious idea,  but

it  has  practical difficulties.  The  Member  for

Sembawang  wants the Primary Production Department

to  find  a market for orchids. There are  already

several  orchid  exporters in Singapore  who  have

their  contacts overseas, and hence the export  of

orchids  brings in considerable foreign  exchange.

But   it   is   not  for  the  Primary  Production

Department to compete with these firms. No one  is

prevented  from exporting orchids if he  can  find

the right contacts overseas. As for fishing, there

is  a  Fisheries Research Station at Changi and  I

would  be happy to show the Member around.  If  he

goes there he will see that fish are reared. There

are  also the giant fresh water prawns. The  young

fish  and  prawns  are  sold  to  the  farmers  or

fishermen for breeding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year the Primary Production Department is

asked  to  help farmers. Well, it does help  them.

But  there is a shortage of land in Singapore, and

there are priorities. The town itself is expanding

and with the creation of new towns like Toa Payoh,

Queenstown and Woodlands, there is less  land  for

farming. But the Department is not asleep. It  has

the  Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory  at  Kampung

Java which provides routine diagnosis of pigs  and

poultry  which  have died. It finds  out  what  is

wrong  and  tells  the farmers.  Specific  disease

control  schemes  are  conducted  by  the  Primary

Production  Department. There is also the  control

of   pullorum  disease  in  poultry,   and   swine

brucellosis  in  pigs,  a  disease  which   causes

abortions  in  fertility,  resulting  in  loss  of

production.  We have a scheme which enables  farms

to get rid of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



disease.   We   have  also  a  free  swine   fever

vaccination   service,   a   poultry   vaccination

service, a plant protection service, and there are

10   treatment   centres   strategically   located

throughout the island providing treatment services

to  pig and poultry farmers on the island. We even

have  training facilities and both ad hoc training

and   organised  training  are  conducted  by  the

Department to enable farmers to learn more  recent

techniques   on  farming,  breeding  and   disease

control.  The  Farm  School at  Sembawang  is  one

example  of  organised training conducted  by  the

Department, it runs a one-year residential  course

and  trainees  can choose one of  three  subjects,

animal husbandry, horticulture or fish culture for

specialisation.  The school  has  turned  out  173

graduates  who are now either managing  their  own

farms   or  gainfully  employed  in  the   primary

production sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be interested to know that the

Department has successfully experimented with  the

cultivation of straw mushroom, and yields of up to

15  per  cent of the weight of the growing  medium

have been obtained. The Department has also run  a

number  of  courses for the public, and there  are

now   a   few  commercial  farms  producing  straw

mushrooms.  A limiting factor to this  development

is  the  lack of padi-straws, the medium used  for

cultivating  the mushroom. But the  Department  is

now   experimenting  with  substitutes,  such   as

sawdust,  cotton  waste, coconut fibre  and  paper

waste. The results are inconclusive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for hydroponics, the Department has

successfully experimented with the cultivation  of

high  value  crops, such as capsicum,  under  this

system.  Yields of up to one pound per  plant  per

crop  may be obtained, and with three crops  in  a

year.   The   Department  is  now  extending   its

experiments  to leafy vegetables, and  these  have

shown  encouraging results. Yields are much higher

than  those produced from the conventional methods

of cultivation. The Department is now intensifying

its  efforts  to  transmit  its  findings  to  the

private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fishing port at Jurong, Members will

remember the opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



we  met  when  the port was first opened  and  the

fishmongers had to shift to Jurong. But I am happy

to  say  that,  since  its  opening  in  1969,  an

increasing number of fishing vessels have made use

of  the  port  facilities. The number  of  fishing

vessels  visiting the port in 1973 was  only  387,

and  last year numbered 659. The fishing port  has

attracted  fishing vessels not only from  our  own

Republic but also those from Japan, Taiwan,  Korea

and  Russia. About 2,000 local fishermen and 4,000

fish  merchants  and retailers  make  use  of  the

market  facilities. Members will be interested  to

know   too  that  seven  factories  are   now   in

production, producing filleted fish meat and  fish

meal for animal feed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, I was not talking about one pig,

two  chickens and three ducks. I was actually  not

talking about animal farming at all. I was talking

about  vegetable farming, not on just  one  square

metre of land but about 0.5 hectare of land tilled

by  the  farmers  in Potong Pasir.  They  are  not

considered  bona  fide farmers although  vegetable

farming is their only means of livelihood, and  in

addition  licences  were issued  to  them  by  the

Primary  Production Department.  I  was  wondering

whether the Minister could enlighten me as to  why

they   are  not  receiving  any  compensation   as

farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, anyone who is paid compensation

must be a bona fide farmer. If he grows vegetables

cases of that nature in Potong Pasir, perhaps  the

Member could give me specific instances and I will

look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred to pigs and poultry because that is

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head MA be

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within the past three years, I was admitted

into   hospital   twice  and  I  have   first-hand

knowledge  of  what I am going to  say  about  the

yeoman's  service  that  is  being  given  by  our

nursing  staff.  In any large establishment  there

are  bound to be some black sheep. But amongst our

nursing   corps,  I  found  that  the  number   of

unsatisfactory  staff is negligible.  Having  said

that,  I  would  like to point  Out  a  number  of

grievances of the hardworking nursing staff  which

can   be  rectified  without  much  cost  to   the

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One very common grouse is that the quality of

uniforms  and  shoes provided  is  generally  very

poor. They are badly tailored, shoddily made, ill-fitting, and on top of it several trips have to be

made to the suppliers or contractors to obtain the

required  uniforms or shoes. All this in spite  of

the fact that, I am sure, we pay these contractors

and suppliers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N. Govindasamy, the Minister for

Health  is not a fashion designer of uniforms  for

nursing staff!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> He is not, Sir, but he is

responsible  for the payment for what  the  nurses

are  supplied with. If we pay for shoes, we expect

to  get fitting shoes. If we pay for uniforms,  we

expect to get uniforms that can be worn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is this part of the Ministry's

policy?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> It is at least part of the

Ministry's  policy,  Sir.  The  Minister  and  his

mandarins at Palmer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



Road  do  not  seem to be aware of this  poor  and

unreliable   service  given  by   the   Ministry's

suppliers. Nor are they aware that sometimes  some

nurses have to stump up from their own pockets  to

supplement their inadequate supply of uniforms and

shoes.  For instance, district nurses and midwives

have  to make rounds to private homes in the rural

areas, and they should therefore be supplied  with

additional shoes and uniforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that there are far too many

Assistant  Nurses  with practically  no  promotion

prospects at all in our Government health service.

In  fact, I am told there are only eight posts  of

Senior  Assistant Nurses for the  1,800  Assistant

Nurses  in  service  now. A  number  of  Assistant

Nurses can and should be given the opportunity  to

undergo  training  to  be Staff  Nurses.  Although

these   Assistant   Nurses  have   the   necessary

educational  qualifications, they  have  not  been

given the opportunity. One begins to wonder,  Sir,

if  this is not deliberately intended to ensure  a

constant supply of Assistant Nurses to provide the

necessary nursing service at a cut-rate salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Cut-throat!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Cut-rate, so that their

throats  can  be cut! Sir, because of the  limited

number  of  post graduate vacancies and  to  avoid

delay in getting their post basic training in  the

preferred  specialty, some Staff Nurses choose  to

go  abroad  on no-pay leave for such training.  On

rejoining the service after completion of the post

graduate   course,   they  are  neither   accorded

incremental    credits    for    the    additional

qualifications obtained nor is their no-pay  leave

period considered in the pension calculations. The

additional qualifications they have obtained, Sir,

benefit   the  service  and  yet  they  lose   out

financially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have noticed that in the hospital wards,

in  many instances, there is only one Staff  Nurse

in  each shift duty, the rest are Assistant Nurses

or  Student  Nurses. If more than one  patient  is

taken  seriously ill, or if two or three  patients

are  critical, then pandemonium prevails. If there

is a shortage of nursing staff,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



why  is  it  that  in  some hospitals  nurses  are

required  to  copy  out  in  their  own  laborious

handwritting Gazette notifications or departmental

circulars concerning them? Surely a lot of nursing

time  could be saved if such notices or  circulars

are cyclostyled by the administrative staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the nurses prefer a three-night shift which

is  less strenuous than the old seven-night  shift

system.  Although this system has been implemented

in  some hospitals there are other hospitals which

still  follow the old seven-night shift system.  I

do not know why this is so.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, since the increase in

charges for out-patient treatment, members of  the

public find that visits to out-patient clinics are

extremely  costly and a great financial strain  at

times.  I  agree with the Government that  whoever

makes use of the medical services must pay a token

share  towards  the cost, to check  abuse  in  the

unnecessary  use  of  these  services.  A  patient

visiting  the out-patient clinic pays $2 (the  fee

is $3 at the General Hospital) on his first visit,

and  quite  often the doctor asks the  patient  to

come back for further check-ups or treatment.  All

these  subsequent visits cost $2 each. Such second

visits,   where  the  doctor  sees   whether   the

prescribed treatment is correct or effective,  can

last  only 5 or 10 seconds. The patient still pays

the usual charges. There are also occasions when a

doctor  refers his patient to another unit on  the

same  day, and yet the patient has to pay  at  two

places,  though it is for treatment  of  the  same

sickness. Is it possible to waive the charges  for

these  second visits, or at least reduce  them  in

order  to reduce the strain on the pockets of  the

poor?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Service in Singapore must be one of

the  most  unpopular professions for any  aspiring

young  man  of  Singapore. Despite promotions  and

other incentives, doctors still continue to resign

at an alarming rate. Can it be that this is not so

much  a  problem of finance but rather  a  problem

associated with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



working  conditions? We still hear of  doctors  on

duty for 24 hours. I wonder if any Members of  the

House  have  experienced 24-hour duty shifts.  How

can a doctor perform his best during the second 12-hour   shift,  when  he  would  have  been   tired

physically  and  mentally? As a result  I  believe

that  some  of  them do not diagnose the  sickness

thoroughly, and thereby patients become worse. Can

something  be  done about these  abnormal  working

conditions,  before  there  is  more  brain  drain

towards  the  private  sector  or  even  to  other

countries?  Sometimes offers of money  alone  will

not  work. The conditions must be right.  Can  the

Minister  give  us  the rate of  resignations  per

month?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Medical Service has a restriction on the

recruitment of doctors who are trained in  certain

countries,  unless they have passed an examination

locally. Can the Minister enlighten the House with

facts and figures? Since the introduction of  this

restriction,  how many recruits in  this  category

have  applied,  and  how  many  have  passed   the

examinations  so  far? Is it  possible  to  revise

these  restrictions  on  some  foreign  university

degrees which have attained worldwide recognition?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, the main topic

that I would like to bring up has been touched  on

by  the  Member for Anson. If the Minister agrees,

may  I  raise it now, or would he rather prefer  I

raise it later?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you going to speak on the

Ministry's policy?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> I would be touching on the

subject of resignation of doctors.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Then it would be better if you

speak on amendment (4)* when it comes up.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (4), standing in hte name of Dr Ong Leong Boon, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head MA in respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I refer to the Member

for Telok Blangah first? He has raised this matter

of  uniforms of nurses. As a matter of  policy,  I

would like to assure him, first of all, that it is

not  my  policy to issue ill-fitting uniforms  and

ill-fitting shoes to our dedicated nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just move on to the other matters which

have been raised? The first point he has raised is

that  there are too many Assistant Nurses  around,

and  he  thinks  that we are taking  in  too  many

Assistant Nurses in order to exploit them. That is

certainly  not true. In fact, it is not true  that

there  are  more  Assistant Nurses than  qualified

Staff Nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Member has brought up

is   that   Assistant  Nurses  have  very   little

prospects  for  promotion or  transfer  to  become

student Staff Nurses. In fact, there is no lack of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



promotional  prospects for  them.  Promotion  from

Assistant Nurse to Senior Assistant Nurse is based

on  merit and not necessarily based on the  number

of  vacant posts. There are also opportunities for

Assistant  Nurses who do well in  examinations  to

join as student Staff Nurses in the second year of

the  three-year Staff Nurse course. This is  again

based  on examination results. Those who score  70

per  cent  and  above are allowed  to  join  these

courses.  Another  opportunity also  is  given  to

serving Assistant Nurses who have failed to  score

70  per  cent  but on the basis of good  work  are

allowed  to  join the student Staff Nurse  course.

They are paid full salary while on this course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised is the three-night shift

system for nurses in our hospitals. As a matter of

fact, the Ministry of Health agreed to reduce  the

seven-night duty cycle to a three-night duty cycle

for  nurses. This was agreed to in principle  with

the union concerned, with the qualification that a

pilot  scheme  should, in the first  instance,  be

introduced at the Outram Road General Hospital. To-date,  some hospitals have been able to  implement

completely  this three-night duty cycle  They  are

the   Outram  Road  General  Hospital,  Middle-ton

Hospital,  and  the  Trafalgar  Home.  Some  other

hospitals, however, like the Woodbridge  Hospital,

Kandang  Kerbau Hospital, and Thomson Road General

Hospital have partially introduced the three-night

duty  shifts.  The point is that  it  is  not  the

Ministry of Health that does not want to introduce

the  three-night shift in all the  hospitals.  The

reason  why some hospitals have not introduced  it

completely  is due to the shortage of  staff.  The

Member can be assured that in due course the three-night  shift  duty  will  be  introduced  in   all

hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to granting of no-pay leave to nurses

who  wish  to  go  overseas for  their  post-basic

courses, the selection for granting this leave  is

based on the following criteria:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The training course must be directly related

to  the  development and expansion of the  medical

services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The course can be recognised for both post-basic increment, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The course is not available locally.



For  the information of the Member, for the  years

1972  and  1973, only two applications for  no-pay

leave  to  go  on  a post-basic course  have  been

turned   down.  In  1972,  31  applications   were

received, of which only one was turned down.  This

applicant wanted to apply to go on a course  at  a

time  when many of her contemporaries were already

abroad completing a course in plastic surgery. For

the  1973  case,  the  applicant  was  advised  to

proceed on other types of courses which would meet

the  needs of the medical services. But as she was

adamant   on  her  choice,  her  application   was

rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the promotion of those who have

obtained this post-basic qualification, may I  say

that  it  is not possible to promote everyone  who

has  this post-basic qualification. In a promotion

exercise other considerations have to be met with.

Moreover,  not every post-basic qualification  can

be  recognised. As far as nurses going abroad  are

concerned,  they are always advised  as  to  which

post-basic qualifications are recognised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ill-fitting uniforms and shoes,

may  I  say  that  uniforms and  shoes  are  being

supplied  by a contractor. May I stress  the  fact

that  uniforms are made to measure. They  are  not

ready-made  uniforms. If, after  measurement,  the

tailor  does  not give a fitting uniform  then  he

will  have  to  re-cut it at the  expense  of  the

contractor. Similarly with shoes. Therefore, it is

not true to say that we are not aware of the fact.

But  such errors do occur sometimes, and when they

do the contractor has to make good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to fixed allowance for midwives, may

I  say that midwives serving in the City districts

are  paid  $60 per month and those in the outlying

districts are paid $70 per month. Those serving in

the  rural  areas are paid $55 a month.  This,  of

course,  as  you can see, is an anomaly  inherited

from the former City Council and the Rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



Board, which paid different rates. The question of

fixed allowances is now under review. Fortunately,

no  decision  has been arrived at, at the  moment,

and  because of the rise in fuel prices and  taxi-fares it has been necessary to restudy the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point brought up by the Member

for  Anson, may I just enlighten him on the $3 and

$2 charges. A $2 fee is charged for each treatment

in an ordinary outpatient dispensary, but a $3 fee

is  charged  if  one  attends a specialist  clinic

attached  to  our  hospitals.  There  is  no  such

directive  as  the Finance Minister  saying,  "You

charge  $2  in  this  hospital  and  $3  in   that

hospital."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the increase in hospital fees. I

am  glad  the  Member for Anson  agrees  with  the

Government  policy that whoever uses  the  medical

services  should  pay a token sum  towards  costs.

This helps to check the abuse of these facilities,

and  perhaps instilling in our people an awareness

that  nothing is for free. However, it is not true

to say that doctors often request patients to come

back  for check-ups after treatment. Requests  for

patients  to come for second visits are only  made

when necessary.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point about doctors being on

call for 24 hours, may 1 enlighten the Member  for

Anson that this 24-hour on call duty is also  true

of  doctors  the  world over,  and  certainly  not

peculiar  to Singapore. However, I would  like  to

say  that it does not necessarily follow that  the

doctors  do  not sleep during such  24-hour  duty.

Perhaps the Member for Kim Seng can enlighten  the

Member  for  Anson  on this matter.  Nevertheless,

doctors who are on call duty are given the day off

the following day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the resignation of doctors, I may

have something more to say when the Member for Kim

Seng  raises the matter under a different subhead.

So I do not think I will deal with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



it  in  detail now. But may I just say that  there

are  many  reasons  for a doctor  to  resign  from

Government  service.  It may  not  necessarily  be

associated only with working conditions.  Some  go

out to be in private practice because they believe

that they can earn more money. In fact, those  who

are  in  private practice may have  to  work  even

harder,  particularly when they  are  starting  to

establish  their  practice.  On  the  analysis  of

resignation,  Sir,  among  the  doctors  who  have

resigned there are those who do not go on  24-hour

call  duty at all, particularly those who work  in

outpatient dispensaries and school health clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the amendment to the Medical

Registration  Act which the Member for  Anson  has

raised. The major change in the amendment  to  the

Act is that we now have a local list of recognised

medical  qualifications. In other  words,  persons

with  qualifications which are not on  this  list,

however,  may  be registered by the order  of  the

Minister  after they have satisfied the  Singapore

Medical  Council that they have reached a standard

of  competence to practise independently. Normally

the  Medical Council makes its recommendations  to

the Minister, under the provisions of the new Act.

The person would have to go through an examination

set by the Medical Council to test his competency.

This is quite important because we are letting him

free  to practise independently, and if he is  not

competent he will endanger the health and life and

limb  of  members  of  the public.  In  1972,  two

persons   who   did   not  have   the   recognised

qualification were so examined. One passed and was

recommended for registration. In 1973, there  were

six  persons who applied for registration and were

examined.   One  was  successful  and   has   been

registered.  This  year  one  applicant  will   be

examined in March/April, and six others have asked

to be examined in September 1974.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, although the Minister

said  that  it  is not his policy to  supply  ill-fitting uniforms and so on,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



the  point  made  is that public funds  are  being

utilised  to  supply  these  uniforms.  We  expect

public  funds  to  be properly  utilised.  If  the

contractor  supplies ill-fitting uniforms,  though

they are made to measure, I suppose something  has

to  be  done  to see that we get a contractor  who

does  not supply ill-fitting uniforms in spite  of

the  fact that made-to-measure uniforms are called

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also raised the problem of nurses in the

rural  areas. They ought to be provided with  more

uniforms because they are out on the field. Nurses

in  hospital  work  within  the  confines  of  the

hospital  and  perhaps they do not  need  as  many

uniforms as those who work in the outlying areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good to hear that promotions from

Assistant Nurses to student Staff Nurses and Staff

Nurses are based on merit. The word "merit" can be

interpreted  in  many ways. Perhaps  it  would  be

better   if   the  number  of  promotional   posts

available  is  made known as that would  at  least

give the nurses an opportunity of knowing what  to

expect  when applying for these promotional posts.

As  was  pointed  out, there are  1,800  Assistant

Nurses with only eight promotional posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister agreed with me that there is a

shortage of nurses and that is why the Ministry is

not able to implement the three-night shift system

although they accept that it is a better system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> In all hospitals?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, in all hospitals. It has

been  done  in some hospitals. But for  the  other

hospitals, they are not able to do it because they

are  short of nurses. That is the point I am  also

trying  to make - shortage of nurses. What is  the

Minister  going to do about it? I thought  I  even

pointed out that there was an occasion that I know

of  when  there was only one Staff Nurse  and  the

rest  were  either  Assistant  Nurses  or  student

nurses.  This  is  not  a  satisfactory  state  of

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should congratulate the Minister when he said

that about 30 nurses were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



given  leave to do post-basic courses. This  bears

out  the  point that these post-basic courses  are

necessary,  and the fact that he gave  the  nurses

leave  to  do this post-basic course on their  own

shows  that this post-basic training is necessary.

And  as the Minister has said, when they come back

there  are  no  promotional  posts  available.  My

quarrel  is not about promotional posts not  being

available. But after they have utilised their  own

time and their own money to go through an approved

course  -if it is not approved, he would not  have

given  them  no-pay leave - when they  come  back,

they   should  at  least  be  given   the   annual

increment.  No,  they do not get it.  I  hope  the

Minister  will  give  some consideration  to  this

matter,  and perhaps let me know why this  is  not

being done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

already  explained the position. As far  as  post-basic qualifications for nurses are concerned, not

all  of  them,  in  particular Staff  Nurses,  are

entitled to an increment. But most of the  courses

do entitle the nurses to an increment. If they are

entitled to it, they would have got it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point made by the Member for Telok

Blangah  is  that  too many Assistant  Nurses  and

Student  Nurses  are around, and  not  many  Staff

Nurses.  Let  me  just give him the  figures.  The

student nurse population as at 1st March, 1974, is

763,  as  compared to 2,182 qualified  nurses.  In

fact, each ward has a team of an average of 19  to

20 nurses, made up of Sisters or Nursing Officers,

Staff  Nurses, Assistant Nurses and Student Nurses

at various levels of training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as shortage of nurses is concerned, every

attempt  has  been  made to  expand  the  training

school  of nurses, and we have been getting larger

intakes  in the last year or two, in view  of  the

expansion  of our medical services.  But,  as  you

know, whatever calculations we make with regard to

intake  and projection, if we expand too fast,  as

we  do  at  the  moment, there is bound  to  be  a

shortage of manpower, including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



nurses.  But the Member for Telok Blangah  can  be

assured that we are training as many nurses as  we

can  at the moment. In fact, when our calculations

were  made, they were based on a seven-night shift

duty.    But   now   because   of   the    union's

representation, we thought it reasonable and  have

changed it to a three-night shift. But surely  the

Member  for Telok Blangah cannot expect us  to  do

wonders  and  increase  the population  of  nurses

overnight. We do what we can.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> The union must co-operate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> And as my colleague says, the

union must also co-operate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Not just words, but in

practice.  The  other point is  about  ill-fitting

uniforms. I think there may have been some  cases.

But  one swallow does not make a summer. In  fact,

even  if  the Member for Telok Blangah goes  to  a

tailor,  he  does not expect a right  fit  on  the

first fitting.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Then I will change tailors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Yes, it is very easy for one

person  to  change  his  tailor,  but  changing  a

contractor takes time. In any case, the contractor

who  gives the ill-fitting uniforms will be  asked

to  change  again and again, and that  will  incur

more   expense  on  his  part.  So  that  is   his

punishment.  Of  course, if he has been  producing

too  many  ill-fitting uniforms, he  can  be  rest

assured that he will not get the contract when the

next tender comes up.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding

the Minister's reply about uniforms, if a contract

is given to a contractor who has quoted the lowest

tender,  he does not sew properly and the uniforms

will  be  useless. Moreover, the measurements  are

not taken properly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



They just sew the uniforms and supply them  to

the nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister about the

charges of $2 and $3. Why is there this difference

in   charges   between  outpatient   clinics   and

hospitals? I do not know the reason. If  a  person

goes  to a hospital, he is charged $3, but charged

$2  if he goes to a clinic. The Minister has  also

promised  that a person will be charged only  once

if  he  goes to an outside clinic and pays $2  and

then  subsequently he is required  to  go  to  the

general  hospital  again  on  the  same  day.  The

Minister  has promised that a person will  not  be

charged  twice  in  the  same  day  for  the  same

treatment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has

not  understood me. I have never made any promises

as  far as charges are concerned because they  are

levied according to the manual which is not put up

by  me.  But  if patients are to be charged,  they

will be charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the difference between $3 and $2,

I  think  I  might have to take half  an  hour  to

explain   to   the  Member  for  Anson   for   his

enlightenment.  This  is in regard  to  specialist

treatment for injuries and treatment of coughs and

colds. Perhaps the Member for Kim Seng could  help

me   explain  to  the  Member  for  Anson  outside

Parliament   the  difference  between   specialist

treatment and a simple outpatient service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  invitation of the Hon. Minister, I  certainly

shall explain it to the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to put on record the point made

by  the Hon. Minister regarding the working  hours

of  doctors in hospitals. I should hate to have it

thought  that, in actual fact, doctors sleep  when

they  are on night calls. As a matter of  fact,  I

think  the Minister could bear me out when  I  say

that  doctors in hospitals work seven days a week,

Sundays and public holidays included. And many  of

them  go  on night calls, at least twice,  if  not

three times



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



and  sometimes four times a week. This means  that

they  start work at 8.00 in the morning, work  the

whole  night  through till 8.00 the next  morning,

and  continue  till 2.00 p.m, the  following  day,

which  means  putting in at least 30  hours  at  a

stretch, depending on the exigency of the  service

when they may not be released until 5.00 p.m, the

next day.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I clarify the point

about  sleeping on duty? What I said was this.  If

they  are on call duty, it does not mean that they

cannot sleep. When they are on call duty, they can

sleep but have to wake up when somebody calls  the

bleep.  It  is very foolish while on 24-hour  call

duty  to  keep waiting for the bleep. I think  the

Member  for Kim Seng understands what I have  been

trying to put across.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point that they work long

hours,  the  situation was worse before,  but  not

now.  Because of the protests and so on,  we  have

introduced  a  system whereby if a  doctor  is  on

night  duty  he  gets  an  afternoon  off  on  the

following  day. I cannot say that this system  has

been  followed  in every case,  but  it  has  been

followed  in the vast majority of cases.  But,  of

course, being doctors they have to respond to  the

exigencies of the service. In fact, I know that in

a  few specialities, like surgery, obstetrics  and

gynaecology, they have to work longer  hours  than

in   the  other  specialities,  maybe  orthopaedic

surgery.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present control of poisons,

including   caustic   soda,  is   cumbersome   and

confusing  as the Poisons Inspectorate section  of

the Ministry of Health, in enforcing the Poisons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  (Chapter  146) uses  under  the  Eighth

Schedule   a  series  of  seven  types  of   forms

stretching from Form A to Form G. However,  it  is

admitted  that  strict control  on  the  purchase,

storage   and  sale  of  sodium  hydroxide   (more

commonly  known  as caustic soda) by  the  Poisons

Inspectorate  is indeed necessary as caustic  soda

is still one of the favourite suicidal poisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule (3) of the Poisons (Sodium Hydroxide) Rules,

1958, states that "it shall not be lawful to  sell

sodium  hydroxide  unless the  purchaser  holds  a

permit (i.e. Form E) to purchase same". Under  the

Poisons  Ordinance a holder of Form A is  licensed

to  import  and  store poisons, and presumably  is

allowed  for  his own use but he cannot  sell.  To

sell, he requires to possess Form C. It is further

complicated  that while a holder  of  Form  A  can

purchase   caustic  soda  from  anywhere   outside

Singapore,  he  is not allowed to purchase  within

Singapore unless he simultaneously possesses  Form  E.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During an emergency, such as shipping delay or

out-of-stock situation, an industrial  firm  using

caustic  soda cannot temporarily buy caustic  soda

locally  unless he possesses Form E  as  explained

above. In this acute situation where a seller,  in

helping out an emergency, contravenes the law,  he

is  prosecuted  in  court. A few  "good-intention"

sellers have landed in court and their rice  bowls

broken  in  performing a samaritan act.  To  avoid

this  situation and perhaps the only solution  for

the  industrial firm using caustic soda is to stop

production   and   await  the  approval   of   his

application for Form E which normally takes  three

or four weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Director of Medical Services

appears to have taken a retrogressive step in that

licensees cannot simultaneously hold both  Form  A

and  Form  E.  This makes matters  worse  and  the

industrial  sector  is  badly  inconvenienced  and

simply  cannot understand this illogical decision.

Could the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



Health  and  Home  Affairs explain  the  rationale

behind this confusing state of affairs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this confusing situation in the control

of  caustic soda, may I suggest that the  relevant

Rules  be  amended and the procedure  streamlined.

Like  many countries elsewhere, it appears obvious

that  the  holder of Form A should be  allowed  to

purchase caustic soda from both outside and inside

Singapore,  subject  to  any  reasonable   control

procedure the Ministry of Health think fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise concerns

the  strict  enforcement of labelling requirements

for  all  scheduled poisons controlled  under  the

Poisons  Act  and Poisons Rules. Here  again,  the

Poisons Inspectorate is too rigid and do not allow

any  degree  of flexibility within  the  scope  of

people who are suitably qualified or authorised to

handle the use and sale of poisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most instances, imported poisons are already

labelled  with  the word "Poison" in  the  English

language.  In  these cases, exemptions  should  be

granted to sales made to trading and manufacturing

firms with knowledgeable, qualified and authorised

personnel, in  the case of poisons  sold  to  the

public   (e.g, at  retail  pharmacies),   it   is

understandable  that the word "Poison"  should  be

written in the four languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, importers have to label these

preparations  when they sell them  to  the  trade.

However,  the  moment these goods  arrive  at  the

retailers  they in turn paste their own  label  on

it. Usually, the first label is either removed  or

superimposed by the second label. This is  because

the  name  and  address of the seller  has  to  be

included in the label at each stage. The label put

by  the  importer,  therefore,  serves  no  useful

purpose  between  the importer and  the  retailer.

This wastage of labour and labelling material will

again  lead  to  higher  expenditure  which   will

finally be passed on to the end-users.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many importers of new drugs and poisons have

found   the  approval  procedure  very  arbitrary,

especially in border-line cases. There appears  to

be  no  co-ordination between relevant departments

and  frequently  importers  are  pushed  from  one

department   to  another.  Although  the   Poisons

authority   insists  on  the  requirement   of   a

qualified pharmacist to present the case, far  too

often  the  authority is simply represented  by  a

clerical   officer,   who   finally   makes    his

recommendation   to   his   qualified    superior.

Occasionally,  there appears to be a  "bargain  or

negotiation" taking place during this  discussion.

This  unhealthy situation also needs streamlining.

I   would   like  to  suggest  that  a   permanent

assessment  committee  be  set  up  consisting  of

knowledgeable  and  qualified representatives  and

given proper terms of reference and guidelines  to

work with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there exists a Poisons Advisory

Committee  (PAC) which seldom sit  and  only  meet

when necessary. Perhaps the PAC should be given  a

"shot" to wake them up. It should be completely re-organised  and re-vitalised with proper  terms  of

operations  and  guidelines.  One  of   its   more

important functions must be the continuous  review

of Poisons regulations and to keep up-to-date with

recent  information on the availability and danger

of existing and/or new poisons. At the moment, the

decision to ban an existing poison or to add a new

poison to the Poisons Schedule is based on  an  ad

hoc   basis.  Frequently,  incomplete  or  partial

information is used in the assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available published literature shows that for the

period  1960  to  1969, 114  deaths  were  due  to

caustic  soda poisoning consisting of 90 per  cent

suicides  and 10 per cent domestic accidents.  For

the  same  period  the number  of  deaths  due  to

salicyclates poisoning was 21 cases consisting  of

50  per  cent  suicides and 50 per  cent  domestic

accidents. This 50 per cent of domestic  accidents

mostly  involved young children. The  majority  of

these cases were due to methyl salicyclates, as it

is  the  common  ingredient used  in  the  popular

medicated oils used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



extensively   in  external  application   by   the

Chinese. Most Chinese families stock a few bottles

of  these  medicated oils at  home  and  they  are

sometimes  used as a sort of panacea.  On  certain

occasions,  such as in the revival of  unconscious

persons, a small amount is even taken orally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recent available figures for the four years

1970-73  revealed 10 deaths due  to  caustic  soda

poisoning,  whereas the number of  deaths  due  to

methyl  salicyclates poisoning was about 3�  times

more  (36  cases). This clearly shows that  deaths

either  suicides  or  domestic  accidents  due  to

methyl salicyclates poisoning have now come to the

forefront.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Chemistry Annual Report for

1972  gave  a figure of 140 tests for salicyclates

detected in biological samples. In addition, tests

for  salicyclates  were also  conducted  at  other

public testing institutions such as the Department

of   Pathology.   For  1973,  the  Department   of

Pathology   reported  91  tests  for  salicyclates

submitted  by the Hospital Authorities.  From  the

above  figures  (both deaths  and  tests),  it  is

obvious  that  poisoning due to  salicyclates  has

achieved  wide proportion. Yet the Poison Advisory

Committee  is  still sleeping  and  doing  nothing

about  it.  As mentioned earlier, the Ministry  of

Health  has  stringent and complicated  procedures

for  the  control of caustic soda but salicyclates

is  not  even  placed in the Poisons  Schedule.  I

would therefore like to suggest that, in the first

instance,  salicyclates should be  placed  in  the

Poisons  Schedule. This will help  to  effectively

control and prevent domestic accidents and  deaths

in some cases of small children and young adults.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest the setting up of a

Poisons  Information Centre. The list of available

poisons is expanding rapidly and a store-house  of

the latest information on existing and new poisons

is  most essential. Many professionals such as the

medical practitioners, pharmacists, chemists, etc.

are sometimes caught in a situation where they are

in  no  position  to recommend a treatment  for  a

particular new poison. The availability



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Poisons  Information  Centre  for

consultation under such a situation will  be  most

helpful.  It  is  not suggested  that  the  Centre

should  be  established on the scale as  those  in

Japan,  Edinburgh or London. For a start, a  small

Information Centre is suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to comment on the Misuse of

Drugs Act, 1973. The Act became operative in  July

1973  and  contains extensive provisions  for  the

regulation  and control of dangerous  and  harmful

drugs  - referred to as "controlled drugs". Nobody

will  dispute the need for such stringent control,

especially  with the increasing problems  of  drug

peddling  and  drug addiction facing  our  society

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support generally the wide provisions in

the   Act,   but  it  is  my  opinion   that   the

implementation   part  requires  streamlining.   I

regret to suggest that the enforcing officers  are

extremely  bureaucratic and  do  not  exhibit  any

sense of discretion or flexibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 (1) (d) of the Act empowers the

Minister  to  make regulations "requiring  medical

practitioners,  dentists, pharmacists,  veterinary

surgeons  and other persons who deal in controlled

drugs  as  may  be authorized by regulations  made

under  this Act to keep records and make returns".

Arising   from   this  provision   the   enforcing

authority makes rules insisting that all purchase,

storage  and  usage of controlled  drugs  must  be

registered  in  a specially bound  book  and  that

entries  must be made daily. To comply  with  this

regulation, clinics and surgeries have to employ a

clerk  just  to do the monotonous task of  posting

the controlled drugs.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what

measures are being taken to introduce an emergency

unit at the Alexandra and the Sembawang Hospitals?

The Alexandra Hospital should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



be  expanded  to  serve the  urban  population  of

Alexandra,   Queenstown  and  Telok  Blangah.   An

emergency  unit  at this hospital  would  help  to

relieve   strain  at  the  Outram   Road   General

Hospital.  At  present any emergency treatment  in

the Sembawang area i5 referred to the Thomson Road

Hospital  unit.  Travelling  that  distance   from

Sembawang  to the Thomson Road Hospital may  quite

often be a waste of time, for the narrow roads are

reputed to be crawling with traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand our hospital wards are crowded,

and  there is usually a long waiting list. Why not

introduce  a  `Home Care' service in hospitals  as

introduced  in some countries? Patients  who  have

the  necessary people to look after  them  in  the

home can be discharged from the hospitals early so

that  their beds can be occupied by those who  are

really serious. A nursing service that can keep an

eye on these discharged patients can be introduced

to help those who are looking after their patients

at  home. Valuable time and money can be saved  in

this  way. Further, patients have a better  chance

of  quick recovery when they are being attended to

by their loved ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently there was an outbreak of typhoid

fever  in isolated areas. May I know what remedial

action  has  been  taken to stop  the  fever  from

spreading?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I answer the Member

for  Anson  first?  For the Member's  information,

there   is  already  an  emergency  unit  at   the

Alexandra  Hospital.  It was  opened  in  November

1971. However, at the beginning it was providing a

limited service, i.e, only during office hours. In

the middle of last year the hours were extended to

9 p.m, on weekdays and 5 p.m, on Sundays. But from

the  1st of October last year, it operates  a  24-hour  service.  At the same time, a new  emergency

complex,  complete with operating theatres,  X-ray

department  and  intensive care  area,  was  being

developed in the Alexandra Hospital. This  complex

is expected to be comp1eted in May this year. This

will  certainly help to relieve the  load  on  the

Outram Road General Hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Sembawang Hospital, an emergency

unit  is  also being constructed there,  and  this

will be completed in the middle of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to `Home Care' service as suggested

by  the  Member, this is being looked into by  the

district  nursing service which cares for patients

who  are  discharged from hospitals. Similar  care

for mothers and new born babies after delivery are

also  provided by midwives. T.B., leprosy and V.D.

patients  are  visited by investigators.  However,

all  these  services are in the process  of  being

reorganised. It must, however, be pointed out that

such    services   are   not   economical    since

considerable  manpower has to be expended  on  the

field.  Whereas  only four to  six  cases  can  be

attended to per day by such visits, three or  more

times  the  number  can  be  attended  to  at  our

Maternal and Child Health Clinics as well  as  the

school  clinics  if  the  patients  go  to   these

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to overcrowding of hospital wards, I

have  to  inform the Member that now there  is  no

overcrowding particularly after we took  over  the

Alexandra and Sembawang Hospitals. Together, these

two  hospitals  have an additional 469  beds.  The

Alexandra  Hospital has at the  moment  405  beds.

This   number  will  be  increased  to  430  beds.

Furthermore  a  small hospital will  be  built  in

Changi  to  be called the Changi Chalet  Hospital.

This  hospital will be equipped for the  treatment

of  emergency, outpatient, and X-ray services  and

minor laboratory investigation. It will have about

36  beds.  It is expected to be completed  by  the

middle of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I have to say with regard to the

queries raised by the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the points raised by the Member for

River  Valley,  I  am glad, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  you

ruled that this matter should have been brought up

under  a separate subhead. The whole tenor of  the

speech of the Member suggests that he was confused

with regard to the rules pertaining to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



Poisons  Act.  First, let me refer to  the  sodium

hydroxide rules under the Poisons Act, 1958. May I

inform  the Member for River Valley that it  is  a

simple  piece of legislation with six  paragraphs.

Its  purpose  is  to regulate the sale  of  sodium

hydroxide, commonly known as caustic soda, so that

it is available only to persons who require it for

trade,  business or industrial purposes. This  has

been  made  necessary to reduce the  incidence  of

poisoning,  intentional  or  otherwise,  by   this

chemical  which has caused death and injury  prior

to  the  introduction of this control.  The  rules

require  that  licensed sellers  may  sell  sodium

hydroxide  only to persons holding  valid  permits

issued by the Ministry. Permits are issued free of

charge  to persons who have satisfied the Ministry

that  sodium  hydroxide  is  necessary  for  their

industries.   In   order  not   to   inconvenience

industrialists, permits are issued for  quantities

estimated  for six months' requirements.  Further,

persons  who  wish  to  buy sodium  hydroxide  for

resale,  export or for scientific and  educational

purposes  are  exempted from  applying  for  these

permits.   The  rest  of  the  rules  consist   of

instructions   to  sellers  when  handling   these

permits  and  are well understood by all  licensed

sellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the flexibility in labelling

control which was referred to by the Member, may I

say  that poisons are controlled because of  their

toxicity and potentially harmful properties and in

order to prevent accidents arising from their use.

For  the safety of workers handling these poisons,

one  basic  requirement  is  that  containers  for

poisons  should be labelled with the name  of  the

poison  contained therein and with the  cautionary

words  "POISON - NOT TO BE TAKEN" in red  ink  and

any  other specific cautions relevant to the  form

and danger of the chemical concerned. For example,

sodium hydroxide is to be labelled "Poison -  This

substance  is  caustic."  And  the  Poisons   rule

provides that they be printed in English, Chinese,

Malay and Tamil.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements of labelling provided in the

Poisons  rules  and enforced by  the  Ministry  of

Health  are  minimal  for the  protection  of  all

persons handling dangerous chemicals in factories,

laboratories,  etc. These requirements  are  basic

and    universal.   Any   relaxation   of    these

requirements  would  increase  industrial  hazards

which  I  believe  my  NTUC colleagues  would  not

support  because it would be creating hazards  for

the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain relaxations in labelling

provided. For instance, all drugs including patent

medicine classified as poisons if dispensed  on  a

prescription  need  not be  so  labelled.  Certain

groups of medicine, e.g, insulin and antihistamine

preparations, may be labelled with only  the  word

"POISON" and in black letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Poisons Advisory Committee,

this  committee advises me on matters with  regard

to  poisons and drugs. In fact, it is  an  ad  hoc

committee and not a standing committee. I  do  not

think  it  is fair to say that this committee  has

gone  to sleep. In fact, it is an ad hoc committee

and  a  meeting of this committee is  called  when

there  is  any matter to be discussed on  and  for

their  advice.  In  fact, this  committee  met  on

several     occasions     and     made     certain

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to further control to regulate the

use  of  drugs, this is covered by two other  Acts

apart  from the Poisons Act, namely, the Medicines

(Advertisement and Sale) Act passed  in  1968  and

the  Misuse of Drugs Act passed in 1973.  However,

may  I say that additional controls are also being

considered  and  my Ministry is now  looking  into

measures  for  the registration of  all  medicinal

products   recommended  for  treatment  of   human

ailments.  The quality of control of all  finished

medicinal preparations are also being looked into.

In fact, this is an all-embracing control and very

much has to be done, and a thorough Medicines Bill

is  now in the process of being drafted. There may

be some loopholes here and there with regard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



to  medicines sold in Chinese medicine shops,  and

they  will be taken care of when the new Medicines

Bill   is   passed.  At  the  moment,  this   very

comprehensive Bill is being drafted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Minister has

completely  missed  all the  points  that  I  have

raised.  I am not quarrelling about the  rules  in

the  Poisons  Act.  I am fully aware  of  the  six

paragraphs  in  the Act. What I am  suggesting  is

fairly  straightforward. Why is it that a  person,

who  holds Form A which allows him to buy  caustic

soda  from  anywhere outside Singapore, cannot  be

allowed  to buy sodium hydroxide within Singapore?

In  other words, the law requires that if he holds

Form   A   under   the  Poisons   Act,   he   must

simultaneously  hold  Form  E  under  the   sodium

hydroxide  rule  1958. Without  this  Form  E,  he

cannot  buy  caustic soda locally. My question  is

straightforward. Why is it that a person,  who  is

authorised  by law by holding Form A  to  purchase

caustic  soda from anywhere outside Singapore,  is

not  allowed to buy caustic soda within  Singapore

unless  he holds Form E? That is the gist  of  the

first point that I want to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is on the question of labelling.

I  am not suggesting any leniency or relaxation of

the  Poisons  Act or the Poisons  rule.  From  the

practical  point  of view, I am  saying  that  the

enforcement  section,  in particular  the  Poisons

Inspectorate, does not exercise any  common  sense

at  all and no sense of discretion. I went through

the trouble to quote the examples. For example, an

importer already imports a certain poison with the

label "POISON" in English, and what he does is  to

sell this labelled poison to a trading firm or  to

a  manufacturing firm which intends to repack  and

sell  it to the pharmacist. Therefore. I am saying

that  there  is  no  necessity for  the  importer,

having  bought this carton of poison, to  put  the

word "POISON" on the carton in four languages  and

send it to the retailer, because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



retailer  will tear the whole label  out  and  put

another  label  "POISON" in four languages  inside

the carton. I do not see the logic. I am trying to

explain that this requirement is unnecessary,  and

in terms of labour and labelling material the end-user  finally has to pay a higher price for it.  I

am saying that some discretion be exercised in the

interpretation  of  this simple  rule.  I  am  not

suggesting any relaxation.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, as far as the Poisons Advisory

Committee  is concerned, is precisely  what  I  am

trying to get at -that decisions are made on an ad

hoc  basis.  To ban or to include a  poison  is  a

decision  made  on  an ad hoc  basis.  So  I  have

suggested  very  clearly that there  should  be  a

permanent committee. So on these three points, the

Minister has completely misunderstood me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point that the Minister has not answered

is my suggestion on the procedure for approval.  I

mentioned  that there is no co-ordination  between

relevant  departments. I have also mentioned  that

on the one hand the Poisons authority requires the

retailer  or the importer to have a pharmacist  to

present  his  case and yet, on the other  hand  at

Government  end it is only a clerk  who  tries  to

negotiate.  I am suggesting that a more  permanent

committee  be set up, which the Minister  has  not

even touched on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which I wanted to say was that I

went   through   a   lot  of  trouble   collecting

statistics to show why - and I am sorry to say the

Minister  did  not  quite understand  what  I  was

trying  to  get at with all the confusion  of  the

control  of sodium hydroxide -there is a  need  to

put   methyl   salicyclate   under   the   Poisons

Ordinance. I illustrated that for the whole period

1970-73,  there were only 10 deaths  from  caustic

soda  poisoning  whereas there were  36  cases  of

salicyclate  poisoning. I would  have  thought  it

obvious  that the Minister would give a reasonable

reply  and  say,  "O.K., we will  put  it  in  the

Poisons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



Schedule",  or "We will consider it."  Instead  he

completely  dismisses all the efforts I  have  put

in. He did not say anything about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in connection with this lack of co-ordination and also this non-flexibility or

complete  lack of discretion on the  part  of  the

enforcement section, I am suggesting that although

laws   are   passed   by  Parliament   with   good

intentions, sometimes the spirit and intention are

completely misinterpreted by those responsible for

its implementation. This is serious because it can

lead  to  misunderstanding between the  Government

and the public. This sometimes leads to resentment

against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up the last point on the non-flexible

bureaucratic approach. Under the Misuse  of  Drugs

Act   every  medical  practitioner  or  practising

surgeon  must put an entry into a specially  bound

record book whatever he buys, uses and stores. And

he  must  employ a clerk to do all this monotonous

work.  Because of section 34 (1) (d) of  the  Act,

the  enforcement section in the Ministry of Health

insists  that  it  must also be a specially  bound

book  approved by the Ministry of Health officials

and  that  entries must be made in the book  every

day.  I  do  not see the logic of it. Consequently

some  doctors  have been summoned to  court  on  a

technicality, which defeats the usefulness of this

Misuse  of  Drugs Act. Perhaps the Minister  could

please comment on these few points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in all fairness, let me

say  that the Member for River Valley is a  highly

qualified chemist, whereas the Minister is not. It

does  seem  to me that the Minister has  been  fed

with  all  sorts of wrong information, and  it  is

about  time  we changed the Chief Chemist  in  the

Ministry!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, if the Member for River

Valley  is less excited about the whole matter,  I

think he would have understood some of my answers.

The trouble is he gets so excited that he does not

understand me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point he raised about Form A

and  Form  E, may I say that if anyone  buys  from

outside, that means he is importing. That is quite

different from buying within Singapore. He may  be

an  importer, a small time consumer or a big  time

consumer, but if he buys in Singapore, that is not

importing. So different rules apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Poisons Advisory Committee

which advises me as Minister, I am not saying that

we  will  not  consider his  recommendation  of  a

permanent committee. I am just pointing out to him

that it is not fair to ask an ad hoc committee  to

meet regularly. He says this committee has gone to

sleep. In fairness I must stand up to defend  this

committee. It is an ad hoc committee and  it  only

meets  when it is called to meet. So it is  unfair

to  say  that it has gone to sleep. The suggestion

of  the  Member for River Valley was that we  must

form a permanent committee. Well and good, we will

consider  his  suggestion. Perhaps  I  might  even

nominate  him  to  be Chairman of this  committee,

since he is so well versed with the small details.

If  I  do, then the suggestion made by the  Member

for Jalan Kayu will be met and I will be fed by  a

well-qualified chemist on matters of poisons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point complained of by the Member for

River  Valley is that these rules and  regulations

have not been implemented in the right spirit, but

carried  out to the letter of the law.  There  are

always two sides to a question. That was his point

of  view, whereas the enforcement officer has  his

point  of view. The trouble is that while  he  has

made   this   allegation,  I  do  not   have   the

enforcement officer here to confront his  charges.

But since I represent them I will do as best as  I

can.  Sir,  I do not know of the actual  instances

where he says that they are unimaginative in their

action.  But to be fair, I always listen  to  both

sides  of the story and come to my own conclusion,

not just one side of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, just a point of

clarification. I did not say the Minister has been

fed with the wrong poison!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I do not think it is my

job  to go into small details, as the Minister has

implied.  He has a whole army of qualified  people

from the Director of Medical Services downwards. I

am   suggesting  what  I  think  the  public   are

thinking, and I am reflecting their views. Perhaps

to  satisfy  the Minister, what he has  to  do  is

simply  to  ask  the  public.  Go  round  to  some

clinics, surgeries or manufacturing firms and  see

what  they  think of the enforcement officers,  in

particular the Poisons Inspectorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is unfair for the Minister to suggest

that  since I have brought the matter up,  then  I

had better do it. This is a wrong attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still not happy with the reply because

either  I  am misunderstood or I do not understand

him - put it that way. I think this point of logic

is  very  important  because it  means  either  an

industrial firm has to stop production or  not.  I

grant that if one is allowed to buy anything  from

outside  Singapore, that means importing.  Whereas

if one buys anything locally -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is not import?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Yes, but it does not make

sense.   For  example,  a  person  imports  sodium

hydroxide all the way from Germany and if he tries

to  help  me  as my shipment is delayed,  he  gets

prosecuted in doing this good act. I am trying  to

tell  the  Minister that it does not  make  sense.

Maybe   that   1958   rule   requires   amendment.

Therefore, it is time the Inspectorate woke up  to

what  other people in the world are doing. If  the

Minister cannot accept that, then I am sorry  that

I still maintain my views.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, I think the

Member  for River Valley has a point. Poisons  may

mean  life  or  death. That  is  why  he  gets  so

excited.  I  think  the  Minister  is  too  light-hearted.  He  does not concern himself  with  this

problem as an important one. The Member for  River

Valley  has  mentioned  that  the  oil  of  methyl

salicyclates (the common name is Winter Green) has

caused



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



a  number of deaths. The Ministry of Health allows

this  oil  to  be  sold  very  freely.  I  do  not

understand why this oil, which, is classified as a

deleterious drug, is sold so freely in the market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I think the Member for

Bras Basah is a bit confused when he says that the

Ministry  of Health or myself has not  taken  this

point  very  seriously. I do not think the  Member

for  Bras Basah has even understood the Member for

River  Valley because his complaint is  that  they

have  been  too strict about it. As far as  sodium

hydroxide is concerned ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I think he is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> No. They are erring on the

side  of  safety  as  far as sodium  hydroxide  is

concerned,  because there have been deaths  caused

by  caustic  soda  or  sodium  hydroxide,  whether

intentionally or unintentionally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to methyl salicyclates, I have

already said in my answer that we are now going to

alter the classification of medicinal products and

we   will   have  that  embodied  in   it   in   a

comprehensive Medicines Bill. Perhaps  the  Member

for  Bras  Basah  will understand  now  that  this

matter  was  not taken in a light-hearted  manner,

though  in a debate we do not want any fisticuffs.

We take it with a sense of give-and-take, not in a

fighting manner as otherwise we might end up  with

fists flying and so on. I am glad to see smiles on

the faces of Members!



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I think in future queries

on   more  technical  matters,  the  DMS  or   the

Permanent Secretary should be present to help  the

Minister concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although the reply was unsatisfactory, I

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Hwang Soo Jin -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head MA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead HA 1109.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head MA (contd.)--



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head MA in

respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year during the Budget

debate,  I  raised several matters  regarding  the

future  of  the  health service in  Singapore  and

expressed   grave  concern  about  the  decreasing

number  of  Singapore students who chose medicine,

dentistry  or pharmacy for a life-time profession.

At  the  same  time  I  pleaded  with  the  Health

Minister  to review salary and service  conditions

so as to provide better incentives for doctors and

dental surgeons to stay in the public service  and

simultaneously to attract more students  to  study

for these professions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a year since, and sad to say, no

definitive  action has been taken to  solve  these

problems. I am alarmed by the degree of discontent

and low morale among hospital staff. This has been

compounded  by  the world-wide inflation  in  1973

that   served   only  to  further  aggravate   the

situation. To illustrate this, may I quote figures

of the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



doctors resigning from the Health Ministry from

1970 to 1974?

<pre>

                               Resignations

      1970                          35

      1971                          44

      1972                          69

      1973                          67

      1974 (January to March only)  53

</pre>



<br>These figures eloquently speak for themselves. For

the first three months alone this year, 53 doctors

have  resigned. It is conceivable that by the  end

of this year many more will leave - multiply 53 by

4,  and  we  will have more than 200 resignations.

Sir,  are  we  to  wait any  longer  to  see  more

resignations before remedial action  is  taken  by

the Health Ministry to keep doctors in service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what is more disturbing today is not the

exodus  of doctors from the public to the  private

sector,  but  the growing number  of  doctors  and

dental  surgeons  who  have left  or  are  leaving

Singapore  to  work or emigrate to Australia,  New

Zealand, the United Kingdom, U.S.A, and Canada!  I

hope  the  Hon.  Minister can produce  figures  to

highlight this very sad and very regrettable state

of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last comprehensive salary review for doctors

was  more  than 10 years ago. Unless an  immediate

review  of salary and service conditions is  made,

the  future of the health service and health  care

for our people will hang precariously in jeopardy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is today, the hospitals are grossly

understaffed. Work-load continues to increase. New

hospitals and new departments are set up and  with

fewer  doctors the work-load per doctor  naturally

increases.  Some departments, I am sure  the  Hon.

Minister  is  aware, are now running with  just  a

skeleton  staff.  I am sure the Hon.  Minister  is

also  aware that departments are running with  one

senior  registrar when there should be  four,  and

two  medical officers when there should be  seven,

and  five  housemen when there should be eight  or

nine.   What  incentive  is  there  to  keep   the

remaining doctors from leaving?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, private practice is attractive with every

good  prospect of earning multiples of the  salary

that  institutional service offers. Most certainly

it   is  preposterous  to  expect  Government   to

substantially  increase  salaries  to  match   the

private  sector.  What can be  done  is  to  raise

salaries to a more realistic and reasonable  level

and at the same time to offer fringe benefits such

as housing. Housing for the middle income group in

Singapore  is  without doubt its biggest  problem.

This  problem has been raised in Parliament during

this  Budget debate and the Government  has  shown

full cognisance of it. The cost of private housing

has  soared  way beyond the reach of  doctors  and

other  middle income wage earners. I am confident,

Sir,  that doctors will stay in service if housing

benefit is extended amongst other incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Ministry has made desperate attempts

to  solve the doctor crisis by recruiting  foreign

doctors into Singapore. More and more doctors  are

being  recruited from India and Ceylon.  Recently,

doctors  from the Philippines, Taiwan,  Korea  and

even  Indo-China  are recruited  to  prop  up  our

hospitals.  I  wonder if this move of  the  Health

Ministry is a temporary measure to meet the doctor

shortage,  or  is  this going to  be  a  permanent

feature.  Paradoxically, we in this  country  have

enough   doctors   of  our  own   to   staff   our

establishments. Sir, I do not propose  to  discuss

the  merits  or  demerits  of  recruiting  foreign

doctors.  What  I  hope  will  not  happen  is   a

situation  in  this country like that  in  Britain

today  where its hospitals and allied institutions

are run by foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the need for a review of salary and

service  conditions, there is an  urgent  need  to

attract  and to encourage more students  to  study

medicine. This is all the more necessary with  the

projected  plans to build new hospitals.  Has  the

Health  Ministry made any projection of its  staff

requirement  say, in five years' time?  Sir,  this

month,  out  of  26 dental surgeons who  graduated

from  the  University of Singapore, not one  is  a

citizen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



of this country. With more than 100 houseman-posts

available,  not  more  than  60  Singaporeans  are

expected  to graduate as doctors from our  medical

school  which proudly boasts to be one of the  top

medical institutions in the Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to part-time doctors, some 20-30

per  cent  of doctors are females. It is  a  well-known  fact  that  many  female  doctors  are  not

practising  their professional expertise  as  they

are  also  at the same time expected  to  be  good

housewives  and  mothers. In view of  the  current

staff shortage, would the Hon. Minister reconsider

the  Ministry's  stand not to  accept  these  lady

doctors for part-time service? Requests for  part-time  employment  in the Health Ministry  by  lady

doctors  have  up  till today been  rejected.  The

medical  establishments can  well  do  with  these

additional hands. The public spends almost $10,000

a   year  to  train  medical  students  to  become

doctors.  Can  the  Ministry  justify  this   huge

expenditure if the expertise obtained is to  waste

behind kitchen doors?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

the  Member  for  Kim Seng a lot of  doctors  have

resigned  since 1970. Could it be  that  there  is

discrimination in their promotions? There are also

some specialists who have resigned. How is it that

foreign  doctors  are promoted whereas  our  local

doctors are not promoted? If they are not promoted

they  will resign. The Minister must find out  why

Singapore  is  short of doctors.  Foreign  doctors

from   Australia,  U.K.,  Brunei,  and   Malaysia,

including  India,  can be accepted.  The  Minister

must  reconsider this matter and  try  to  recruit

foreign doctors who are able. It is unfair not  to

accept foreign doctors. Otherwise next year  there

will  be a bigger shortage of doctors. But if  the

Minister  does  not care about the  shortage,  who

will suffer? The people will suffer, and therefore

he must take into consideration what I have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to

the Member for Anson makes one think that only  he

is  concerned  about the shortage of doctors,  not

the  Minister or the Ministry. I think he has made

a very far-fetched statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just deal with the Member for Kim Seng now?

He  spoke about the shortage of doctors last  year

and also about why they should have their salaries

revised and so on, and that nothing has been  done

to date. That is not strictly true because, as far

as our specialist doctors are concerned, their pay

has  been  increased  by the  recent  increase  in

specialist  allowances. Further, they can  now  be

promoted on merit and their promotion will not  be

dependent upon vacancy in the posts available.  In

fact, there is no limit to the superscale level to

which they can be promoted. For example, a head of

a  unit  has been promoted to Superscale Grade  D,

whereas in the past heads of units were limited to

Superscale  Grade  E. That is just  for  a  start.

There have been promotion exercises, and it is not

true to say nothing has happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as medical officers are concerned,

hon.  Members may be aware that the National Wages

Council  has  been  given  the  responsibility  of

reviewing  salaries not only of doctors  but  also

others in the context of the nation as a whole. In

fact,  to  be  fair,  doctors  are  not  the  only

professionals working in the Government. There are

architects, engineers, and so on. So any  increase

or  revision  in  salaries must also  include  the

doctors.  Of  course, as the  Health  Minister,  I

would   very  much  urge  that  their  terms   and

conditions  of service are improved.  But,  before

the  National Wages Council deliberates over these

matters, the medical officer, in the meantime, has

benefited from the 13th month payment - there were

two  13th month payments in one particular year  - and  also  the  9  per  cent  wage  supplement  as

recommended by the National Wages Council.  So  it

is not true to say that nothing has been done with

regard to their salaries. Something has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



done although perhaps not as much as we wish it to

be.  But  it  is rather odd - and I am not  saying

anything  in objection - that salaries of  doctors

have  been  raised again and again in this  august

Assembly,  but  so far I have not  heard  in  this

Chamber  of  any raise in salaries of accountants,

engineers   and   architects   employed   by   the

Government.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the resignation of doctors.

Let  me  hasten  to  assure the public  that  they

should  not  be  alarmed.  Although  the  rate  of

resignation has increased, I do not think the  way

in which the Member for Kim Seng has presented the

case  is correct, that is, just because there  has

been  a large number of resignations in the  first

few months of this year, resignations will come up

to a very high figure by the end of the year. I do

not think that will happen. I would like to assure

members  of  the  public  that  although  we   are

understaffed at the moment we are not  badly  off.

In fact, some years ago doctors had to work longer

hours.   At  the  moment,  although  not  in   all

hospitals  but  in  quite a number  of  hospitals,

doctors have been given a day off following  night

duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the figures about the resignation

of  doctors in 1970, which the Member for Kim Seng

quoted, they are more or less correct. They  tally

with my figures although there may be a difference

of  one  or  two. Then he did ask me how  many  of

these  doctors had emigrated to Canada,  Australia

and  so on. I do not have the actual figures,  but

the figures which I have on migration are obtained

from  various  sources,  that  is,  the  Singapore

Medical   Association,  medical  colleagues,   the

Medical  Register and so on. I  can  say  that  in

1973,  out  of the 67 resignations, four  went  to

Australia,  one to Brunei, one to Canada,  one  to

India, one to New Zealand, one to Sibu, two to the

U.K, and  10 joined the University of  Singapore.

And  41  of  them actually resigned  for  personal

reasons, which means that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



they are probably in private practice earning,  as

the  Member for Kim Seng has said, three  or  four

times  more. If they want to earn much more  money

in private practice, we cannot help it. But we try

our  best to retain them. In fact, as far  as  the

movement  of  doctors from Government  service  to

private  practice is concerned, as  Members  would

know,  we have introduced two schemes to get  them

back  to work for at least a few sessions  in  our

hospitals.   First,   there   is   the   part-time

consultant   scheme  whereby  those   in   private

practice  who  volunteer to work in  the  hospital

will  be  paid  a  certain sum per  session.  This

scheme   is   particularly   helpful   to    those

departments which need the specialists  concerned.

The other scheme, of course, is the appointment of

honorary consultants so that their expertise  will

not  be lost in the private sector. In fact,  they

will see more searching cases in the hospitals and

their talents will be more usefully employed there

than in the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the point about foreign doctors having

been  recruited into the Singapore health service,

may  I  say  this? As far as Government policy  is

concerned,  we  do  not go out  of  our  way,  for

example,  to  advertise in the  press  to  recruit

doctors  from  other countries. Any applicant  who

writes in and is found suitable for recruitment is

offered employment. Recruitment of foreign doctors

into  the service is in the main confined to those

with  higher  qualifications. With regard  to  the

breakdown of figures of foreign doctors  which  we

have  employed, may I say that the  largest  group

consists  of Malaysians. We have in service  today 43  Malaysian doctors, 16 of whom are with  higher

qualifications     and    27    without     higher

qualifications. The second group  consists  of  13

Ceylonese,   11   of   whom   have   got    higher

qualifications,   in   other   words,   they   are

specialists.  Only two of them are without  higher

qualifications.  We have also six Indian  doctors,

two with higher qualifications and four without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



higher  qualifications. And there are  14  others,

five  with higher qualifications and nine  without

higher  qualifications. Altogether the  number  of

foreign  doctors is 76. As far as  our  policy  is

concerned, as I have said, we do not go out of our

way  to recruit foreign doctors. If they apply and

if  they  are  found suitable, we employ  them  if

there  are vacancies. We cannot be too choosey  in

our recruitment. If we have vacancies we fill them

up.  Of course, we are very concerned about  their

competence and standards. In fact, as I have said,

most  of them have higher qualifications. For  the

information of Members, the vast majority  of  the

Indian  and  Ceylonese doctors we  have  recruited

have recognised higher medical qualifications from

the U.K. Their qualifications include the M.R.C.P.

London,  or  Edinburgh, or  F.R.C.S,.  London,  or

Edinburgh.   Most  of  them  had   hitherto   held

specialist  positions in the  U.K, hospitals.  On

recruitment  into our service they were  appointed

directly  to consultant positions, as for example,

Senior  Registrars. Thus with regard to the policy

of  appointing doctors from overseas which I  have

enumerated,   the   possibility   of    recruiting

incompetent doctors is very much reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of them have performed

satisfactorily. However, in any group there  would

be  a  few who might not perform as satisfactorily

as we would have wished. In this respect there has

been  only one case in which it has been necessary

to  terminate  the contract of a  foreign  doctor.

This was not for lack of competence but because he

did not fit well into the service. However, if any

one  of  them is found to be incompetent.  We  can

easily terminate his contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the intake of medical and dental

students  into  our  medical  schools,   I   agree

entirely  that we should do our very best  to  get

our  citizens  to take up medicine and  dentistry.

But,  unfortunately, it appears  that  with  rapid

industrialisation  going on in Singapore  and  the

shortage of engineers, architects and accountants,

many  of  our young men now tend to opt  for  such

courses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



and  overlook medicine and dentistry. This is  the

situation we are now facing. But, in any case,  we

will  give  them every encouragement  to  take  up

medicine,  not  only for an under-graduate  course

but also a post-graduate course for those who have

already qualified. In fact, we have devised a very

attractive  training scheme for young  doctors  to

take  up  a  higher qualification. I do not  think

there  is much complaint as far as that scheme  is

concerned.  Many doctors have taken  advantage  of

that  scheme and, as a result, we produce quite  a

large number of Masters of Medicine in the various

specialities each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to projections for staff

requirements, may I say that there  are  not  only

new  projections  but also new services  as  well.

This is based on the criteria determined by actual

observation  in  the  ward. For  example,  in  the

medical unit, for every 70 beds there should be  a

staff  complement comprising one  consultant,  two

senior  registrars,  three  medical  officers  and

three  to  four housemen. The figures are  higher,

for  instance,  in  the surgical,  obstetrics  and

gynaecology  wards. Of course, this is  the  ideal

number. We try to project the Ideal, but if we  do

not  have the ideal number we try to make do  with

what we have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to incentives to retain doctors in

the  service,  particularly young  doctors,  apart

from  the  scheme for Government  officers  to  be

eligible  for  housing, we  are  also  considering

building some blocks of flats for medical officers

as  part  of  the development of the new  hospital

that  is coming up in Outram Road. I am personally

very  sympathetic  to  the  need  of  doctors  for

houses, especially the young doctors, who have not

established  their  own  homes.  My  Ministry  has

recently  appointed  a  committee  to  study  this

question  and to make recommendations.  I  believe

that  if  our young doctors are given houses  they

will  not  only be tied down to their service  but

they  will  also have something to  lose  if  they

think of emigrating.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to the Member for Anson, I might

as  well  enlighten the Member for Kim Seng  about

employing lady doctors part-time. I would like  to

say  straightaway that we have  a  scheme  at  the

moment to employ lady doctors part-time. It is not

that  we  have no such scheme. In fact, there  are

two  schemes  whereby doctors in private  practice

can be appointed to the medical service. The first

Scheme  A is based on sessional appointment  where

we  pay $30 for a two-hour session up to a maximum

of  $400  a month. The second Scheme B is a  part-time  appointment paid in proportion to the  hours

of  work given each week to a 42 hourly times  the

last drawn salary. Such appointments would be  for

those  who were previously in Government  service.

At the moment, in respect of Scheme A we have four

appointments.  For the information of  the  Member

for  Kim Seng, three of them are married women and

I  think  one  is  a male doctor. With  regard  to

Scheme   B,  two  lady  doctors  have  also   been

appointed. In other words, they are being utilised

for  the benefit of the medical service. It is not

true  to  say  that  their  applications  are  not

considered at all. We will be happy to take  in  a

larger  number  under  this  scheme.  Perhaps  the

Member  for  Kim Seng can encourage  some  of  his

colleagues to apply for these appointments.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I have left out anything else that the

Member for Kim Seng has raised, may I just  go  on

to  the Member for Anson. The Member for Anson has

again  brought  up  the  question  of  the  recent

amendment to the Medical Registration Act  whereby

we have in our local List excluded medical schools

in  India.  This  does  not mean  that  those  who

graduated  from medical schools in India  are  not

able  to  practise in Singapore. Under  a  certain

provision  of the Act, they can apply to practise.

The  Singapore  Medical Council will  judge  their

competence  by invariably setting an  examination,

and  on  passing  the examination,  they  will  be

registered. I have already answered this question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



when  the  Member for Anson raised it at the  last

Budget debate. Of course, the Member may have  his

own  views. But that is the position. It  is  very

important  that we guard our standards of  medical

practice very jealously. Other countries may  have

other  standards, but that is their privilege.  As

far  as  Singapore is concerned,  human  life  and

health  is  important and we want to  ensure  that

only  competent  doctors are allowed  to  practise

independently.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Government has again

brought  out  the  bogey  of  the  National  Wages

Council. It is not true that the doctors have  not

got  wage increments, wage adjustments and so  on.

They  do receive the 9 per cent and the 13th month

pay  and  so on. Sir, everybody receives  the  NWC

award,  not  just the doctors and architects.  NWC

recommendations  are the result  of  a  number  of

factors  -  to  make  adjustments  for  the   wage

restraints  and  for the cost of living  that  has

increased tremendously. Perhaps this may not be  a

permanent feature. But to say that doctors did get

wage  increases  is not correct. It  is  something

that 1 find hard to accept. The Minister said that

doctors  are  not  the only  people  who  did  not

receive   the  wage  increase,  but  others   too,

architects,  accountants, lawyers. But  the  brain

drain  in  the  medical services has been  greater

than in any other service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Does the Member have the facts

and figures?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I want the Minister to tell

me. I do not have the figures. I hope the Minister

would  be able to tell me that the brain drain  in

the medical services is not greater than the brain

drain  in  all the other services and,  therefore,

why  should there be wage adjustments for doctors.

It  is  not  for me to produce facts and  figures.

However,  Sir,  we  have examples.  Where  we  are

afraid  that  there will be further  resignations,

wage  adjustments have been made in the Government

service,  e.g, the Police and the Fire Brigade  in

spite of the National Wages Council awards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  we  should look into the  question  of

resignation  of  doctors much more carefully  than

just  writing it off as "What to do? We cannot  do

anything about it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of housing for doctors brought

up  by  the  Member for Kim Seng is worth  looking

into.  I  am glad the Minister has mentioned  that

the Government is looking into the possibility  of

providing doctors with houses. This is a  move  in

the  right direction. I know of a doctor who asked

his  wife to resign so that they could qualify  to

apply  a  Housing Board flat, as he was bonded  to

serve the Government. I think he had a scholarship

and, therefore, he had to serve for five years. If

he  did not have such a bond with the Ministry, he

would  have  resigned from the service instead  of

asking  his wife to resign. This is a matter  that

we have to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very fact that less people want to take

up  medicine is a sure sign that there is no money

in medicine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> No money in medicine in

Government service - if the Minister wants  me  to

be  specific. I think I heard - I hope I am  wrong

-the Minister saying that private doctors who come

to serve the Government are being paid $30 for two

hours. Sir, we get what we deserve. If we pay  for

quacks,  we  get  quacks. Look at the  newspapers.

Even  unqualified  private  tutors  for  secondary

school  students command much more  than  $15  per

hour, Sir!

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members that the

guillotine time for this particular Head  is  5.55

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

on  the question of medical services, the Minister

said  just now that there is a shortage of doctors

in  Singapore.  I would like to ask  the  Minister

whether   he  is  prepared  to  consider  allowing

Chinese  physicians to serve  our  people  in  the

hospitals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I brought this subject up

because he happened to be the Minister for Health.

If  he  were the Minister in charge of architects,

engineers or lawyers, I would have brought up  the

same topic under the pertinent Head. I raised this

point because I feel that there is a real case for

us  to  give careful and thoughtful consideration.

And  I thought that it would be helpful to him  as

the  Minister for Health. It was not my  intention

to  be  an  alarmist. I have quoted  figures.  The

Minister  has very cleverly reduced these  figures

and felt somehow that one should not be alarmed. I

hope he is proven right. He has raised a number of

points and it is a pity that I do not have time to

reply to them. I thank the Minister for mentioning

the  Ministry's care and concern about housing and

his  assurance that he will look into this problem

further. The second point is that he would proceed

to encourage more students, and in the coming year

I shall be watching it very carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for incentive programmes and traineeship

programmes to keep doctors in service,  I  beg  to

disagree  with him. In actual fact,  a  number  of

doctors who have elected for higher training  have

resigned  and have refunded to the Health Ministry

whatever  amount  they were  given  initially  for

further training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> How many?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I do not wish to quote

cases.  But if the Minister wants, I can give  him

cases. There was one classic case of a trainee who

went on leave for one week. On Monday, the Head of

Department  received a letter of  resignation  but

two  days  before  that he had  already  left  for

Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for part-time lady doctors, I am thankful to

the  Minister for mentioning that there are cases.

But it is surprising that this is somewhat unknown

or mysteriously hidden. There are in actual fact a

good  number of doctors who have applied but  have

been rejected. With the Minister's assurance, I am

sure  more  doctors  will apply  for  this  scheme

because in all sincerity I hope we attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



back into the service more people, whether they be

ladies  or men, because we need them just  as  the

Minister  has  said quite clearly earlier  on.  We

cannot afford to be choosey.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Half a minute for you, Mr Chua.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I just want to assure

Members  that we are concerned about this question

of  resignation  of  doctors and  we  are  looking

seriously  into it. That is why I  said  that  the

Ministry  has appointed a committee to  look  into

the  question of housing for our doctors. I  think

one  of  the attractions of retaining them in  the

service is the provision for housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the National Wages Council, I do

not  know why the Member for Telok Blangah is very

averse  to  the NWC. Of course, I quite understand

him.  He is a trade unionist. The point is: I  did

not say that medical officers should not have wage

revisions. I said that it should be revised in the

national  context, not only for  medical  officers

but  also  the other officers. That is  the  point

which I want to put clearly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, although I hate to end

this debate, I am grateful to the Minister for his

reply and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head MB be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Emergency Unit at the Outram Road

General Hospital does a good job most of the time.

But  there are times when this Emergency Unit does

not   live   up  to  its  name.  I  have  received

complaints that there are times when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



some  of the doctors and nurses attending to cases

brought in to this Unit have been found to be rude

and snobbish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors attached to this Unit must do their

work  only at this Unit but instead they are  made

to  go  on  ward duty as well. As such,  when  the

doctor goes round checking the patients, sometimes

with  housemen following him around  for  lessons,

there  is no other doctor available at this  Unit.

The  Emergency Unit is meant for emergency  cases.

Those  who  are  suffering in  pain  or  requiring

urgent treatment cannot wait for hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the case of a person who was brought in

because of a heart attack. He was attended to only

two  hours  later. By that time he was  only  good

enough to be pronounced dead. A life was lost  and

it  could have been saved only if proper attention

was  given  at  the right time. I also  understand

that often when patients are referred to the X-ray

unit  by the Emergency Unit, they are not attended

to as quickly as possible. This has resulted in an

ordinary  X-ray taking about two to  three  hours.

Sometimes the doctors are overworked and  some  of

the cases are not thoroughly checked. To quote  an

example,  there  was a case of a  statutory  board

employee  who fractured his leg in an accident  at

his  place of work. He was referred to the  Outram

Road  General  Hospital,  and  was  granted  three

months'  leave, but he is still not  fully  cured.

Though  the nature of his illness does not  permit

him  to  do normal duties, the doctor nevertheless

sent  him to work without recommending that he  be

given light duties because of his limping leg.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, since the doctor at the General

Hospital  had taken such a decision,  the  Board's

doctor  did  not want to overrule the decision  of

the   hospital  doctor.  I  think  they  have   an

agreement  between them. The patient  then  got  a

note  from  his  union leader to appeal.  But  the

letter  was ignored. Furthermore, I understand  he

was advised by his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



superior to take vacation leave instead. I do  not

blame  the  doctor for this decision; probably  he

could  have made a wrong decision due to  pressure

of  work. We take pride in our hospitals and their

facilities,  yet  there  are  many  services  left

wanting. Some buttons in the medical service  have

to be pushed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paediatric Unit too at the hospital is often

overworked. It is believed that there are  only  a

few  paediatricians  with many  children  to  look

after. If more paediatricians are appointed,  then

our  children  in  the  ward and  those  requiring

specialist   attention  will  not  be   neglected.

Sometimes  patients are turned away  just  because

the  doctors  in  the  section  had  gone  to  the

University  to give lectures to the students.  Why

is this section understaffed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also note that in this unit there is no

skin  specialist available. The children are  also

not referred to the skin clinic for treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, improvements are needed in the non-paying wards. There is often congestion in these

wards. Beds are placed all over the corridors  and

they  are  so  close to each other that  there  is

hardly  any  space  for  free  movement.  This  is

aggravated  when student nurses and  housemen  are

moving around during their lessons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, something is definitely wrong with the

billing  system  in  the  General  Hospital.  When

patients leave the hospital after treatment,  part

of the Bill is sent to the employer and part of it

to  the  ex-patient. This brings confusion to  the

employer  and  the  ex-patient.  I  am  sure   the

accounting  system in the General Hospital  is  no

better   either.  Why  not  eliminate   all   this

unnecessary  paper work by sending the  full  bill

directly  to  the  employer or the  ex-patient?  A

division of a single bill will thus be avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring this subject up because there n a case of

an  employee of a statutory board who was admitted

to  the  hospital some time back and he was  faced

with this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member

for Anson, I would like to enlighten him by saying

that it is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



true  that doctors in the Emergency Unit  do  ward

duties.  For his information, there are 18 doctors

attached to the Emergency Unit of the Outram  Road

General Hospital on full-time, and they do not  do

ward  duties at all. Up to March, 1972, there were

only  12  doctors attached to the Emergency  Unit.

This  number  was increased to 18 in April,  1972.

The  Head  of  the  Unit is a surgeon,  and  these

doctors are also not on 24-hour call-duty but on a

shift  duty of eight hours each. The Head  of  the

Unit is a surgeon and he operates on cold cases as

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Member for Anson that emergency

cases  are always promptly attended to by doctors.

However,  the  problem here is that  non-emergency

cases  come in to crowd the Emergency Unit,  which

is  meant for emergency cases. As a result,  there

could  be occasions when a genuine emergency  case

escaped notice and was not given proper attention.

The Member has quoted some particular cases. If he

wants me to look into them, he should write to  me

and  give  me the details. We will certainly  give

him satisfaction. He is in the habit of writing to

my  Ministry  and myself, and I hope he  continues

with that habit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to paediatricians, I would like to

assure him that there is no shortage of specialist

paediatricians.  In  fact, there  are  12  trained

paediatricians with higher qualifications  working

in  the children's ward in the Outram Road General

Hospital.  In  the  past year  more  doctors  have

acquired  a  higher qualification in  paediatrics.

However, no skin specialists are available in such

wards.  Skin  specialists are available  in  units

specialising  in  this field, and  references  are

made to such specialists, if necessary. It is  not

possible to have all sorts of specialists  in  one

ward.  In  so  far as congestion in  the  ward  is

concerned, it is hoped to alleviate this situation

when  the  new  Outram  Road General  Hospital  is

completed, when we will then have more beds in the

Paediatric Unit. Of course, the problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



is  that we will have more and more children,  and

that is why family planning has to be stressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to non-paying

wards  in  the Paediatric Unit in the Outram  Road

General Hospital. By this, I suppose he refers  to

C  class wards, and his implication is that  there

is  no  crowding  in the A and B class  wards.  In

fact,  in  the Outram Road General Hospital  there

are no A and B class wards for children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to patients being turned away because

doctors  have  gone  to  the  University  to  give

lectures  to  medical students,  may  I  say  that

patients,  whether  they are attended  to  by  the

University  doctors  or  Government  doctors,  are

usually requested to come on the appointed day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to bills, they are never sent

partially to the patient and the employer. As  far

as  the Ministry of Health is concerned, bills are

sent to either the patient or the employer. A bill

is sent to the employer if the employer is willing

to  furnish a letter of guarantee. However, if  an

employer  is  not willing to furnish a  letter  of

guarantee, the bill is always sent to the patient.

In  industrial  cases  where  it  is  possible  to

identify the employer, the bill is always sent  to

him.  However, in a manually operated system which

has to cater for anything up to 180 bills per day,

minor  errors are bound to occur. However, Members

may   wish   to  know  that  the  feasibility   of

computerising the billing system is  under  active

study, and we hope to implement it before long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in view of the somewhat

high  rate  of  turnover of medical staff  at  the

hospitals,  I  presume  we have  to  depend  quite

heavily on newly qualified doctors and housemen. I

am  just  wondering whether the Minister can  off-hand tell the House what is the average length  of

medical experience of doctors in the hospitals. He

has many times emphasised on the competence of the

medical  staff, and I am just wondering what  sort

of arrangements are in force to supervise the work

of these young doctors or housemen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, young doctors are always

supervised  by  the  consultants  and,  therefore,

supervision  is adequate. So I do  not  think  the

Member for Jalan Kayu should worry very much  over

this point. In fact, with the recent increment  in

specialist  allowances,  there  have   been   less

resignations from among our Government specialists

than from among our medical officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I was a bit disturbed when

the  Member  for Anson alleged that a patient  was

not  attended to in time. There was some delay.  I

just want to know whether or not the Minister  for

Health  has  received any such complaint.  Was  he

aware  of this case or did he come to know  of  it

only just now when the Member for Anson brought it

up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I myself was very disturbed

when  I heard that. In fact, the Member for  Anson

should  have written to me, but he thought it  fit

to bring it up only now. He should have brought it

up to me in a letter, which lie normally does. The

point is this, and I have said just now, we try to

give prompt attention to emergency cases, but  the

trouble is that the non-emergency cases crowd into

the Emergency Unit. As a result, genuine emergency

cases may have inadvertently escaped attention. In

fact,  the  doctors and nurses now and  then  pick

cases which need urgent attention and they do give

prompt  attention straightaway. The  non-emergency

cases, of course, have to wait.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, with regard to this

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head NA be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1004.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Home Affairs is a very important Ministry because it is charged with the

responsibility   of  safeguarding   our   internal

security,  peace and the maintenance  of  law  and

order.  Recently, a security corps was  formed  by

the  national  servicemen  to  play  the  role  of

maintaining law and order. It goes without  saying

that the setting up of this corps is a right move.

On  the one hand, it helps the Police to keep  law

and  order. On the other hand, it helps to  enrich

the  experience of the Vigilante Corps members and

to train them to be more competent in their role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the organisation of this Vigilante Corps

is  not  big  enough.  There are  only  about  100

members  doing patrol duty. It is not  sufficient.

More members should be deployed in the rural areas

and  the housing estates. That is why I would like

the  Minister to consider increasing the  strength

of   this   corps.  I  understand  that   national

servicemen  in the Vigilante Corps number  20,000.

Sir,  it is not difficult to recruit more national

servicemen  of the Vigilante Corps  to  do  patrol

duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allowance paid to members of

the  Vigilante  Corps, I think the amount  is  too

small. Members of this corps receive only about 25

cents  per  hour for their training.  It  is  very

small; 25 cents is not enough to pay for their bus

fares.  Sir, I would like the Minister to increase

the allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allowance to the group leader

of  the Vigilante Volunteer Corps, I would like to

cite one example. In my constituency there are two

group  leaders. They are very dedicated  to  their

duties  as  they utilise their leisure  hours  for

this  civic role. They have done so for more  than

10  years. At present, they are in charge  of  the

volunteer   corps   in   several   constituencies.

However,  for carrying out their duties, they  are

paid  only  80 cents per hour for their transport.

This  is not enough. The price of petrol has  gone

up.  The  price  of premium petrol  is  now  about

$3.20,  an increase of about 50 per cent over  the

past  year.  Sir,  I would like  the  Minister  to

consider increasing the transport



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



allowance for the group leaders in order to offset

their loss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the

recruitment of volunteers for the Vigilante Corps,

the  number  of volunteers is only about  300-400.

Sir,  there has been a reduction in the  programme

of   activities.  In  order  to  revive  the  full

programme of activities, I would like the Minister

to  consider  recruiting more members.  I  believe

there  are many dedicated citizens who would  like

to  participate in such activities, and this is  a

useful means to train up our citizens to serve the

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have received some

complaints  from Vigilante Corps members  that  in

the  allocation  of duties they  are  deployed  to

other constituencies. This is not good because  it

will  increase their transport expenses and  their

duties  will  be made more difficult because  they

are  not  familiar with the environment  in  other

constituencies.  In  posting these  members,  they

should  be  posted  to constituencies  near  their

homes so that they can more effectively carry  out

their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to talk about long hair. I

appreciate  the efforts made by the Government  to

get rid of long hair. There is an Action Committee

concerned   with  this  anti-long  hair  movement.

Although  two years have passed, we can still  see

many  people  with  long  hair.  Even  in  certain

Government  departments, there are civil  servants

with  long  hair. Why is this so? I  believe  that

apart from a minority of people with long hair who

come  from  abroad, cinema shows  also  have  some

influence   on  our  young  people   because   the

characters in films also sport long hair.  If  the

heroes  in  these films keep long hair, our  young

are  apt to copy them. They believe that in  order

to  become heroes, they must imitate or copy their

hair styles. Sir, in order to get rid of long hair

styles  vigilance  should be kept  up  and  action

taken  to  deal with those who keep long hair.  On

the  other  hand, we should also ban  those  films

showing long-haired heroes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, lastly, I would like to

talk about internal security and what the Ministry

should  do. There should be more Police  Weeks  to

promote  better relations between the  Police  and

the  public in order to achieve greater peace  and

order in the Republic. We should bear in mind that

co-operation with the Police is part of  our  duty

as citizens. If better relations exist between the

Police   and  the  public,  there  will  be   less

opportunity for people to commit crimes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

to seek clarification on procedure. It seems to me

that  it  is  a  habit  of  the  hon.  Member  for

Sembawang  to  jump the queue. First  of  all,  he

talks about Vigilante Corps which should, in fact,

be  raised under Head NA subhead FA 1111. Then  he

proceeds to talk about the Police which should  be

raised  under Head ND -Police. Sir,  if  we  allow

this  to go on, there is not going to be any order

around.  Then how are we going to debate? I  would

like a ruling on this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang, I am aware of that. In

fact,  I  consulted the Clerk on this,  but  since

there is no objection either from the Minister  or

from  hon. Members, I have allowed the Member  for

Sembawang  to  go on. So the next time  you  think

that  the  Member  is violating  Standing  Orders,

could  you  please object, so as  to  give  me  an

opportunity to make a ruling?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> In that case, can I be

permitted  to speak now on Police brutality?  Will

the  Minister object to that? I am going to  speak

on  brutality  which is more a subject  of  policy

than  the  question of Police Week,  which  is  an

administrative matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is a question of policy, Mr

Hwang,  you can go ahead. But I will stop  you  as

soon as you touch on administrative details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. From

the number of complaints I have heard lately in my

"Meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



the  People"  sessions, it is evident that  Police

brutalities   are   on  the  increase.   What   is

unfortunate is that most people who have had rough

treatment dished out to them are reluctant to come

forward  and  make official charges  for  fear  of

subsequent  retaliation, and also  they  can  ill-afford  the  time  and money  involved.  From  the

stories  one  hears, the Police officers  seem  to

have refined their techniques of brutality to such

an  extent  that they do not leave  any  tell-tale

marks  that  might incriminate them  subsequently.

With  their  knowledge of the rules  of  evidence,

they will make sure that subsequent identification

is made impossible. In cases where the responsible

persons  are  identified, there are always  ready-made  witnesses  among  their  own  colleagues  to

testify to their innocence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most of our Police stations, the lock-up is

being  used rather too liberally. I have heard  of

cases  of  persons caught without driving licences

or some such similar offences, and thrown into the

lock-up until they are able to contact their homes

for  the licences to be produced. How many of  our

citizens, because of minor omissions or oversight,

have  been subjected to the indignities  of  being

treated  as  common criminals? I dread  to  think!

Over   the  last  couple  of  years,  the   Police

Department, as quite rightly pointed  out  by  the

hon.  Member  for Sembawang, has  been  trying  to

promote  the  image  of  being  "friends  of   the

people".  But unless we make sure that  atrocities

of  the nature I have just mentioned are put to  a

stop,  I  cannot  see  how the  Police  Force  can

succeed  in  being  accepted  as  friends  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all fairness, I must say that most of the

misconduct  took place among the  lower  level  of

officers,  often  without  the  knowledge  of  the

officers-in-charge, most of whom are  perhaps  too

heavily loaded with work to be able to keep an eye

on  things. For example, the Officer-in-charge  of

the  Police station in Jalan Kayu also  has  under

his  control  Serangoon Gardens, Upper  Serangoon,

Punggol, Nee Soon and Sembawang, which come to  an

area



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



almost  half of Singapore. Maybe it is about  time

that the whole organisational structure was looked

into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since two

hon.  Members have touched on Police, I would like

to bring up something on a matter of policy too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would appeal to Members that, as

far as possible, the debate should be confined  to

the  relevant  Head because it is very  unfair  to

those  Members,  who have made amendments  to  the

various  Heads, if they should not  afterwards  be

able to find the time to speak. But as long as the

discussion is on policy, Members can go ahead. But

I  would  appeal  to all hon. Members  to  confine

themselves to the Head under discussion.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Thank you, Sir. Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the  present traffic situation on  the  road

endangers  pedestrian  life immensely.  Statistics

will show that about 50 per cent of the road users

killed every year are pedestrians.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that

I think is not a matter of policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since there is a subhead for that,

I  suggest the Member should wait until we come to

that subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are there any other Members who

wish to speak on the Ministry of Home Affairs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  what I wish to talk has nothing to  do  with

the  Police  or the policy on Police.  The  social

ethos of Singapore is getting worse. Yesterday  at

about  4.00  a.m, there was an incident  involving

some foreign streakers. They have come from abroad

to my constituency to streak themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I interrupt the Member? Is the

Member's speech going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



to  be  a policy matter, or is it just a narrative

of an isolated incident in his constituency?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  this  matter is related to policy,  but  you

must  give me the opportunity to develop my  theme

on the policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If it is an incident which

the  Member thinks the Police should do  something

about,  I  suggest  he raises it  under  the  Head

-Police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I

say  to the Member for Potong Pasir and the Member

for  Bras  Basah that there are many  items  under

which they can raise their points. They should not

worry   about  them.  They  should  not   be   too

impatient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, may I just touch on the point raised by

the  Member  for Jalan Kayu? He raised  the  point

that allegations or complaints of Police brutality

are on the increase. As far as I can see, I do not

know  whether Police brutality is actually on  the

increase  or because people are now more conscious

of  their  rights that there have been an increase

in  the number of complaints. In any case, I would

like  to  emphasise that, as far as the policy  of

the Ministry of Home Affairs or that of the Police

is concerned, we do not tolerate Police brutality.

I  made this very clear in my speech last year  at

the annual dinner of the Police Force - I think it

was sometime in September or October - that as far

as  the Ministry of Home Affairs is concerned,  we

do not tolerate Police brutality. I agree entirely

with Members that if we do not check any instances

of Police brutality, whatever we do in Police Week

to  foster  good relations between the public  and

the  members  of  the Police Force  will  come  to

naught.  One  instance of an actual occurrence  of

brutality can undo all the good work that has been

done.  In other words, one single shower  can  wet

the  whole field. Of course, there are always  two

sides to a case. Let us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



be fair. There will be allegations. Some are true.

Some are motivated by revenge. Therefore, some may

not  be  true  or some may be true. But  I  assure

Members   that   every  complaint,  whatever   the

motivation, is thoroughly investigated  into.  For

acts  of brutality by members of the Police Force,

which  are substantiated, disciplinary action  has

been  taken and will continue to be taken. Members

can be rest assured of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point was about a person who committed

a  traffic  offence  was found without  a  driving

licence  and  was  put  in a lock-up.  Of  course,

technically,  if  a  person  cannot  produce   his

driving  licence or an identity card to  establish

his  identity, he will be arrested.  But  we  have

given  instructions  to  members  of  the  Traffic

Police that in cases where a person cannot produce

his  driving licence or identity card, but  if  he

can  satisfy  the Traffic Police of his  identity,

then  he  should not be arrested. Technically,  of

course, he can be arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about the Police

Division  under which jurisdiction Jalan  Kayu  is

included, of course, that Division covers  a  vast

area  under  the charge of an 0/C. It is  a  Rural

Division.  Therefore, coverage tends to be  larger

because  there is less population. It is like  the

delineation  of  the  constituencies.  Some  urban

constituencies are much smaller in area than rural

constituencies  which are very large  because  the

population  in  the rural areas is  more  sparsely

spread  out than in the urban areas. But  I  agree

that  the  Police Divisions - we have  eight  Land

Divisions - - which had been fixed years ago, have

to be re-delineated. A review is now being made to

re-delineate these Police Divisions in  the  light

of  developments which have taken place in  recent

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Sembawang's

comments,  I  would like to thank him  for  paying

tribute   to  us  for  setting  up  the  Community

Security Force of the Vigilante Corps. Of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



he  has also at the same time made some complaints

which  I will deal with now. One of his complaints

is  that the Force is a bit too small. He wants it

to  be enlarged. At the moment the strength of the

Community Security Force is about 2,400.  However,

because  of  the initial success achieved  by  the

Community Security Force, plans have already  been

made to expand it to 5,000 by July, 1974. Although

the  present force is mainly deployed in the urban

areas  which  are  more crime  prone,  it  may  be

possible  later  on to deploy them  to  the  rural

areas in which the Member for Sembawang may have a

vested interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the case put forward by the Member

for   Sembawang  for  increasing  the   travelling

allowance  to  members of the Vigilante  Corps,  I

would  like  to  say  that the Ministry  will  not

consider  any increase in the allowance  given  to

national  servicemen  in the Vigilante  Corps,  in

view  of  the increase in bus fares and in  petrol

prices.  The  reason  is  that  members   of   the

Vigilante Corps have been granted concession rates

for  travel  on buses. For a revised  fare  of  20

cents  to  40 cents, the Vigilante Corps  national

servicemen need only pay 20 cents. Thus, the total

increase  in  bus  fares would  only  be  marginal

compared to the total allowance paid for each duty

session.  On  the question of giving an  increased

allowance to offset increases in petrol prices,  I

do  not think that an affirmative decision will be

consistent  with our policy, which the  House  has

heard for the last one week, to persuade owners of

private  vehicles to economise  in  their  use  of

petrol.  Furthermore,  members  of  the  Vigilante

Corps   are  deployed  for  limited  policing   in

increasing  numbers,  and  they  will  patrol  the

vicinity  of  their own residence. Therefore,  the

necessity for travel will be considerably reduced.

But,  of course, the Member has mentioned a number

of cases where members of the Vigilante Corps were

deployed in areas away from their residence. There

might  have been exceptions but as far as possible

we try to deploy them in the areas where they live

for obvious reasons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about long hair, the

Member has thought fit to raise it again, although

I  had answered the question quite comprehensively

last  week.  In  any case, may I say  that  it  is

always our policy to take action against those who

sport  long  hair. Of course, if  the  Member  for

Sembawang  has  seen any Government  officer  with

long   hair,   he  can  himself  make   a   report

straightaway  and action will be  taken.  He  also

mentioned that in some of the films, and I suppose

he  has seen them, the heroes have got long  hair.

He  said that this should be discouraged. I  agree

with  him  entirely but I thought he  should  have

raised this matter with my colleague, the Minister

for Culture, when his Ministry came up for debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also brought up the matter about fostering

better relations between the police and members of

the public. May I say that this has always been at

the  back  of our minds, as a result of  which  we

have   been  conducting  Police  Weeks.  For   the

information of Members, this year we are going  to

have   a  much  bigger  campaign  to  foster  this

relationship. It will come on in June. In place of

the  Police  Week  we are going to  have  a  "Keep

Singapore Crime Free" campaign. Not only will  the

theme of good public relations with the Police  be

stressed,  but  there are also other  themes,  for

example,  how members of the public  can  help  to

prevent crime. They will be along the lines of the

mass  campaigns which we have had,  for  instance,

the "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign, where Members

of Parliament as well as the Citizens Consultative

Committees  are  involved. I hope the  Member  for

Sembawang will actively support this campaign.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg your indulgence to

say  a  few words. I am most appreciative  of  the

Minister's  assurances, but the unfortunate  thing

is  that  when complaints of Police brutality  are

passed   down  the  line,  to  what   extent   are

investigations   conducted  seriously   by   those

implementing   Government  policy?  The   Minister

himself has just pointed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



out that he is not aware whether the incidence  of

Police  brutality has gone up or  whether  it  has

come down. That in itself indicates the complexity

of   bringing  up  complaints  against  a   Police

officer.  If  a  person were to make  a  complaint

against a particular policeman, he would very soon

find  that  another officer from the  same  police

station  is  sent to investigate, and the  officer

would take two or three hours or even a day or two

harassing  the  complainant  with  all  sorts   of

queries  and  so on. Since the Minister  has  said

that  he is very concerned about maintaining  good

relations  with the public, will he  not  consider

looking into the existing rules and regulations to

see  whether  there are ways whereby  people  with

legitimate  complaints  can  "short  circuit"  the

existing  technicalities, and whether  or  not  in

view   of   the  ineffectiveness  of  the  Central

Complaints  Bureau  to set  up  his  own  separate

complaints  bureau? In this way, I am  quite  sure

the  relationship will go a long way. This  is  my

suggestion.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other aspect, I think it is not right to

say  that  the  population of the rural  areas  is

smaller.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The density is lower.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> The density might not be as

high  as  the  urban  areas,  but  the  number  is

certainly  not  less.  So with  the  same  numbers

spread  over  a much bigger area, is it  not  more

reason for a much bigger staff to police the area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I clarify the point

about  Police  brutality?  It  is  not  that   the

Minister  or the Police Commissioner is not  aware

of  it.  The point is, as I have said, we  do  not

tolerate  Police brutality if there is  a  genuine

complaint.  If complaints are made, they  will  be

investigated. In fact, if the Member wants to know

more  about it, he can put in a Question for  oral

answer  and  he will get a detailed answer  as  to

whether any action has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



been  taken in respect of such complaints. I think

that will be more satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about complaints and why

members  of the public are reluctant to  complain.

The Member says that the Central Complaints Bureau

is  ineffective.  I  do not think  the  Bureau  is

ineffective. We do get complaints from the Central

Complaints Bureau. But at the same time  there  is

no  reason  why members of the public  should  not

approach their MPs. Our MPs are very hard-working;

they   look   after   the   interests   of   their

constituents. In fact, one complaint  came  to  me

through   one  of  the  MPs,  and  it   is   being

investigated.  I  do  not  think  we  should  have

another  bureau.  It  is  just  bureaucracy  being

duplicated.  The MPs are the persons to  whom  the

complaints  should be made. MPs have been  writing

complaints  to me on behalf of their constituents,

and  there should not be any fear on the  part  of

members  of the public to make complaints so  long

as  they  are genuine complaints and not motivated

by  some other ulterior motive. Of course, in  any

organisation, we have the black sheep. II is  only

when these complaints are investigated that we can

know  who the black sheep are, so that action  can

be taken. Instead of making general complaints, it

will  be  more  helpful  if  particulars  of   the

complaints  are given so that the  matter  can  be

looked into. We have to be fair to both sides, and

when the whole truth is out appropriate action can

be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, it is not that the MPs are

not  willing to help. We do our best  to  help.  I

have heard of many cases, and I have tried to  get

the complainants to give me a signed statement but

they  are simply not prepared to do so. We as  MPs

like to act responsibly. We like to be fair to the

Department, as the Minister has pointed out, and I

cannot  therefore just write to the  Minister  and

say  that  so-and-so has complained  that  he  was

beaten  up. I have to ask the complainant  whether

he  has a medical certificate to prove that he has

been beaten up, and whether he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



prepared  to sign a statement. Surely without  all

this evidence, the Minister is not going to accept

our complaints.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I am not criticising the

MPs.  I  am  saying that they form a good  channel

through which such complaints can be made. I agree

entirely  with  the  Member for  Jalan  Kayu  that

before  they put up complaints to the Ministry  or

to  the  Minister concerned, the  matter  must  be

properly  presented. There must be statements  and

so  on.  I  agree. But if the person who wants  to

complain refuses to give a statement, we can  draw

our own conclusions. Why do they refuse to give  a

statement? Members can say that the complainant is

frightened.  But  what can we  do  if  he  is  not

willing   to   substantiate  his  complaint?   The

complaint  must be substantiated with a statement.

Is  that so difficult for the complainant?  If  he

does  not want to give a statement, then what  can

we  do? I appreciate the difficulties of the  MPs.

In the same way, if a person comes to the Ministry

himself to make a complaint and he refuses to give

a  statement, what can we do? Then the matter must

lie there. I am not criticising the MPs at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, if people are fearful of

coming   forward  with  complaints,  surely   that

indicates,  as I pointed out, that there  must  be

something  wrong with the manner in  which  we  go

about  with our investigations. Therefore,  should

we  not start looking in further and say, "Are the

investigating   officers  harassing   them?"   The

Chinese saying is Kwan kwan shiang hu. Have we got

this sort of situation? Surely we just cannot bury

our  heads  in  the sand, or like  the  proverbial

three monkeys which symbolise, "Hear no evil,  see

no  evil, and speak no evil"; therefore, there  is

no evil.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, we certainly do not want

to  be the proverbial monkeys or bury our heads in

the  sand.  Let us look at it from a common  sense

point  of  view. If a person comes  along  with  a

complaint but is not prepared to substantiate  it,

what can we do about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



it? I can assure Members that these complaints  go

direct  to  the Commissioner of Police.  They  are

investigated into, and if there is anything  wrong

with  the  investigation,  then  there  are  other

avenues  for further investigation. There  is  the

Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, which  can

further investigate into the matter if we are  not

satisfied  with  the investigations  conducted  by

senior Police officers. May I remind Members  that

these complaints are investigated by senior Police

officers  and,  as the Member for Jalan  Kayu  has

said,  Police  brutality is alleged to  have  been

committed among the lower rung of officers. If the

Commissioner  of  Police  and  the  senior  Police

officers  are  involved with  the  investigations,

what fear should there be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, in view of the

sentiments   and  concern  shown  towards   Police

brutality  by  my  colleagues,  I  wonder  if  the

Minister would consider setting up a parliamentary

commission  to  help him look into the  nature  of

Police  brutality  and  to ascertain  whether  the

increase  in the incidence of Police brutality  is

due  to  the  refined technique of the  Police  in

dealing with innocent people, or is it due to  the

increased consciousness on the part of members  of

the  public. There must be a reason why the recent

movie   "Walking  Tall"  was  so  popular  amongst

Singaporeans.  Could  the Minister  enlighten  the

House  on  whether he would seriously consider  my

suggestion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I do not think we need a

parliamentary  committee or a commission  to  look

into this matter. As I said, public assurance  has

been  given  over and over again that any  genuine

complaint will be looked into and, if the  culprit

is  identified, action will be taken against  that

person.  I  have  also said: it is quite  probable

that  the  increase  in the number  of  complaints

means  that  members  of the public  are  plucking

courage  to come up and make their complaints.  It

is a good thing. That is my feeling and assessment

of the situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to talk about the Vigilante

Corps. I heard the Minister saying that he is  not

prepared to increase the training allowance for VC

members. I feel that the reasons given by him  are

too  simple  to  be credible. In actual  fact,  we

should consider increasing the allowance for basic

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that they are paid only 25 cents per

hour  for basic training, which is normally for  a

duration of four hours. Therefore, they get only a

maximum   of  $1.  Although  they  are   given   a

concessionary  rate  for  public  transport,   the

minimum bus fare is 20 cents. Therefore, for a  VC

member to go to his centre for training, he spends

40  cents for his journey to and fro. Furthermore,

he  may spend 30 cents on drinks. This amounts  to

70  cents.  After  the four-hour  training  at  10

o'clock, he may have a snack which costs about  50

to   80   cents.   Therefore,  according   to   my

calculation, a VC member spends at least $1.20  to

$1.50  on a night out for training. Therefore,  to

pay him $1 is inadequate. In the past, with $1  he

could  possibly have a balance of 30 cents to  buy

candy  or  sweets for his children. But  time  has

changed.  I hope the Minister will look into  this

matter more seriously, because I cannot accept the

reasons  that he has given for not increasing  the

allowance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I fully

support  the  views expressed by  the  Member  for

Bukit  Panjang. I also feel that the reasons given

by  the  Minister were too simple. At the  present

moment,  the  minimum bus fare is 20 cents.  There

are  also  other  factors  to  consider.  So  this

allowance  of 25 cents per hour is too  little.  I

hope the Minister will reconsider this matter  and

give  adequate allowance to the trainees so as  to

raise  their  morale in the present circumstances.

The  Minister may not have heard this very clearly

just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allowance for the group leader in the

Vigilante Volunteer Corps is also inadequate.  The

group leaders go on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



patrol  duty in various areas to supervise the  VC members.  In  discharging  such  patrol  duty   at

specific  times and at specific places, a  lot  of

travelling in their own cars is involved. If  they

have  to travel by taxi or by bus, it can even  be

more  costly.  If  they are asked  to  walk,  then

unless  they are marathon walkers it is impossible

for  them  to do so. The present rate of allowance

at  80  cents  per  hour for transport  for  these

people  is  too  little. I hope the Minister  will

give sympathetic consideration to this matter.  It

does  not  mean that because we must economise  in

the use of fuel we should overlook this matter. If

they  are  to economise in the use of petrol,  how

are they going to discharge their duty?



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, of course, if I can raise

the  allowance I will do so. But the point is that

a  good  case must be made out before  it  can  be

raised. I find that a good case has not been  made

out  to  increase  the allowance.  Therefore,  the

suggestion  will not be considered unless  a  good

case  can be made out to raise the allowances  for

the Vigilante Corps national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the two group leaders from Sembawang -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> There are many group leaders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Well, many group leaders. This

is  a  matter  of  detail, but if the  Member  for

Sembawang  feels very strongly about  it,  he  can

write to me about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister has just

mentioned  that so far a good case  has  not  been

made   for  his  consideration  to  increase   the

allowance of the Vigilante Corps members. Can  the

Minister give some sort of guidance as to what  he

means by a good case, and what are the criteria? I

should  say that to pay the rate of 25  cents  per

hour is most ridiculous. That is a trade union's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



point of view, and I believe Members of this House

would support my views too.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, there is a very long

list  of amendments yet to be moved and I have  so

many  items to speak on. I may not get  the  time,

and therefore I wonder if I may speak now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, what are you

going to speak on?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On the same Ministry, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have got until 7.15 p.m, to

speak  on  this Head. Are you going  to  speak  on

Can you just wait a minute?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng:</b> Sir, just now the Minister said

that the Vigilante Corps does not have a good case

to   fight  for  an  increase  in  allowance.   My

colleague, the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, has asked

him  for  guidance as to what he means by  a  good

case.  Just  now  I have put in  my  case  to  the

Minister  for  an increase in the  basic  training

allowance.  The  reasons are that bus  fares  have

been increased from 20 cents to 40 cents, and soft

drinks  from 20 cents to 30 cents. Furthermore,  a

bowl  of  mee which previously cost 30  cents  now

costs   50  cents  or  80  cents.  So  the   total

expenditure per night's training is about $1.20 to

$1.50. Previously he required only about 70  cents

to 90 cents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, may I interrupt you? You

have  made your point earlier, so would  you  like

the Minister to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng:</b> But the Minister did not give

any  consideration at all. That is why I  have  to

point it out again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, but you are only repeating

yourself. Would you like the Minister to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As I have said just now, the

payment  of  the  allowances  was  primarily   for

transport. I do not know about any allowance for a

bowl  of  mee, soft drinks and so on. In  fact,  I

have  answered the Member's question when  I  said

that  as  far as transport is concerned,  the  bus

fare for the Vigilante Corps is half the rate.  In

other  words, the increase was only from 10  cents

to 20 cents. That is about all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have a

few  more  points to support a good  case  for  an

increase in the allowance, although I have already

given  him  enough reasons for a good case.  After

training they have to send their uniforms  to  the

laundry  which will cost them $1.00.  So  this  is

another point to make out a good case. Is that not

enough?  There  are some members of the  Vigilante

Corps  who are still unemployed, and they have  to

get  pocket allowance from their parents to attend

the  training. Is this still not another point for

a good case?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> This is a ridiculous follow

up,  Sir! First, it was a bowl of mee, and now  it

is  because of dhoby charges, and so on. As I have

said,  this  allowance is primarily for transport.

We  can go on ad infinitum - maybe he needs a pair

of  spectacles, and this too has now  gone  up  in

price.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do not

want  to  say  anything  more.  I  beg  leave   to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head NA he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BA ll09.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can we have some facts and figures on drug-taking from the Narcotics Bureau? Recently there

has   been   a  spate  of  drug-taking  incidents.

Recently, too, there was a report on sex  and  pot

parties  in  the  newspapers. How  active  is  the

Bureau?   How  effective  are  their  sources   of

information?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that long hair is associated with drug-taking. It is observed that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



still have the problem of boys sporting long hair,

and most of them can be found in coffee houses and

along certain streets. What action has this Bureau

taken against these people? Again, in many places,

you  can  see  groups of youngsters  mingling  and

disturbing  the  people who are  passing  by.  One

would not be surprised to see a drug session going

on. Does the Bureau raid all these places to catch

and reform the drug addicts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson's

observation that there has been a recent spate  of

drug-taking incidents is not strictly correct. Our

records  have indicated that signs of drug  abuse,

especially  amongst our youths,  have  started  to

decline.  Strict enforcement action, such  as  the

closure  of  discotheques in November last  year,

has  to some extent helped to check the spread  of

drug  abuse  among youths. As to  be  expected,  a

number  of  existing young drug addicts have  gone

underground. However, a close watch is being  kept

on   places  that  they  are  likely  to   gather.

Eventually  all  of them will be  sought  out  and

action  taken  to  help  them  rehabilitate.   The

Central  Narcotics Bureau is doing all it  can  to

raid  all  places  and areas  suspected  of  being

haunts  of drug addicts and abusers. The  Director

of the Bureau has since January this year sent 218

young  drug  addicts to St. John's  Rehabilitation

Centre for compulsory treatment and rehabilitation

under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the press report on sex and pot

parties  referred to by the Member, investigations

have indicated that it has been highly exaggerated

for  sensationalism. The young people who gathered

at  Tanah Merah beach in Changi over the past  few

months  did so in small separate groups.  Most  of

them  are teenagers, waiting for their examination

results.  The majority of them did not indulge  in

drug-taking   or   even  in  unseemly   behaviour.

However, surveillance has been kept by officers of

the Central Narcotics Bureau.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in mid-November, 1971, the

Central  Narcotics  Bureau has been  very  active.

During 1973 a total of 3,339 arrests were made  by

the Bureau involving drug offences. Of these, only

507  or  6.4  per cent were committed  by  persons

below  20  years  of age. This is  an  encouraging

sign.  Since  the Misuse of Drugs  Act  came  into

operation  in July last year, the Bureau  arrested

111  drug traffickers and pushers. These purveyors

of  misery and death have since been convicted  in

court.  Their  sentences ranged  from  a  fine  of

$5,000 and two strokes of the cane to seven years'

imprisonment  and  two strokes of  the  cane.  The

activities  of  drug  trafficking  syndicates  are

always   cloaked  with  tightly  secured  secrecy.

Enforcement agencies in other parts of  the  world

have   great   difficulties  in   penetrating   or

obtaining  information  about  such  sophisticated

syndicates. The Central Narcotics Bureau faces the

same difficulty. However, the Bureau's sources  of

information can be considered good.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CA 1111*.



(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs P. Govindaswamy and Hwang Soo Jin.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice the policy on citizenship keeps

changing  all the time. As far as possible,  I  do

not write letters to the Registrar of Citizens. If

at  all  I  do,  I  write only  when  I  think  an

applicant has a reasonable case. And I do write it

with  my own laborious handwriting and get a reply

which  I  am  sure you are familiar with,  Sir:  a

cyclostyled note



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



with  a  signature  on it on the  very  next  day.

Perhaps  we  should  at least be  treated  with  a

little more courtesy than this cyclostyled note.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, some time back the

granting of citizenship was a major problem in our

Republic.   Today   the  situation   is   entirely

different. May I know what is the present ruling?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that citizenship is not a right but

only  a  privilege. I agree with the  ruling  that

there   should   be   restrictions   in   granting

citizenship,  taking into account the  social  and

economic  problems of the Republic. However,  some

time   back  it  was  announced  that  loyal  army

officials   would   have   special   consideration

attached  to  their application  for  citizenship.

With  regard  to  this category of  applicants,  I

would like to ask the Minister a question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Singapore citizen with two Sons who

were born abroad. The boys joined him in 1958. The

elder  boy faithfully joined the army as a regular

national  serviceman in 1961. He is  now  a  staff

sergeant  and  is  married to a Singaporean.  They

have a child born in Singapore. In 1969 he applied

for  citizenship  and,  after  going  through  two

interviews, he is still waiting for a  reply.  Why

does  it take so long to consider his application?

If  the  Minister  wants the particulars  of  this

case,  I would not mind giving him the application

number for his easy reference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the younger brother, after

finishing his studies in Singapore, went abroad to

continue  his education. He has been returning  to

the Republic every year to renew his passport.  He

has  every  evidence to prove that he went  abroad

solely for educational purpose. He too had applied

for  his citizenship and was unsuccessful  in  his

first attempt. Today this poor boy is in Singapore

with  an  academic degree, and is  still  awaiting

anxiously for the result of his second application

for  citizenship. And because of  his  non-citizen

status he is unable to get a proper job.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



He  had  also  loyally applied for  a  post  as  a

regular serviceman at the CMPB. Two weeks later he

received  a reply in the negative. But he  decided

to  make  a  trip  to  the CMPB  to  ask  why  his

application was turned down. The official told him

that  they  were  not dealing with  graduates  and

referred  him  to the O.P.C. This  young  lad  was

given  the  same reply. But this time he  was  not

given  a verbal reply at the O.P.C, as the reasons

were regarded as confidential. It is believed that

because of his non-citizen status, he is unable to

get  on.  What is going to be the plight  of  this

boy?  His  age  is  catching up and  he  is  still

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know why foreign women

who  are married to Singapore citizens take a long

time  to  get  their citizenship. Can the  Minster

enlighten me on this subject?



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I

deal with the Member for Anson first, and then the

Member for Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Member for Anson agrees with

Government's basic policy on citizenship, that is,

grant  of  citizenship  is  not  a  right  but   a

privilege,  and that there should be  restrictions

in granting citizenship by taking into account the

economic  and social problems of the  Republic.  I

would  like to inform him that there has  been  no

basic  change  in this policy. The main  criterion

upon  which  citizenship is granted  is  that  the

applicant should not be a liability but should  be

able  to make a positive contribution towards  the

economic wellbeing of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession referred to by the Member

regarding  service  in the  SAF  applies  only  to

persons born on or after the 1st of January, 1949,

that  is,  those within the call-up age group  for

national  service.  Permanent residents  who  have

completed      full-time     national      service

satisfactorily  will be eligible  for  citizenship

provided they have completed five years' residence

in  Singapore.  Citizenship status  will  only  be

conferred   after   completion   o   five   years'

residence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case brought up by the Member refers to an

applicant  serving as a regular in  the  Singapore

Armed  Forces. To enable the Registrar of Citizens

to  look into this case, I will appreciate  it  if

the Member will supply more details. In respect of

the  application  by the younger  brother  of  the

applicant mentioned, the application may have been

rejected  on the grounds that he has not fulfilled

the  residential  requirement. More  details  will

also  be required. I am surprised that the  Member

has not written to me on these two cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the foreign woman married to a

Singapore  citizen, she must first  apply  to  the

Controller of Immigration for permanent  residence

in  Singapore. Once permanent residence  has  been

granted,  she  must  reside in Singapore  for  two

years   before  she  can  qualify  to  apply   for

Singapore  citizenship. The Member will appreciate

that  owing  to  the large number of  applications

from  such persons, it will necessitate some  time

for the application to be processed. Since 1969 to

28th  February, 1974, there were a total of 32,257

applications from such persons. The applicant must

also take her turn in the queue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the query by the Member for

Telok Blangah, regarding the stencilled reply that

he  gets,  may  I  say  that whenever  he  gets  a

stencilled  reply,  he can  be  assured  that  all

enquiries   have  been  seen  to  and   personally

processed  by  the  Registrar  of  Citizens.   The

majority  of  these enquiries are for  expeditious

consideration of applications and for  information

on  the progress of the application. As it is  not

possible to indicate the outcome of an application

until  a decision has been made, a standard  reply

that  the  application is under  consideration  is

given.  And  in  view  of the  numerous  enquiries

received  daily  at the Registry,  not  only  from

Members   of   Parliament  on  behalf   of   their

constituents but also from members of  the  public

direct,  the  reply is stencilled.  If  stencilled

replies  for such enquiries were not given,  there

would   be   a  waste  of  material  and  manpower

resources. However, may I point out to the  Member

that the reply saying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



that  the application is under consideration means

that  there  is hope that the application  may  be

granted  at  a future date, no matter whether  the

reply was handwritten, typed or stencilled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some time back a Singapore citizen, who had

been  employed for many years in the Army, married

a  foreigner. But due to his loyalty to Singapore,

he was unable to make a trip to visit his wife for

some  time. He had applied for a visa for his wife

to  join him. But his application was turned  down

due  to  the fact that both of them had  not  been

living together for more than five years. Since he

was  unsuccessful in his effort to  get  his  wife

down he decided to migrate to join his wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I be enlightened as to what is the

present  ruling  on the question  of  Singaporeans

wanting their foreign wives to join them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point I would like to raise is: what

precautionary measures are being taken  along  our

coast  and  entry points to prevent the  entry  of

illegal immigrants? Press reports state that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



these  unwanted people are in Singapore.  What  is

the Immigration Department doing about this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

law  governing  the  entry of wives  of  Singapore

citizens for permanent residence is set out in the

Immigration  (Prohibition of Entry)  Order,  1973.

Under  paragraph  3 of the Schedule  to  the  said

Order,  the wife of a citizen who has not  at  any

time  after  her  marriage been living  separately

from  her husband for a continuous period of  five

years  may be granted permanent stay in Singapore.

This  law  has been in operation since  1959.  The

underlying  presumption is that  if  a  couple  is

really  attached to each other, they would not  at

any time live separately for more than five years.

It  is not only possible for the Singapore citizen

husband  to  visit  his wife  in  her  country  of

residence, hut the wife herself can also  come  to

Singapore from time to time on a temporary  social

visit  pass,  even if she is not ready  to  settle

down  permanently here. To be equitable,  the  law

has  to  he  applied  equally  to  all  concerned.

However,  if it can be proved that the  separation

of  a  couple is due to circumstances beyond their

control,   my  Ministry  is  always  prepared   to

consider and approve their application on  special

compassionate grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the precautionary measures taken

to  prevent entry of illegal immigrants, may I say

that  concerted action has been and is being taken

by  the  Police  and Immigration authorities.  The

Marine  Police,  while patrolling the  territorial

waters of Singapore, are on the look-out for small

vessels   sneaking  in  with  illegal  immigrants.

Members  of  the Police Force, on  beat  or  other

duties, carry out frequent checks to detect  those

who manage to enter. Surprise checks and raids are

performed   by   the  Immigration  Department   on

information  received.  In  addition,  Police  and

Immigration Officers carry out surprise checks  at

various worksites all over Singapore. Such actions

have  resulted  in continuing arrests  of  illegal

immigrants throughout the year. When arrested,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



illegal  immigrants are detained,  prosecuted  and

removed after serving their sentences. Heavy court

sentences  are  being  pressed  for  against   the

traffickers whenever they are arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments have already been made to the

Immigration  Act to provide for the imposition  of

heavier    penalties   for   illegal   immigrants,

harbourers,  employers and traffickers.  With  the

enactment  of  the  Immigration  (Amendment)  Act,

1973, with effect from the 1st of March this year,

traffickers   are  now  liable   to   caning   and

forfeiture of their vehicles or vessels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to extol the Government for the

marvellous  way  in  which it  tackled  the  "sea-jackers" problem in Singapore recently. Whilst the

Government is to be praised for this, the 13 civil

servants  are  worthy of even greater  praise  and

commendation for the risks they had taken to  save

the   Government  from  this  misfortune.  It   is

believed that initially the 13 officials had great

difficulty in obtaining landing rights  in  Kuwait

until  the  leader  of  the  delegation  tactfully

persuaded   the   authorities   there   to    make

concessions.  I  wonder if  the  Government  would

consider some form of commendation for these brave

and loyal civil servants. Though the situation was

tackled  very tactfully, can the Minister tell  us

what  security measures have been taken to protect

our islands and coasts? There may be other similar

attempts in the future. After this recent incident

at  Pulau  Bukom, what safety measures  have  been

introduced at these vital installations? Incidents

of  sabotage  can occur again. We must  make  sure

that we do not relax in our vigilance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the police patrol cars have quite often

proved to be the losers when chasing criminals who

escape  in more powerful cars. Obviously something

must  be done about this. Is there any possibility

of  introducing a helicopter service to track down

criminals who flee from the law?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to draw the attention of this House

to  the  streakers who run naked in some  American

University  campuses and then  into  the  streets.

Within  the  short space of a few days,  this  new

trend  has  spread to France, Japan  and  then  to

Hongkong.  Just as the mini-skirt, the long  hair,

the  drug  addiction and the free-sex parties  had

come  from  the West to the East and then  to  our

Republic,  it will not be long before  "streakers"

will  be seen running in our Singapore streets.  I

was  told that some of the girls and boys used  to

loll naked at Changi Beach at night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indecent or obscene exposure has been regarded as

a  minor offence and penalties of perhaps  $10  or

$20 fines have been imposed. I would like to point

out that a streaker's exposure is not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



same  kind  of obscene exposure that we have  been

dealing  in  the  past. This  is  part  of  a  new

movement  designed to destroy  the  youth  and  to

damage   the  socio-economic  structure   of   the

country. This is a serious matter, and I urge  the

Government  to  introduce  severe  penalties   for

streaking before they become a regular feature  in

Singapore. Our investments in our youth  would  be

frustrated  and, in order to save our  youth  from

this evil influence, may I venture to suggest that

offenders  be  punished by caning for  the  damage

they   do  will  be  no  less  severe  than   drug

traffickers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know the functions of our

Special  Constabulary.  How  do  they  serve   the

country and the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the Member for Potong

Pasir that we have six minutes to go. Will he,

therefore, leave three minutes for the Minister to

answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Yes. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

present  traffic situation on the  road  endangers

pedestrian  life immensely. Statistics  will  show

that  about  50 per cent of the road users  killed

every year are pedestrians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the need for higher standards of

roads,  traffic markings, improved vehicle  design

and   driver  training,  there  is  a   need   for

pedestrian  training.  The National  Safety  First

Council  has  done a great deal towards  promoting

the  awareness of pedestrian safety with the  help

of  the Traffic Police, the National Trades  Union

Congress   and   other  interested  parties.   But

pedestrians keep dying on the roads. It appears as

if  pedestrians are still unaware of  the  dangers

lurking   on   the   asphalt  jungle.   Organising

pedestrian  safety  campaigns in  itself  must  be

lauded. But are we achieving the results we want?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this lack of knowledge among

pedestrians can be corrected through education and

campaigns. But the devil-may-care attitude of some

pedestrians   cannot   be   erased   without   the

introduction of sterner measures. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



Government  is failing in its responsibilities  if

it  does  not  take  cognisance  of  the  terrible

tragedies that are caused on our roads and come up

with an effective answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to protect those who seem

not  to  want to protect themselves. Suicides  are

against  the  law.  Why is jay-walking  permitted?

When   will  legislation  be  introduced  to  help

pedestrians  protect  themselves  and  other  road

users?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I hope I can do justice

to  the two Members but the time is limited. First

of all, I agree with the observation of the Member

for   Anson   that  the  13  civil  servants   who

accompanied the four Laju hijackers to Kuwait  had

shown dedication to duty. In fact, the Ministry of

Home    Affairs   is   considering   putting    up

recommendations  for  this  year's  National   Day

Awards  for  those who had given  outstanding  and

dedicated service during the Laju affair. However,

the award for commendation for outstanding service

is  considered collectively by the Government once

a  year.  As it is not yet time for the Government

to   consider  the  annual  awards,  it  would  be

inappropriate  for me to comment further  on  this

subject without pre-empting Government's decision.

Immediately  after the sabotage attempt  at  Pulau

Bukom, the Government reviewed the security of all

our   vital  installations,  and  hence   security

measures  were  immediately  put  into  effect  to

prevent any similar attempt in the future. We have

also tightened the security of our Airport and the

various  entry  and landing points of  our  Island

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member's point about Police cars

chasing  criminals along Singapore roads, I  would

like  to inform the Member that, contrary to  what

he  has  said,  the patrol cars  have  been  quite

successful  in apprehending criminals  fleeing  in

cars  after  a chase. Only recently, a patrol  car

from  "E" Division spotted a stolen vehicle,  gave

chase and finally caught up with the wanted man to

recover  the  stolen vehicle and  apprehended  the

culprit. There have been

many  instances  where  Police  patrol  cars  have

caught up with the fleeing vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point about the feasibility of introducing

helicopter  service  to  combat  crime  has   been

considered by my Ministry. However, in view of the

prohibitive  costs  involved,  both  in  terms  of

initial  outlay  to purchase the  helicopters,  to

build  helicopter  pads, etc, and  the  recurrent

costs   of  maintenance  and  operation   of   the

helicopters  as  well as manpower training,  since

the Police has no qualified helicopter pilots, the

project  has been shelved for the time being.  The

main   reason   for  wanting  to   introduce   the

helicopter  service to combat crime,  however,  is

not  to  chase  criminals on land  but  rather  to

undertake   harbour  and  sea  patrol  to   combat

smuggling  activities and illegal immigration,  to

assist in traffic control and emergency evacuation

operations  and  so on. It is not meant  to  chase

criminals. In view of the need to economise in the

face  of  the uncertain world economic  situation,

consequent  upon  the energy crisis,  my  Ministry

will  not be pursuing the project any further  for

the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to streaking. The Member for

Anson's concern over undesirable trends, like  the

streakers  infiltrating into  Singapore,  is  very

much  appreciated.  To-date  the  Police  has  not

received any complaint of such incidents. However,

it  is  envisaged that, except perhaps for a small

minority, streaking would not appeal to our youths

who  are  basically Asian in outlook where modesty

is  still  one of our strong tenets, I  hope.  The

Police,  however,  will  deal  severely  with  any

streakers  brought to their notice. Under  section

24  of  the  Minor Offences Act, a first  offender

will  be  liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine  not

exceeding $250 or to imprisonment for a  term  not

exceeding  one  month.  On second  and  subsequent

convictions, the offender will be liable to a fine

not  exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for a  term

not  exceeding six months. However, in  future  if

the  situation merits it, the Member's  suggestion

that  such  streaker  offenders  be  caned  or  be

subjected  to  other  forms of drastic  punishment

will be considered. Until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



then,  I do not think the Member for Anson  should

be too unduly worried about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am not worried.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> With regard to the point

brought  up  by  the Member for Potong  Pasir  for

effective control of traffic, I agree that traffic

supervision is becoming increasingly difficult  in

view  of the rapid increase in the number of motor

vehicles and drivers on the road. Recognising  the

importance  of  this function, the  Government  is

giving  high  priority to the Traffic Police.  For

the first time the Mobile Squad, which is the main

traffic law enforcement arm of the Traffic Police,

has  been  brought up to full strength early  this

year.  The  Mobile Squad is now operating  with  a

full establishment of five senior officers and 184

junior  officers, 137 motor cycles,  22  scooters,

two   pursuit  cars  and  two  sets  of   portable

electronic  traffic analysers, commonly  known  as

speed traps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also a selective enforcement squad of

traffic  police  organised  since  1972.  This  is

beginning  to  show results. The total  number  of

road  accidents  for the year 1973  is  35,977  as

compared with 36,125 for the year 1972, showing  a

decrease of 148 cases. At the same time, the death

toll  also registered a decrease. In 1973 a  total

of  380 persons were killed as compared to 390  in

1972,  showing a decrease of 10 in the  number  of

persons  killed  in  road traffic  accidents.  The

decrease  is all the more significant considering,

the   fact   that  the  motor  vehicle  population

increases at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. It

is  because of mounting traffic accidents that  we

will   be  launching  a  mammoth  "Keep  Singapore

Accident Free" campaign in October this year,  and

I  hope  Members of Parliament will  support  this

campaign.
