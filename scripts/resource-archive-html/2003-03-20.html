<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, yesterday I finished

replying to questions on the Trim and Fit programme.  Let

me  continue  with what Mr Ng Ser Miang  had  called  the

gifted sports classes.  Mr Ng would be glad to know  that

besides  Parkview  Primary School,  there  are  11  other

primary   schools,   including  Fuchun,   Admiralty   and

Evergreen Primary schools, involved in this pilot  scheme

sponsored by the Singapore Sports Council.  Anglican High

School and Temasek Junior College have also started their

sports  classes.  MOE's approach is to allow schools  the

autonomy   to  decide  niche  areas,  including   sports,

depending on their needs and resources.  However, I would

like to clarify that these are not gifted sports classes.

The  Sports School, which is scheduled to open  in  2004,

will  be in a better position than mainstream schools  to

look  after the sports and academic needs of gifted young

sports  talents.  It is for this reason that MOE supports

the establishment of the Sports School by the Ministry of

Community Development and Sports, which determines, among

others, the Sports School's entry requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now answer some specific queries from MPs.

Dr  Maliki  suggested  that  the  Ministry  of  Education

conduct  a study on the profile of the teenagers who  had

abortions  and  target our sexuality  education  at  this

group  of  teenagers.  Our programme is targeted  towards

all  pupils  of  different backgrounds and experience  in

sexuality  matters.  Our main focus is on  education  and

character building.  Our approach is directed at upstream

measures  and,  hence, proactive in nature.   We  aim  to

impart   to  all  pupils  the  necessary  knowledge   and

inculcate   a  responsible  attitude  towards   sexuality

issues.  MOE's Sexuality Education Programme was drawn up

after studying successful programmes in both Western  and

Asian  countries.  This programme incorporates strategies

to  address  the needs of teenagers who are  at  risk  of

engaging  in  sexual activities that might lead  to  teen

pregnancies and abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked if schools provide dedicated

follow-up services to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



students   suspended  from  school.    As   I   mentioned

yesterday,  the  school would only mete out  disciplinary

action like suspension, as a last resort, for the student

to  reflect  on his misbehaviour.  During the suspension,

the pupil will be given school assignments to ensure that

time is gainfully spent.  Schools tap on professional MOE

counsellors  to  work with pupils before and  during  the

period  of his suspension to deal with the root cause  of

his  misbehaviour.   Parents are also  involved  in  this

whole   process  to  fully  understand  the  purpose   of

suspension  and  to  ensure proper supervision  at  home.

When the pupil returns to school, a meeting would be held

with him and the parents with the principal, to help  the

pupil  integrate back into school life.  The school would

continue to provide counselling, when necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong asked if our National Education

programmes are kept up-to-date on current developments in

national  and  global  issues,  like  terrorism  and  the

impending  Iraq  war.  Yes, definitely.  Current  affairs

provide  very  useful  opportunities  to  raise  national

education  issues for discussion.  Within the  classroom,

History,  Social  Studies and General Paper  lessons  are

examples  of  where  this  may  be  done.   Outside   the

classroom, dialogue sessions with senior civil  servants,

annual   pre-university  seminars  and  various  National

Education talks are the usual forum to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi expressed concern with the continued

implementation of National Education and values education

programmes  when  principals  are  rotated  and  changed.

National  Education and values education are key features

of  our  education which are implemented in all  schools.

Furthermore,  the  system and processes for  implementing

these programmes are already in place in all our schools.

Our  principals  and  teachers  will  implement  National

Education and values programmes regardless of the schools

that they are in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, even as

a young boy, I sensed from my school environment that the

arts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



subject  is  one which is least emphasised.   It  is  the

easiest  to  handle because faring well in it was  really

inconsequential, unless, of course, the student hopes  to

use  the  arts  subject  marks to  pull  up  his  or  her

cumulative results, then it becomes useful.  On the other

hand, parents are also not to be blamed.  They respond to

the  environment and prepare their children to  face  the

future  where arts have little to contribute to.  Perhaps

this  is  what they feel.  In times like this,  my  worry

increases  as support and resources for arts and  culture

are  threatened.   We  have, however,  demonstrated  some

commitments when funds are given to private arts  schools

like  NAFA  and  LaSalle-SIA.  However, the  real  issues

remain:   what  is  the position of  arts  in  our  local

schools?  Are qualified teachers teaching the subject, or

has  it been reduced to logistics and available manpower,

ie,  any teacher from any discipline that has an hour  to

spare   will  end  up  teaching  the  subject?   Are   we

particular about standards?  Is it still the first to  be

sacrificed each time the school is shorthanded?



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I am

pleased  that the Ministry of Education has taken several

initiatives over the last three years to improve the pre-school  education here.  In December 2000, MOE  announced

the minimum qualification of kindergarten principals.  In

October the following year, the minimum qualification and

composition   of  kindergarten  teachers  were   defined.

Earlier this year, a framework of kindergarten curriculum

has  been  introduced  and, finally,  the  MOE  announced

recently that the new Kindergarten Education Bill will be

introduced in Parliament shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all aimed at ensuring quality pre-school

education for our children.  Some of us will remember the

story  of "Meng Mu San Chian".  Meng Tze is a very famous

Chinese scholar.  His mother Meng Mu shifted house  three

times  -  not to upgrade from a 3-room flat to  a  4-room

flat,  to a 5-room flat, and then to an Executive flat  - but  to give her son a better environment to study.  This

goes  to  show that the children's education is close  to

the hearts of parents.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



therefore  welcome the greater attention  given  to  pre-school education here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make three points with regard

to  pre-school education.  With the introduction  of  the

new  criteria  and the framework of curriculum,  we  must

have a system to monitor the progress of compliance, even

though the curriculum is not compulsory, and I agree that

it  should  not be made compulsory.  We must be  able  to

know which kindergarten has adopted it and which has not.

The parents must also know, so that when they enrol their

children, they can make informed choices.  Therefore, can

we  consider  some kind of accreditation system  to  give

recognition to those who have adopted the system?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, additional financial resources may need to

be  given to help the lower income families so that their

children  will not be denied pre-school education.   Pre-school  education is generally more expensive than formal

education  because  there is limited Government  funding.

The  lower  income families may need help to  keep  their

children in the kindergartens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I hope the introduction of the Kindergarten

Education Bill will not imply greater rigidity.  We  must

continue  to encourage creativity and diversity.  I  hope

the  Government will continue with its light touch policy

on education, more help and guidance, rather than control

and regulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although pre-school education is not

compulsory, it has become very much a way of life for our

younger  families.  With MOE placing greater emphasis  on

improving pre-school education, I have no doubt that  our

young  ones  will  benefit from a better  run  pre-school

system.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, I would like to

applaud  the  Ministry  for introducing  a  comprehensive

framework  to improve pre-school education in  Singapore.

Currently, pre-school education is not regulated  by  any

authority.    Although  it  is  part  of  the   childcare

services, it may be subject to MCDS rules.  The structure

of pre-school education that exists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



today is very much geared towards preparing children  for

primary  one.   There  is  a lot  of  focus  on  teaching

children to read, write and count, but very little on how

to  help  them to acquire the kind of skills and thinking

capabilities that are needed to help them deal  with  the

increased  complexities, both in our  school  system,  as

well  as  in life.  However, Sir, to achieve the outcomes

that  are  desired  under this new  pre-school  education

framework,  we  must have teachers with the  quality  and

capabilities  to  deliver these new standards.   This  is

where  the  new  pre-school  education  teacher  training

framework   and  accreditation  of  teachers   are   very

important.   Teacher training will be a big challenge  as

many of the existing non-profit kindergartens do not have

enough qualified teachers based on the new framework.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another challenge for most kindergartens would be

how  to  provide kindergarten teachers with a challenging

career  path.   If our teachers upgrade themselves,  they

will  need better motivation and career path compared  to

what currently exists.  Sir, with this revamp of the pre-school education system, there is clearly a need to  look

at  the  primary school syllabus as there  is  a  linkage

between   the  two.   The  Ministry  has  announced   its

intention  to  introduce  single  sessions  and   smaller

classes  for the lower primaries, and I also look forward

to  a  revamp of the primary education syllabus  so  that

there  is a continuous flow from pre-school education  to

primary and to secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on parent perception. The research

that  was  started  by the Ministry on  the  pilot  group

indicated that most of the parents are happy with the new

pre-school  education change.  I would like to  ask  that

the Ministry continue to focus on reaching out to parents

on   the  new  pre-school  education  syllabus.   My  own

experience tells me that there are still many parents who

like  the old rote learning method.  Recently, one parent

complained to me that the PCF



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



kindergarten did not give enough Chinese spelling to  her

child,  compared  to  the private kindergarten  that  her

child  was  previously attending.   So,  if  parents  are

geared towards one mindset, and the MOE wants to put pre-school  education  on  another track,  there  will  be  a

mismatch.   One suggestion that I would like to  make  is

for  MOE  to  encourage those parents covered  under  the

survey   and  who  had  found  that  the  new  pre-school

education  is  better to speak up.  In  this  way,  other

parents will also be more confident and will support  the

changes better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other concern which parents may have is

increased  childcare fees.  The improvements  to  teacher

training  and other teaching methodologies will  increase

the  cost of childcare education.  This may be passed  on

to  parents.   I hope that the Ministry can also  address

this  point.   The  bottom  20-30%  of  households,   for

instance,  is  very  sensitive to changes  in  prices  of

kindergarten  education, and may pull out their  children

if  prices go up.  This would be detrimental to the  very

children whom we are trying to help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also hope that the requirement to license

kindergartens  and  all costs related  thereto  will  not

translate into higher business cost.  I do ask  that  the

Ministry exercise some restraint in imposing licence fees

or other costs on kindergarten operators, as again I fear

that this will get transferred to parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I support the flexibility granted to

kindergarten  operators to develop their  own  curriculum

based on the broad framework set by MOE.  This is a  step

in  the  right direction and is in line with the need  to

provide greater diversity in pre-school education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I hope that we will achieve the

outcomes  desired  by the Senior Minister  of  State,  Mr

Tharman,   when  he  described  the  kind  of  pre-school

children  he wants to see - eager to learn, confident  of

themselves  and willing to persevere, able to communicate

with teachers and classmates.

<br>11.15 am



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, our education reforms and

training  must  create a globally competitive,  creative,

employable   workforce.   Our  system   must   facilitate

Singapore's   transformation   into   a   knowledge-based

economy, and this system begins with the very young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A growing body of research has identified the

complex  interplay between the brain  and  what  a  child

learns from his environment.  And that the young immature

brain  is  very open to early experiences, good  or  bad.

The  fact is that from the time of conception to the  age

of  five, a child's brain develops at a faster pace  than

at any other time in his life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Association of Education of Young

Children  (NAEYC) in the USA believes that  the  children

who  have  high-quality early childhood programmes  "gain

skills  that  are normally associated with greater  brain

development   such  as  problem  solving  and   language,

mathematics and literacy skills."  They also  gain  other

competencies such as self-control, higher motivation  for

learning  and social skills.  Thus, it cannot  be  argued

otherwise   that   pre-school  education   provides   the

foundation for learning throughout the child's life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Sir, I am happy to see new initiatives

such as the PSC grants and plans to uplift the pre-school

standard.   They are positive steps.  However, I  believe

more needs to be done.  I would encourage the approach to

be  more holistic  -  things like preparation for school,

character    development,   discipline,    the    child's

initiative, inquisitiveness, creativity and  so  on.   My

message   is  that  the  same  amount  of  emphasis   and

importance that we give to formal education must also  be

given to pre-school education in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I am glad

that  since  I  last spoke on this topic in  last  year's

Committee  of Supply, the salary scales for  teachers  of

special   education  (SPED)  schools  have  been  raised,

although a gap still exists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>



between  mainstream and special education  teachers.   In

fact,  some special education teachers who teach children

who  are  more  difficult  to handle  are  given  monthly

premium allowances. However, I understand that the  whole

issue   of   lack  of  career  development  and  training

opportunities   of  special  education   teachers   still

persists.   In  fact, there is a lack of trained  special

education teachers today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do understand that SPED teachers are under the

purview  of NCSS, and not MOE.  However, I would like  to

urge  MOE,  as  the Ministry in charge of  education,  to

spearhead  and coordinate the training of these  teachers

who  perhaps  need  even  much more  help,  as  they  are

handling children with special needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of secondment of mainstream teachers to

SPED  schools, I understand that MOE's policy is to limit

the  secondment to one or two terms of two years, so that

these  seconded teachers do not lose out in their  career

development   as  against  their  counterparts   in   the

mainstream schools.  This is indeed well intentioned  but

it,  inadvertently, deprives SPED schools of a source  of

trained,  dedicated teachers with a compassion  for  SPED

students.   Will  it  not  be  possible  to  accord  such

teachers  equal  opportunities  to  training  and  career

development  and advance, even as they are on  secondment

to the SPED schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another avenue by which SPED schools can have more

access  to  the  services of well-trained  teachers  from

mainstream  schools is to have a roster  of  postings  of

available  and  willing mainstream  teachers  to  special

schools  and  give them hardship allowances  during  this

posting.   This will facilitate the transfer and exchange

of   skills  and  knowledge,  which  will  also   benefit

mainstream schools as the teachers become more conversant

and  compassionate to children with learning disabilities

in their midst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also pleased to note that, in recent

years,  the  inclusion of high functioning children  with

special  needs into mainstream schools has received  much

higher understanding from MOE.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, there has been one mainstream secondary

school  per cluster fitted with facilities to accommodate

children with special needs.  However, a recent study  of

inclusion  of high functioning hearing-impaired  students

in  mainstream schools shows that more has to be done  at

the  operational level to alleviate some of the  problems

faced   by  the  physically  challenged  students.    For

instance,  in  one case, a hearing-impaired  student  was

punished  at the school assembly for not doing  what  she

was  told.  In fact, the real reason was that the teacher

did  not  know  that she could not hear the  instructions

clearly  and  thought  she was  acting  up.   A  standard

operating procedure could have been easily put  in  place

to  help ensure students with hearing impairment to  hear

the  instructions,  say, through a  buddy  system.   More

attention  and thus resources are needed to  improve  the

current  structure  and systems of  integration  for  the

special needs children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, there are about 20 special

education schools today run by VWOs with funding  support

from   the   Government.   There   are   numerous   other

organisations running special education services  without

funding support.  However, there is a need to do more for

special education.  Sir, I should disclose my interest at

this  point that I am a director of Care Corner  Limited,

which is operating a learning clinic for children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to request the Ministry to consider

three  areas:  firstly, physical facilities  for  certain

disabilities, eg, autism.  There is a rather long waiting

list  for  admission into special schools.  I  understand

that  the special school at Margaret Drive has a  waiting

list  of about 200 and the average waiting time is  about

two  years.  We need to increase the capacity to meet the

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, teacher training. I agree with Dr Amy Khor

that this is an area that we should look into.  I believe

that  one  of  the constraining factors is  the  critical

shortage of qualified teachers for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



special education.  Therefore, the existing teachers  are

all  burnt out and this has led to even higher attrition.

Part of the problem is the low remuneration level and the

lack  of a career path. The Ministry could look into this

and  see  how we can help train more teachers in  special

education and provide them with a career path within  the

mainstream, so that they do not lose out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, financial assistance. The real cost of

providing  education to children with  special  needs  is

very high, sometimes four to five times that for ordinary

education.  The actual cost varies depending on the  type

of  disabilities.   Some  children  may  need  individual

specialists   to   help  to  cope  with  their   learning

difficulties.   Few can afford this.   The  situation  is

compounded by the fact that it is quite common  that  one

of  the parents has to stop work to help take care of the

child.   Many  of them are facing physical and  emotional

stress today.  Sir, these parents need some help to  cope

with  the  situation.   I hope that  the  Minister  would

consider  providing additional assistance to the  parents

to  help  them keep their children in the special schools

if needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, children are our asset and our hope for the

future.  They are a source of joy to our family life.   A

small  number  of  them, unfortunately, need  some  extra

help.   If  help  is  unavailable,  they  may  drop   out

eventually and become a burden to the family, society and

the  nation.   But  if we can offer adequate  and  timely

help, most of them may be able to contribute meaningfully

to the society, and some of them may even make it back to

the mainstream.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I too

would like to join the chorus to ask for more support for

special  education.  Not so long ago, we discussed  about

changes for upper secondary education to develop our best

and  brightest.  So we also ought to discuss changes  for

special education in order to cater for the other end  of

the   spectrum,  which  is  the  intellectually  disabled

including the autistic children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too note that the numbers have increased. Perhaps

the statistician would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>



say  that this is due to growing awareness.  But the fact

remains,  as  has been said by Mr Gan, that  there  is  a

queue waiting to be admitted to special schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have a wonderful education philosophy

which is to accord free and compulsory education for  all

our  young up to the age of 12.  We should include  these

kids  into this catchment as well.  Already, quite a  bit

has been done.  We have lowered the age of subsidy from 6

to  4, recognising the need to address this problem at an

early  age,  so that these children can gain  faster  and

fuller development.  There is also a sum of $200,000  set

aside  to train special teachers, but it would take time.

And  that is the right philosophy.  If we do not have the

teachers, we cannot establish the schools as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, there is also the cost. It costs a lot

more,  $12,000 as opposed to $3,000.  But if we  look  at

other countries like the US and Australia, they, in fact,

have  specialist teachers on a one-to-one basis.  And  we

should  also  aim  to  achieve this  benchmark  as  well.

Because,  in the past, our expectations were  not  there,

but this has changed.  In the past, we might be contented

to  leave  these children at home and allow  siblings  to

look after them.  This is not acceptable any more because

we  feel that these kids too can be developed.  They  too

can  become  self-reliant and contribute  to  society  as

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge that more should be done for special

education.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

thank you for allowing me to speak on this topic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the views of Dr Khor, Mr Gan and I like

what  Mrs Fang Ai Lian has said that perhaps it  is  also

time  to  step back, take a more macro view of the  whole

area  of  special education, as we have done for  the  JC

curriculum, and look at it from all aspects to  see  what

more can be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For today, I would like to raise my concerns where

the teachers are concerned and argue for the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>



Education  to  take them on board as their own  teachers,

rather  than le them be managed by the voluntary  welfare

organisations.   Currently, the  teachers  attend  either

Certificate  in Special Education or Diploma  in  Special

Education courses at the National Institute of Education.

The NIE training processes do come under the jurisdiction

of   the   Ministry  of  Education  through  the  Nanyang

Technological  University.   The  teachers,  as   already

mentioned by Dr Khor, do not get salaries that are apple-for-apple  comparisons with those  in  national  schools.

Teachers  with Second Upper degrees earn about $500  less

than those in MOE national schools.  Those with 'A' level

certificates  earn about $300 less.  While  they  may  be

teaching in smaller classes, the demands placed on  these

teachers are quite high.  And many of these teachers  are

also  burnt out, as has been mentioned, and the attrition

rate is one in five.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2002, 400 teachers with special

education training were teaching 4,200 pupils, in a  1:10

teacher  pupil ratio.  In the year 2000, there  were  476

teachers for 3,800 pupils, on a better ratio of 1:8 .  So

we  do  have a problem here where attrition is concerned,

where   morale  is  concerned,  and  I  found  it  rather

interesting  that  the  special education  teachers  come

under  the Singapore Mercantile and Manual Workers Union.

I  hope  the  union  stands by the aspirations  of  these

teachers  in  the  same way that the  Singapore  Teachers

Union stands by teachers in national schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been mentioned, upgrading for these teachers

is  very much dependent on the funds available with VWOs.

VWOs, as we already know, do have a problem sometimes  in

raising  sufficient funds.   My question to the Ministry,

barring  historical reasons as to why these  teachers  do

not come under the MOE is:  is it possible to review this

and   bring  them  on  board?   After  all,  the  primary

objective is being fulfilled - that they are training our

children   and  the  training  is  based  on  pedagogical

principles  as  directed  by the Ministry  of  Education.

This  means that training programmes, career development,

salaries, upgrading,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>



promotions can all come under one body rather than, right

now,   be  dispersed  over  many  VWOs,  which  may  have

different systems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Braema, wind up your speech,

please.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Currently, the principals

of these schools are not on any policy management studies

programme.   The  teachers  are  not  in  the   teachers'

network, and I think these are great avenues for them  to

share information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min, take your two cuts

together, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, I recognise the

need  for  schools to be upgraded.  Many of our  schools,

designed  and  built in the previous era, cannot  support

the  present  demands.  It is the amount  of  funds  that

schools  have  to raise that worries me.   Among  my  own

small  circle of family and friends, I know of  not  less

than  four schools that are actively raising at least  $3

million  each  through  similar activities  such  as  fun

fairs, concerts and gala dinners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE pays for 95% of the infrastructure upgrading

cost.   If  principals of PRIME schools  were  to  adhere

strictly to the set of standard specifications, they need

to  fork  out only the balance 5%.  But that alone  could

work  out  to  be $800,000, based on the usual  upgrading

cost  of $15 million.  However, nowadays, there are  more

and  more  young and dynamic principals at  the  helm  of

schools.   They have, and we should motivate and  empower

them  to  have, greater expectations of how  an  enriched

learning environment can impact the holistic education of

our  children.   They  require more than  these  standard

features  and  specifications to creatively  nurture  and

develop  the  students under their charge.  For  example,

the  notion that learning is not static gives rise  to  a

desire  to  have  desks and chairs of various  sizes  and

shapes placed in different configurations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>



for  different  activities.  The traditional  classrooms,

with  just  a  teacher's desk, with rows  of  tables  and

chairs and a whiteboard, are not tenable any more.  There

should  be storage cupboards, shelves, notice boards  and

other  "props"  in the classroom.  These  are  deemed  as

extras  and  are not within standard specifications  laid

down by MOE.  When we look further at computer or science

laboratories, the standard items laid down  a  few  years

ago  are not even required or useful any more.  All  non-standard items or space are to be paid for in full by the

schools concerned.



<br>11.30 am



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these difficult economic times, to raise $3-$4

million  takes tremendous efforts and resources,  usually

led  by  the  principal and teachers and involving  their

students and their families.  The teaching staff  has  to

devote  a  disproportionate amount of staff  and  student

resources, energy and time in these fund-raising efforts.

While  there  are  other  sources  of  funding  from  the

Government,  such  as cluster fund and  innovation  fund,

these  are  limited and subject to other rationalisation.

If  sufficient  funds  are not  raised  by  the  schools,

progress  payments cannot be met and the contractors  may

stop  work.   If the upgrading programme is held  up  and

moving  to  the upgraded school is delayed, the students'

benefit and enjoyment of the new facilities will also  be

postponed.  With the deadline to move out of the  holding

school  coming up, there will be an increasing  sense  of

urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be grateful if the Ministry could, firstly,

review,   update   and  exercise  some   flexibility   in

administering  the  standard  specifications  which  were

first  drawn  up some years ago; secondly,  provide  more

funds  for  schools  under  the  PRIME  programme;   and,

thirdly, help to finance the funding shortfall and  allow

the  schools  some  leeway to tide  over  this  difficult

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to my cut on Edusave.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have five school-going children and would like to

ask that the Edusave scheme be extended to cover not just

the first three children.  I understand that the original

reason  for  restricting  Edusave  to  the  first   three

children  is  to discourage those who cannot afford  from

having more children and that parents should not rely  on

the  State to pay for the expenses of bringing  up  their

children.   Much has already been said in the  media  and

Forum  pages  on this issue.  Perhaps it is opportune  to

review this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean counts. With only 40,000 live

births last year, every child is important.  Once a child

is born, we should do our utmost especially in his or her

education  so  that he or she can grow up  to  contribute

meaningfully  to  society.  If we want to  disincentivise

those  who  cannot afford from having more, I believe  we

should  do  this  in other ways and not  to  deprive  the

children  of  funds for enrichment.  If we  want  to  use

monetary disincentives, there are many other ways we  can

do  so,  such  as  not giving dental subsidy  or  student

concession for public transport.  So, why Edusave,  where

the  money  will  be used for the direct benefit  of  the

child by helping him to attend educational and enrichment

courses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister's answer to the above is still "no",

and  the  policy  remains,  may  I  suggest  that  it  is

administratively easier for the school if  every  student

has  an Edusave account.  For those students who are  not

entitled  to  the  Government Edusave  contribution,  the

parents  should  be allowed to voluntarily  top  up  this

account.  As an added incentive to have more children,  I

would  like  to suggest that any contribution  made  into

this account by the parents should qualify for double tax

relief.   After all, one gets double tax relief  for  the

maid  levy  and, surely, Edusave is more important.   The

Edusave account is then treated like a bank account  from

which  the  school  can  deduct  money  to  pay  for  the

enrichment modules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, at the class level, every student is

treated the same way, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>



makes it administratively easier.  Otherwise, there  will

be some students making payments by cash or cheque.  From

my  experience, when my children brought cheques to their

teachers  to  pay  for their modules,  the  teachers  had

thought that they or their parents were mistaken, because

cash  payment  was  not necessary as the  fees  could  be

deducted   from  Edusave.   The  payment   handling   and

administration system in the school may not be geared  up

to  handle cash or cheque, as I am sure children  without

Edusave are far and few between.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to request

that  the  Ministry  consider some flexibility  in  three

areas with regard to the use of the Edusave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area I would like to ask is with regards

to   the   use   of  Edusave  for  standard  school   and

miscellaneous  fees.   Currently, this  is  not  allowed.

Parents  cannot  use  the  Edusave  for  payment  of  the

standard and miscellaneous fees, although for fees  above

the  basic  they are allowed to do so.  My  argument  for

asking that some flexibility be allowed is because of the

current  economic downturn where a lot  of  parents  face

difficulties   in   paying   for   these   standard   and

miscellaneous fees.  We could, in fact, allow parents  to

use  the  Edusave for payment of these basic fees  for  a

very short period.  It may not be for a prolonged period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the rationale why they are not allowed

to  use  the  Edusave for the standard and  miscellaneous

fees.  The rationale is that parents should bear part  of

the  cost of financing the school fees and also there are

other  help  schemes available.  But I  think  a  general

policy  which allows some flexibility in this area during

a  general  economic downturn, which is pretty severe  as

compared to many years that we had in Singapore  of  good

economic growth, would be really helpful to parents.   In

fact,  we have allowed some flexibility in allowing  fees

above the basic to be used.  That is already a compromise

on  the  policy.  So I do not see why we would not  allow

flexibility in terms of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



allowing  basic  fees to be used for a  short  period  of

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second flexibility I would like to ask the

Ministry  is  with regard to the portion  of  the  unused

Edusave   when  a  person  reaches  21  years   of   age.

Currently,   what  happens  is  that   that   amount   is

transferred  to the person's CPF.  I would  like  to  ask

that this amount be transferred to a skill save fund kept

in the CPF.  His own CPF funds to be used for retirement,

medical  and  housing would not be affected.   But  I  am

talking about the Edusave portion.  The intention is  the

same  -  investment in developing human  resources.   So,

transferring from the Edusave to the skills fund  in  CPF

will  be  a  perpetuation of that policy  of  encouraging

lifelong learning as well as encouraging people  to  take

personal  responsibility and ownership for investment  in

their own development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third flexibility I would like to ask is the one

which Mr Ong Kian Min had already argued earlier on,  ie,

to  extend  Edusave use beyond three children.   I  think

sometimes  the  problem is that the Government  tries  to

achieve  too  many  objectives under  one  scheme  -  the

objective of discouraging people who cannot afford not to

have  more  children and the objective  of  investing  in

education.   I would argue that the primary objective  of

Edusave  is  to  invest  in the  education  of  the  next

generation,  so that they are prepared for the  knowledge

economy.   Does it really matter, in this case, that  the

child  is  a  fourth or a fifth child?  As in any  event,

this  child will eventually enter the workforce.  And  if

he is ill-equipped and he does not have the skills or the

qualifications, the Government will have to pay  for  his

retraining and skills upgrading costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even looking at it from a purely economic

perspective, I think it is a rational ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, could you start wrapping

up your speech, please?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I take note of your point.

I  think  they  need the stimulation, and I really  would

like  to  ask  the  Ministry to  consider  revising  this

policy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the role private

institution  plays  in  the education  sector  has  grown

significantly  in  the  last few  years.   While  it  has

brought diversity to the education landscape, there is an

immediate  need  to come up with an accreditation  system

for the various programmes being offered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education landscape has changed

significantly  over the last few years.  Today,  aspiring

students   have   a   diverse  choice   of   professional

certificates, graduate or post-graduate programmes.  This

is  in itself a good thing.  However, my concern is  that

there  are  few checks on the private sector institutions

to ensure that what is taught is actually of good quality

and useful to their students.  The education landscape is

characterised   by   local   companies   that   act    as

representatives   of  foreign  institutions   of   higher

learning.   In  some  cases, I must  say,  these  foreign

entities  are of high standards.  However, this does  not

give the full picture.  Many private institutions act  as

re-sellers with the goal of gaining as many enrolments as

possible.  I have heard that it is now possible to get an

MBA  in  nine months through an accelerated post-graduate

programme.  Enough examples of this cause me to raise the

concern that the quality, content and delivery are highly

suspect.   This, of course, does not speak well  for  the

educational industry as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I, therefore, urge the Minister to give his

Ministry the mandate to benchmark the courses offered  by

the private industry against established institutions  of

higher  learning.   This will ensure  the  reputation  of

Singapore  as a centre for higher learning  and,  at  the

same  time,  prevent students from being shortchanged  by

private institutions driven purely by profit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

for the long term survival



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore, we must learn to live in harmony with  our

neighbours, our other ASEAN countries and also  globally.

We  must  enhance our international links through various

sectors,  including through our educational institutions.

Has the Ministry considered opening up more places in our

schools  and  institutes of higher learning,  and  invite

more  students from Malaysia, Indonesia and  other  ASEAN

countries and from as many countries as possible to study

here?  These foreign students should be encouraged,  upon

completion of their tertiary education, to return home so

that  they  can be our friends and ambassadors,  as  they

will  have a soft spot for Singapore as long as they  had

good  experiences  and  fond memories  whilst  they  were

studying in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Ministry tell us how many foreign students

are  studying  in  primary and secondary schools,  junior

colleges,   polytechnics  and   universities,   and   the

breakdown of students by countries?  And how many of them

leave Singapore and go back to their respective countries

on completion of their studies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how many of our Singaporeans are studying

abroad at the equivalent of "A" and tertiary levels?  And

how  many  of  them  do come back to Singapore  to  work?

Which  countries  do  they go to study  mainly?   Is  the

Ministry  looking into the possibility of  utilising  the

Internet  and  teleconferencing  amongst  junior  college

students  of  Singapore and equivalent  levels  in  other

countries in some subjects for a start, so that there can

be  a  productive  exchange of views  and  comparison  of

educational  standards?   I  believe  this  is,  to  some

extent,  being  done at our university level.   Does  the

Ministry  also encourage exchange programmes between  our

students, especially junior college and tertiary  levels,

with  other  countries, especially our ASEAN  neighbours?

We  could  send  some of our students, especially  during

school and university holidays, on a voluntary basis,  to

neighbouring  ASEAN  educational institutions,  and  vice

versa.   These  programmes could  enhance  our  students'

perception of our standard of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



education  and that of our ASEAN neighbours  and  promote

friendship and care for each other.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on

behalf  of business, as has been shared many times  over.

Children's  education  ranks  very  highly  in  terms  of

concerns  for  all  Singaporeans.   In  fact,  children's

education  is  factored  into  every  family's  decision-making.   Some  families have chosen to go away  to  seek

easier education for their kids.  But more disturbing are

executives  not  taking on opportunities to  go  overseas

because  it  would  disrupt their  children's  education.

Again, there are also executives who choose not to return

because it is, again, about education - how to get  their

kids   back  into  the  system  which  they  have   grown

accustomed  to.  In fact, I have a colleague's  neighbour

who was on his way from the US, and because he was unable

to   get   the   Ministry's  assistance   to   get   into

international  schools, he chose to take another  posting

to  Hong  Kong  for many years until all  his  children's

education was completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we seek to regionalise and globalise, we have got

to  get  rid  of this education obstacle.  A lot  of  MNC

chiefs   have  also  said  that  we  have  got  wonderful

Singaporeans, but the minute they are asked  to  take  an

overseas  posting, they will say "no".  This  is  a  real

waste   of   opportunities,  and  in  terms   of   career

advancement as well.  We do need people to go overseas to

get  their  exposure and to get their valuable experience

and to return to Singapore to contribute.



<br>11.45 am



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, the Ministry of Education, in the past

year,  has  made  quite a number of concessions  to  help

facilitate their return to Singapore and to get  admitted

into  international schools.  Added to that is the second

language  problem  and all this makes  it  difficult  for

parents  to  consider a posting and return to  Singapore.

The  Ministry's  assurance is on  a  case-by-case  basis.

This lacks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



certainty  and, therefore, is a major obstacle which  has

to   be   overcome.    So  if  you  are   serious   about

regionalisation,  entrepreneurship and globalisation,  we

have  got to be serious about getting rid of this problem

too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> On exporting education, it is

known  to  all  that the Singapore education  system  has

become  a  brandname, one with real social  and  economic

value.   Its  reputation  precedes  itself  and   it   is

precious.   Currently, the education industry contributes

about  $3 billion to our economy, which is about 1.9%  of

our GDP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, we have been providing lots of

training and technical assistance to our ASEAN neighbours

and  other  third  world countries.  We  have  built  our

expertise  and  gained valuable experience.   Hence,  the

respect  that  we now enjoy in the area of education  and

training  is  well earned.  However, this reputation  has

yet  to be fully exploited.  The time has come for us  to

reap  the  benefits  of our hard work  by  exporting  our

education  as  a  business.  It can  be  our  new  niche.

Education  service is big business.  Public education  is

focused  on  providing  education  for  Singaporeans  and

meeting our manpower and capability requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, I strongly suggest that we

systematically address the opportunities provided by  the

Singapore  brand of education, and not just leave  it  at

that.   Additionally,  we must  also  set  up  a  quality

assurance  system for the private education  industry  to

ensure  that our brand, which is the Singapore  brand  of

education,  does not get tarnished.  It is  precious  and

must be preserved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, a few Members, Mr Gan Kim

Yong, Mdm Halimah and Mr Zainudin, have rightly commented

on the importance of the pre-school education sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically two thrusts in MOE's approach to

uplift the quality of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



pre-school  education.  First, we have developed  a  pre-school   curriculum  framework,  emphasising  a  holistic

approach to development and enhanced interaction  between

teacher  and  pupil.   The curriculum  framework  is  not

prescriptive in detail, and MOE does not intend  to  make

it   a   formal   requirement  for   all   kindergartens.

Kindergartens are, instead, encouraged to  use  it  as  a

guide   to   design  their  programmes.   This   approach

encourages   diversity   and  experimentation   as   each

kindergarten operator strives to shape practices to  meet

the needs of its pupils, and to make a mark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic idea of the new curriculum framework is to

develop and nurture the child in totality, including  his

ability  to  relate  to  others, to  communicate  and  to

develop  an  enthusiasm  for learning.   I  am  glad  Mdm

Halimah mentioned parents, and I agree with her fully  on

the  need  to  reach  out to them.  Kindergartens  should

engage with parents and give them the confidence that the

changes  they  are  making are in the   interest  of  the

child.   MOE  will  help  where it  can.   Mdm  Halimah's

suggestion  is a useful one, for wider publicity  of  the

views  and comments of parents who have found that  their

children are keen to learn and have benefited as a result

of the new approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are not wrong to be concerned about their

children's  future performance in primary school  and  to

expect  that  pre-schools provide a good  foundation  for

their  children's schooling.  Basic academic skills  like

reading, writing and numerical or mathematical skills are

important  in the pre-school years.  They should  not  be

overlooked.    But   we  want  to  avoid   premature   or

accelerated learning of the Primary 1 syllabus.  It  does

not translate, by and large, into the children being able

to learn better when they get to the upper primary years,

let  alone  the  secondary school years.   More  emphasis

should  be placed on development of broader communication

skills,  such as the ability to ask questions,  to  begin

thinking  for  themselves, to explore,  or  to  sort  out

puzzles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving towards a more interactive and child-centred pre-school environment with more room for

children to explore and experiment.  But we should  never

be purists in our approach to pre-school education.  Good

kindergarten  teachers adopt more than  one  orientation,

more than one method, and they mix and match as they  see

fit  to  meet the needs of their pupils.  Not all  drills

are  bad.   After all, most kids learn songs and  nursery

rhymes  that way, although we sometimes find our children

singing away lustily but mispronouncing the words!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust is to uplift the quality of the

teaching  force  in  the  pre-school  sector.   MOE   has

articulated standards of professional qualifications  for

all major providers of pre-school education to meet.   To

answer Mr Gan Kim Yong's question, good progress has been

made  in the number of teachers going for training.   All

the  major kindergarten providers should be able to  meet

the  target  of  having  all their teachers  certificate-trained,  and  one  in  four of their  teachers  diploma-trained.    In  2002, 43% of kindergarten  teachers  were

trained  staff.   By  the  end  of  this  year,  74%   of

kindergarten teachers would have been trained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan, Mdm Halimah and Mr Zainudin have asked about

financial  assistance for families, besides the recurrent

grants  for  kindergartens.  Let  me  first  clarify  the

purpose  of  the  recurrent grant scheme.   MOE  provides

recurrent    grants    to   help   eligible    non-profit

kindergartens  to  attract and  retain  better  qualified

principals  and  teachers  in  order  to  meet  the   new

standards.  The grants can also be used to provide better

support  for  teachers,  in terms of  administrative  and

teaching  resources.  In short, the grants are  aimed  at

helping  eligible  kindergartens to  raise  quality.   In

answer  to Mr Zainudin, we expect to maintain the  grants

at  this level, but any future adjustments would have  to

depend on the availability of resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial assistance for families is a separate

matter from these grants to kindergartens.  To assist low

income fami-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



lies  who  send  their  children  to  kindergartens  that

provide programmes that meet the quality guidelines,  the

Government will provide financial assistance of $600  per

annum  per child to lower income families who are sending

their  children  to  qualifying non-profit  kindergartens

from 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked about the Kindergarten Education

Bill.  MOE is currently reviewing the legislation for the

pre-school sector.  The Kindergarten Education Bill  will

be introduced in Parliament within a few months.  It will

set  out  the  licensing  framework  and  emphasises  the

importance  of  having  qualified teachers  and  a  sound

curriculum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min raised the issue of funding for the

upgrading of infrastructure in Government aided  schools.

To-date, the Government has spent about $1 billion on the

PRIME  programme  to upgrade 146 schools  to  the  latest

specifications.  Under PRIME, the Government  funds  100%

and  95%  of the development cost of upgrading Government

schools  and  aided schools, respectively, based  on  the

cost  of standard facilities.  The Government's share  of

the  development  cost of Government  aided  schools  has

increased significantly over the years, from 50% in  1982

to 95% today.  The Government also pays for 100% of their

recurrent  cost.   It is necessary for  Government  aided

schools to continue to raise funds to pay for part of the

cost of development of the schools.  This is to show that

the Government aided schools are committed to the project

and  that  they  enjoy  the support of  their  respective

communities.  If the Government were to pay for  100%  of

both  the  capital and recurrent costs of  such  schools,

they  would  really be no different from  any  Government

school.   Aided schools which find it difficult to  raise

funds may wish to review and reprioritise their plans for

non-standard facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min and Mdm Halimah asked the Ministry

to   reconsider  the  existing  restriction  of   Edusave

accounts to the first three children.  Families  need  to

take  into careful account the affordability and expenses

when deciding to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



have more than three children.  The allocation of Edusave

accounts to the first three children remains sensible and

is a workable approach.  However, I do not want to appear

blind  to  the  feelings  of Mr Ong's  fourth  and  fifth

children.   In  fact,  my own fourth  child  has  already

communicated  her views to me.   So we  are  prepared  to

consider  suggestions as to how we can better handle  and

manage  feelings of children, in particular those in  the

higher order birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should emphasise, however, that the Edusave

account is only one way in which Singapore pupils benefit

from  the Edusave scheme.  Each year, about half  of  the

expenditure  on the Edusave Endowment Fund  goes  to  the

Edusave accounts; one quarter to Edusave scholarships and

awards, and another one quarter to the Edusave grants  to

schools.  The Edusave scholarships and awards and Edusave

grants  to  schools  are  available  to  all  Singaporean

children, regardless of their birth order.  In 2002,  $37

million  was disbursed to 141,400 pupils in the  form  of

scholarships  and awards.  And another  $35  million  was

disbursed to schools in the form of Edusave grants to run

enrichment programmes for all their pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked MOE to allow greater

flexibility  in  the  use of funds in  Edusave  accounts.

Currently, pupils can already use Edusave funds  for  the

second   tier   miscellaneous  fees.    Families   facing

difficulties in paying fees can approach the  school  for

financial  assistance.  Various forms of  assistance  are

available through the MOE financial assistance schemes or

other  sources,  such  as  financial  assistance  schemes

administered   by  the  School  Advisory  or   Management

Committees, and community organisations, such as the CDCs

and  voluntary welfare organisations.  No child  will  be

denied  an  education because of financial  difficulties.

Further, when the Edusave account holders reach 21  years

of  age, any unutilised balance is transferred to the CPF

Ordinary  Accounts and can be used for all  CPF  approved

schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked how we are building links

with  students from the ASEAN countries.  There are  many

students from ASEAN countries studying in our schools and

institutions.   In  addition,  schools  and  institutions

participate   in  student  exchanges  with  other   ASEAN

countries.  Between 2001 and 2002, close to 800  students

from  Singapore participated in exchanges and  attachment

programmes  with  post-secondary  institutions  in  ASEAN

countries.   Our students have also actively participated

in  community involvement programmes in ASEAN  countries,

such  as Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand  and

Vietnam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian has suggested that we allow local

students  who  have  returned  from  overseas  to  attend

foreign system schools in Singapore.  As far as possible,

we  believe  that  all Singaporeans  should  be  educated

together  in  national schools.  That way,  they  can  be

imbued  with  a  common sense of identity and  a  certain

commitment to each other that comes from having grown up,

played  and studied together.  It is difficult to  expect

the same spirit of Singaporean-ness to be inculcated in a

foreign  system  school which will  have  a  majority  of

foreign  students  and follow a foreign  curriculum.   It

does not work that way in practice.  This is also why  we

decided that the opening up of the national school system

to  two  to  three  privately  funded  schools  would  be

conditional  upon such schools having a  minimum  of  50%

Singaporeans in the student population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MOE does recognise the broad economic

imperative    of   encouraging   Singapore    firms    to

internationalise and Singaporeans to venture  abroad  and

gain experience.  We have implemented a range of measures

to  meet  the  educational needs of Singaporean  children

returning from overseas.  Parents can apply for leave  of

absence  at their children's current school to reserve  a

place until the child returns to Singapore.  We have also

provided  boarding  awards  to  allow  secondary   school

children  to  stay  in local school-based  hostels  while

their parents were overseas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate that some children who have studied

abroad  for  a  significant period  of  time  could  face

difficulties  in  adapting  and  fitting  back   to   the

education  system.  MOE is prepared to  be  flexible  and

would consider requests for admission into foreign system

schools for such children on a case-by-case basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin had asked how Singapore's education

system   brand  could  be  used  to  economic  advantage.

Education  is  also  one  of the  areas  of  high  growth

potential identified by the ERC.  IE Singapore has  taken

on  the  role  of  helping our local education  providers

export  their  services overseas.  However,  the  primary

focus  of  the Ministry of Education must remain  in  the

education of students in our national schools.  Where our

institutes   of  higher  learning,  or  our   independent

schools,  have developed the capability to  export  their

services,  they  can do so, as long as they  continue  to

provide  high quality education in Singapore and  do  not

divert   Government   resources  meant   for   delivering

education in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong asked about the registration of

private  schools  in Singapore.  I share  his  view  that

disreputable education providers will not help us develop

Singapore  as  an education hub.  However,  MOE  and  the

Government are not in a position to review the quality of

such  programmes.   Private education providers  offer  a

diverse   range   of   education  programmes,   including

academic,  continuing  and  adult  education  and   self-improvement programmes, and often in partnership  with  a

wide  array of overseas partners.  The market is the best

regulator  of  such providers.  The range  of  programmes

caters  to a diversity of needs as students and employers

will  ultimately decide on what value they place on their

programmes  and qualifications.  However,  there  may  be

some  scope for some form of industry self-regulation  so

as  to  enhance  the branding and image  of  the  private

education  industry.  I believe IE Singapore is currently

helping to facilitate discussions among leading education

suppliers in Singapore on matters relating to issues such

as quality certification and control within the industry.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Sir, let me address Members' concerns about arts and

special education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, arts education. Mr Zainudin has asked what

MOE's level of support and commitment to this is.  He and

other  Members  will  be  happy to  know  that  the  arts

education  environment promises to be more vibrant  as  a

result  of a number of recent initiatives.  Firstly,  for

NAFA  and  LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts, MOE  provides

these two arts institutions with per capita funding  that

is  equivalent to the per student subsidies  received  by

polytechnics and ITE.  MOE will also be providing funding

of about $180 million for the development and land needed

for  their new permanent campuses, which should be  ready

by  2004  and 2006 respectively.  Every time I  pass  the

Central District, I get a sense of excitement.  With  the

new SMU, NAFA and LaSalle-SIA College campuses coming  up

and  the  Arts Museum, I think the area will add vibrancy

and a glowing buzz to the arts education milieu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with the recommendation for NTU to have a

school  of  design, media and art will  allow  interested

students a relevant route to the university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Zainudin has asked about teachers. MOE

has  recently  launched a 4-year Art  and  Music  Teacher

Training  Scheme,  together  with  NIE  and  the  Nanyang

Academy  of  Fine Arts.  This scheme will supplement  our

existing  recruitment avenues for  these  teachers.   The

structural  and manpower provisions will strengthen  arts

education  in Singapore.  Arts education is provided  for

all  students  in  our schools, through the  general  art

programme and the general music programme.  Students  can

also opt to offer art at "O" and "A" levels, and music at

the  "O"  and  "A"  levels as elective  subjects.   These

measures  will  complement  the  12-cluster  art  centres

serving  97 schools, and one centre for Chinese orchestra

music serving east



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



zone  schools.  We plan to add 10 more such  cluster  art

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the queries by various Members on

special  education.  I hear clearly and empathise greatly

with  the  calls from Dr Amy Khor, Mr Gan Kim  Yong,  Mrs

Fang  Ai  Lian and Ms Braema Mathiaparanam for compassion

and for us to do more for these children.  As part of  my

duties,  I  have  to attend many functions  as  guest-of-honour hosted by these VWOs working in concert with other

agencies  to  take  care  of our disabled  children.   If

Members  have  attended any of these  functions,  Members

will  agree with me that the passion is palpable,  often-times heart-wrenching.  Your spirits are both lifted  and

saddened;  lifted because of the individual  stories  and

the  bravery they showed to take care of their  children,

and  sometimes  saddened because of the  inequalities  of

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, through these functions, I have become more and

more convinced that the many-helping-hands approach - the

philosophical  stance, if you like - that  MOE  takes  in

providing  assistance to these VWOs is the  correct  one,

because  it  engages  the  community  and  unleashes  the

passion  without which we would have made  our  provision

less  than  effective.  This many-helping-hands  approach

that  we  adopted  since 1989 was in response  to  a  key

recommendation of the Advisory Council of  the  Disabled,

which  involves  the  Government, family  and  community.

However,  the many-helping-hands approach must  not  mean

less subsidy or support from MOE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian and Mr Gan Kim Yong have both asked

for more to be done in the area of special education.  We

will  try  our  best.  MOE, together  with  the  National

Council  of Social Services, has increased the number  of

SPED schools run by VWOs from 11 to 19.  Today, these  19

SPED  schools  provide education for about 4,004  pupils,

double   the   figure  in  1989.   MOE  has   started   a

redevelopment  programme  to improve  the  facilities  of

these schools.  Once redeveloped, these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



schools  will be purpose-built with facilities customised

to  their specific needs.  Within the last four years, we

have  completed  the redevelopment of four  of  these  19

schools.   MOE provides capital funding for  90%  of  the

construction cost for this redevelopment programme at  an

estimated cost of about $100 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members said that there was a queue for these

schools.   That is not quite correct.  There is  actually

no  queue  for any child with special disability,  except

for  autism.   For autism, it is a world-wide phenomenon.

From the medical point of view, we are not sure why there

has  been a sudden rise.  Mrs Fang Ai Lian alluded to it.

Perhaps it is more recognition.  Other theories have been

ascribed.  We do not really know why.  There has  been  a

sudden  ramp  up  and, as Mr Gan said, we  should  expand

capacity  for this particular group of children,  and  we

have  been trying.  As a result of recent efforts by NCSS

and  MOE, the number of SPED schools providing programmes

for  autism has increased from a previous two to 11.   In

addition, as Mrs Fang Ai Lian alluded to, we have set  up

a special fund, together with the Autism Resource Centre,

to  develop  teacher capability in the  SPED  schools  to

manage  children with autism.  It is not that  we  cannot

build the buildings; the buildings are there, but we need

teachers.   As  more teachers are trained, an  additional

400  children with autism would be catered  for  in  SPED

schools by 2006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan said that the cost of education for children

with  special needs is very high.  We recognise this and,

therefore, SPED schools receive more funding per  student

from MOE and NCSS.  Mrs Fang said indeed quite correctly,

that they receive four times the subsidy of a pupil in  a

mainstream  primary school.  In other words, we  use  the

child without disabilities in the mainstream school as  a

benchmark, and then we provide four times as much.   That

works  out,  as  she said, to $12,000 versus  $3,000  per

year.  Eligible pupils who attend these SPED schools also

receive a yearly Edusave contribution of $160, like their

counterparts in the primary schools, and receive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



as well an annual Edusave grant for enrichment programmes

and purchase of equipment and resource materials.  As for

the  fees  charged, they are subject to the  approval  of

NCSS,  and the NCSS and the VWOs also oversee the welfare

assistance for needy pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members, including Mr Gan Kim Yong, Ms

Braema Mathiaparanam and Dr Amy Khor, have touched on the

teachers  in  these  schools.  They have  asked  why  not

subsume  these  teachers under MOE.  First  of  all,  the

provision of care, while to a great degree is provided by

our teachers, is not the only avenue of care.  There need

to  be  a number of elements which will provide for these

children.    There   is  a  balance   between   subsuming

responsibility and decreasing stakeholdership.  As I have

said,  the  many-helping-hands approach that engages  and

says to the community, "This is a problem that we have to

collectively  address and, therefore,  we  will  have  to

signal  to  each  other the level  of  commitment"  is  a

correct one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, teachers in the SPED schools are provided

training at the NIE.  As of February 2003, 73% or 410  of

these teachers have received training, while another  23%

or  131  are  either  currently undergoing  or  would  be

starting  their  training in the NIE  soon.   Every  SPED

school is also provided with funds for staff development.

This  amounts to about $1,080 per professional staff  per

year.   They also have access to MOE programmes, when  we

run  them, to facilitate courses and workshops  for  SPED

school teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have expressed that there is a lack of

career path and that we should facilitate secondment from

MOE.   Yes,  teachers from the MOE do undergo  secondment

and,  if  teachers want to teach in the SPED schools,  we

will facilitate it on a case-by-case basis.  The lack  of

career path is due to a number of reasons.  Many of these

VWOs work as separate entities.  There is nothing to stop

them  from coming together to derive economies of  scale,

and  we will encourage them.  But this is something  that

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



would  have  to do.  To take it over would also  decrease

the  level  of stakeholdership from these VWOs, something

which we should not do, because it is to our detriment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked about the assimilation of children

from SPED schools back into the mainstream.  I thank  her

for  acknowledging that some of these efforts have  borne

fruit.   Children with learning or physical  disabilities

who  are  able  to  follow the mainstream  curricula  are

provided  places  in  mainstream schools.   That  is  our

principle.  Some mainstream schools, she rightly  pointed

out,  already have full facilities to enable  access  for

pupils  with physical disabilities.  MOE targets to  have

at  least one such school per geographical cluster of 8-9

schools.   Currently,  there are  51  mainstream  schools

equipped  with handicapped-friendly facilities.   As  for

pupils  with hearing or visual impairment, there are  six

designated  schools  where such  pupils  have  access  to

additional resource teacher and assistive devices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor recounted to this House the case of a

hearing-impaired   child   who   could   not   hear   the

instructions  and  who  was  subsequently  penalised.   I

believe her, and I can well imagine that these things can

happen.  But I would think that the teachers do not do it

because  they  are  trying to victimise  the  child,  but

because  they probably did not understand.  I agree  with

her that a certain standard operating procedure should be

adopted.   If  Members  know of  individual  cases,  they

should  relay  them to MOE, and we will  explain  to  the

staff of the relevant schools what the problem is, and  I

am sure they will take remedial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children with disabilities who do not attend

mainstream schools are better served in SPED schools with

specially   trained  teachers  supported  by  paramedical

personnel.  At these specialised schools, these  children

can  learn  at  their own pace through a  curriculum  and

environment specially tailored to their needs.  In  fact,

those  who are able to - even though they study in  these

SPED schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



-  have  an  opportunity to prepare for the PSLE  and  to

continue their education in mainstream secondary schools.

In  2002,  39 pupils from SPED schools sat for  the  PSLE

and, of these, 90% were placed in secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang alluded to the fact that these children can

also  be independent in employment and, indeed, we should

strive to.  Through the SPED schools, those who are  able

to  pick  up  functional literacy and numeracy,  and  the

Vocational  School for the Handicapped  provides  further

training to children with hearing impairment and children

with  mild intellectual disability.  ITE also takes in  a

number  of special needs students who are able to  follow

the  curriculum  and  function in a workshop  environment

without undue risks to themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Gan that the parents need support,

and  parental involvement is important.  The SPED schools

have put in place such programmes.  MOE will continue  to

work  closely with NCSS and the VWOs on the education  of

children  with special needs.  There can never be  enough

done for these children, but we should continually strive

and do so.  To sustain this tripartite partnership, there

must  be  active involvement and support of the community

and  parents.   There must be a passion and participation

from  the  community, coupled with  a  strong  spirit  of

giving and volunteerism among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, last year, I told the story of

the  yellow  wolf and the golden monkey, and many  people

were  asking  me  what is happening to this  yellow  wolf

which  cannot speak its own language.  Now I am going  to

go  on  to chapter two of this story of the golden monkey

and the yellow wolf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This yellow wolf, which has forgotten how to speak

the  wolf language, had a change of fortune.  His ability

to  speak the monkey language and to communicate with the

monkeys brought him a lot of benefits. Consequently, more

and  more  yellow  wolves began to learn  and  speak  the

monkey  language.  For survival sake, they could  not  be

faulted for wanting to master another language.  However,

the   situation  became  more  and  more  serious.   Some

children and grandchildren of the yellow wolf forgot that

they   were  wolves.   They  could  not  speak  the  wolf

language,  and  some  even despised  the  wolf  language.

Regrettably, some of these yellow wolves began  to  treat

the  monkey  language as their own mother  tongue.   They

were  asked to learn the wolf language merely to  appease

the  other yellow wolves.  What hurts most is that  those

in  the pack of yellow wolves who were oblivious of their

origin  were asking that the monkey language be  used  to

help in the teaching of their own language to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declining standard of Chinese in Singapore is a

fact  beyond  denial.   Yet, the  Ministry  of  Education

chooses not to look at the matter squarely. In fact, what

it  has  been  doing is to keep lowering the requirement.

Mother  tongue has been downgraded to that  of  a  second

language,  and then the lower standard syllabus  'B'  was

introduced  just to help them pass the minimum  standard.

Now  it  is  even  resorting to using  English  to  teach

Chinese.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a case of a westerner who has never been

exposed to Chinese and who wants to learn just to  say  a

few simple sentences in Chinese, I will not fault him for

doing so. Even in the case of a young child who has  just

returned  to  Singapore, after living overseas  for  many

years where Chinese is never in use, helping him to learn

Chinese with the use of English is acceptable to  me.   I

will support it. However, in Singapore, whether it is  in

the  schools  or  in  public places, the environment  and

opportunities   for   speaking   Mandarin   are   readily

available. So using the lack of a Chinese-speaking family

environment  as an excuse and it degenerates  to  such  a

stage  that  English has to be used to teach  Chinese,  I

think it is absolutely groundless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a will, there is a way. If you want

to  speak  Mandarin in Singapore, there are opportunities

aplenty here.  A doctor friend of mine, both husband  and

wife  were English-educated, sent their children  to  the

neighbourhood  kindergarten in order that their  children

have more opportunities to speak Mandarin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, we ban the airing of dialect programmes for

fear  that  the use of dialects may affect the  promotion

and  learning  of  Mandarin.  So would  not  the  use  of

English to teach Chinese create similar confusion to  the

students?  I have another story to tell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gorgeously-dressed young lady went into a lift and

smilingly,  the young man who was inside the  lift,  said

"gou  yindang".  On hearing it, the young lady  was  very

angry.  She protested, "Why are you accusing me of  being

luscious?",  and  gave the young man a big  slap  on  his

face. The young man was shocked. "Why did you hit me when

I  asked you: Going down?"  The young lady thought he was

being  cheeky  and  saying that  she  was  "gou  yindang"

(meaning "very lascivious").  You see, Sir, when  English

is confusingly mixed with Chinese, it can cause trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if we can give concessions to students in

English-speaking families by using English to teach them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



Chinese,  will MOE use the respective mother  tongues  to

teach  English to students coming from the Chinese, Malay

and Tamil-speaking families?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that MOE will reconsider its

decision of using English to teach Chinese.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, before I answer Dr Ong's question, I would like to

thank  Dr  Wang and other Members of this House  for  all

their useful contributions to the Education budget debate

this  year.   I think we have had a very interesting  and

constructive debate and I hope to continue engaging  them

throughout the rest of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, I addressed the issue of mother

tongue  and  the dilemmas that parents in Singapore,  the

society at large and our schools face in trying to follow

our  policy  of  bilingualism - English  and  the  mother

tongue  -  to  as high a level as possible  for  all  our

students.  Therefore, MOE has had to respond to  try  and

achieve this objective in the best way possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piloting of the bilingualism approach in

teaching  Chinese  is part of our continuing  efforts  to

address  the problems that some students have in learning

Chinese in school. This is a reality.  I do not think  we

can  will  it  away or pretend that it  does  not  exist.

There  are  students who have difficulties  learning  the

language  and  it is best for us to try and address  this

problem  than to push it aside and pretend that  it  does

not exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who come from non-Chinese speaking home

backgrounds  have  poorer home support for  the  language

than   those  who  speak  Chinese  at  home.  Those  with

exceptional difficulties learning the language  are  like

saplings, young trees, which have shallow roots. They  do

need  additional  support if they are to  have  a  better

chance  to  grow.  And you can see this in Singapore.  We

build  a  frame around it, or we put a stick and tie  the

sapling  there,  and we encourage it to  grow.   If  not,

these saplings may never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



grow.   But, with support, these saplings may  well  grow

into big, tall trees one of these days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to see if the use of English at

appropriate   occasions  provides  that  extra   support.

Otherwise,  some of these young children  may  well  lose

heart and develop the kind of attitude that Dr Ong speaks

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pilot programme, students are allowed to

use  some English to help express themselves more clearly

when  asking and answering questions, while teachers  use

English  to  help students to understand the text  better

and faster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is still the main medium of instruction in

these  classes.  Examination standards remain  unchanged.

The   interim  findings  of  the  pilot  have  been  very

encouraging.  The Ministry has received positive feedback

from  the  teachers involved in the programme that  their

students  are more confident in the learning  of  Chinese

and  have  better  rapport with  them.  The  Ministry  of

Education will be conducting a more comprehensive  review

at  the  end of this year when the pilot has run for  two

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong himself said that if there is a will, there

is  a  way. So, we should keep an open mind about how  we

teach  the  Chinese language and be willing to experiment

and  find out what works best for our children - they are

not  all  the same.  Different methods may be  suited  to

different  groups  of pupils.  And by catering  to  these

varying  needs,  we  give the Chinese language  the  best

chance of flourishing in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his

reply.   May  I  seek a clarification from the  Minister?

May  I  ask  the  Minister to assure us  that  using  the

bilingual approach to teach Chinese will not result in  a

further lowering of the standard of Chinese?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a clarification. That is

asking an assurance from the Minister.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, as I said, the bilingual

policy  of the Government remains the same and unchanged.

What we are doing is trying to find the best possible way

in  order  to  achieve the highest possible  standard  of

mother tongue in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept of cultural capital is a sound one.

As  MITA's  vision is to develop a creative and connected

Singapore,  it  should step up its marketing  efforts  to

sell  the  idea of cultural capital to Singaporeans.   In

this  way, we can ensure a collective national effort  to

develop   Singapore   into  a  creative   and   connected

international   city.   And  more   and   more   ordinary

Singaporeans  now realise that the creative industry  has

the  potential  to become a key propeller of  Singapore's

creative economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During these hard times, it is heartening to note

that  jobs  are  created for both young and  old  in  the

creative   industry.   And  with  the  opening   of   the

Esplanade,  we see cheerful young men and women,  working

as ushers and at the restaurants. With the opening of the

Asian  Civilisation  Museum and the exhibitions  held  at

other  museums and heritage centres, we are  also  seeing

jobs being created for the older fellow citizens too.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rise of a creative economy, may I ask what

plans  are  in the pipeline to capitalise on  Singapore's

cultural scene for the arts to bloom and create jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, a vibrant,

creative   arts  environment  is  integral  to  realising

Singapore's dream to be the premier Asian cultural hub.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already invested $1 billion in

building  a  world-class arts and culture infrastructure.

Our investments are paying off.  The creative arts sector

had value-added of almost $5 billion in 2002 or about  3%

of GDP. We seem to be on the right track for success. For

instance,  the  creative  cluster  employs  about  72,000

employees  in Singapore, representing about 3.5%  of  the

workforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, an estimated 1,500 new creative arts

cluster graduates who are trained in the performance arts

and  related management services will be available to the

creative  cluster.  Granted, some may end up in  jobs  or

even  careers that may have little or nothing to do  with

their training.  There would be those who will be looking

towards  being  employed in their disciplines.   Sir,  we

have a feeder of people who are trained in specific areas

to support the arts cluster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we invest and increase in our cultural

capital,  I  wonder  if there are enough  jobs  for  such

graduates upon completion of their arts courses. Perhaps,

some  scrutiny  may  be timely, to  see  if  courses  are

turning out too many for too few jobs.  Perhaps, an inter-ministry  unit  can  be  set  up  between  MITA  and  the

institutions  to  oversee this.  The  unit  can  look  at

specific clusters that will require certain talents, work

with  institutions to design courses,  have  an  industry

player  to sit in the unit to advise on such courses,  to

ensure that they are relevant and updated. This will also

give  a  heads-up as to the employment of such people  in

the respective areas of the arts cluster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit can also arrange for our graduates or

undergraduates to be attached to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



work with the production crew of world-class performances

that we are now able to attract to our stages.  Then, our

own  creative  cultural capital, in  the  form  of  these

graduates,  can  learn  from the  best  sound  and  stage

managers,   special  effects  directors,  set  designers,

lighting  managers  as well as performers.   I  urge  the

Minister  to consider these suggestions as this will  not

only increase the skills and exposure of our arts cluster

students  but  also create employment opportunities  when

they  complete their courses.  I believe that  the  value

added  to  this  human  capital will  truly  enhance  the

cultural capital that we are creating that will, in time,

make Singapore the premier cultural hub, not only in  the

region but in the world.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, competition from

other countries in the traditional economic activities is

increasing.   As  our  economy is rapidly  changing,  the

services  sector  looks  set  to  grow  to  become   more

important.  If you look at Venice, Paris, London and  New

York, we see many visitors who come to enjoy the cultural

and  arts resources and activities. Such tourists are  an

important  economic sector of these cities.  I  therefore

join  my  GPC Chairman, Mr Seng Han Thong, and my  fellow

GPC  member, Mr Arthur Fong, in asking the Government  to

pay more attention to the growth of this cultural sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should also develop our human capital and

culture and the arts.  Like in those cities, culture  and

arts  tourists can be an important economic  sector.   To

grow  this  sector, we have to develop our  hardware  and

software  in the culture and the arts.  Our hardware  are

the  Esplanade, our museums, Chinatown, Little India  and

our   libraries.  Our  software  are  our  artists,   our

performers, our people who manage our hardware and  their

skills and know-how. We have to develop and nurture them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important component that we need to have are

the customers, people who enjoy arts and the culture.  In

any  country, culture and the arts need a core  of  local

supporters to sustain and to grow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



them.   When  the  sector  becomes  established,  foreign

visitors  will  come  and enjoy our shows,  museums,  art

galleries  and  libraries.  Our culture and  arts  sector

will  then  grow.  We thus need to nurture and  grow  all

three components.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister revealed the intention of

the  Ministry to develop the culture and arts sector.   I

would thus like to ask the Minister for an update of  our

efforts  to develop our cultural capital and the  culture

and  arts  sector into an important economic  sector,  in

respect  of  the  three  components  that  I  have   just

outlined.   What  are some of the future plans  that  the

Ministry has to develop this sector?



<br>12.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, for the

creative industry, MITA has a desired outcome to  have  a

vibrant and self-sustaining creative cluster, and  it  is

basically  the  fusion  of arts,  culture,  business  and

technology.  I must say that it is a tall order,  and  it

is  a  tremendous challenge for MITA to accomplish  this.

If   they  are  successful,  they  will  increase   their

contribution  to our GDP and result in job  creation  and

wealth to the country.  But, Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister what other conditions and an environment that we

can create in Singapore to facilitate this success in the

story  of  a  creative industry.  In a very stress-driven

society,  creativity can be a result of our  backs  being

against  the  wall.   But there must  be  conditions  and

environment  where you need the calm, the reflection  and

meditation, for people to explore ideas.  I would like to

ask   whether  enough  conditions  and  environment   are

provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent is a very severe constraint. We are

successful in setting up schools for the arts, design and

media  right up to the university level.  Are there plans

to  move  such schools from the Ministry of Education  to

MITA?   Is  there  a  business case for  a  very  special

purpose  school  under  MITA?  How  do  we  overcome  the

constraints of manpower and time?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, in view of

the  time  constraint  and that  this  speech  originally

comprises  two cuts, please allow me to ask a  series  of

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will give you another 50%.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Thank you very much. I appreciate

that.    Sir,   the  creative  industry  is   universally

acknowledged  as  an engine of growth in  knowledge-based

economies.   In  the UK, the annual value output  of  the

creative industry reaches 50 billion, and is 16%  of  its

GDP.   In  New  England, four out of  every  10  creative

workers are self-employed, and in Portland, the mean wage

for  the  creative services cluster in 1999 is about  60%

above the regional average.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, and Singapore's need to

create  high-value add goods and services, the  arts  and

creative scene is now thrust into the limelight.  Art  is

no  longer  for  art's sake, but that  there  is  a  real

economy  within.  We also call it cultural capital.   The

creative  industry  is  now prized  as  a  propellant  of

growth.   However, what price creativity?  Does  it  mean

that now all artists should learn to produce commercially

viable  goods and learn to market their products,  rather

than   deepen  their  experience  in  the  arts  so  that

creativity can come from experiments and expressions from

within,  or  is there still room for art for art's  sake?

If  so,  how can we help the creative cluster to overcome

funding,  housing and exposure issues so that  they  will

not  look  like  the 1960s' image of a poor tuberculosis-stricken Chinese calligrapher who coughs blood and dies a

pauper, or the pathetic blind, black sunglass erhu player

who  is  accompanied by his young but, equally, pathetic-looking songstress singing the famous tune of "lok kai mo

chin mai meen pow"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, how does the Minister intend to strike a

balance   between  the  need  to  commercialise  artistic

productions    vis-a-vis   the    need    to    encourage

experimentations and expressions of art for  art's  sake?

What are the specific plans to translate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



art  and culture, which are raw materials and undoubtedly

the  cradle  of  creativity  into  successful  commercial

products  or services, without compromising the  artistic

spirit and culture?  Both UK and New England have a  deep

history  in arts appreciation, which has become part  and

parcel  of  the  society's psyche.   It  is,  hence,  not

surprising  to  see  a  high rate of entrepreneurship  in

their  creative industry.  The situation  is  reverse  in

Singapore,  as years of academic numbers have overwhelmed

the  development of the creative cradle.   What  are  the

specific  plans to accelerate the growth of the  creative

sector given the lack of depth in arts appreciation here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the issue on vision. Does the

Minister have a specific vision of a cultural capital  in

Singapore?   If so, does it look more like  that  of  the

London of the East, as Minister BG George Yeo has said in

the  case  of MTI, or is it the Switzerland of the  East,

where  artistic talents are evident in the production  of

almost  all  goods,  from the famous  watch  industry  to

musical boxes to church organs?  What are the steps  that

are taken to bring us closer to our vision, and are there

any measurable indicators?  Singapore has a rich cultural

heritage,  one  that  blends  the  East  and  West.    We

inherited the British legacy and are exposed to  American

cultural  imperialism, yet we are very  Asian  at  heart.

With   an   open-door  policy,  cultures  of  the   world

congregate  here  to give us a unique  blend  and  unique

cultural  experience and exposure.  How can we take  full

advantage  of this blend to create and put a  premium  on

our goods and services?  A good example would be that  of

Angsana Spa Resort in Australia, Queensland.  It cleverly

blends  the  refined eastern traditional decor  with  the

Australian outback to make it one of the best resorts  in

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artistic talents are mobile. How do we then intend

to  first groom them and then keep them?  Creativity also

means  thinking out of the box, which means  out  of  the

norms.   How far are we willing to go to tolerate out-of-the-norms thinking and behaviour?  What does this trans-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



late into in the area of censorship?  How liberal are  we

prepared  to  be?  After all, out-of-the-norm  behaviour,

once  endorsed, becomes acceptable and gets  proliferated

over time to become a norm.  Where do we draw the line?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, given that the creative

industry  is a multi-disciplinary industry,  is  there  a

supra  agency  overseeing  the  execution  of  the  ERC's

Services  Sub-Committee's  recommendation,  in  order  to

ensure  its  success?   Given that the  majority  of  the

businesses  in the arts and creative industry are  mainly

small  and  medium size, a national agency  could  render

some  help  to design, package, market and,  even  export

their  products  and  services.   Sir,  ultimately,   the

creative  industry  is important to us  not  only  as  an

economic  engine  of  growth,  but  also  enhancing   our

cultural environment.  Hence, I would urge the Government

to  pump-prime  the sector through an adequate  framework

comprising   fiscal  measures,  employment   and   social

security   considerations,  as  well  as   the   relevant

legislation.



<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> In the current

economic  climate and given the world  as  it  is  today,

creativity is no longer an option.  Creativity is the key

to  our survival in this very different world.  For  that

reason,  I  would like to ask the Minister  what  we  are

doing to encourage creative arts in Singapore as well  as

creative  designs.   The  way  of  the  future   is   not

Singaporeans sitting back and asking the Government  what

jobs  there are available.  The Government will play  its

part,  I  am  sure, in providing jobs,  but  the  key  to

surviving  in this very challenging world is the  ability

to  actually  create or come out with things  that  might

actually grow or encourage your own employment.   One  of

these  areas  is creative design.  Just take  handphones,

for  example.   The  three popular designs  in  Singapore

would  be  handphones by Motorola, Nokia,  and  Ericsson.

The  reason why they are so successful is because the way

these handphones were designed - easy to hold, press  and

use.  Design is actually the key for a lot of things that

are going to be marketed in the future and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



the  issue is how we can harness the talent that we  have

to create creative industry in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to sound a very upbeat note on this because I

do not think it is a situation where Singapore has a lack

of talent.  Most people, when they think of Singaporeans,

think of us as technocrats, a little dull and boring, and

I  think  that was what prompted Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon  to

talk about Singapore being a "wow" city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the occasion, this week, to encounter what I

consider to be very powerful talents in Singapore.   This

was  an  exhibition  done by Henderson Secondary  School.

They  have a project known as "Matchbox Project" done  by

their  aesthetic club, and they have actually  taken  the

art  works and pottery done by the students and exhibited

it  in a gallery at South Bridge Road called Utterly Art.

I  was  invited  to come down and have  a  look  at  this

exhibition.   When I saw the works of art  there,  I  was

really  blown  away because the works of  art  that  were

hanging  on the walls were done by 15-year old  students.

The  kind of depth and sheer raw power that emanated from

those  paintings were illustrative of maturity far beyond

15-year  olds.   For  anybody  who  has  not  seen   that

exhibition  yet, I strongly encourage you to go  and  see

it,  including  the Minister, because it  is  very,  very

good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the paintings, for example, was done by a 15-year old girl. She had lost her dog. So, the painting

was of a poodle suspended on the hands of a clock against

the  background of a clock.  It was very Salvador Dali's.

It  was  not a copy, but you could see elements of  that,

without  the  kind  of  darkness that  you  see  in  some

Salvador   Dali's  paintings,  but  it  had   a   certain

lightheartedness about it that was just excellent.  There

were other paintings hanging up there which reflected the

various  thoughts and feelings of the pupils.  There  was

one  of  HDB housing which I had strongly encouraged  the

principal   to  donate  to  the  Ministry   of   National

Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



because  I  happened  to think of the  particularly  good

piece  of  work.  So the point that I want to  sound  out

here  is  that  we have no lack of talent.   We  have  an

enormous  depth of raw talent.  It is just a question  of

how  we harness it and I hope the Minister would be  able

to expand on how we can channel the energy that the young

Singaporeans have.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, there is

money in movie making.  The Hollywood movie "Titanic",  a

movie  about the sinking of a British luxury  liner,  was

reputed  to be made with about US$252 million.   But,  it

raked in world-wide a record sum of about US$520 million,

more  than  double  its  outlay  of  capital.   Our   own

Singapore  movie,  made  by Jack  Neo,  entitled  "I  Not

Stupid",  is said to have made $1.6 million, and  it  was

screened  internationally, in Malaysia, Hong Kong,  Japan

and  South  Korea,  and was very well received  in  those

countries.   Jack  Neo's  latest  movie  does  show  that

Singaporeans do have creative talent to make a movie  and

be  accepted internationally and make money at  the  same

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, George Lucas of "Star Wars" fame, for the past

25 years in Hollywood, pioneered film-making with the use

of computer technology and sound technology.  Sir, I have

been  told that Singapore has such technology, especially

sound  technology  as pioneered by Mr  Sim  Wong  Hoo  of

Creative Technology.  Sir, it would appear that Singapore

do  have  creative and talented people, and expertise  in

computer and sound technology.  We do have the people and

the  technology  to make films that can be  sold  in  the

world  market.  Can the Minister comment on why, up  till

now, Singapore has not developed a vibrant movie industry

of international standard?



<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, may I first

thank  Mr Seng Han Thong and the other Members for  their

support  and  calls to develop our cultural  capital  and

creative   industries?   They  have  raised   many   good

suggestions  and  asked many searching  questions.   And,

yes, certainly I will take up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



Ms  Indranee's  suggestion to take  a  look  at  the  art

exhibition,  if  nothing else, to find  out  why  it  has

enthused her so much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since you are in a good mood today ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is just that we have some time,

that is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Since the Minister for Education has

left  me a little bit more time, I thought I would  begin

with a little story.  It is a story about a principal and

her  problem.   I  call  it  my "Lipstick  Story".   This

headmistress had a problem with her girls, and it was not

because  of  the policy measures introduced yesterday  by

the  Minister for Education.  I think those are all  very

welcomed.   Her  problem  was  that  every  evening,  the

cleaner  would  discover that the mirror  in  the  girls'

bathroom would be full of lipstick prints.  The girls had

taken  to  this little prank and they would put  lipstick

on,  all the different colours and shades, and they would

kiss  the  mirror.  Every night, the cleaner would  spend

the  greater  part of the night cleaning it up,  and  the

next day it would all come back again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the principal decided to speak to her girls at

the  assembly.   She told them what an irresponsible  act

this  was.   It  did not help.  The lipstick  marks  were

still there.  The next day, she tried a different speech.

She  told them about how hard a time the poor Ah Soh  had

cleaning the lipstick marks off the mirror.  That did not

help.   She  thought  of  calling  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment, but she thought the better of it.   So,  she

called  the  parents instead.  But that only made  things

worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, she decided on a new course of

action.   One afternoon, she called a few of  the  girls,

the  ones  that she suspected, but could not prove,  were

the ringleaders behind this.  She called all of them down

to  that girl's bathroom and she said, "I'd like  you  to

see  something.  I'd like you to meet someone."   And  in

walked  the  cleaner.   She is  a  typical  cleaner,  50-something,  got the job as a cleaner of the  school  from

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



Ministry of Manpower's Job Connect programme.  She walked

in  with an old mop.  One of the girls looked at her  and

taunted  her.  She said, "Old lady, where is your  pail?"

The cleaner looked at her and said, "Ai yah, I don't need

a pail.  You just watch."  So she walked up to one of the

toilet bowls, lifted the lid and said, "Ah neh la sam"  - so  dirty.  So she pressed the flush and she looked at it

again and said, "Still a bit dirty, but never mind."  She

took  the  mop  and  she stuck it into the  toilet  bowl,

swirled it around, took it out, and started cleaning  the

mirror.   The  headmistress did not have a problem  after

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tell this story, from time to time, when I

talk  about  the creative industry, or when I talk  about

innovation.   Because being creative is not always  being

high-tech.   It  is  how  we  think.   But  the  creative

industry  certainly  will be an  important  part  of  our

future  economy.  Unlike manufacturing, we cannot  easily

say   what  makes  up  this  industry.   It  ranges  from

architecture  to  fashion, from artists  to  copywriters.

But  what we do know is that this industry creates a  lot

of value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years back, American architect, Frank Gehry,

designed the Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao in Spain.   Your

first  impression of this museum is that it is a  tangled

mass  of  metal.   There  are no  straight  surfaces,  no

straight  lines.  Everything is curved and twisted.   But

it  is  an  architectural  marvel.   That  building,  the

Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao, transformed a stagnant steel

town  into  a major tourist draw.  The Museum cost  about

US$200 million to build, but I am told that the tourists'

spending  within  two years more than made  up  for  that

amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example. Japanese designer,

Kitoshiyuki Kita, designs TV sets for Sharp.  Sharp is  a

manufacturer  of  LCD  TV  screens,  a  very  competitive

market.   And Sharp needed a more attractive  product  to

gain market share.  When Mr Kita's design hit the market,

Sharp's sale of LCD TVs went up five-fold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global success stories are endless. What we

want to do is to have more of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



them  to  be  Singapore stories.  The  creative  industry

accounts for about 3% of our GDP today - and about 70,000

jobs.  But in the UK and the US, they account for 5-8% of

GDP.   And  this means that there is tremendous potential

for  creative  industries to grow and to create  tens  of

thousands of good new jobs.  MrsYu-Foo would say this  is

definitely a "wow" industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kinds of jobs we can create are wide-ranging.

Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Arthur Fong have both noted that

the  Esplanade generated new jobs.  It created about 320,

both  full  and part-time, and numerous more in  all  the

shops and arcades that are located at the Esplanade,  and

for  all  the artists who perform there.  But  more  than

just jobs at the Esplanade, we can create high value jobs

in   design,   media  and  other  areas   of   arts   and

entertainment.  Some jobs will be glamorous like  fashion

designers or movie stars.  But there will also  be  other

kinds   of   challenging  work,  like  sound  and   stage

engineers, graphic designers and animation artists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond jobs, the creative industry also has a

powerful  indirect impact on other industries  by  adding

style,  aesthetics  and freshness to  everything  we  do,

resulting  in more exciting products and services.   This

will   add   vibrancy  to  our  companies   and   enhance

competitiveness of our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But being creative is not something we can order

upon  on a menu.  Sometimes, as Mr Loh Meng See says,  we

need  to be pressed to the wall.  At other times, we need

quiet  and  solitude.  We are also, sometimes, stimulated

by  the  buzz  of a lively city to come up with  original

thoughts.   And  this  is where cultural  capital  is  so

important.  The richer our cultural capital, the more  it

nourishes  us  and  it gives us that unexpected  insight,

that perspective or that sudden thought that allows us to

break through and come up with winning ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural capital is hard to define, because it is in

everything that we do.  It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



includes  our sense of aesthetics, beauty, identity,  our

imagination and emotions, how we communicate  and  relate

to  each  other, how we deal with stress and  respond  to

opportunities.   But what we know is  that  the  more  we

widen   and  deepen  our  cultural  capital,  the  better

equipped we will be to compete in the creative industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is why I fully support Mr Seng Han Thong, Dr

Tan  Boon  Wan and the others who have called for  us  to

develop  our cultural capital.  To do this,  we  need  to

give  our  people  wider perspectives  of  life,  through

literature,  history, the arts.  This is a big  and  wide

task, but we have the ingredients and the institutions in

place to take off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday and today, my colleagues in the Ministry

of Education have talked themselves hoarse, talking about

all  the  different things we will do in our schools,  to

create  the  space  for  our  children  to  become   more

creative.   MITA  will  also do its  part.   Through  our

heritage  programmes,  promotion  of  the  arts  and  the

development  of  library systems, I will recount  briefly

here  the progress we have made in these areas.   We  are

reaching   out  to  more  people  through  our   heritage

programmes and museums.  Last week, for example,  DPM  Dr

Tony  Tan  launched our third Heritage  Festival  and  we

expect  about  200,000 people at these activities.    Two

weeks  before that, the Prime Minister opened  the  Asian

Civilisations  Museum.  And three  years  from  now,  the

expanded  Singapore  History Museum  will  be  completed.

Taken  together,  our  museums  attract  half  a  million

visitors  a year, a large part of them Singaporeans.   We

have  more facilities and activities now than ever before

for  Singaporeans to explore and to discover their roots.

In  the arts, we had record performances last year and  a

record  number  of  people attending  them,  despite  the

downturn in the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the Esplanade has branded Singapore

as  a  city with an ambition for the arts.  The NAC  will

continue  to  work  on that brand to turn  ambition  into

reality by bringing our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>



artists  to  international events and  by  continuing  to

increase  the  number and quality of  art  activities  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See and Miss Penny Low have raised

various questions about the arts and arts school,  and  I

will respond to them later in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our libraries, last year, we saw more than

32,000  visits,  an  average  of  10  visits  for   every

Singaporean, and the numbers are still rising.   But  now

that   we   have   succeeded  in  making  our   libraries

attractive, we will focus on how we can get borrowers  to

read  more  deeply  and  more  widely,  and  to  use  our

information services to excel in the knowledge economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts we make to increase our cultural

capital  will  take  time to bear  fruit.   They  have  a

cumulative  effect.  But, over time, more  reading,  more

awareness  of our roots, more exposure to the  arts  will

change  us in ways that we cannot exactly describe.   And

there  will  be  more of us who, like Ms Indranee  Rajah,

will  jump up and be enthused about the arts.  If we keep

at  it,  we will become a more gracious society   -   big

hearted,  imaginative and we will create such  a  vibrant

and  lively city that the creative industries cannot  but

grow and flourish here.  This is our goal.  But how do we

achieve it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some immediate steps we can take

towards that goal.  MITA will take a focused approach and

we  will concentrate on just two key areas for a start  - design   and  media,  both  areas  where  we  have   some

strengths.   We  pick  design because  good  designs  can

create  a lot of value.  I gave examples earlier  on  but

let  me  cite just one more.  Inter Brand, which  studies

companies' brand values reported in its 2002 survey  that

Samsung's  brand  value  gained  30%,  rising  to  US$8.3

billion, because it used bold designs to transform itself

into a premium seller of consumer products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, what a good design does is that it

allows  companies  to differentiate  their  products  and

services, and to gain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>



a  competitive advantage. This allows them to work on the

revenue  side  of the equation to increase revenues,  and

not just make profits by containing costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We aim to make Singapore one of Asia's leading hubs

for  design excellence.  To do this, MITA will  launch  a

multi-agency design Singapore initiative, promote  design

as a strategic capability in Singapore.  Design Singapore

will  do three things in the coming year.  Firstly,  MITA

will  work  closely with the economic and  education  and

research  institutions  to  develop  new  capability   in

design.   NTU's recently announced plans to  establish  a

School of Design and Media is one example of how the  new

capability  we like to see develop.  This will complement

the  architecture and industrial design offerings at NUS,

polytechnics  and  arts colleges,  like  LaSalle-SIA  and

NAFA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MITA will work with EDB to attract and

anchor  leading  industrial  design  companies  from  the

region  and the world to Singapore.  Currently,  we  have

MNCs,  such  as  Philips,  Motorola  and  Hewlett-Packard

already  designing some of their products  in  Singapore.

We  will work with them and also with other companies  to

increase the scope of such activities here and strengthen

our position as a global design and manufacturing centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we will take a cluster approach to develop

the  design services in Singapore.  This approach  allows

us to maximise our limited resources and to synergise our

creative capabilities.  MITA, working with MTI, will  set

up   the  Design  Singapore  Council  to  spearhead   the

development  of  this cluster.  This  Council  will  pool

together  the  efforts of Government's institutions  and,

most   importantly,  industries  to  promote  Singapore's

design culture and design industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council will include many top executives from

industry, because do we not only need creativity  but  we

also  need business and marketing skills to make the most

of  our  creativity.  Mr Edmund Cheng,  MD  of  Wing  Tai

Holdings and Deputy Chairman of the Singapore Arts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



Council, will chair this Council.  Mr Tham Kai Meng,  Co-Chairman  of Oglivy and Mather, Asia Pacific,  and  board

member  of  the National Arts Council will be the  Deputy

Chairman.  The Council will be set up shortly.



<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me update Members on what we plan to do in

the media industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Chiam See Tong for his support to develop

the film industry in Singapore.  Indeed, I agree with him

that not only would this create jobs but, by making films

that  reflect  our way of life, it can also contribute  a

cultural  identity.   As Mr Chiam has  pointed  out,  the

media industry is a huge global industry.  In 2001, total

worldwide  spending  in  the  media  industry  was   US$1

trillion.   We  shall ride on this growth and  work  with

studios to attract some parts of the value chain, such as

digital  animation and pre- and post-production work,  to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me sound a word of caution. I have said

before  that developing the film industry is a  challenge

for  us  because of our much smaller size.   Whether  one

million  or 100 million people watch the movie, the  cost

to  make it is the same.  Mr Chiam said it cost more than

$250  million  to make the Titanic.  But if  100  million

people  pay $5 to watch the movie, then you can get  $500

million of revenue.  I do not know how much Jack Neo paid

to  make  his movie "I Not Stupid".  But then  far  fewer

people paid to watch the movie, and that is why he made a

little bit less than what the Titanic made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face two key challenges. First, we have fewer

talents  compared to the large countries, simply  because

of our small size and not because we do not have talented

people.   Secondly,  we are smaller  scale  in  terms  of

market.  Notwithstanding these limitations, we have  seen

encouraging signs of success.  Apart from Jack  Neo's  "I

Not Stupid" movie that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Chiam  mentioned, the Singapore-France  co-production

"Song of the Stork" and other movies have won recognition

at  foreign  film  festivals, and  a  few  of  them  have

succeeded at the box office in a modest way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local production houses are now winning major

overseas  contracts.   They  are  recognised  for   their

quality  and  creative  abilities.   We  have  built   up

capabilities   in  animation,  pre-  and  post-production

facilities.  Our arts scene is creating buzz, and that is

attracting venture capitalists who sense that  there  are

opportunities opening up.  But, most of all,  our  strong

IP  regime  in  Singapore is attracting  foreign  content

companies  which want to finance, produce or trade  their

media  contents and manage their intellectual  properties

here under the protection of our laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Media Development Authority (MDA), newly formed

to  help  develop the media industry, has outlined  three

thrusts to building on these promising trends.  The first

is to develop "Made-by-Singapore" content, not just "Made-in-Singapore".   By  this, we mean content  that  can  be

created either in Singapore or elsewhere, and not just by

Singaporean  companies but also through co-production  or

joint ventures with international partners.  But to  make

content,  we need money.  Substantial upfront  funds  are

needed  to  develop TV productions, films  and  animation

projects.   MDA is drawing up plans to set up  a  Content

Development Fund that will be invested in media  projects

in  co-funding arrangements with the industry.  To  seize

the opportunities that are available today and so that we

do  not lose the momentum that we have built, MDA has set

aside  $20 million of its own funds to seed projects  and

to launch this new fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust is to develop Singapore into a

media  exchange  -  a marketplace for  the  distribution,

trading  and management of intellectual property, digital

rights and other media products.  Last year, it organised

the  Asia  Media Festival which comprised six  concurrent

trade events.  That attracted 2,200



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>



industry  professionals  to  Singapore  to  pitch   their

products,  sell  and distribute their  creative  content.

MDA  and  EDB will work on making this event bigger  each

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MDA is collaborating with JTC to build a

prototype  environment called "Fusionpolis" in One-North.

I launched this about a month ago.  It will be for people

in  the  media, infocomm and other creative companies  to

work,  live,  play and learn.  It will  be  completed  in

three  years'  time  and will have  state-of-the-art  art

studios  and  production facilities that infocomm,  media

and  arts  companies can use to integrate or  fuse  their

ideas together, to generate new products and new business

propositions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the first steps that MITA will take

to develop the design and media industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has identified the creative industries as an

important   component  of  Singapore's  future   economy.

Growing   these  industries  is  risky,  because  success

depends  strongly on whether we can develop  and  attract

talents to work in the industry, and that, in turn,  will

depend on whether we can develop our cultural capital and

make our city attractive, lively and stimulating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing this will require new thinking. But we can

take  encouragement from what others say of us, what they

see  in our efforts to achieve our ambitions.  Just a few

weeks back, Motorola's top designer, Mr Iulius Lucaci, in

an  interview with Streats, said that Singapore  has  the

potential  to become a leading industrial design  centre.

Mr  Lucaci  should know.  He was one of the two designers

behind  Motorola's  revolutionary  V70  handphone,  whose

sales exceeded $500,000 shortly after its launch.   If  I

may quote Mr Lucaci, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Form is now as important as function. Technology

has become a commodity, and it is the design that sets  a

product apart from competitors."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, whether we fail or succeed depends

not just on the completeness of our plans.  It depends on

our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



spirit  and  will  to  see this through.   With  Members'

support  and working closely with partners from  relevant

Government  agencies and the private  sector,  MITA  will

endeavour to develop the design and media industries, and

we  will  endeavour  to  make the creative  industries  a

cornerstone of our economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, the successful launch of

the  Esplanade  with  1.03 million  attendees  and  1,300

artistes from 22 countries should be commended.   It  has

become  a  centre  of  attention,  as  mentioned  by  the

Minister.  Our dreams of becoming a regional arts hub and

a  global art city with a good world-class performing art

centre will come too sooner than expected.  And I learned

that  from  April to December last year, S$80 million  in

media  advertising value was generated, with 1,200  media

articles,  of  which one-third was overseas publications,

including the New York Times, Washington Times, USA Today

and  South China Morning Post.  The other key achievement

is  that  the Esplanade staged 421 free performances  and

over-1,000  visual  arts  exhibitions  for  1.5   million

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is another intangible achievement

which  the  Minister may know.  It is that even  ordinary

Singaporeans are cracking jokes on the Esplanade.  I will

also  consider  this as an achievement.  That  shows  the

Esplanade belongs to the ordinary Singaporeans.  Since we

have time and, Mr Speaker, you are in good mood ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are catching up quite fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Yes. I will give a very quick

joke.   One day, the Minister, Senior Minister of  State,

the  Parliamentary Secretary, the Permanent Secretary and

some  senior officials were deciding on the name of  this

building.   So  they reviewed all the proposals  -  there

were  long  names,  short names - sexy  names,  sensitive

names, and they went through them one by one.  Some  were

too  sensitive,  eg, if you pronounce it  in  Hokkein  or

Cantonese, it may convey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



other meanings.  So the Minister decided that they should

call   for  coffee/tea  to  excite  them  to  give   more

appropriate  names.   So  coffee  was  served,   and  the

Minister asked the three girls who served coffee, "Girls,

we have problem in naming this building.  Can you give us

some ideas?"  So one Malay girl said, "Explain, lah!  Why

you  give this building a funny shape of a durian?"   The

Indian  girl  asked, "Explain, lah!  Why  you  have  this

funny  fly  eyes?"  The third girl asked, "Explain,  lah!

If  we  open this up, what will we see inside?"  So  when

they  left,  the Minister said that since the Malay,  the

Chinese  and the Indian girls all said, "Explain,  lah!",

let  us  decide on "Esplanade".  I would say this  is  an

achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the durian scent to entice Singaporeans to

taste  this  fruit has spread wide.  In  Chinese,  it  is

called   liu   lian   piao   xiang,   chu   chu   wen   (

).   I  would  like  to  urge MITA to  ensure  that  this

"durian"  can  sustain its drive with adequate  attention

and budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Penny Low. No more durian joke,

please.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I would like to continue this

talk on the Esplanade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Renaissance City Report 1, the stated aims

were  to  make  Singapore into a global arts  city.   The

Esplanade   opened  with  great  fanfare  last   October,

signalling  that  Singapore is  geared  up  to  the  next

sparkling star in the global arts scene.  Much money  and

hopes are on the Esplanade.  Hence, I would appreciate it

if  the Minister can provide some interim numbers on  the

following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What has been the box office income since

opening,  and the number of performances and audience  it

has attracted?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The accounts for FY 2001/2002 show that there

is  a  substantial Government grant of over $12  million,

for which a total of $7 million was expended.  There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



is therefore an excess of $5 million of Government grant.

Could  the  Minister shed light on how the  excess  grant

would be utilised?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that to make it affordable, many of the

shows in Esplanade are actually subsidised.  What is  the

extent  of  this subsidy, and how much will it  cost  the

Ministry on a yearly basis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that many marketing initiatives

have  been  planned  for this year.  Would  the  Minister

please comment on what will be the expected results as  a

result  of  these activities, and how it will  place  the

Esplanade  as a sought-after performance venue  vis-a-vis

that of Sydney Opera House, Carnegie Hall, and even Royal

Albert  Hall of London?  In addition, what is the  amount

that  has  already  been spent on the  publicity  of  the

Esplanade,  and is there any measure of  the  return?   I

understand  that  the international  press  has  actually

picked  up on the Esplanade quite a bit.  Perhaps  it  is

good   to   share  the  good  news  with  the   rest   of

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I also refer you to the table that I have

just     distributed,    comparing    Singapore's    arts

infrastructure  and  audience participation  with  bigger

cities like London and New York, as well as similar  size

cities like that of Glasgow, Hong Kong and Melbourne.  It

is  quite obvious from the figures that Singapore's  arts

scene lags far behind the cities listed, both in terms of

infrastructure  as well as software like  arts  companies

and  audience.   What  are  the  plans  that  will  bring

Singapore a step closer and, realistically, when can this

objective be achieved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps to accelerate the appreciation and

participation  in  the  arts among the  local  community,

could  the  Minister consider more internship  programmes

for  both school goers as well as members of the  public;

more educational backstage tours for locals and tourists;

and perhaps to dedicate a week per year to show off local

talents,  ie,  a local talent festival of sorts,  in  the

Esplanade,  as  the Esplanade is seen as the  prestigious

performance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



venue and a great morale booster for all involved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, is there any plan to build

smaller but good performance theatres, so there could  be

opportunities  for  good  productions  like  the   highly

acclaimed  local  musicals,  Siamese  Twins,  to  have  a

permanent performing stage?  This is, in fact, one of the

critical success factors in grooming the performing  arts

scene  like that in London, New York and even Las  Vegas.

We  may  not have the critical mass to sustain the shows,

but  this  is  also  the  case in  the  venues  that  are

mentioned  above.  Most of them, in fact, depend  on  the

tourist market and have been relatively successful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> The National Arts Council's

support for local arts professionals cannot be emphasised

enough here.  Its mission to nurture the arts and make it

an  integral part of the lives of the people of Singapore

is  clearly  an  important one.  NAC's  progress  in  the

promotion  of arts appreciation includes the arts  grants

and  awards,  arts  in  the  heartland  programme  and  a

significant increase in the number of quality arts events

and  festivals.  This has added colour to our arts scene.

We  are  providing funds and building the  infrastructure

required.  However, I believe that an equal importance to

the  arts  professionals exposure is  important  too.   A

platform  to  be  heard by crowds can  also  propel  them

forward.  Hence, I support the call by Miss Penny Low  to

provide  the opportunity for our local arts professionals

and artists on the scale of the Esplanade, for example.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I have the following questions for the

Ministry.  What else are we doing to improve the exposure

of  local  talents  and artists?  Do we  give  our  local

performers  equal  or better treatment  compared  to  the

foreign ones?  How do we select recipients of grants  and

awards?   Can the process be more transparent?   To-date,

how many and who are the recipients of these awards and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



grants?   Do  we monitor their progress?  And  where  are

they now?



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> On buskers, Sir, the street theatre

is  perhaps the oldest form of entertainment and one that

is   vital   in  adding  colour  and  vibrancy   to   any

cosmopolitan city.  It is commonly known as  busking  and

it  is  an  art form that dates back to the old  days  of

court  jesters  and travelling minstrels.  Unfortunately,

colourful  buskers are rather inconspicuous here,  and  I

wonder if the Minister would do more to encourage it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I surfed the website of the National Arts

Council to see what it takes to be a busker in Singapore.

There  is  a  litany of do's and don'ts,  conditions  and

indemnities  and,  of  course, the  omnipresent  fine  of

$10,000  for  breaching  the  Public  Entertainment   and

Meetings Act.  In order to perform in Singapore, first, a

busker  has to secure a letter of endorsement  from  NAC.

With  NAC's  endorsement, the busker would then  have  to

seek  approval from property owners and then go  back  to

keep  NAC  informed.   Over and above  this,  any  monies

received are to be donated to an arts group or charity of

their  choice after offsetting their transport and  other

expenses.   In other words, we do expect them to  perform

free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want a vibrant, dynamic and entertaining

busking scene in Singapore, we need to relook at some  of

the  terms and conditions surrounding busking activities.

Let  me  state that I am not against rules, but I am  for

simplifying them.  It would make a lot of sense to have a

one-stop  registration for buskers,  instead  of  two  or

three  stops process.  Or what about an online system  to

keep   pace  with  the  e-Government  initiative?    Some

professional buskers are travellers who are in  Singapore

for  just  a  few days and to devote a full  day  running

around  Government buildings is certainly  not  on  their

agenda.  It would dissuade buskers to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the rule on income. Buskers are not

allowed  to  earn  their keep.  Is it  because  they  are

perceived as the traditional buay ko-yok men who in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  movies are half-skilled, half-beggar or  conmen?

Perhaps,  some are.  But many modern buskers are  serious

artistes whose craft demands skills and experience, and I

think  we  should  respect that.   They  are  actors  and

actresses  in  the theatre of life when  no  audience  is

guaranteed.  Success depends on their skills to draw  and

keep  a  crowd.  Obviously, outright soliciting of  money

should  be  frowned upon, but money given voluntarily  in

appreciation of the busker's art form should be perceived

as their rightful reward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had successful buskers festival every

year  since 1997 and have established ourselves as Asia's

second  largest busking festival attracting some  400,000

participants,  both  local  residents  and  visitors   to

Singapore.  We can do better.  Let me just benchmark  our

buskers festival to some of the more successful festivals

around  the  world.  I present a table that I  have  just

distributed  for Members' reference.  In the  year  2002,

Singapore  River  Buskers Festival saw an  attendance  of

400,000  and 17 international artistes.  The duration  of

the  festival  was  seven days.  In Italy,  there  was  a

Ferrara   Buskers   Festival   that   attracted   800,000

attendance, but they had 669 international artistes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, you have got to end your

busking soon.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> And, of course, in New Zealand too.

I  could  refer  you  to the table.   Sir,  there  is  no

guarantee  that simplification of the rules  itself  will

build numbers.  I would like to suggest that perhaps even

a corner be considered to be allocated to the buskers, as

in  the  case of Centre Pompidou in Paris where the  area

serves  as  a  meeting  point  for  busker-wannabes   and

veterans,  to  learn  and exchange tips  and  experience.

This  place  has in fact become a tourist  attraction  as

tourists  flock  to see a side of the real  life  in  the

city.   This  way,  we  can  encourage  both  local   and

international  buskers to do a second take  on  Singapore

and, at the same time ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is up, Miss Low.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> --- increase tourist visits and add

to the vim, wild and WOW! to liven up Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, last year, the North West CDC

set up five cultural focus points to provide monthly arts

and  cultural performances in the community.  A total  of

53  performances were organised attracting  about  35,000

residents.  The CDC has worked with partners, such as the

National Arts Council, grassroots organisations,  schools

and  various performing groups, to bring arts and culture

to  the community.  The community outreach programme  has

enhanced  the  quality of life of  our  residents.   Many

residents  have given positive feedback to these  various

performances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to thank the Ministry and the National

Arts  Council for the support they have given to the  CDC

in  bringing  these performances to the  heartlands.   We

hope  that more can be done to increase the collaboration

between  the  CDC and the Ministry and the National  Arts

Council.  May I ask the Minister two questions?  What are

the resources allocated by the Ministry for the community

arts  and  culture outreach programme?  And  what  public

education efforts are in place to increase the  level  of

appreciation of arts and culture among Singaporeans?



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, in our effort to move towards

a  renaissance  city and build a creative  industry,  one

major prerequisite is the presence of a large talent pool

to draw from, as well as the need to send a strong signal

to  cultivate  and reward talents.  One such  signal  can

come  in  the form of a formal Arts School, where talents

are identified and developed from a young age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I advocate a model similar to the Sports School with

a  tight  timeframe set.  The Arts School could emphasise

on  the  learning of techniques and exposure to the  arts

without sacrificing the basic 3R's of Arithmetic, Reading

and  Writing.   In addition, subjects like arts,  history

and sociology could also be adequately taught



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



so that artists and people in the creative industry could

be  up  to par with the socio-economic developments.   In

short,  the  Arts  School  is a  necessary  institutional

support and push for the artistically-inclined, not  just

to  learn to build basic foundations in arts, but also to

give greater exposure to the world and the world of arts,

via  different  works,  techniques, exchange  programmes,

etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates of the Arts School should aim to be

dynamic,  be able to communicate with the global audience

and  improve  their  access  to  markets  and  career  or

business   opportunities.   Similarly,  they  should   be

capable  of encapsulating society's development  in  arts

and   contribute  to  the  creative  goods  and  services

cluster.   A  good example would be the designers  behind

the  Benetton clothes and Swatch watch who  are  able  to

communicate  their idea on a small canvas and  market  it

across cultures and the globe with much success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we able to produce such people? I think so. We

have,  as  our  national pride, Mr  Tan  Swie  Hian,  the

Singapore  Cultural  Medallion winner,  who  has  brought

Singapore to the global stage recently by being the first

Singaporean   to  be  conferred  the  prestigious   World

Economic Forum's Crystal Award at Davos, Switzerland.  He

joins  world-renowned  artists,  like  Ravi  Shankar  and

Sidney  Poiter.   We have many others like  maestro  Choo

Huei, potter Iskandar Jalil and the late playwright,  Kuo

Pao  Kun,  who  can bring glory to our country  with  the

right system, infrastructure and incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only just 1%, or approximately 400, of each

student cohort gets talent spotted and groomed in an Arts

School,  we  would  have  created  a  critical  mass  and

momentum  for  a  snowball effect to boost  our  creative

industry.   Let us not be half hearted about it  and  get

the  hardware,  which is the Arts School established,  so

that   the  software,  which  is  our  talents,  can   be

installed, running and upgrading all the time, to help us

face  the  challenges  of the New  Economy  at  broadband

speed!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, I must say that we have

done rather well lately in promoting the appreciation  of

arts.   We  have  clearly demonstrated  our  support  and

aspiration  to  turn  Singapore  into  an  artistic   and

culturally  rich  society, rooted in  our  multi-cultural

heritage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have some way to go. But I am certain we

can  turn Singapore into a vibrant, global city  for  the

arts  with  three  key  factors which  are  essential  in

enhancing the current situation.  They are infrastructure

and   facilities;   a  pool  of  talents,   artists   and

professionals; and arts education and training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear the initiatives and efforts spelt

out  by Dr Ng Eng Hen earlier on the part of MOE on  arts

education.   But  for MITA, my concerns are  as  follows:

What  else  are  we doing to improve arts  education  and

appreciation?  Is Singapore going to have an Arts School?

If  yes,  when  and  who  are MITA's  partners  for  this

project?   Is  Government's support and  funds  for  arts

going  to  be  reduced in this current economic  climate?

Are the Esplanade and NAC working closely with schools to

expose  our  students  to world-class  quality  arts  and

performances?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I should try to keep you in a

good mood.  But I think my mood has turned a bit.  So  no

stories to begin with.  I thank Mr Seng Han Thong for his

joke and shall count it as a joke for this session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arts, as many Members have noted, plays an

important  part  in increasing our cultural  capital  and

growing  our creative industries.  That actually is  good

enough  reason.  However, we should continue  to  develop

and  to  support the arts.  Let me recount  some  of  the

progress and reply to Members' queries and suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I do so, I want, at the very outset, to

address the point that Miss Penny Low has raised earlier,

when  we  talked about creative industries, and  that  is

whether or not we will continue to promote art for  art's

sake.  Yes, we will.  As I told this House last year, the

arts plays three important



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



roles  in  our society.  Firstly, it is a foundation  for

our  cultural  heritage.  Secondly, it  is  a  source  of

aesthetic   inspiration  and  intellectual   stimulation.

Thirdly,  it  is a resource for the creative  industries.

MITA values each and every one of these roles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yes, we will continue to promote art for art's

sake,  but we will also try to eke as much economic value

out  of the arts as we can.   Mr Seng Han Thong has noted

that  the  opening of the Esplanade was one of  the  most

significant events in the arts calendar last year.   More

than  1  million  people turned up  and,  now,  they  are

cracking jokes about it.  Well, that is good.  Even  more

significant  is  that  the event has  made  headlines  in

international press and in arts magazines.  Net of ticket

sales, we spent about $7 million on the opening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been asked: was it worth the money?

I  think it was.  And I think Mr Seng will agree with me,

especially if I tell him that the Esplanade has estimated

that the publicity that we gained from the articles,  the

editorials,  the testimonials written up on  the  opening

festivals were by themselves worth the equivalent of  $18

million  of  paid advertising, and paid advertising  does

not  have  the  same  credibility as an  editorial  or  a

testimonial.     The   endorsements   from    world-class

performers    and   international   arts   critics    are

immeasurable.  And they have now placed the Esplanade and

Singapore on a must visit, must see stop on their tours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benson Puah, the CEO of Esplanade, told me that, in

the  past,  it was hard for Singapore to get  world-class

orchestras to play here, and even if they were willing to

come,  they  would  ask  for  very  high  fees.   At  the

Esplanade's   opening,  not  one  but   two   world-class

orchestras played - the London Philharmonic and  the  New

York  Philharmonic - in addition to our  own  SSO.   Now,

Benson tells me, they get enquiries from top artists  and

troupes asking them when there is a slot available,  when

can they come and perform



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



at the Esplanade.  They still ask for somewhat high fees,

but  he  has got a bargaining chip now and he can  haggle

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esplanade has increased the value of Singapore's

brand  name  and it can do for us what the  famous  Opera

House  has  done  for Sydney.  This will be  an  enduring

asset, and it will have a tremendous impact, not just  on

the  arts  community  but on the  whole  economy.   This,

again,  is  reason why we must continue to  maintain  and

support the Esplanade as a world-class facility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, significant and impactful as the opening of the

Esplanade was, it was only one of the many things we have

done  to  promote the arts in Singapore.  Several Members

have  offered suggestions and asked questions as to  what

more  we can do to promote the arts to support our  local

artists.  Let me take Members back three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, my predecessor, Mr Lee Yoke Suan,

presented  to  this  House the Renaissance  City  Project

(RCP)  to  make Singapore a global city of the arts,  and

Parliament approved a budget of $50 million to  be  spent

over five years to further promote what some Members have

called the software and customer aspects of the arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to report that this project has

yielded  dividends.  Although I will  not  have  time  to

recount   all   the  successes,  I  will   mention   some

highlights.   Last  year, for the first  time  ever,  the

figure of ticketed attendance for performing arts crossed

the $1 million mark.  This was about 5-6% higher than the

year  before,  and  very creditable, given  the  economic

conditions.   I  think  it shows  that  Singaporeans  are

beginning  to take an interest in the arts and  beginning

to see the value, because these are ticketed performances

where they have to come up with hard cash in order to see

the performances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are many reasons why there is this

greater interest.  For one, the NAC has worked very  hard

to create



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>



greater  awareness  and  also to raise  the  quality  and

variety of programmes that are available at the different

venues.  So, there is now something to suit every  taste.

Another reason - and one that I would want to single  out

- is the rising quality and fame of our own artists.  Our

arts companies are making a name for themselves globally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Singapore Dance Theatre performed

to  8,000 people at the Cervantino International Festival

in  Mexico  last  year, the first time a  Singapore  arts

group  took part in that event.  In 2001, two years  ago,

four  of our young artists - Suzzan Victor, Matthew Ngui,

Salleh  Japar and Chen KeZhan - were invited, again,  for

the first time ever, to the Venice Biennale, which is the

most  important visual arts exhibition and  show  in  the

world.  This year, three more artists, ie, Tan Swie Hian,

Francis  Ng  and  Heman Chong, had been  invited  to  the

Venice  Biennale.  I think the world has taken note  that

we  do  have some good artists.  And, as Miss  Penny  Low

pointed   out,  Tan  Swie  Hian  was  also  awarded   the

prestigious Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum  in

January this year, the first Singaporean to receive  this

award.  Ong Keng Sen was invited to curate at Berlin arts

festival, In Transit, last year in Germany, and the plays

of  the  late  Kuo  Pao  Kun were performed  to  sell-out

audiences at the Biennale Asian Arts Festival in Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many, many more deserving artists and arts

groups that I am unable to acknowledge, for lack of time.

But,  as Members can see, Singapore artists are making  a

name  for themselves, and they are not the blind pathetic

erhu players that Miss Low talked about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will continue to help source new opportunities

for  our  artists  to gain international  exposure.   One

example of this is an MOU that we are working with China,

which  we hope to conclude this year, that will pave  the

way  for  our  artists to perform there  regularly  every

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure Miss Penny Low and Mr Zainudin that we are

very mindful of helping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



our local artists to grow and excel.  We have the talents

and,  if  we  continue to nurture them,  recognise  their

talents,   take  pride  in  their  work,   attend   their

performances, I am sure we will have even more  successes

to report in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we are now entering the fourth year of the

Renaissance  City  Project.  Demand for  RCP  funding  is

strong because of the rapid growing interest in the arts,

both  by the public at large and also the private sector.

So, we are now working on plans for a second RCP project.

We  should move quickly into this next phase and build on

the  momentum  that  the first RCP has  created,  because

other countries in Asia are doing so.  They have seen the

importance  and the benefits of the arts,  and  they  are

investing  and  implementing major arts  projects.   Hong

Kong,  for  example, has embarked on  a  40-hectare  West

Kowloon  Reclamation Project that will house Hong  Kong's

new cultural belt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three major art shows have established themselves in

Asia   -  Shanghai,  Guangdong,  and  Kwangju  in  Korea.

Practically  overnight,  these  have  become   the   most

important  art  shows  in  Asia.   Shanghai  opened   its

Shanghai  Grand  Theatre  five  years  ago  and  is   now

developing the Oriental Art Centre at Pudong, which  will

feature, like we have, a 2,000-seat hall and a 1,800-seat

theatre.   We must move quickly and with equal speed  and

confidence,  if  we  are  not to lose  the  standing  and

goodwill that we have earned from the Esplanade  and  our

RCP programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address some specific issues Members have

raised.   Dr  Teo Ho Pin and Mr Zainudin wanted  to  know

what  we  would do to promote community arts and culture.

I  agree  with Dr Teo that we must do more to  bring  the

arts to the people and the people to the arts.  This way,

all  Singaporeans can enjoy the arts, not just the  well-heeled.  We have programmes to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esplanade, for example, has made an on-going

commitment  to  stage  community arts  performances  that

would appeal to a wide spectrum of people.  I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



not think we should just set aside one week a year to  do

this,  but we should have programming all throughout  the

year  that  is  accessible and open to the  community  at

large.   Last year, NAC sponsored some 90 community  arts

programmes,  such as Concerts in the Park, and  community

arts  groups, and many community arts groups  took  part,

and we will continue to do so this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also encourage more corporations to follow

the  excellent example of the LTA to make more provisions

for  arts  to  be  displayed in corporate  buildings  and

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low suggested that we should simplify our

rules for busking and allow buskers to keep more of their

earnings.  These ideas have also surfaced in the Remaking

of   Singapore  discussions.   I  agree.    Buskers   add

liveliness to our city and to our neighbourhoods,  and  I

will  ask my officials to work with the relevant agencies

to  make  it easier for the buskers to busk, but  without

causing   too  much  nuisance  and  disruption   to   the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low also asked whether we have plans to

build new performance theatres.  I am glad to inform  her

that  the new National Library at Victoria Street,  which

will be completed by the end of 2005, will house the  new

Drama  Centre.  This new centre will comprise a  642-seat

theatre  for mid-sized productions, and also  a  120-seat

black  box  theatre  for  experimental  theatre.   If  we

compare  ourselves to other countries, we  can  say  that

there are other cities that have more facilities than  we

have.   There  are larger, older cities with  a  stronger

tradition  in  the  arts.   But  we  are  not  short   of

facilities  in  Singapore and, as we make  use  of  these

facilities,  ie, the hardware that we already  have,  and

build  up the software, I think we can consider  and,  at

the right time, look to see what other new facilities  we

need to build.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to do it as much as possible in as

clever a way as we can to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



make full use of the limited funds that we have.  By  co-locating the new Drama Centre at the National Library, we

not  only  make  better use of that space -  because  the

library  can  also use it - but we put it in  a  district

where  there  are  many  other  arts  institutions   and,

hopefully, that would spark off more synergy.   So,  this

is  the  approach that we want to take, to try to cluster

these activities and groups together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin wanted to know whether funds would still

be  available  for  local arts groups,  in  view  of  the

limited  money we have in our budget.  For  the  artists,

money  is  always not enough.  But I am glad  to  let  Mr

Zainudin  know that MITA will maintain our existing  arts

schemes  to  support our local arts groups.  But  funding

arrangements for the Esplanade - which is what some local

arts  groups have raised as a concern - will not draw  on

the  funds that we have already set aside for these other

programmes.   But  we  are  in  the  midst  of  difficult

economic times, and I hope arts groups will understand if

we have to tighten our belts a little.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to look for new sources of support.

Our  private companies have been very supportive  of  the

arts,  but  our  goal  really is not  just  to  look  for

charitable contributions.  Our goal is to work  with  the

private sector to get them to see where the arts  can  be

of  value  to  them to raise their image to impact  their

corporate activities and, in some way, to get more  value

out  of the arts for the businesses, and then we will  be

able  to  ask  the businesses to contribute more  to  the

arts.  Last year, private corporations gave $37.1 million

to  the  arts, about the same amount as the  year  before

and,  given again the difficult conditions, I think  that

is good support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Mr Loh Meng See, Miss Penny Low and Mr

Zainuddin have asked about arts education in our schools,

whether  MITA intends to start an Arts School.   I  agree

that  we should have a stronger emphasis for the arts  in

our  schools,  and I am indeed glad to  see  the  various

measures that MOE has already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



taken  today.   In 2002, NAC's arts education  programme,

which we do with the support of the schools, reached  out

to  98%  of our schools - practically everyone of them  - and  involved about 60% of our total student  population.

So,  about  60%  of  our students had an  opportunity  to

participate  in  or  look  at arts  programmes.   But  as

interest in the arts grows, it is timely that we look  at

the  feasibility  of setting up an Arts  School  or  some

other  means  to  provide an enhanced curriculum  in  the

arts, in tandem with an academic programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that the Arts School will follow

exactly the model of the Sports School.  Our goal is  not

just  to produce artists.  Certainly, if we have  such  a

school  or arrangement, we would want to prepare some  of

the students to become professional artists or to take up

an  arts career.  But, at the same time, I think  we  can

also produce students who have a strong foundation in the

area of the arts that they enjoy, and then go on to other

careers.  In this way, we can give our students, who have

a  bent  for the arts, more career options while  at  the

same  time  nurturing their artistic talents.  MITA  will

set  up  a committee to look at this shortly and it  will

involve  and  work  very closely  with  the  Ministry  of

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although we have made much progress in the

arts,  there is still much that needs to be done to  grow

and  support the arts.  I will ask NAC to look  into  the

many suggestions that the other Members have raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was a milestone year for us in the arts,

but  it was also a sad year with the demise of two of our

most  outstanding and well-loved artists, Brother  Joseph

McNally and Kuo Pao Kun.  The arts community mourns their

passing   but,  at  the  same  time,  we  celebrate   the

foundation that they had laid, the legacy that  they  had

left behind.  They have built a very good foundation  for

many generations of artists to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the foundation of all who have laboured to build

the  arts, and with the support of this House, MITA  will

endeavour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



to  make Singapore a global city for the arts.  I do  not

know  if  we will become the London of the East,  or  the

Paris  of  the East or the New York of the East,  because

these  are all great arts cities.  But I think if we  all

contribute,  and  we can build up our  cultural  capital,

create  a more gracious society and contribute to a  more

vibrant  economy, this will be a city that  we  will  all

want to live in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, since your mood has

changed, I will not tell another joke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Censorship Review Committee's Report will be out

soon.   Could  the Minister enlighten us on the  possible

recommendations it is likely to make?  Will there be  any

major  shifts in the censorship standards and approaches,

and  if  there  are, whether adequate consultations  have

been  made  by the Committee to ensure that  the  various

sectors   of  our  society  are  comfortable  with   such

recommendations?  While we allow for greater  choice  for

individuals, along with a greater exercise of  individual

responsibility,  we  need  to strike  a  balance  between

individual choice and community's preference.  One lesson

that  we  can learn from the last CRC's Report  was  that

MITA had to modify the "R" rating to "R(A)" due to public

outcry.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, on censorship, obviously

society   has  changed  and  we  are  seeing  the   rapid

introduction  of technology, so the mood is  for  greater

liberalisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to urge the Ministry to be very cautious

in their response to opening up because I think there are

fundamentals that we need to maintain.  I am particularly

concerned  with regard to the young. We are  seeing  over

the  Internet  young girls who innocently got  themselves

into  trouble because of massacre raiding adults.   Here,

parents  play a very important role and we have to  teach

our  young to be independent, and not to succumb to  peer

pressure, and to be well-equipped to stand up against all

temptations and situations that compromise themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have seen in the case of smoking, because we

take  an easy attitude, we are finding now that more  and

more of our young ladies are taking up smoking.  That  is

a form of censorship.  That is a lesson that we can learn

when  we  try to open up, especially in finding a balance

with regard to how much to open up.  I think we should be

especially  cautious when the media can reach  our  homes

and  the  children can have access to them.   For  public

performances,  we have to make sure that  there  are  not

only  the  audiences  involved but  also  the  performing

groups. It is important that we also uphold the integrity

of all the performing arts groups.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to talk about

TV  programmes.  Over the last few years, the quality  of

our  TV programmes has, in fact, gone up.  They are  much

better now. We see a lot of good documentaries on TV.  We

also  see  good Sitcoms like Phua Chu Kang and Under  One

Roof,  which  capture nuances and different  flavours  of

life  in  Singapore  and which are  very  interesting  to

watch.  More of such programmes are definitely welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in recent times, there has been a

spate  of TV programmes - I am specifically referring  to

reality TV programmes - which I am a little bit concerned

about.   Let  me  assure Members that  these  reality  TV

programmes are neither real nor realistic.  In fact,  the

kind  of  values  and  lifestyles that  they  project  as

acceptable, glamorous and fun, are clearly not consistent

with our own value system in society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite, in particular, two reality TV

programmes  and  they  are  Temptation  Island  and   The

Bachelor.   Temptation  Island, if  Members  are  not  so

familiar  with  the programme, refers to the  show  which

captures a few young couples that are put together in one

place  and the real test of life for them is to show  how

loyal they are to their partners.  For The Bachelor,  the

programme concerns a man who is look-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



ing  for  a  woman of his dream and the dream  women  are

supposed  to live up to his standards.  They have  to  do

all kinds of things to try and attract his attention.  If

Members are interested in more details, they could  watch

the  television programmes.  I assure Members that  I  do

not  watch these programmes every night.  On one of those

days  when  I had a hard day in Parliament, I  went  back

home  to  do some channel surfing and happened to  chance

across these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the media has a tremendous

influence  on the young.  Recently, a parent  told  about

her  young  kid who, after watching the news coverage  on

murders  in  Singapore, and we had a few these  last  few

months,  was wondering why people are killing each  other

all the time and whether that was the norm. Obviously, we

know  that  is not the norm because people do not  murder

each  other  every day in Singapore.  It is very  unusual

and   rare.   But  children  cannot  distinguish  between

reality  and  fiction.   So  certain  facts,  which   are

constantly  repeated, get distorted in their  minds.   Of

course,  we  are also concerned about the values  of  our

young people. We see a lot of babies being abandoned,  we

know  of  cases of abortions increasing and so  on.   The

situation  is  very  complex now  because  young  people,

unlike  in  the  past, are now subject to  all  kinds  of

different  ideas and messages.  In those  old  days,  the

message  that constantly gets reinforced in  us  is  very

clear - from parents, schools, the community. But now, it

is  very  diffused.  It is different kinds of values  and

messages that get transmitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of that, Sir, the questions that I would

like   to   ask  are:   who  is  monitoring  our   media,

particularly  our  television?  Is  there  a  cause   for

concern?   What  can  be done to counter  some  of  these

negative  values that are being portrayed in the national

media, particularly television?



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I would like to speak up for the arts community

concerning censorship laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our censorship laws fall short of what our vibrant

society deserves. In any case,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



the   Internet  has  made  censorship  almost  irrelevant

because  it  allows  almost unrestricted  access  to  all

materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Censorship should be replaced by regulation with a

light  touch.   Arts  requires  a  free  environment   to

flourish  and  any set of rules which is too  restrictive

will  undermine the renaissance city goal.  The following

three  principles, as proposed by the arts community,  in

favour of rules, should be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the rules should acknowledge the diversity of

modern  Singapore  and, in fact, allow for  the  greatest

possible  expression of that diversity.  That requires  a

climate   of   reciprocal  tolerance,  which   means   an

acceptance  of  other's  right  to  express  and  receive

certain  ideas and actions, and others accepting that  we

have  the  right not to be exposed against  our  will  to

one's expression of ideas and actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, classification by rating, supported by zoning

and  belting.   Diversity requires  tolerance.  Tolerance

enables choice. That exercise of choice is based  on  the

principle  of  limited access and exposure,  rather  than

total  blanket  bans  or  censors over  any  questionable

material.   A  regulatory system which bans nothing,  but

allows  everything, through regulating  the  distribution

and  access, should be set up. The model should be  based

on  a  system  of  rating, zoning  and  belting.   Rating

classifies  works,  like films, books, plays,  magazines,

etc,  according to their content, and imposes age  limit,

like  the current film ratings that we have.  Under  this

system, no work is banned outright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoning classifies geographical areas when works of

certain  ratings are restricted to certain parts  of  the

city  or  certain areas within a bookshop, video shop  or

retail  shop.   Belting classifies time period,  like  on

television or radio or types of media, such as newspapers

or  restrictive circulation like magazines, according  to

reach, imposing stricter limits on time period and  media

with  greater  reach according to the  rating.   So,  for

objectionable materials, like what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



Mdm  Halimah has quoted earlier, it should be shown at  a

later time belt on TV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, the principle of brown-bagging should be

applied  for printed works which fail the general  rating

test.   It  should be appropriately wrapped so  that  the

material on the cover would not be inadvertently seen and

brown-bagged. This protects those who do not wish to come

across such material.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that MITA will take these three

principles  into  consideration in the censorship  review

process.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, I wish to discuss on

politics  and the media. Politics in Singapore  has  been

dominated and controlled very clearly and convincingly by

the People's Action Party since our independence in 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be argued, Sir, that the PAP, through the

Government,  has  in many ways, been very  successful  in

controlling  or influencing the mass media,  directly  or

directly, through legislation, rules and regulations,  or

appointments  in senior positions, be it  on  radio,  TV,

newspapers  and  the relevant Ministries,  including  the

Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Ministry interested in the thinking of our

people  on politics in Singapore who may not be connected

to  the  PAP or, for that matter, any political party  in

Singapore,  eg, political scientists in the  universities

and  think-tanks, like the Institute of  Policy  Studies,

Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore Institute

of   International   Affairs,  etc,  the   various   non-governmental   organisations  and   civic   groups,   the

undergraduates and even commentaries and reports of local

and   international  publications,  and  reports  by  the

foreign  press,  TV  and  radio  broadcasters,  like  the

British Broadcasting Corporation?  The perception is that

there  is  still a very strong control from the political

leadership and the OB markers, as far as politics and the

media  are  concerned, seem to be one of  less  tolerance

compared  to  the  other activities in Singapore.   As  a

result, the citi-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



zenry would remain passive when it comes to discussion on

politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also confirm that our

journalists,  political  news  commentators  on  TV   and

publications  are  given freedom to write  critically  on

political matters in Singapore?  If the Ministry does not

agree with this perception of control and if it is of the

view  that  politics and the media in  Singapore  are  as

liberal  as it can possibly be, may I invite the Ministry

to  seriously have a dialogue session with interested and

concerned  Singaporeans and stakeholders to  revisit  and

analyse critically what needs to be done in terms of  the

pieces   of  legislation  on  politics  and  the   media,

including  the Internet laws, the composition  of  senior

officials in the mass media and the avenues available  to

the  citizenry to be involved in politics and the  media,

not by politicians, but by the ordinary citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our citizens become more educated and assimilate

ideas  and freedom of the press in the western democratic

countries,  and with the easy access to information  from

the Internet and various publications, and the variety of

newspapers  available  in the global  arena,  it  may  be

advisable for us to be more liberal in order to create  a

more  vibrant  political spirit in Singapore.  Would  the

Ministry,  on  the assumption that they are not  directly

involved,  relay  the message, indirectly  through  their

great  influence to the mass media, especially radio  and

TV,  to  foster greater political debate and  discussions

amongst Singaporeans and have more political programmes?



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I hope this will be my last

speech,  I  hope, before the break.  Sir,  let  me  first

address the issues that Mr Chandra Mohan has raised.   In

gist,  he  is asserting that the Government controls  the

media  in such a way that it does not allow for political

views to be heard.  Sir, this is not true.  You only have

to open the newspapers and look at the Forum pages to see

that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



are   all  kinds  of  views  expressed  about  Government

policies.   I think every conceivable argument  on  every

relevant policy has been raised.  And, every time  a  new

issue  comes  out you get a flood of letters  coming  in.

True,  not every letter gets published because  there  is

only so much space available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the editors make an effort to present a

representative slate of views and opinions when they pick

the  letters.   Sir,  when editors or journalists  decide

what  they are going to write, or articles to publish  or

what  letters they will print in the media, they have  to

consider whether these articles and letters, will inflame

emotions,  whether they will harm our  social  fabric  or

compromise our national interests, or whether  they  will

break  or contravene the laws of the land.  A responsible

editor  will therefore not publish a letter or an article

if   he   thinks  that  it  is  potentially   defamatory,

seditious,  likely to cause racial hatred,  or  otherwise

break the law.  For an editor to make such a decision, it

is  responsible  journalism.   It  is  not  a  matter  of

political censorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the issue of censorship that the

other  Members  have  raised.  We do have  censorship  in

Singapore, as they do have in all countries.  Is it still

relevant,  as Mr Steve Chia has asked?  If censorship  is

not  relevant  because we can get all of these  materials

anyway  on  the Internet, then would Mr Chia  expect  any

reaction  at all tomorrow when we publish a  photo  of  a

nude person on the front page of the newspapers?  I think

he  himself  would  not think that that was  appropriate,

even  though  these  materials can  be  obtained  on  the

Internet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has expressed grave concerns that TV

programmes such as Temptation Island or The Bachelor  can

instill  the wrong values in our children and  youth.   I

have  seen  half an episode of Temptation  Island.   Like

you,  on a busy day, at the end of the day when we switch

on  the  TV at night for a moment of relaxation,  and  it

comes  on  only  late  at night.  I  have  not  seen  The

Bachelor and so I cannot comment on it, but it does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



sound interesting and I will see if I can catch the  next

episode  -  the next time.  But it is for the  reason  of

your  concern that we have devised a set of  measures  to

guide  our media on what can be shown, and at what times,

and  on  which  channels.  Similarly, we  have  developed

guidelines  for the theatres and the arts to  address  Mr

Loh  Meng See's concern, that in the area of the arts  we

should  also  not  have artistic licence degenerate  into

unacceptable expressions.  But, at the same  time,  I  am

mindful  of the early exhortation when we discussed  arts

and  the creative industry, that we should allow for more

freedom in our censorship rules.  Miss Penny Low  and  Dr

Tan Boon Wan have raised this.  If you want to succeed in

creating  a  livelier and more innovative  society,  they

have argued that we have to be a bit loose and a bit more

relaxed.  How can we do this and yet address the concerns

that Mdm Halimah and Mr Low have raised.  And this is the

challenge that we face in setting the rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our censorship rules and policies have been drawn

up,  finessed  over time, and they have served  us  well.

Periodically, we do surveys and consistently they show  a

high  level  of acceptance and comfort with  the  current

censorship norms.  We will never have 100% of the  people

agreeing  with  us.   But, if we can get  70-80%  of  the

population saying, "Yes, we are quite comfortable.  These

are  the  right standards", I think we are not doing  too

badly.  Because, for the 20-30%, half of them wants us to

be  more  relaxed,  and the other half  wants  us  to  be

stricter.   Having said that though, our society  is  not

static  and  unchanging.  We are not insulated  from  the

rest  of  the world, quite the contrary.  If we  want  to

remake ourselves into a global city, we must become  even

more  aware of what is happening elsewhere, what are  the

trends,  what are the fashions, what are their  cultures,

what  are their values, so that we can interact with  the

rest  of  the  world and do business with.   And,  as  we

travel  and become more widely exposed, our own  people's

interests and attitudes and values will also become  more

diverse.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was why I decided last year to convene the

Censorship Review Committee (CRC) to seek their views  on

what  we should do to bring our censorship system  up-to-date.  Mr Seng Han Thong has asked about the progress  of

the  CRC  and  its  recommendations.  The  committee  has

almost  completed its work.  I will ask him to be patient

and it would be out in a month or two.  But over the past

years,  they have held 21 meetings.  They have  consulted

extensively.   They  have had 15 focus group  discussions

and talked to more than 300 people and received many more

representations from the public at large.  They have also

taken in the views expressed in articles and commentaries

carried by the media, and commissioned a survey to obtain

direct public feedback on key censorship issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised a number of specific changes to

our  censorship rules and I will pass these on to the CRC

for  consideration.  But, allow me to briefly  make  some

observations.   Mr Steve Chia has raised the  concept  of

rating, zoning and belting.  This is not new.  We do this

now   in  terms  of  film  classifications,  as  he   has

indicated,  in terms of shifting certain programmes  onto

late  night  television  or  allowing  certain  types  of

programmes  only  on paid television and not  free-to-air

television, and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has hinted at the idea of brown-bagging

materials.   I am not quite sure what he means.   But  in

America, where I lived for quite some time, brown bagging

is  only done for pornographic materials.  I do not  know

if Mr Chia is suggesting that we should have pornographic

materials  on  sale in Singapore and, if so,  whether  he

truly  believes  that this will make Singapore  a  better

society,  or  whether  he is just arguing  a  choice  for

choice's  sake.   If  we talk about such  materials,  the

question  is not a question of choice.  It is a  question

of  boundaries and where we want to draw the line.   Most

people,   I  think,  could  find  pornography  repulsive,

debasing, unacceptable.  Some may argue where exactly the

line  should  be drawn between pornography  and  art  for

entertainment.  Crossing this line would change the moral

character



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



of  our  society.  So, in considering this point that  Mr

Chia  advocates,  we  must  ask ourselves  this  question

whether,  and  to  what  extent, we  want  to  shift  the

boundaries  on pornography, and why?  Or, we  should  not

approach it as a choice for choice's sake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See mentioned that we should be careful

about  what we show over the media in the homes.  I agree

that  we should be stricter in our free-to-air programmes

because  that is what our children have easy  access  to.

But,  here  again, we have another dilemma.  Parents  may

not  always  agree on whether a particular  programme  is

suitable  for children or not.  In such instances,  would

it not be better to let parents decide where they want to

draw   the   line  for  their  children,  and   to   take

responsibility  for their decision?   This  is  different

from the point that Mr Chia had raised because it is  not

a  matter  of  shifting  the  boundaries  but  rather  of

providing  choice  within  the  broadly  accepted   moral

markers  of  our  society.   But,  if  we  move  in  this

direction,   then  we  must  ensure  that  parents   have

practical  tools  to  help control  what  their  children

watch.  And, there are tools today.  On subscription  TV,

for  example, the remote control allows parents to switch

off  the programmes or the channels that they do not want

their children to watch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CRC expects to publish its report in a

month  or  two, and so any comments at this  time  by  me

would be inappropriate by way of pre-empting what the CRC

may recommend.  But I can say that the CRC is considering

a wide range of issues including, inter alia, a review of

a   classification   standard   for   film,   video   and

subscription  TV,  the licensing and regulation  of  arts

groups,  and  whether other media, such  as  publications

should  also  be  classified  or  rated.   Whatever   the

recommendations  and  changes  we  decide  to  make,  the

challenge is how to meet the opposing demands of allowing

for  more  choices, on the one hand, and  protecting  our

young and our core values, on the other.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in responding to the CRC report, I will be

guided by a number of basic considerations.  Firstly,  we

must  develop our own approach.  We are a young  society,

raised  on traditional values and seeking to fit  into  a

global world.  We are also multi-religious, multi-racial,

multi-cultural.   We  therefore  cannot   simply   follow

foreign  norms  or import ideas from societies  that  are

culturally different from us.  It simply would not  work.

We  must develop our own formula and base these on  sound

and clear principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must look at the issues from all sides.

This is almost axiomatic.  But if we do not see or try to

see  the concerns of others, there is no reason why  they

should  see  our  concerns.  And if any  one  insists  on

absolute  freedom for himself, then he denies all  others

any freedom at all.  So, if we hope to find workable ways

to accommodate our different views and values, we must be

prepared for some give and take, and to take progress one

step at a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should aim to move at a pace that the

society,  as  a  whole,  can accommodate.   We  have  not

dramatically changed our approach to censorship over  the

last  10 years, and yet anyone who has lived during  that

period  will  recognise that we have  eased  up  in  many

areas.   Friends who have come to visit us after  a  long

while  feel  that it is different now, and yet acceptance

of our current censorship norms is still very high.  This

means  that  we have managed to find a workable  balance,

that  is,  the  tension between being too inflexible  and

changing too quickly, and we should continue to work  for

such a balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we must recognise that decisions

eventually have to be taken and then we have to move  on.

As  the CRC process demonstrates, the views of the public

are widely canvassed when developing censorship policies.

Likewise,  we  have many advisory and review  and  appeal

committees.  The public inputs are obtained to guide  the

implementation  of censorship rules.  But  in  the  final

analysis, the Government, as elected leaders,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>



must  decide  what the policies will be,  and  where  the

lines, for the time being, will be drawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate the Members' concerns over our

censorship  rules.   MITA  will  study  the  CRC   Report

carefully when it comes out and we will look not only  at

whether some of the rules should be changed, but also how

the process of administering these rules can be improved.

I  hope Members will continue to support us, give us  the

feedback, so that together, we can make a better  society

for our children.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, since the dot.com saga, and

the  problems  of  the  telecommunication  industry,  the

interest in the infocomm industry appears to have  waned.

This  would be a great mistake.  It is right to cool  the

euphoria  of  IT and telecommunication, but we  must  not

lose  sight  of its relevance and importance to  the  new

economy.   Information  and telecommunication  technology

underpins  the  new  economy.  We have irrevocably  moved

into  a network and knowledge-based economy.  Traditional

economies  will  transit over to the new economy.   There

will  be  many  opportunities  for  us  in  the  infocomm

industry.   I  would thus like to ask the Minister  about

the  status of the infocomm industry.  What progress  has

it achieved last year?  In view of its continuing growing

importance,  what plans does IDA have to further  develop

the  industry?  In particular, I would like the  Minister

to  provide an update on the status and development of e-commerce.  What is the position of the Government  on  e-commerce?



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I share Dr Tan Boon Wan's

concern  that possibly the telecommunication industry  is

reaching the stage of stagnation as reflected even in the

Budget Book.  I am very sure that there are opportunities

for us and maybe we would like the Minister to share with

us  what  are the areas of opportunities and development,

and  whether the route is towards more infrastructure  or

the applications that could be developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, is with regard to penetration of home

PC and on-line transactions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



To  my mind, security is actually a major obstacle to the

use  of on-line transactions and I would like to ask  the

Minister  how  we  can  persuade  Singaporeans  that  our

systems are secure and that we can go on-line without the

concern that we will be overcharged.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I read with concern an interest of

competition that other countries, like Mauritius, pose to

us.   In  the setting up of the disaster recovery centre,

we  can  actually  have competition with  countries  like

Mauritius.   What  are  the steps that  we  can  take  to

develop Singapore as a centre for disaster recovery?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on home grown competition amongst the

domestic  players of the infocomm sector, I know  of  the

debate  on having greater competition in this  area.   We

have   to   watch  domestic  competition,  but   domestic

competition is not really important.  It is  how  we  can

compete against others in the region.  It is still a very

much regulated industry in the region. What steps can  we

take   to  allow  for  greater  liberalisation  in   this

particular   sector,  so  that  we   can   have   greater

opportunities in this sector?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainudin Nordin is not moving. Dr

Teo.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the Infocomm Plan 21 aims to

develop  Singapore  into  a dynamic  and  vibrant  global

infocomm capital with a thriving and prosperous e-economy

and   an  infocomm-savvy  e-society.   One  of  its   six

strategies is e-powering the people sector which  entails

improving  accessibility of infocomm technology  to  all,

bridging  the digital divide and encouraging the adoption

of e-lifestyle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in support of the Infocomm Plan 21, North West

CDC has set up 24 IT training centres with 24 schools  in

our district.  Last year, we trained 300 students to be e-ambassadors  to assist in our IT training programmes  for

residents.  We have also trained 1,300 residents in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



National IT Literacy course.  I wish to thank the IDA for

its support given to the CDC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further encourage e-lifestyle, we hope to

organise more IT outreach programmes for our residents in

the district.  In this regard, I wish to ask the Minister

whether  the  Ministry  can  provide  more  resources  to

support the CDC's efforts in e-powering our residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What is the status of development of the Infocomm Plan 21?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Are there specific programmes to support CDCs in e-powering our people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What are the plans to promote e-Government services

to Singaporeans, especially the heartlanders?



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, may I take the

opportunity to clarify on what the Minister said  earlier

about  pornography.   With regard to  pornography,  I  am

actually  asking  about a light form of nudity  where  it

could  be  allowed  under  brown  bagging,  and  not  the

hardcore pornography, as what the Minister may think.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will go on to my speech on e-mail spamming.

As  e-mail becomes more popular, many users are receiving

an  increasing amount of the unsolicited commercial  mail

known  as spam.  Not only does spam make it difficult  to

identify  valid  e-mails,  some spams  contain  offensive

message and images.  While I understand the difficulty of

regulating  spammers and catching them, we  should  guard

against  their  growth  within  our  community.    As   I

understand   it,   there  are  private  individuals   and

Singapore registered companies that are collating e-mails

ending  with dot.sg and selling them for a profit.   Such

marketing  of  private  individual  e-mail  addresses  is

equivalent  to  the selling of our private telephone  and

fax  numbers to telemarketers who will call us up and try

to sell some redundant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



products.  We need to guard against this proliferation as

it will cause great inefficiencies and a breakdown of our

e-mail  communication system.  As a Straits  Times  forum

reader  puts it, "as a company with 10 e-mail  addresses,

imagine our daily frustration as our mail servers have to

cope with the same junk e-mail multiplied 10 times."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this rare instance, I am in favour of legislation

banning  the  sale of private e-mail addresses.   At  the

same  time, IDA needs to seriously do something  to  stop

the  growth of the spamming industry.  I look forward  to

the  Ministry to come out with a creative solution  to  a

difficult  problem.  Meantime, can the  Ministry  explain

what course of action can victims of spamming take?



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, let

me  first  reply to the cuts on infocomm by Dr  Tan  Boon

Wan,  Mr  Loh  Meng See and Dr Teo Ho  Pin.   Their  cuts

reminded  me of a speech I made just three weeks  ago  at

the  Singapore  Computer Society's Gala Dinner.   My  key

message  to  them  that night was this: "Let's  get  sexy

again!"   Sir, this is not my solution to our  low  birth

rates.   But like Dr Tan Boon Wan and others, I  sense  a

certain  loss of confidence in the infocomm industry.   I

decided  that I should give them a pep talk to point  out

the positives and urge them not to lose heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In infocomm, we have been sexy globally, and we can

be sexy again.  Just the other day, someone pointed me to

a  local  website, a chat group.  He said that there  was

some  discussion about my speech after it  was  made.   I

remember reading this entry from, presumably, a lady.   I

think  she wrote something like, "Actually, I rather  get

sexy  with somebody like F4, one of the most popular  boy

bands  now  in  Taiwan  -  tall, dark and handsome.   But

since  that is not possible and Minister made the  offer,

okay lor,  boh pian".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, my serious speech and message were

correctly received and understood by the ICT industry.  I

received



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



this e-mail from Mr Saw Ken Wye, Chairman of Singapore IT

Federation.  He thanked me for my speech and the  message

which  he  agreed.  And he wrote, "The final chapter  for

Singapore's IT industry has not been written yet  and  we

have  barely finished Chapter one.  And the beauty  about

IT  is  that  it  is  an  industry that  can  continually

reinvent  and rejuvenate itself."  I totally  agree  with

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some hard data. The infocomm

industry is large.  In Singapore, it made up 7.9% of  our

GDP.   It  is worth $28 billion and employs over  100,000

ICT  professionals.   Throughout the Asian  crisis,  from

1998  to  2000, it grew by an average of 5.6% per  annum,

higher than the overall economic growth rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now, the industry looks healthy. Where is the

evidence?   First,  infocomm investments  remain  strong.

Last  year,  it was the largest contributor of investment

commitments  in the services industry, with $870  million

of  business spending, that will create $1.9  billion  of

total value-add and 2,300 new jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, infocomm salaries remain attractive. Last

year,  salary increments averaged 3.5%, higher than  that

for other economic sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our global ranking (in terms of networked

readiness) by the World Economic Forum went up from   No.

8 to  No. 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we can be optimistic about our growth

prospects.   As Mr Saw put it, the industry is resilient,

being able to reinvent and rejuvenate itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Members should read the current issue of the

Economist,  where there is a special section on  what  it

called  "Telecoms  II".   Its  conclusion  is  that  "new

wireless  technologies that render  bandwidth  irrelevant

could  kindle a revolution in communications bigger  than

the Internet".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry players are betting big money on this

development.  Just last week, Intel launched  its  latest

chip,  the Centrino.  Intel already has its Pentium chips

in almost all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



desk-top computers, and it is now betting on its Centrino

chip  to be in most laptop computers.  It hopes that  its

"Intel  inside"  act I could be followed by  a  "Centrino

inside" act II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel believes Centrino's spread will trigger a

wireless  revolution  akin  to the  1960s  transformation

brought  about by the transistor radio.  That revolution,

you  may  remember, gave us all the freedom  to  use  the

radio anytime, anywhere, any place.  Intel hopes that its

Centrino  will  now allow us to use our laptop  computers

anytime, anywhere, any place.  Now, that is cool!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUN Microsystem has its own vision of this future,

of course, based on its Java solution.  Scott McNealy was

in town just a couple of days ago, and Members would have

read about his plan in the newspapers.  Microsoft and IBM

are no less ambitious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well positioned to ride on these waves,

because  of  our consistent efforts over  many  years  in

promoting  infocomm, from Intelligent Island, through  IT

2000 to Infocomm 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about Infocomm 21. We continue to make

progress.  In two years, our telecommunications bandwidth

has  expanded by 400 times.  We now have 21  terabits  of

high-speed   submarine   cable  bandwidth   with   direct

connections   to   more   than   100   countries.    Full

liberalisation,  as  Members know,  has  already  brought

telecommunication costs down sharply for  both  consumers

and business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, we are now a leading e-Government and have

won various international awards.  Our courts of justice,

our  libraries,  our electronic road pricing  system  are

world-class showcases of e-Government efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one in three Singaporeans uses broadband to

access on-line content from home, school or office.   The

number  of  broadband users will soon reach one  million.

There are now more than eight wireless Local Area Network

(LAN) service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



providers  and  more  than  240  wireless  LAN   hotspots

throughout Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last month, I patronised a Japanese restaurant

at  the  Esplanade.  It is one of such wireless hotspots.

Customers can access Internet on their laptops  at  high-speed.   Waiters  are armed with PDAs  so  that  customer

orders  are captured immediately and electronically,  and

transmitted  on-line to the kitchen, and, of  course,  to

the  cashier.   With  this  infrastructure  in  place,  I

suppose  the  next  step  for them  is  to  transfer  the

information to the suppliers real-time, so that raw  fish

can be replenished as and when needed!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know if you plan to turn this House

into a wireless hotspot.  If you do, then some of us  can

follow  the development in Iraq real-time without  having

to walk in and walk out, even as we debate the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now reply to the specific queries by Members.

Dr  Tan  asked  about e-commerce.  It  has  continued  to

gather momentum in Singapore.  Last year, the total value

of business-to-business (B2B) transactions remained above

$100  billion,  as  in the previous  year.   Business-to-consumer  (B2C)  spending has grown  by  20%,  from  $2.5

billion to $3 billion in 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked about security concerns as they may

hinder  the  growth of on-line businesses.  I agree  with

him that we need to maintain a trusted environment for e-commerce to flourish.  That is why much effort is put  to

developing  on-line security technologies  and  policies.

Our approach is to adopt a combination of (a) legislation

by  the  Government; (b) industry initiatives; (c)  self-regulation  by  the  industry; and  (d)  user  education.

Time,  however, does not allow me to go into the  details

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about e-Government. As I said just

now,  we can be proud of our achievements here.  Nine  in

10  public  services can now be accessed  and  transacted

electronically, a total of over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>

1,500  public  services.  The e-citizen portal  attracted

nearly seven million hits every month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the National IT Literacy

Programme (NITLP).  The purpose is to help bring basic IT

skills  to  Singaporeans who missed out on IT  education.

The  target was to equip 315,000 Singaporeans with  basic

computer  and Internet skills over three years.   Working

through  28  training centres, the programme has  so  far

benefited more than 113,000 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About six in 10 Singaporeans are now IT literate.

One  significant  achievement  is  this  mindset  change.

There  are many anecdotes of Singaporeans taking  to  the

convenience  of  e-Government,  SMEs  leveraging  on  the

Internet for their business, and housewives logging  onto

the  Internet  for information and leisure.  Singaporeans

do  not  resist  IT for fear of layoffs or  displacement.

This  is a big achievement that many other countries  are

still working on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See talked about our telcos going

regional  and whether our FTAs will be one  way  to  help

them  open up the market.  Although our domestic telecoms

market  is still growing, our telcos know that they  need

to  go  regional to secure long-term double digit growth.

The  activities of SingTel and StarHub in the region  and

further afield have been well reported in the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunities are there. First, growing middle

class   will  increase  the  market  size.   Second,   as

countries  open  up  their regime and lift  the  domestic

protection, there are new businesses for our  players  to

participate.  Our various FTAs certainly help to speed up

the  process, as we persuade our FTA partners to give  us

better market access.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked if the opportunities are more in

applications  development or infrastructure  integration.

I  think  it is both.  But industry players will have  to

focus,   as   always,  on  their  core   competency   and

differentiate themselves from the competition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now reply to Mr Steve Chia's cut on the

subject of junk e-mails, commonly called e-mail spamming.

There are really two parts to this issue.  First, can  we

prosecute e-mail spammers?  Yes, we can.  E-mail spammers

can be prosecuted if the e-mail spam is serious enough as

to  cause  a  degradation  of  the  computer  system  and

resulting  in disruption of service.  Victims can  report

to the Police who can pursue it under the Computer Misuse

Act.   Members may remember -  I think it was  two  years

ago  -  there was such a case when someone was prosecuted

for  bombarding HDB's computer department with  something

like  7,500 junk mails over a period of 21/2 hours.   But

the  act  of  sending  unsolicited email  is  itself  not

illegal.    When  used  appropriately,  it  is   a   very

legitimate form of marketing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect: is the unauthorised selling of

email  addresses  illegal  in  Singapore?   We  do   have

sectoral legislation that contains provisions to  protect

an   individual's  personal  information  and  that  will

include  his or her email addresses.  For example,  under

the  Banking Act, banks are not allowed to sell the email

addresses  of  their  customers.   Likewise,  under   the

Private  Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, it  would  be

illegal  for hospitals and clinics to pass on  the  email

addresses of their patients to a third party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a company has collated email addresses

from  the  Internet  or  from  the  Singapore  Directory,

repackage  it  and resell the information  to  interested

marketers,  the  marketers are basically  buying  already

public  information,  which they could  otherwise  obtain

free of charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, Minister David Lim received an

unsolicited  email  from a company promoting  a  software

package  which  it  claims can,  and  I  quote,  "harvest

hundreds of thousands of email addresses within seconds",

and the word used is "harvest".  And this is the type  of

spider which the industry talks about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, email spamming is a global phenomenon. We are

not alone.  It can be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



nuisance but overall the extent of spamming here is still

relatively  low.  How do other countries respond  to  it?

Is there any good model for us to follow?  Unfortunately,

the answer is no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is legislation effective? The US experience is that

anti-spam laws are not effective.  The US has state  laws

against  spamming, some dating back several  years.   But

despite  the  law, successful suits against spammers  are

rare  and  the extent of spamming has not gone down.   In

fact, it has gone up.  Australia too has concluded, after

a  study in August last year, that legislation alone will

not be effective in curbing spams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason why spams are difficult to eradicate is

that the majority of them originate from overseas.  Anti-spam  laws,  even  if  enacted,  do  not  have  effective

jurisdiction against spammers who are based overseas.  We

have  just to adopt a practical approach, comprising  (a)

industry  self-regulation; and  (b)  consumer  education.

This  approach  takes  into  account  and  balances   the

legitimate interests of businesses and consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this approach, our Internet Service Providers

(ISPs)  have all adopted best practices to counter  spams

originating  from  their subscribers.   Each  ISP  has  a

policy  of  suspending  the  email  account  of  its  own

customers.    Users  should  also  take   some   personal

responsibility to safeguard their email information, just

as  we all do for our other personal particulars, such as

telephone numbers and residential addresses.  Some simple

tips  I  would offer include the following: do not freely

disclose  your  email address; only disclose  your  email

address   to  organisations  or  websites  that  practise

personal  data  protection  principles;  and  of  course,

install  anti-virus software.  As a parent, I  constantly

remind my daughters about these tips.  And here, my worry

goes beyond just the nuisance of spamming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, we cannot eradicate spamming, just as

we  cannot avoid catching the flu occasionally.   But  we

can reduce the nuisance.  And IDA will step up its public

education programmes on how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



email users can better protect themselves against spams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Loh Meng See.



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, we are very proud of the

National  Library.   I  think  it  is  one  of  the  most

innovative  statutory boards that we have  in  Singapore,

and it is a challenge to make it even better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, an area that I thought the Library can

look  into - in fact, I am surprised that they are  doing

right  now in Shenton Way having that promotion -  is  to

encourage   as  many  adult  readers,  particularly   the

professionals, to make use of our public  libraries.   In

fact,  if  we were to visit the library on a normal  day,

they  are  mainly  made  up  of  children,  students  and

retirees making use of the facilities.  So, I think it is

of  greater value and benefit, if more such adult readers

make use of our facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, is the organisation of our libraries.

Though  we  have regional libraries, I am just  wondering

whether some means can be found to provide for niche

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>

libraries,  in  the sense that, either based  on  certain

themes  or interests, we can have a better collection  in

particular  areas  and  locations,  rather  than   having

libraries where the collection would actually be few  and

far between.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, personally, I feel that

the  National  Library Board (NLB) is  one  of  the  most

progressive statutory boards, as mentioned by Mr Loh Meng

See  just now.  It has done a highly commendable job,  in

terms of providing accessibility to resources, and it has

also  effectively  utilised  technology.   However,   the

journey  surely  cannot  end here.   The  library,  as  a

knowledge centre, is still at its infant stage,  and  its

potential for growth is immense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy slowly makes its way to become a full-fledged knowledge, I hope that the library will parallel

this  growth  or, better still, pave the way  and  create

space for lively debate and the sharing of knowledge.  It

can  very well be our next icon and join the ranks of the

libraries of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concerns are the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What are the future plans of the NLB towards

making our libraries the community knowledge centres?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What is the progress of the library

construction  and  development  in  Singapore,  eg,   the

National Library and the Community Libraries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Many have expressed regrets and sadness on the

possible  loss  of our National Library.   What  are  the

plans of NLB for the new National Library?  Would it be a

library that many will treasure and be proud of, as  with

the past National Library?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Can NLB turn our new National Library into a

future  icon,  and  perhaps make  it  one  of  the  great

libraries  of  the  world or, if not,  at  least  of  the

region?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Total Defence

and NEWater exhibitions are great national events that we

should be very happy with. Unfortunately and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



regrettably, these national events are conducted only  in

English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our civil servants must have forgotten that about

30%  of  Singaporeans  do not know  English.   These  are

mostly elderly people.  The editorial of Lianhe Zaobao on

5th  March commented, "Though our civil servants are  the

elite in the frontline, they lack the basic understanding

of  our  own residents in the rear.  The result  is  that

while  the  Government is busy building the "Ideal  Home"

for   the   next   generation,  many  older   folks   are

increasingly  feeling  as though they  are  strangers  in

their own homeland."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask our civil servants whether they

are  unaware of the existence of the non-English speaking

masses or do they just simply could not be bothered  with

them,  to the extent that they become so insensitive  and

indifferent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large scale activities like the Total Defence and

NEWater  exhibitions   are meant  to  reach  out  to  the

people.  The Government has the duty to see  to  it  that

these messages are conveyed to each and every citizen  in

a  simple  and approachable manner.  As such, I urge  the

Government to expressively stipulate that activities like

these  should provide explanatory notes in all  the  four

official  languages  for  the  exhibits.  Every  citizen,

irrespective of his race, language or religion,  has  the

right to share the information.  The Minister should  set

out  clear orders that all public activities that involve

the  participation  of  the total citizenry  should  have

instructions given in all the four official languages.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Media

Advisory Panel has recommended for a lifting of  the  ban

on  dialect  programmes.   In 1979,  the  Speak  Mandarin

Campaign was launched by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan

Yew.   The  slogan  was  "Speak more  Mandarin  and  less

dialect".   This was subsequently followed  by  concerted

efforts  in  eradicating dialect songs,  talk  shows  and

story-telling programmes, as well as dialect  commercials

on TV and radio.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Programme Advisory Committee, in recommending

the  return of dialect programmes on TV, had argued  that

most  young  people  are  now  effectively  bilingual  in

Mandarin   and  English.   Therefore,  allowing   dialect

programmes  would  have no adverse impact  on  the  Speak

Mandarin policy.  Other reasons given are that  it  is  a

good  way to let young Singaporeans know something  about

dialect,  as  dialect  is  still  part  of  our  cultural

heritage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature has shown that many nations use language

as  a  means to unify the country, eg, in China, the  US,

Europe and India.  The different languages that were once

spoken converge into one or two major ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move by MITA is significant for Singapore. The

unique geopolitical context of Singapore, with its unique

multi-racial setting and immigrant origins would  require

young  Singapore to be fundamentally strong in  just  two

languages  that  will  serve to  unify  its  multi-racial

character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our political leadership made the major

decision  more  than  20  years  ago  to  implement   the

bilingual policy, many good reasons were given.   I  have

requested  Speaker of the House to allow me to distribute

some   extracts   of  the  reasons  from  our   political

leadership.   I am also distributing a table  that  shows

the  proficiency that Chinese Singaporeans have  made  in

English,  Mandarin  and  Chinese dialects  in  the  years

between 1990 and 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it took the Chinese Singaporeans 10 years to

achieve  a  15%  in  the  number of Chinese  Singaporeans

embracing the language.  In the same period, the  use  of

Chinese dialects dropped from 50.3% to 30.7%, ie, a 19.6%

drop.  Yes, we are making progress in embracing Mandarin.

But,  contrary  to  what  the Media  Advisory  Panel  has

alluded to, we are not proficient in the language yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I was told, students who have scored A1

for  Chinese in their GCE "O" levels have said  that  all

they had to do was to mug 3,000 Chinese characters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



and  then remember them by heart.  After that, they  will

just  discard  the use of the words.  And these  are  our

creme de la creme.  In other words, the language has  not

been internalised in most of the students and it does not

come as second nature to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues I would like to raise are as

follows:   will  the  lifting of  the  ban  result  in  a

slowdown  of the good progress we have been making?   How

can we ensure that our progress rate, including embracing

our bilingual policy, will not be affected?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should be mindful of the fact that while we

have  succeeded  in  our  bilingual  policy,  there   are

Singaporeans  who  are  not able  to  effectively  master

either  English or Mandarin.  My next question  therefore

is:  by allowing dialect to co-exist with Mandarin,  even

if they are on ad-hoc basis and limited in scale, will we

expect some degree of deterioration in the proficiency of

Mandarin?  There is evidence that learning more than  one

language  can lead to the learners making errors  because

of what linguists call "language interference".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue, the bilingual policy is a

fundamental   national  policy.   By   allowing   dialect

programmes  to  be shown over national TV,  what  signals

will  we be sending to Singaporeans who have been brought

up in a culture of bilingual policy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that such a move by MITA may

lead  to  other racial groups also requesting for similar

viewing of dialect shows, in which case, where do we draw

the line?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the variety can be interesting and rich, will

the  viewing  of such dialect shows lead  to  norming  of

dialect  groups, which can extend into the way  we  live,

where  we  work, as had happened in the past?   We  would

recall  that  our bilingual policy has an impact  on  our

housing, occupation and lifestyle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, let me first reply to the

cuts on public libraries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with both Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Zainudin

that  public libraries have important roles to play.   As

Mr  Zainudin  put  it,  knowledge centres,  to  encourage

reading and to promote continuous learning.  That is  why

we  were  so  concerned  when  visitorship  to  libraries

declined and libraries were - this was some 11 years  ago

-  at risk of becoming irrelevant.  The then Minister for

Information  and  the Arts, BG George  Yeo,  assembled  a

Library  2000 Taskforce to try to reverse the  trend.   I

had the honour of being a member of that taskforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Cantonese say: ngow mng yam tsui, dim gam

ngow  tou  dai,  ie, if the cow does not want  to  drink,

there  is no way you can get it to bend its head  to  the

trough.   If  Singaporeans do not come to the  libraries,

then  either we bring the libraries to the people, or  we

make  the libraries compelling for them to want to visit.

We  decided to do both.  As a result, we have been  quite

successful in reversing the trend.  I thank both  Mr  Loh

and Mr Zainudin for the compliments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our libraries have now become so buzzy that I

remember  reading about some complaints against noise  in

the  newspapers  recently.  Because libraries  have  been

transformed,  we  now find visitors  who  had  previously

never stepped into any library.  We can be proud of  this

transformation  of our public libraries.  The  successful

transformation  of our libraries even  became  a  Harvard

case study.  Some of the visitors that we now receive are

fellow  librarians from many other countries.  They  have

read  about  our success, and they came here to  see  for

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can libraries do to promote adult reading?

Getting  more  adults to visit the library regularly  and

frequently is one important step.  I think this  we  have

largely succeeded.  So, the next step is to have them  to

read  more.  I think they do.  I do not think they  visit

our  libraries merely to look at the decor  or  to  drink

cafe  latte.  One evidence is the sharp increase in  book

loans.   The  number of loans from the adult  collections

has  more  than doubled from six million in  1995  to  13

million  this year.  But this is a continuous effort  and

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



have  to be creative in the promotion efforts.  So,  last

month  we  launched the Library Ambassador  programme  to

promote  reading  and  learning.  We have  personalities,

such  as  our  national  bowler, Remy  Ong,  and  Channel

NewsAsia  presenter Suzanne Ho as our Ambassadors.   They

fan  across  our 24 libraries to take part in activities,

such  as story-telling, meet-the-star sessions, Celebrate

your  Festival Series.  As Mr Loh pointed out, just  this

week,  we  launched another programme, the Library@Office

campaign  to  promote  to office workers,  professionals,

executives  and  businessmen  on  our  varied   services,

resources and extensive distribution channels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked if all libraries should be general

libraries or is it not better for some to specialise.  He

called it niche libraries.  We agree with Mr Loh that not

all  libraries should be the same.  Indeed, they are not.

Wherever possible, we try to tailor the character of each

library  to  reflect  the targeted  niche  audience.   In

selected  libraries, we set up special collections.   For

example, the Bedok Community Library has a Malay  library

service, and the Tampines Regional Library has a  Chinese

library  service.  I have just visited the newly upgraded

Ang   Mo   Kio   Community  Library  which   is   in   my

neighbourhood; a wonderful transformation.  I  notice  it

has an Indian library service there.  And, of course, the

library@esplanade is a great example of a niche  library.

It  focuses  on  the four performing arts: dance,  music,

theatre and film.



<br>3.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are responding to these niche libraries

and  niche  services  with great  enthusiasm.   They  are

saying  that we are on the right track, and we will  push

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin hopes that we can make our new National

Library  an international icon of learning and knowledge.

We  will  try, but within the sensible limits of  budget.

We  do  not have the huge budget of the British  Library,

but we will stretch what we have been given, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



create something different and of value to Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like our newly opened Asian Civilisation

Museum  at  Empress Place.  Our collections  are  modest,

compared to what you can find in the museums in Delhi  or

Beijing.   Ours is relatively small, in terms of quantity

and  perhaps  even  quality.  However,  through  creative

curatorship,  I  think we have created a  product,  quite

world-class, and which we can all be proud of.   This  is

the  same  approach we will be taking on the new National

Library. So, stay tuned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on Dr Ong Seh Hong's cut on the

greater  use of official languages in public exhibitions.

Let  me  state MITA's own guideline for our  own  museums

first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our museums provide all panel texts in English. But

we  do  supplement  with other languages,  in  two  ways.

First,  we  often provide panel texts in other languages,

depending  on  the  content, theme and  target  audience.

Second,  we  have handouts and brochures in the  relevant

official   languages  for  all  our  exhibitions.   These

handouts  and brochures provide the synopses and  explain

the main themes of the exhibitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the current "Exhibition on 20th Century

Chinese  Paintings" in the Singapore Art Museum  contains

panel  texts  in both English and Chinese.  For  the  new

Asian  Civilisation Museum at Empress Place, panel  texts

are  in English.  But we have gallery guides in brochures

in Chinese, Malay and Tamil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guideline also applies to our travelling

exhibitions.  The only exceptions are school  exhibitions

and  temporary exhibitions of very short duration,  where

only  the  translation of the synopses  in  the  official

languages will be provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I agree with Dr Ong that we should be

sensitive  to  the non-English speaking Singaporeans  and

cater  to their needs as far as possible.  At the end  of

the  day, the purpose of a public exhibition is to  reach

out.  It would be quite silly not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



to  use  the other languages, unless we are quite certain

that  the  targeted audience is already comfortable  with

English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me spend some time on this very

important topic of dialect.  I think Mdm Ho Geok Choo was

a   bit   mistaken.  She  read  in  the  newspapers   the

recommendations  of  the  Programme  Advisory   Committee

(PAC).   MITA's  policy  is  quite  different.   We  have

already  announced it and replied to the  newspaper.   We

stand  firm on the current policy.  I am glad  that  this

particular MITA's policy, which we are standing firm, has

the  support of Mdm Ho. She understood the importance  of

Mandarin  as  a  unifying language to  bond  the  Chinese

community.  As  she  has  pointed  out,  we  should   not

inadvertently  reverse  the  progress  we  have  made  in

getting  our people to use Mandarin, through  a  careless

liberalisation of our dialect policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not ban dialects. Where practical, we allow

some  dialect  programming to service the needs  of  some

older  Singaporeans and the arts community.  But when  we

make  such concessions, we do it carefully to ensure that

the  concessions  do  not undermine  our  Speak  Mandarin

Campaign.   That  is   why  some dialect  programmes  are

available on radio, on the arts channel and on cable  TV.

For  instance, Arts Central occasionally carries  dialect

operas   and  art-house  movies  in  dialect.   FM   95.8

broadcasts dialect news daily, and dialect programmes are

available on cable TV's TVBJ channel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, kept Channel 8 and Channel U free

from  dialect  as  these channels are watched  by  school

children.   We  should not confuse them by,  on  the  one

hand,   promoting  Mandarin,  and  on  the  other   hand,

broadcasting dialect programmes on these channels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share my personal experience. I grew up in a

Hokkien-speaking  family.  My parents  could  only  speak

Hokkien,  although they could read and write in  Chinese.

I  then  entered  a  Chinese kampong primary  school  and

gradually picked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



up  Mandarin,  English and Bahasa.  But  even  then,  the

school  environment  was  largely  Hokkien-speaking.    I

recall  that  we  did not take languages  too  seriously,

except to pass school examinations.  At that time, we did

not have compulsory PSLE examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I joined high school and because it took in

students  from all over, with varying language abilities,

we  were  all put through an extra year, called  "Remove"

class, before we began formal secondary school education.

"Remove"  class was really an extra year for the students

to brush up on their English as all other subjects, other

than languages, were taught in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I entered university in Australia and had to

pick  up  more languages: computer languages  -  Fortran,

Basic  and Cobol.  I do not belong to that small minority

of  people  like Mr Seng Han Thong, or our colleagues  in

the   interpretation  booths,  who  can  handle   several

languages competently with ease.  I am just your ordinary

fellow, with an average brain capacity. So in my last  50

years,  I  found  myself with competencies  in  different

languages at different periods of my life.  During my six

years  in  primary school, I was fluent  in  Hokkien  and

Mandarin.   During secondary school, I was  strongest  in

English and Bahasa. I neglected my Mandarin somewhat.  In

university, I was most fluent in English and  Fortran,  a

computer  language.  After graduation, I began  to  again

spend  time  on Mandarin, but even then, it  never  quite

reached  the same competency as my English.   My  Hokkien

and  Bahasa are now probably at primary three level.   My

computer languages have become totally obsolete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we face a constant struggle with limited time

and  limited brain capacity.  We only have 24 hours  each

day.   If we spend more time on X, we have less time  for

Y.   It is as simple as that.  We all want to be good  at

X, Y and Z, but it is often just humanly not possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we have achieved some success in our Speak

Mandarin Campaign is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



outcome that is not irreversible.  It was an uphill task,

but we have managed to push that rock up the slope.  Some

of  us  can  now take the hands off the rock and  perhaps

listen to shan ge in dialect.  But if everyone does that,

the rock will immediately roll down the slope.  My advice

to Chinese Singaporeans is san si -  think thrice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House has heard the debate of Mandarin

versus dialect many times.  The arguments are well  known

to  all,  including the members of the Programme Advisory

Committee   (PAC).   These  are  rational   establishment

people.   So why did they suddenly argue for a relaxation

of our dialect policy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was curious, so I sniffed around and I think I

found  out  why.  It is Jack Neo's "I Not  Stupid".   You

see,  "I Not Stupid" has been such a roaring success that

Singaporeans want more of it.  I myself have  watched  it

two and a half times.  Once, in the cinema; once, on VCD.

The third time was when it was screened on Channel 8.   I

only  saw part of it, because when "lim-peh" became  "ni-lau-pa",  something was missing.  "I Not  Stupid"  became

kind of stupid, and I switched it off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be many like me in the Programme Advisory

Committee who felt the same way.  I am speculating, but I

think this led to their call for some dialect programming

on free-to-air TV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to resolve the contradiction in this

instance is to screen "I Not Stupid" in its original form

on Arts Central, but not on Channel 8 or Channel U.  This

way, we uphold our Speak Mandarin Campaign and still  get

to  enjoy Jack Neo's masterpiece free-to-air.  MITA  will

consider  this  and other programmes from time  to  time.

But  we must always bear in mind that in exercising  such

flexibility,  we  do not dilute or harm  our  efforts  to

promote Mandarin to our young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that

we are behind time on this amendment.  Dr Maliki.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, it

has  been  more  than  five  years  since  the  Singapore

International Foundation started its operation.  The fact

that this cut comes under MITA suggests the focus of  the

SIF  is  to project a specific image of Singapore to  the

international community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that SIF has several programmes, including

the  Singapore  Volunteers Overseas Programme  and  Youth

Expedition  Programme and so on.  Most of the  programmes

involved   Singaporeans  going  overseas  and  performing

community  activities at work, certainly  benefiting  the

people and the communities that they are serving.  Sir, I

am  sure  SIF will be able to give us a list of the  many

schools  we have built, the many children we have  helped

immunised, and certainly the many lives we have touched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while these are all well and good, I wonder how

much  has  been  spent so far in sending Singaporeans  on

these overseas community projects.  The SIF annual report

showed  that  for  last year alone, we  spent  some  $4.6

million on overseas programmes, plus another $2.9 million

on  staff  cost.  My concern relates to the old  adage  - that  charity  begins at home.  In this current  economic

climate, we have heard so much about how Singaporeans are

affected by the economic downturn.  It may not make sense

for  Singaporeans that we are spending so  much  to  help

other people, when our own people may need equal, if not,

more help.  I would like to ask the Minister:  how can we

justify to Singaporeans that the amount of money that  we

are  spending  in  making the lives of  people  of  other

countries better, when Singaporeans' lives may  be  worse

off?   Specific  examples are those  without  electricity

supply and water supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the desired outcomes of the SIF programmes?

How do SIF programmes benefit Singapore and Singaporeans?

In  this regard, I would like to ask the Minister:   what

are some of the requirements that SIF has of Singaporeans

who  have  served  overseas  and  contributing  back   to

Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my interaction with young people, especially

with  those  in tertiary institutions, my sense  is  that

they  have  a  very  global  perspective  and  many  have

aspirations  to  do  community work overseas,  with  very

little  mention  of  doing community work  in  Singapore.

Certainly,  the  SIF  provides an  excellent  avenue  and

opportunities for them.  But I am concerned  how  we  can

encourage and ensure that these young people continue  to

feel  for their fellow Singaporeans so much as they  feel

for  the  people in other countries.  I hope the Minister

can also provide insights into the processes that SIF has

put  in place to achieve this end. Also, with these young

minds,  how can we ensure that we will continue  to  root

them to Singapore?  Being exposed to different levels and

manifestation  of  poverty and  different  political  and

social  systems, how can we allow them to  process  these

differences and appreciate Singapore better?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that Singaporeans understand why we

need to help others because I am sure, in the process, we

are   helping   ourselves  to  be  a  more   mature   and

compassionate society.  Even if charity does not begin at

home, just make sure that it returns home.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Some advertisements are misleading. In order

to  achieve the effects of advertising, some  go  to  the

extent    of    posting   exaggerative   and   misleading

information.  People who are not careful and  believe  in

the  misleading advertisement may lead to disappointment,

financial  losses and, sometimes, lose their lives.   Now

let me cite some examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair growth advertisement: A friend of mine told me

that  the model she used for a hair-growing advertisement

had well-groomed dark hair. A photograph was taken of him

with  dark, thick hair on his head. They then shaved  off

the major



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



part of his beautiful hair, and had a photograph taken of

the  "Mediterranean Sea" on his head. The two photographs

were  then  shown  on  the advertisement  to  depict  the

"before"  and  "after"  the  treatment  which  they  were

promoting. But the sequence was reversed to suggest  that

the  bald  head had turned into a head of thick and  dark

hair.  This  advertisement is misleading  and,  in  fact,

deceiving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water filter advertisement: There is also an

advertisement  on a water filtering machine.   It  claims

that  water  that  passes through the  filtering  machine

comes  out many times cleaner than the tap water supplied

by  PUB.   In  other  words, it misleads  the  public  to

believe  that  PUB water is dirty and not fit  for  human

consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another one which appeared in Wanbao,

which is even more absurd. It claims that by wearing  the

slimming shorts, blood circulation can be improved by  as

much as 30%.  I think this is grossly exaggerated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are really too many advertisements which

contain varying degrees of untruth in them. I would  like

to  ask the Minister whether something should be done  to

stop such misleading advertisements from appearing in the

media.  The  merchants  who put  up  such  advertisements

should be taken to task.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> I am

here  to  ask  the Ministry for clarity on  its  role  in

governing  such advertisements as Assoc.  Prof.  Low  has

brought  up, and in this case I am talking about slimming

advertisements.  Each day, there are at  least  two  huge

advertisements in the print media and many  smaller  ones

in  the  other  media.  These advertisements  prey  on  a

woman's  insecurities over her body  and  also  reinforce

notions  that she is just there to be attractive  to  her

husband.   Let me recite some examples that  appeared  in

today's paper:  "Let your wellness radiates from within",

"Become  now  a  beautiful mother", "To be attractive  to

your husband", "She has gained back her



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



beautiful body even after having two children".  And then

the  lady  goes  on  to say how she is  grateful  to  her

husband  for  encouraging her to  go  for  this  slimming

course, whatever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not here to dispute the claims made by these

advertisements or the efficiency of the agencies that are

running  these  courses to bring women back  into  shape.

What  I  am here is to ask the Ministry - as I have  just

heard  from Mr Yatiman that there are two representatives

as  constituent  members  of  the  Advertising  Standards

Authority  of Singapore (ASAS) alongside with many  other

reputable representatives - how is the Singapore Code  of

Advertising  practice being administered and governed  by

these  representatives on ASAS.  On top of that, I  would

also  like to draw attention to this book which  has  got

wonderful  clauses  in Appendix H relating  primarily  to

slimming    advertisements.    When   I    compare    the

advertisements  to 2.1.5, I do not really  see  a  direct

correlation.  Is it time then to review these guidelines?

Also, there is a chapter in this Code, primarily catering

to how children are being used.  I wonder why is there no

such  provision where women are concerned, because  women

are  used  all  the  time in so many  advertisements  for

different purposes.  Lastly, it took a while to find this

Code  and  I  thank  the  parliamentary  librarians   for

tracking  it  down.  It is not on the web, and  I  wonder

why.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> First of all, I would like to thank Dr

Maliki  for  his comments on the Singapore  International

Foundation (SIF).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIF is an NGO (non-governmental organisation), but

it  is funded in part by the Government as its mission is

in  line  with the Government's aims and goals.   For  FY

2002, the SIF received $9 million of funding support from

the  Government through MITA, MFA and the National  Youth

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIF was set up in 1991 with two core missions.

First,   to  connect  Singaporeans  living  overseas   to

Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



thus  strengthening  their sense  of  being  Singaporean.

Second,  to  help  shape a positive image  for  Singapore

internationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIF programmes are geared towards these two

missions.   Externally, they seek  to  generate  goodwill

between  Singapore  and other nations and  peoples,  thus

supporting  our  efforts  to grow  an  external  economy.

Domestically,  SIF  programmes  help  to  develop   civic

society  through  fostering  a  spirit  of  volunteerism,

compassion and active citizenry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the SIF has carried out a wide range

of   programmes.   One  key  programme  is  its  Overseas

Singaporeans programme.  SIF runs support activities  for

a global network of 91 clubs and 109 student associations

to  strengthen the Singapore identity and connectivity to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another is the Friends of Singapore programme. SIF

has  received more than 1,000 visitors from 17  countries

in  the  past  decade, as part of its  efforts  to  forge

strong networks of goodwill and friendship for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under its Singapore Volunteers Overseas programme,

more  than 500 Singaporeans have become volunteers in  14

countries.  They work on many meaningful projects.   Some

help  to bring basic healthcare to the poor in the  rural

areas.   Some help to bring IT and Internet to  those  on

the  wrong  side  of the digital divide.   We  have  some

reports  in  the  newspapers showing the success  of  the

programmes carried out by the SIF, including going to the

remote  areas to help those having toothaches.  So  these

are clear examples of how our volunteers are really going

into remote areas, linking Singapore to people living  in

those places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through its Youth Expedition Project, SIF has

also  trained over 2,000 young Singaporeans in leadership

and life skills through overseas community services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee envisages Singapore

becoming a globalised,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



diversified and entrepreneurial economy.  With its  reach

to  Singaporeans overseas, SIF is well positioned to play

an important role to draw Singaporeans everywhere to be a

part  of  this expanded space that we operate in  and  to

make  their  contributions.  Through the SIF,  and  other

outreach  programmes  like  Contact  Singapore  and   the

Majulah Connection, we can help our overseas Singaporeans

feel   connected  to  Singapore,  and  be  part  of   the

Singaporean  community  worldwide.   In  turn,   overseas

Singaporeans   can   help  us  to   enhance   our   image

internationally  of a globally oriented Singapore.   Sir,

this  is  a  win-win  approach  for  both  Singapore  and

overseas  Singaporeans, and this  is  why  SIF  is  worth

supporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me go to the question of misleading

advertisements  raised  by  two  speakers.    Ms   Braema

Mathiaparanam and Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay talked about

people  who  are  losing their hair  and  those  who  are

overweight  falling victims to misleading advertisements.

I  share their concerns because at my age when people are

also talking about losing their hair and gaining unwanted

extras  all over their bodies, I too and you too, Members

from this Chamber, could be victims.  The question is: is

the   existing   regulatory  framework   for   misleading

advertisements sufficient, in light of the  proliferation

of  weight-loss and other related advertisements  in  the

newspapers and TV broadcasts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two bodies that could address their

concerns.  First, the Advertising Standards Authority  of

Singapore  (ASAS)  and,  second,  the  Media  Development

Authority (MDA).  ASAS polices advertising standards  for

advertisements.   ASAS  is a local  advertising  industry

self-regulating  body  comprising  representatives   from

various   entities  including  advertisers,   advertising

agencies, Government agencies and media owners.   She  is

right when she said that MDA is represented in ASAS.   It

is  an advisory council to the Consumers' Association  of

Singapore (CASE).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ASAS has a Code of Practice called the

Singapore Code of Advertising Practice (SCAP), which sets

standards on accuracy, authenticity and good taste.  This

Code  was  recently updated and re-issued in early  2003,

and  includes guidelines pertaining to slimming  products

and services, scalp products and environmental claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever there are cases of misleading

advertisements or complaints, ASAS would review and  take

action  against the dubious advertisements that  seek  to

exploit   the  consumers.  These  actions  could  include

directing the advertiser or advertising agent to amend or

totally  withdraw the advertisements, or  requesting  the

media to impose sanctions on the errant party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since local media owners and advertising agents

support  the ASAS Code, advertisers who do not  amend  or

withdraw   their  misleading  advertisements   may   find

themselves denied access to space in both the  print  and

broadcast media.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if there is any breach of our

censorship  guidelines,  eg,  Code  for  TV   and   Radio

Advertising  issued  by MDA, Media Development  Authority

can  also step in to investigate and take action  against

the advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although regulators can take care of

misleading  or  objectionable  advertisements,  consumers

should  also  play a role by using judgement  and  common

sense when interpreting advertisements.  New products and

services are being offered all the time.  Some are driven

by real advances in technology, others may be repackaging

of   existing  products  and  services.   Hence,  it   is

important  that  the  public should always  be  alert  to

offers that are too good to be true, or miracle solutions

that solve problems with little effort or cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the book that Ms Braema raised,

we  will look into whether the question of children  used

in advertisements could be extended to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



women too.  MITA will take a proactive stand in it.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the war has started, which we cannot stop, but

I  would  like to ask the Minister whether  he  can  stop

another  war - the media war - with the Media Competition

Code.   The  Media Competition Code is to ensure  limited

competition within Singapore's mass media market.  I have

four  questions  to ask the Minister.  One,  whether  the

anti-competitive  practice will be  effective  enough  to

ensure  fair  competition or prevent vicious  competition

leading  to  a media war.  Second, what are  the  guiding

principles in setting the Government's standards?  Third,

how  will  the authorities monitor the Code and how  will

breaches  be  dealt with?  Lastly, how will the  public's

interest be safeguarded by the Code?



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, competition in the media

industry  in  Singapore  has to be  limited  because  our

market  is  such a small one.  I remember  talking  about

this  last week when replying to Mr Steve Chia's question

on  a  second  pay  TV.  But, whether it  is  limited  or

otherwise, anti-competitive practices cannot be condoned.

The  Media Market Conduct Code sets out the ground  rules

for  fair competition and fair market conduct.   Some  of

the  anti-competitive practices that we  frown  upon  are

spelt  out  in the Code, eg, the Code prohibits predatory

pricing.   If  a  dominant  player,  with  deep  pockets,

deliberately prices itself, for example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



advertisement  rates below its marginal  cost,  with  the

view  to  make life difficult for a new player  or  small

player, this is predatory pricing.  Regulators will frown

on such practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code imposes special obligations on dominant

players.   The  purpose is to prevent them  from  abusing

their dominant position to stifle the development of  new

players.   For  example, mandatory bundling services  are

also frowned upon.  If a dominant player, let us say, who

owns  several  newspapers, insists that  all  advertisers

must  advertise in all its newspapers, he will  find  the

regulator   knocking   at  his  door.    The   Code   has

comprehensive enforcement procedures to check  on  errant

players.   The regulator can either initiate  enforcement

actions  or  act  upon complaints.  There are  prescribed

procedures  in  the Code to investigate  anti-competitive

conduct.   Enforcement measures will  range  from  simple

warnings,  knocking at the knuckles to  severe  financial

penalties of up to $1 million per contravention.  In this

way  the  Code  serves  the  wider  public  interest   by

facilitating fair and effective competition in  the  mass

media market.  By spelling out the ground rules for  fair

play,  new entrants to the market will have a fair chance

to  establish  themselves.  This will,  in  turn,  foster

further investments in and development of the mass  media

market.  Their success, in turn, will add to the range of

quality  media services available to Singaporeans,  thus,

giving them more choices.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this topic is on heritage centres and museums.

I  must commend the National Heritage Board's decision to

open  our museums every day, a marketing drive to attract

Singaporeans  to  visit the museums  free  during  public

holidays.  This is one of the effective ways to cultivate

the   museum-going  culture.   The  NHB's  heritage   bus

launched  earlier this year is another move  targeted  at

the  community.  May I ask what is the NHB's overall plan

in  developing museums and heritage centres and fostering

the museum-going culture?



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, first and foremost, I would

like   to  extend  my  congratulations  to  the  National

Heritage  Board for a job well done and also  the  recent

opening  of the Asian Civilisations Museum.  We  are  now

one  step  closer to realising the goals set out  in  the

Renaissance  City  Report.  Over the years,  millions  of

dollars  have  been dedicated to retain our heritage  and

thus  giving us a sense of identity and historical roots.

We   can   now  say  that  we  have  world-class  museums

showcasing  Singapore's history and  rich  heritage.   In

order to promote the arts and get our population to  have

a  greater appreciation of our roots, would the  Minister

consider,  first,  engaging  our  schools  to  adopt  the

heritage  centres and museums and, in the process,  train

our  students to be guides or ambassadors of the museums?

The  students  can  be engaged on special  school  tours,

school   holidays  or  during  foreign  student  exchange

visits.   The advantage of such a scheme is that it  will

broaden  the  scope of understanding of  their  subjects,

which are social studies and history of Singapore.   This

is  one  way  we  can groom our young to  have  a  deeper

appreciation  of  both  the  arts  and  the  history   of

Singapore.  Perhaps the Minister could explore this  idea

with the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, currently, have a total of 18 museums and

galleries.  In the Renaissance City Report, MITA has also

stated  that  it  would work with the  Singapore  Tourism

Board  to promote arts and cultural tourism "capitalising

on opportunities in conferences, conventions and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



exhibitions."  Sir, may I suggest that an all-in-one  day

pass  or  season pass be offered to cater to the  diverse

interest of tourists, which I am sure our 18 museums  can

accommodate.    This type of day pass is not  unusual  in

cities  like  Paris or London where visitors  can  choose

from a range of museums and art galleries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, we have two other amendments

to deal with.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Another spin-off from the all-in-one

type of pass is that of riding on bigger attractions, and

it would help build attendance for smaller museums.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Seng Han Thong

and  Miss  Penny  Low for their encouraging  remarks  and

suggestions for our museums.  The National Heritage Board

(NHB)  is  currently  working on a  number  of  marketing

strategies  to promote a museum-going culture by  forging

stronger partnerships with the public, private and people

sectors.  Let me elaborate quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our museums are positioned as lifestyle centres. Mr

Seng and Miss Penny Low may be happy to know that many of

the  suggestions raised have been incorporated  into  the

NHB's  operations.  Lifestyle elements, such as food  and

drinks,  retail shops, arts and cultural activities,  are

integrated  to  enhance the visitor's  total  experience.

For  example,  art appreciation workshops and  Lindy  Hop

dance  classes are regular features in our  museums.  Our

arts and heritage facilities, such as the Singapore Tyler

Print   Institute   and  Reflections@Bukit   Chandu   are

available for corporate functions as well as arts-related

events,  such  as poetry-reading, public talks,  location

filming  and  staging of plays.  Like the  newly-launched

Asian   Civilisations  Museum  at  Empress   Place,   the

Singapore  History Museum will have a variety  of  retail

spaces  and  function rooms for public bookings  when  it

reopens in 2006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng and Miss Low suggested that we issue pass

cards  to  encourage museum visitorship.  I  am  glad  to

inform them that the NHB offers an annual pass



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



with  unlimited  entry  to  all three  national  museums,

namely, the Singapore History Museum, Asian Civilisations

Museum  and  Singapore  Art  Museum,  and  the  Singapore

Philatelic Museum.  NHB also works closely with partners,

such  as  the  STB  and its network  of  tour  operators,

hotels,  community  organisations  and  NTUC,  for  joint

promotions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NHB is currently working with STB on a day pass with

attractive  benefits for tourists, as requested  by  Miss

Low.  Day passes catering to different niche groups, such

as  families,  youths  and the  elderly  are  also  being

considered.  NHB will study the feasibility of  extending

some of these passes to other smaller museums in the near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Low also suggested that we should collaborate

closely  with  schools.  I am glad to say  that  this  is

already  being  done.   For  many  years,  NHB  has  been

actively  reaching  out  to  students  and  getting  them

involved  in  our museums.  About 70% of the  schools  in

Singapore  are  members  of the NHB's  School  Membership

Scheme.   On average, member schools visit our museum  at

least  twice  a year as part of their school  curriculum.

Together  with the Ministry of Education,  NHB  has  been

involving  students as museum guides and facilitators  in

its   volunteer  programmes,  as  well  as   in   museums

documentation  and  research  work.   Chong  Fu   Primary

School,  for  example, has adopted the Singapore  History

Museum.   The  School has been working closely  with  the

museum  to provide museum guide services and performances

for  special occasions.  We welcome more schools to  take

part in these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Low also suggested that our museums encourage

long-term  loans  or donations from private  collections,

and we are looking into it.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am disappointed with IDA's decision to

continue the practice of receivers of mobile phone  calls

paying  for  half the cost of mobile calls.   This  means

there  is no free incoming calls.  I raised this  subject

sometime  last  year, and I was quite  hopeful  that  the

present system, whereby the receiver of a call, in  fact,

subsidises  by  half  the cost to the  caller,  would  be

scrapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest decision fails to recognise

fundamental flaws in the current system.  Why should  the

consumer  pay  for something he did not  initiate?   This

means   consumers  have  no  control  over  their   final

billings.   Why should the consumer pay for something  he

has  no  control, such as paying for wrong calls made  to

his   number  or  unsolicited  calls  from  people   like

telemarketers?   Does this not mean that those  who  make

calls do not realise the full cost of making a call?   In

asserting  that  changing the format may not  mean  lower

cost  to  consumers,  IDA has not provided  us  with  any

evidence to back up its claim.  On the contrary,  I  have

read  a  lot of studies that have shown that the calling-party-pay system encourages more use of the handphone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, there is one minute left for

this cut.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> On the contrary, the smallest

telco,  Starhub, is providing free incoming  local  calls

till  March  next  year, and there is  a  possibility  of

extending  it  further.  One may  say,  "Why  not  switch

telco?"  But there again, we run into other problems.  If

a person is a subscriber of SingTel or M1 and he wants to

switch  to  Starhub, he cannot retain  his  phone  number

unless he pays a monthly charge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



So  he either bears the inconvenience of a new number  or

he bears the burden of additional charges.  If we realise

that  SingTel  has a 49% market share and M1  has  a  33%

market  share,  we can see that Starhub is disadvantaged,

and such a decision of IDA does not encourage the type of

competition that we would like to see and which I thought

IDA is supposed to promote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Khaw, you have 30 seconds to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> I agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that

it  is logical to make the calling party pay for the call

he or she initiates.  It is like postal service.  You pay

for the stamp when you want to send a letter.  If we were

to  start  afresh  and introduce mobile telephony  today,

then we would most likely have adopted the calling-party-pay  system.   But  having gone for the  mobile-party-pay

system,  we  would  now  need to  evaluate  the  cost  of

switching  mid-stream versus the benefits of the  switch.

Switching is not  cost free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, let me explain why the regulator opted

for the mobile-party-pay system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You do not have time to explain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, from the little answer I got,

it appears that switching is one of the problems.  But  I

just  want  to  point  out  to  the  Minister  that  many

countries  in Europe started with the other  system,  and

they had switched to calling-party-pay system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot has been said about the need to maintain

and   strengthen   social  cohesion   in   these   rather

challenging  times,  especially in a multi-racial  and  a

multi-religious country such as Singapore.  The  Minister

had previously mentioned two areas of concern: first, the

communal divide; and, second, the material divide.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>3.56 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the communal divide, many activities and

programmes  have been organised by various organisations,

such  as the CDCs, People's Association, IRCCs and  other

community  and  grassroots organisations.   However,  the

emphasis  has  mainly been targeted at understanding  and

tolerating  our racial and religious differences,  rather

than  increasing our common areas and building  upon  our

common objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visiting each other's places of worship and having a

better   understanding   of  each  other's   differences,

different cultures, different religious practices are not

enough  to  bond us as a cohesive society.   We  must  go

beyond  just being aware of our differences and insisting

on  having our own way all the time, but we must also  be

willing to accommodate one another for the common good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong social cohesion can only be achieved by

establishing more people-to-people links based on  common

interest  and  common values.  In troubled times,  people

are  more  likely to stand up and defend those whom  they

know personally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



as  friends, as team mates and as neighbours whose  homes

they have visited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister tell us what measures are

being  introduced  to  promote  better  engagement  among

Singaporeans?   Measures such as promotion  of  community

sports and mutual self-help groups that cut across ethnic

lines  would  be  some  of the measures  that  should  be

considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the material divide, the income gap is widening

in  Singapore.  The average household income ratio at the

bottom  10% has increased from 14.1 times in 1998  to  18

times  in the year 2000, and the gap is expected to widen

even further in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social stratification may result if measures are not

taken  now  to  ameliorate the effects  of  the  widening

income  gap.   One such measure is for the  promotion  of

philanthropy  and a culture where the more able  feel  an

obligation  to  help the needy and the  less  successful.

However,  the  rate of philanthropy and  volunteerism  in

Singapore is still very low.  Could the Minister tell  us

what  measures  and initiatives are being  taken  by  his

Ministry to address these concerns and issues?  Has there

been  a  significant  progress made  in  social  cohesion

amongst Singaporeans?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey on social attitudes was commissioned by

MCDS  in early 2001.  The survey results show the glowing

state   of  race  relations  and  social  cohesion  among

Singaporeans.  In fact, nine out of 10 Singaporeans  were

generally satisfied with race relations in Singapore, and

also  89%  of  Singaporeans considered  their  neighbours

helpful and friendly and could be depended upon for  help

in times of need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that a more recent survey has been

done by MCDS.  Could the Minister comment on the findings

of this latest survey?



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, my cut is

on  a  cohesive and resilient society.  This  mission  of

MCDS will get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



more  complex.  It is already very challenging by  itself

because  of  the nature of our very own multi-racial  and

multi-religious  society.  It would  be  made  even  more

sensitive   and   potentially  divisive   when   external

developments  and forces come into play.   The  war  with

Iraq and the continuing fight against terrorism, with its

Muslims and perceived Islamic connection, will make MCDS'

task more onerous and formidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to touch briefly on the Iraq crisis

and  its immediate impact on our cohesion.  Although till

early  this morning, I was still praying, like many other

Muslims and non-Muslims all over the world, for peace and

no  war, we know that in fact it was inevitable.  The  US

has  already  fired  its  first salvo.   And  the  prayer

notwithstanding, Sir, we have to deal with the  realities

of war and peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans do not want to be in the

spotlight again.  Even among Muslims generally, there  is

no  love lost for President Saddam Hussein but they  are,

nonetheless, disturbed like many millions of  other  non-Muslims,  as they worry for the innocent Iraqis  who  are

also  victims  of the situation.  We pray and  hope  that

they  will be spared a prolonged disaster.  And we, as  a

country  and a people, Muslims and non-Muslims  alike,  I

trust we rally to the call to provide humanitarian aid to

the Iraqi people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, back to MCDS, how are MCDS' efforts for better

integration taking shape, especially through IRCCs,  GROs

and VWOs?  Does the Ministry see the momentum picking up,

and  are  more ordinary citizens participating in Harmony

Circles?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassroots harmony journeys to mosques, temples and

churches  are important and must continue, but we  should

see  more  substantive  programmes organised  that  would

promote better understanding and integration.  The better

mixing  and  meeting  of hearts  and  minds  at  the  HDB

heartlands  should  be one success criterion.   There  is

room for more bridging among Singaporeans to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



bring  about  greater comfort level among neighbours,  in

particular,  through Harmony Circles.   And  I  hope  the

Minister  will share with us what is being done  in  that

direction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the war in

Iraq  has  started.  Its ramifications will be  seen  and

felt around the world in the coming days.  Singapore  may

also  be  affected.  We certainly hope that the  conflict

will   be  short  and  the  suffering  minimised  through

humanitarian efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, what should our priorities be in this

situation?   Clearly, we have to concentrate on  tackling

matters  that are within our influence because our  goals

must  be  to act in our national interest.  Economically,

we  have  to  watch carefully the impact of the  war  and

potential disruption to trade and production.  The bottom

line is the impact on our ability to attract investments,

export our goods and services so that there will be  jobs

for Singaporeans. On security, we have to up our antenna,

guard  against  potential terrorism  and  sabotage,  take

decisive  action  to  forestall and neutralise  any  such

threat  so  that  all  who live in,  work  in  and  visit

Singapore  will continue to have confidence to  do  this.

Because this again is crucial to our livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social front, Sir, we must step up all

efforts  that  promote  and  strengthen  our  racial  and

religious  harmony.  For multi-racial and multi-religious

Singapore, racial and religious harmony is not a nice-to-have quality.  It is the very glue that holds the various

parts together, allowing for not only tolerance and  give

and  take,  but  also mutual respect and mutual  support.

Under no circumstances must we let our racial harmony  be

undermined or strained, or else all Singaporeans will pay

a heavy price for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the time for Singaporeans of all races

and  religions, especially for leaders of all groups that

represent  them, to stand together and clearly articulate

the message of unity above all.  This pro-Singapore, pro-Singaporean message



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



is  a  crucial  reminder to help focus the attention  and

understanding of our people on our national interest  and

on the common interest of all Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a saying that if life throws you a

lemon,  then  make lemonade with it.  Singapore  did  not

wish for this war to happen, but it has.  And I hope that

we   can   therefore   make  use  of  the   circumstances

nevertheless  to  strengthen our  unity  and  resilience.

Beyond the current circumstances, I urge MCDS to consider

joint  leadership seminars for the leaders of the various

racial   groups   because   this   will   provide    more

opportunities in a structured form for the leaders of the

different  races  to  meet, to learn  from  one  another,

especially  to  get  to  know one  another  better.   The

strengthened  personal ties will go a  long  way  towards

enhancing unity and problem solving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge MCDS to therefore ensure that, in these

increasingly  volatile  times,  sufficient  emphasis  and

resources  continue to be given to the  strengthening  of

racial and religious harmony.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society consisting mainly of

Chinese, Malays, Indians and Eurasians, and most of  them

are  either  Buddhists, Taoists, Christians,  Muslims  or

Hindus.   Fortunately, Singapore has experienced a  great

deal  of  racial  and religious harmony in  the  last  30

years,  or so.  So are the programmes in place for racial

and   religious  harmony  amongst  our  people?   As  for

students,   I   trust   schools  and  other   educational

institutions have in place such programmes.  If so, could

the  Ministry  tell  us about these programmes?   As  for

adults  and citizens in the workforce, could the Ministry

tell us of the programmes available, if any?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the Ministry conducted research and studies on

racial  and  religious  harmony  being  improved  in  the

following cases: (a) through inter-racial marriages;  (b)

through  inter-religious marriages;  (c)  through  inter-racial and inter-religious adoption of children, if  any;

and (d) do the offsprings of these marriages, as compared

to children from one-race couple, show that they are more

tolerant of different races?  Do we have any precedent or

studies  done in other countries from which we can  learn

our  lessons?   If there are indications of children  and

other  citizens  being  more Singaporean  through  inter-racial   and/or  inter-religious  marriages   and   their

offsprings  being  likewise, should the Ministry  promote

such  marriages?   If  so,  and  if  it  is  a  necessary

enticement, should our Government consider, as  examples,

granting  of tax incentives for inter-racial  and  inter-religious  marriages  and also priorities  for  entry  to

primary  schools,  as has been done in other  situations?

If  such  measures can promote a better multi-racial  and

multi-religious  society, which Singapore  always  boasts

of,  let  us  test  it seriously, unless  of  course  the

leadership  feels  that  race should  not  be  mixed  for

whatever reasons.  Are there statistics on the number  of

inter-racial and/or inter-religious marriages  for,  say,

the last 10 years?

Boon Ann.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, in this House,

there  are  many  of us who see jobless  residents  every

week.  Sadly, some of these residents have been coming to

our meet-the-people sessions for more than a year.  I can

safely  say that, for them, it is not for want of  trying

that they cannot find jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are faced with the prospect of prolonged weakness

in  our  economy.  Many Singaporeans who helped to  build

this country and carry the economy on their backs are now

without jobs; and not employable because China and  India

have  stolen  their  lunches.  We have  always  told  our

people  that  we are not a welfare state and that  public

handouts  can be a crutch, which removes the  dignity  of

labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, our people bought that argument then because

there  was  full employment in the economy, it  would  be

easy  to  frown upon those who do not work for a  living.

However,   where  unemployment  runs  at  4.8%   of   the

population  and  rising, it would ring hollow  really  to

tell  these people to go for training and retraining,  as

if there are plenty of jobs waiting for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have said that there are more than 600,000 jobs

taken  up  by  foreigners against about  80,000  who  are

unemployed   in  Singapore.   We  can  make  these   jobs

available  and  the  unemployment in Singapore  would  be

solved.   This is not a realistic suggestion as  many  of

these  jobs  are in the unskilled sector with wages  that

cannot realistically be expected to sustain a full family

with  school-going children in Singapore.  We  have  seen

how  a  weak  economy translates into empty stomachs  and

angry  minds in a few neighbouring countries.   Now  more

than ever, we need to ensure that our social cohesion  is

not undermined by our state of the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economy weakens and to preserve our social

unity  and  bond, we must be prepared to cast our  safety

nets wider and be prepared to provide more assistance for

the  poor  and  needy.  We must be prepared to  recognise

that  what was previously a luxury 10 years ago may  well

be a necessity today.  We may not be a welfare state, but

certainly we are not a heartless society either.  We must

not  be  seen to be niggardly in extending our assistance

to  those  who  are deprived.  If we did  that,  we  will

surely  alienate our people.  We have told our people  to

sing  "Count  on Me Singapore", we should  send  a  clear

signal to tell our people that they too can count  on  us

fully in such difficult times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, my topic is on

promoting a caring and compassionate society.  Whilst  we

have  progressed to be a first world nation,  it  may  be

timely  to ask whether, as Singaporeans, we are a  caring

and  compassionate  society.  We have anecdotal  evidence

that Singaporeans generally care



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



more  for  themselves and seldom assist  or  bother  with

other  people's problems and predicament.  There are,  of

course, exceptions to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Ministry have programmes to enhance our

citizens'  response to the call for  a  more  caring  and

compassionate society?  A caring nation is one that shows

compassion  and  goodwill towards  the  lesser  fortunate

citizens and also to animals.  I trust the Ministry  will

spare  no  efforts in promoting, amongst our people,  the

need  to  be  compassionate and caring to our  poor,  our

sick, our less educated and less successful.  I hope  the

Ministry,  together with the Ministry of Education,  will

do  their  utmost  best to promote and enhance  voluntary

work  by students and adults and joining the hundreds  of

voluntary  organisations and contribute  their  time  and

energy,  besides  monetary contributions,  to  worthwhile

causes, including charitable organisations, homes for the

poor  and elderly, animal care and groups of such nature.

Perhaps, the Ministry could elaborate on the schemes that

they  have  in  place, or propose to have,  so  that  the

citizens  would know more about it and could  participate

actively in such efforts so that, as a nation, we grow to

be a more caring nation.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, some two weeks ago, I was

deeply  moved  when  I read the article  written  by  our

journalist,  Ms Chua Mui Hoong, on her fight with  breast

cancer.   Yesterday, another ST interviewer, Ms Elisabeth

Gwee,  interviewed a Mrs Katherine Chionh on her struggle

with   her  skin  disorder,  vitiligo,  also  caught   my

attention.   Recently, a young friend of mine,  aged  22,

also  contracted  breast cancer.  All of  a  sudden,  her

world  went  into a spin and so did her families.   Words

like   confusion,   anger,   fear   and   disbelief   are

understatements.  Their fight is a long and  arduous  one

and perhaps one which can sometimes get so bad and lonely

that thoughts of giving up all hopes may surface.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I salute these three women warriors who have since

conquered their illnesses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



and surfaced stronger than before.  However, I would also

want to recognise those who were behind them and who gave

them strong support when they were down so that they  can

live a life again.  We have caring Singaporeans too.  All

three  women could surface today only because  they  have

found  a  strong support group who, in the  words  of  Ms

Chua,  shared  information, thus empowering patients  and

their caregivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last 15 years, we have unbridled growth

and a very rapid pace of change, and the stress level  is

high.  At various points in time, people did help to cope

and  move  on.   The retrenched need help,  the  sandwich

generation needs help, the physically disabled or  unwell

need  help, the alcoholic or smokers need help,  and  the

list goes on.  As a responsible Government, we must reach

out to this group of people by providing some assistance,

both  financially and infrastructure-wise, to  help  them

move  on with the predicament.  We can reach out to  this

group of people, so they know that they are not alone  in

the  darkest moments of their lives.  Support groups  can

act  as  self-help  and mutual help  groups.   These  are

pressure-release valves, a stabiliser for the despondent,

and the light of hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that it is in these darkest hours

that   a   listening  ear,  a  helping   hand,   and   an

understanding smile are the balms that soothe  the  pain.

Perhaps, MCDS can tangibly assist these mutual and  self-help groups by:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) providing trained facilitators and social

workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) publicising the existence and easy

accessibility to such a group, perhaps a form of a  guide

could  be published to facilitate better access to  these

groups;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) providing some very basic start-up funds or

meeting  venues  in  different  parts  of  Singapore   to

facilitate their meeting; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) taking a proactive stand to encourage the

formation of suitable support groups for both the  client

and the patient, and the caregivers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last case, I read that Mrs Catherine Cheong

is  keen to start a support group for vitiligo sufferers.

Perhaps, MCDS could consider reaching out to her and give

her a hand to form maybe the first vitiligo support group

in Singapore.

issues,  let  us  not lose sight of the  turmoil  in  the

international arena.  We must not take safe  harbour  for

granted,  and must continuously work towards  maintaining

national peace and harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I thank Mr Charles Chong and other Members

for  raising their concerns about social cohesion, racial

harmony and our society in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also acknowledge the 98 cuts

that  MCDS  received - the most among all the Ministries.

Nevertheless,  MOS Chan Soo Sen and I will  endeavour  to

answer all the queries to the best of our abilities  and,

hopefully,  to the satisfaction of all Members  who  have

taken a keen interest in the work of our Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCDS' vision is for Singapore to be a cohesive

and  resilient society.  However, unlike Ministries  that

directly  deliver  the  end  outcomes,  such  as  a  good

education or health system, MCDS primarily plays the role

of  facilitator, enabler and catalyst.  We encourage  and

enable the individual to show resilience, the family



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



to show care and support, and the community to show inter-group  understanding  and interaction.   We  may  be  the

cheerleaders,  and  sometimes  even  the  coach  or   the

physiotherapist, but we are not the players.  The players

are each and every Singaporean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cohesive society is one that displays unity in

diversity.   We  want  to ensure we  have  strong  social

networks amongst Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players matter most. That is why they are valued

more  than  coaches or physiotherapists.  A  soccer  team

cannot  perform at its best on the pitch, if the  players

do  not  get  along off-pitch, whether because  they  let

their  different backgrounds come in the way, or  because

of  other  reasons, such as stolen girlfriends or  flying

boots.  In the same way, Singapore's ability to cope with

tough times would also be affected, if Singaporeans  from

various segments of society are not united.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has also been likened to a dish of rojak

-  many  different  pieces, each with its own distinctive

feel  and  flavour,  with the prawn  paste  binding  them

together and enhancing their taste.  The test of  a  good

rojak is in the paste.  A cohesive society is like a good

dish  of  rojak, with thick prawn paste being the  inter-group understanding, the interaction and cooperation,  as

well  as the shared values and aspirations that bind  the

various  ethnic  groups together.  Our  challenge  is  to

ensure  that  we have the right paste, or the appropriate

connectors  that can only be developed through  enlarging

our common space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social cohesion is about building social capital.

Social  capital  refers to the social  trust,  norms  and

networks  that  people can draw upon for mutual  benefit.

In  other  words,  people getting  together  and  growing

comfortable  with one another, eg, through dialogues  and

networking, as well as working and interacting on  common

projects.   In this manner, we build social  capital  and

not  allow social exclusion to take place.  If any  group

feels  that it does not belong, and feels excluded,  then

our rich social tapestry is at risk.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as Mr Charles Chong has said, social cohesion

must go beyond racial and religious harmony, and includes

collaboration   between  various  groups,   eg,   between

religious  and secular groups, between the rich  and  the

poor, between the young and the old, and between citizens

and  foreigners.    We want to create  opportunities  for

such  groups to interact in all aspects of life, such  as

through   the  arts,  culture,  sports  and  recreational

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cohesive society should also go beyond mere talk

to  action.  Volunteerism, philanthropy and mutual  self-help  groups can enable people to connect, cooperate  and

build  bridges  across social divides.  These  activities

enable  social  groups  to  interact  and  affirm  common

values,  such  as  helping the  less  fortunate.   Common

values  that all groups can uphold are a vital  dimension

of  the  common space.  We also want more of the  support

groups that Miss Penny Low talked about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is widely believed that one test for social

cohesion  in Singapore is the war on Iraq, which  started

this  morning.   Both Mayor Zainul and  Mayor  Heng  have

touched upon this.  As reported in the newspapers,  there

is  some  feeling against the war, and this feeling  cuts

across racial and religious groups, even though there  is

strong support for the Government's stand as rational and

in  Singapore's interest.  Such variations in  views  are

inevitable.  They are found even in the US.  Whatever our

personal views, I am confident that we will maintain  our

shared  perspectives  as Singaporeans.   We  have  passed

previous tests, and I am confident we will pass this one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst a cohesive society is one that displays unity

in diversity, a resilient society is one that shows unity

in  adversity.   Singapore has had  a  relatively  smooth

ride,  although a carefully managed one, in the  past  25

years.   But  now  we  are  entering  into  a  much  more

competitive,  volatile  and uncertain  environment,  both

economically as well as geo-politically.  The ability  to

recover



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



quickly from setbacks, whether from the loss of a job, of

loved  ones,  or  from something like the  shock  of  the

Jemaah   Islamiyah  arrests,  these  are  tests  of   our

resilience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be able to bounce back from misfortune and

cope positively with challenges.  In fact, we must tackle

challenges  head-on.   To  enable  this,  MCDS   promotes

individual  resilience, family resilience  and  community

resilience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, MCDS promotes personal

responsibility  and self-reliance.  We  provide  a  basic

social  safety  net to look after the well-being  of  the

socially disadvantaged.  This net will help them build up

their  self-esteem, so that they can get  back  on  their

feet  as  much as possible.  A good example of individual

resilience is the story of Elim Chew, highlighted in  the

newspapers  last  week.   She  left  school  early,   but

continued her education in the school of hard knocks, and

turned   out   as  an  extremely  successful   streetwear

retailer.   A firm believer in an attitude of  gratitude,

she even gives half her income to community causes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the family level, we help create a social

environment  that  is  conducive to having  children  and

raising  families.   We help facilitate  programmes  that

strengthen families, so that they can continue to be  the

first  line of care and support for the individual.   The

State can provide financial support to needy individuals,

but  it  can never replace the emotional care and  social

support  that  only  family members  can  give.   A  good

example  of family resilience is the story of Kenny  Goh.

His  company, Ken-Air, may have collapsed, but his family

ties have strengthened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, we promote the principle of

"Many  Helping  Hands"  and enable communities  to  solve

their  problems together.   The haves should help  bridge

the  social divide by helping the have-nots.   More  than

that,  there  should  be more collaboration  between  and

within groups.  Community activities nurture human bonds,

mutual support and social networks, which neither the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



State  nor  the  market can provide.  A good  example  of

community resilience is the Seniors Befrienders programme

run  by the Lions Befrienders Service Association.  Quite

a  number  of the befrienders, who provide meal  delivery

and  errand  running,  among other  things,  are  elderly

themselves.  In fact, 23 befrienders are 80 years old  or

older.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mr Charles Chong, Mr Zainul

Abidin  and other Members that we must continue to  forge

racial  and  religious harmony.  Last  year,  I  reported

findings  from a benchmark Survey on the Social Attitudes

of  Singaporeans conducted by MCDS in 2001.  The findings

were  very  positive.  Nine out of 10  Singaporeans  were

satisfied  with  race and religious  group  relations  in

Singapore.  However, the 2001 survey was conducted before

the  September  11 terrorist attacks in the  US  and  the

arrest  of  JI  members  in Singapore  in  January  2002.

Hence,  I  said  that  my Ministry  would  be  conducting

another survey in 2002, to see if the views have changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has asked for an update on the

second  survey.  I am very happy to report that,  despite

the  two key events in the one-year interval, there  have

been  no  significant  changes in satisfaction  with  the

current  state  of racial and religious group  relations.

Nine out of 10 Singaporeans continue to be satisfied with

race  relations, but with small differences, if the  data

is  analysed by race: Chinese community, 88%, Malays 91%,

and Indians 93%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second survey also found that almost all

Singaporeans,  99%, were comfortable  with  the  idea  of

allowing  their children to play with children  of  other

races.  96% of Singaporeans also thought that it was good

to  have  people of different races living  in  the  same

neighbourhood.   There  were no  significant  differences

between the races in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the more personal level, we found that the

proportion  of Singaporeans who had close  friends  of  a

different race rose significantly, from 70% in 2001 to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>

76% in 2002.  In fact, a much higher proportion of Malays

indicated  that they have close friends of another  race,

from 71% in 2001 to 86% in 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these findings speak well of the current racial

and religious group relations.  It suggests that there is

a  certain amount of social resilience among Singaporeans

in  general,  a social resilience that provides  a  sound

foundation  for  safeguarding and  enhancing  racial  and

religious  group relations in Singapore, despite  shocks,

such as terrorism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one note of concern is that, unlike 2001,

in  2002  we  found that only six out of 10  Singaporeans

with  tertiary education were satisfied with current race

and  religious group relations.  This might be due  to  a

greater  sensitivity to the global terrorist  threat,  as

well   as   perhaps  increasing  expectations   of   what

constitute good racial and religious group relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the basic characteristics of Singaporean

life  is  the  presence  of, and the  continued  need  to

enhance our common space.  Our common space reflects what

makes  us  uniquely  Singaporean,  while  embracing   the

diverse cultures and faiths that we come from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the common space allows for the

diversity  to  flourish primarily because what  brings  a

diverse  people  to the common space are the  values  and

aspirations  that define us all as Singaporeans.  Without

this  shared aspiration and the common values that define

us,  there will be no Singapore. But how the common space

grows  depends  largely on how the different  communities

see  the  value  in  preserving  a  uniquely  Singaporean

identity.  Hence, we need to continuously  encourage  the

building   of  ties  across  all  groups,  in  order   to

demonstrate this value to all Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us would have experienced the idea of being

in  a common space one way or the other as part of living

in Singapore and being Singaporean at heart.  Let me cite

some everyday examples.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports is a universal activity and passion for

Singaporeans,  regardless  of  age,  gender,   race   and

religion.  During the last World Cup finals, big  screens

were  set  up at a few public areas, and even  hospitals,

for  people to enjoy the match together.  You could  even

find  crowds  sitting or standing outside  shops  selling

television  sets,  watching soccer together.   And  every

time  a  goal was scored, they would cheer together,  and

every  time the referee made a bad call, they would  jeer

him together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also not many countries where you can find

temples, mosques and churches peacefully co-existing next

to one another.  Just look at our Chinatown, Little India

or Geylang East.  We know of several places of worship in

Singapore   built  with  generous  donations   from   all

Singaporeans,  regardless  of  race  or  religion.    For

example,  Dr  Theyvendran, who oversaw the renovation  of

the Sri Senpaga Vinayagar Temple in Ceylon Road, told  me

that  the  temple  received donations from  Muslims,  and

involved Chinese architects in its design.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we respect diversity within the common space,

so  that all can be comfortable and feel at home  in  it.

Diversity goes beyond race and religion. The common space

includes  diverse  groups, with different  interests  and

needs.  Examples include environmentalists,  arts  groups

and  sports enthusiasts.  In other words, it is  a  space

that all Singaporeans have a stake in, no matter what  we

are  and  what  our  interests  are.   Common  space   is

underpinned by our shared values, such as our  belief  in

nurturing  strong families, meritocracy,  multi-racialism

and a corrupt-free Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some are concerned that by enlarging the common

space,  our  private  values and ways  of  life  will  be

threatened.  It is not a zero-sum game. While we have our

private  needs  and preferences, we can  accommodate  and

appreciate others who are different within



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



the  common space. What we do in our private space should

not  make  it  harder  to  mingle and  understand  others

outside  of  our belief systems. Cultural  and  religious

values,  when  practised in the spirit  intended,  should

help to enrich and enlarge the common space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Mr Charles Chong and Mr Zainul Abidin have

pointed  out,  as  a society, we need  to  find  ways  to

meaningfully   engage   one   another,   negotiate    our

differences    and   move   forward.    The    Grassroots

Organisations  (GROs),  Inter-Racial  Confidence  Circles

(IRCCs) and Harmony Circles are some of these platforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRCCs and Harmony Circles are avenues to expand the

common  space.  The IRCCs are in a good position to  help

Singaporeans  make  sense  of events  that  affect  their

lives.  The  IRCCs comprise a diverse group  of  national

leaders from the local community.  Currently, the members

comprise 23% Malays and 16% are Indians.  Half are people

from outside the grassroots network, including community,

school and religious leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the IRCCs, community and religious leaders

form friendships and better understand one another. Armed

with a good understanding of other communities as well as

their  own communities, the IRCC members are in a  better

position  to  help  their own communities  and  followers

navigate through sensitive or difficult issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendships and understanding built up will also

help  manage the ground reactions during times of crisis.

While  some people doubt the value of visiting  religious

places of worship, IRCC members told me that this is like

visiting  someone in his own home.  It really breaks  the

ice among the members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRCCs also add value to grassroots organisations by

giving  suggestions on how their activities can  be  more

inclusive.   For example, avoiding evening activities  on

Thursday nights, as Muslims tend to congregate in mosques

at those times for extended prayers.  And this culminates

with the Friday afternoon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



prayer  session.  Many Hindus, for  example,   visit  the

temple on Friday evenings, just as many Christians go  to

church  on Sunday mornings. Besides playing this advisory

role,  IRCCs  also  reach  out to promote  cross-cultural

activities  that  attract  all races  and  religions  and

engage in public education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Bishan-Toa Payoh North IRCC,

together  with  five  religious  groups  and  the  Inter-Religious  Organisation,  reached  many  residents  in  a

public  education  effort called  "Celebrating  New  Year

through  Community  Bonding".  Some  35,000  participants

turned  up at the Carnival last weekend on 15th and  16th

March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, Fengshan IRCC had a Community

Quiz  targeted at young people from primary and secondary

schools,  and  the voluntary sector.  The  quiz  promoted

greater  awareness and understanding of  ethnic  cultures

among school students.  The feedback from the schools was

very  positive.  Fengshan IRCC, together with South  East

CDC,  is  now  thinking of developing a puzzle  book  for

younger children in the South East District.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next phase, IRCCs will expand their efforts

to get their members more actively engaged.  The National

Steering  Committee on IRCCs will be putting  together  a

resource  guide for IRCC members to help  them  do  their

work.   The Committee is also planning more training  for

IRCC members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further support such bottom-up community

initiatives, my Ministry will give more than $80,000  for

four  community projects under the pilot  phase  for  the

Community  Harmony  Grants  Scheme.   Let  me  give   two

examples of the approved projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Religious Organisation will develop an

inter-faith  manual  to  guide community  and  grassroots

groups  who  wish  to  organise more inclusive  community

events  and activities that would cater to the  needs  of

Singaporeans of various faiths.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Social Service Centre in Central Singapore

CDC  will be starting a course for frontline staff,  such

as  nurses  and social workers, to enable them to  better

appreciate ethnic differences and serve their clients  of

different races more effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just two examples. We would, of course,

be  very  happy  to  hear new ideas from  any  Member  of

Parliament or member of the public on activities that can

bring about better inter-group understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from facilitating inter-racial and inter-religious activities, the Government has also worked with

religious  groups to reaffirm Singapore's  commitment  to

fundamental principles that have held Singapore  together

as a multi-religious society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Community Development and

Sports,  Mr  Chan Soo Sen, has been leading this  effort.

His  working committee has held many dialogues with  main

religious  groups  and  achieved  a  consensus   on   the

Declaration  on Religious Harmony.  He will be  ready  to

share about the Declaration soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one concrete way of strengthening ties and

bonds  in our society and bridging social divides  is  to

promote   volunteerism  and  philanthropy.   Philanthropy

refers   to  the  giving  of  money  and  resources   for

charitable  purposes.  It comes from the Greek  word  for

"love  for  mankind".  This sense of giving back  to  the

community  cuts across all boundaries, be it class,  age,

gender, race or religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a strong charitable culture in

Singapore.  Foundations, clan associations and  religious

and  community groups, work tirelessly to raise funds for

various  causes.   Most  people would  expect  charitable

giving  to fall in bad times.  But the numbers show  that

even  in bad times, the haves are doing more to help  the

have-nots.  Donations to Institutions of Public Character

rose every year from $157 million in 1995 to $381 million

in 2001, despite the financial crisis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



in  1997  and the economic downturn in 2001.   Similarly,

our  national  volunteerism rate increased from  9.3%  in

2000 to 14.9% last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have the 2002 figures yet, but recent fund-raisers such as the President's Challenge and the Ren Ci

Hospital  Charity Show have received overwhelming  public

support.   The  donations  to the  President's  Challenge

increased  50% from $4.1 million in 2001 to $6.3  million

in  2002.  The Community Chest, which raised $37  million

in  FY  2001, expects to meet its fund-raising target  of

$40  million  in  FY 2002.  All this shows  that  we  are

indeed a caring, cohesive and compassionate society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philanthropic activities in Singapore are not new.

But  we  need more modern-day versions of Lee Kong Chian,

Govindasamy  Pillai, CJP Paglar and  Mohammed  Eunos  Bin

Abdullah - people who had a passion and did good for  the

community.  We should preserve the spirit of philanthropy

and  broaden  its  base.  Philanthropy is  about  "giving

back"  to society.  It provides an important channel  for

the  more  successful to help others and  to  better  our

society.  It is an important bridge, nurturing people  in

a   world   of  increasing  income  inequality.   Besides

bringing  people together, philanthropic  activities  are

critical  in  complementing the Government  in  providing

financial support for social causes.  There is  room  for

more philanthropists in Singapore.  So I fully agree with

Mr  Charles  Chong that more needs to be done to  promote

philanthropy in Singapore as a way of bridging the income

divide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excellent example of a modern-day philanthropic

organisation in Singapore is the Tsao Foundation.  It  is

guided  by  the vision of their founder, Mrs Tsao  Ng  Yu

Shun,  who was 86 years young when it was first chartered

in 1993.  She wanted to do something about the challenges

of  growing old.  Tsao Foundation became one of  the  few

philanthropic   organisations  in  Asia   that   provides

services rather than grants.  The Foundation carries  out

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



wide  range  of  programmes, including a  community-based

healthcare  programme, which runs a  domiciliary  medical

clinic service, and a community care management service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, my Ministry will provide more resources to

the  National  Volunteer Centre to promote  philanthropy.

The   National   Volunteer  Centre   currently   promotes

volunteerism as a way of life. Promoting philanthropy has

good   synergy  with  volunteerism,  as  both   call   on

Singaporeans to give of their time, talent and resources,

to make a difference to the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned earlier, Singaporeans donate

generously.   They do so as they trust and are  confident

that  the  charities will do the right thing.  We  should

not  take  this trust for granted.  Charities  should  be

prepared to show that the donations are spent wisely, and

go towards programmes that make a difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges we face go beyond encouraging charity

and  keeping faith with the donors.  Philanthropy has  to

be  increasingly  strategic,  and  directed  at  emerging

social  needs. Money raised should be invested  for  good

results.  Some social problems need to be tackled via the

root  causes.   For  those who  can  be  helped  to  help

themselves, we should empower them, rather than provide a

crutch.  For those who need lifelong support, there  must

be  a safety net to protect them. We need to channel  our

passion and resources strategically to tackle the  social

challenges that we face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developed countries, donors, especially rich

philanthropists  and foundations, are  moving  towards  a

model of social investment.  They want to be involved  in

enterprising,  outcome-driven  programmes.   They  donate

funds, share expertise with non-profit agencies, and take

an  interest in the programmes.  For example,  the  Robin

Hood  Foundation  was set up by an investment  banker  to

raise funds and partner organisations to fight poverty in

New York.  Programmes are regularly reviewed for results,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



the   foundation  also  sources  for  expertise  to  help

programmes do better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to find new ways of getting the best social

value  from the charity dollar. We need to find  ways  of

encouraging  new  philanthropists, who  expect  and  want

greater involvement for the funds they donate, to come to

the  fore.  Our infrastructure has to support the  growth

of  more foundations and philanthropists, and enable  our

charities to run the distance. Corporations can add value

by   partnering   non-profit   organisations   in   their

programmes, and exercise social responsibility. They will

also  infuse  corporate  expertise  into  the  non-profit

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another concrete example of community self-help

is  social entrepreneurship.  Social entrepreneurship  is

about  bringing business practices or innovation to solve

social problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is the recently-established Food from

the  Heart  programme, which delivers unsold  bread  from

bakeries  across  the island to charity  homes.   It  was

initiated by a couple, who used their logistics expertise

and  implemented  a mobile tracking system.  The  system,

accessed by handphones, coordinates the times and  routes

volunteers take to transport bread and pastries  to  some

35  homes.  A social enterprise is essentially a business

with a social mission, not merely commercial objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Voluntary Welfare Organisations like MINDS,

Teen  Challenge  and  the Singapore  Association  of  the

Visually   Handicapped   also  have   humble   commercial

activities or what may be termed as social enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social enterprises are becoming more sophisticated.

One  example  is the Industrial Services and  Cooperative

Society, commonly known as ISCOS, set up in 1989, to help

discharged inmates re-integrate into society through work

rehabilitation.   It  promotes self-esteem  and  economic

independence   by   developing  businesses   to   provide

employment  opportunities.  ISCOS  is  financially  self-sufficient, and profitable with healthy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



revenue.   Another example is the Development of  Economy

for  Women  Credit  Cooperative Ltd, or  DEW,  which  has

assisted   1,500  women  since  1981  to  save   together

regularly and lend to one another from the savings  at  a

reasonable  rate  of  interest.  DEW members  assist  one

another  through  mutual  cooperation.   To  foster   and

support  emerging social enterprises,  MCDS  will,  as  a

start,  establish a $2 million Social Enterprise Fund  in

FY03.    The  fund  will provide some capital  to  social

entrepreneurs seeking to invest in start-up  projects  or

to scale-up fledgling social enterprises.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann made some comments on social

assistance  but  I  will address them  later  when  other

Members  speaking  on  the same  topic  have  made  their

points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low spoke about encouraging the formation

of support groups.  I agree with her and I am glad to see

support  groups  springing up in Singapore.   Members  of

such   groups   give   one  another  emotional   support,

information  and  other  resources.   Many  are  run   by

volunteers.    They  exemplify  the  spirit   of   active

citizenry and self-help.  There are many such groups that

we may not know about.  Allow me to highlight a few.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer Story.com was founded by Lee Soh Hong to

share  her  experience in dealing with  cancer  and  help

patients  and  their  families face  the  battle  against

cancer.   Another example is the Amputees Caring Together

(ACT)  Club  at the Alexandra Hospital which was  started

last year.  The Club brings together people who have lost

their  limbs  and are struggling to cope with  the  loss.

The   Club   is   an   initiative   of   the   Hospital's

Rehabilitation Department and its key organiser, Ng  Hwee

Hian,  is a physiotherapist.  A support group was  formed

to  help the amputees talk through their fears, and  help

them and their families cope so that they can live normal

lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Volunteer Centre supports such support

groups as well as volunteer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



hosting organisations by providing start-up grants of  up

to  $50,000  on a co-funding basis.  The Centre  provides

information  which people sector groups find useful,  for

example,  on  how to start an organisation  or  go  about

getting  fund-raising permits.  It also gives advice  and

training  on  volunteer recruitment  and  management  and

facilitates  volunteer recruitment through  its  website,

and through its partners such as companies.  The National

Volunteer  Centre  currently  has  a  list  of  volunteer

hosting  organisations on its website, including  support

groups.  It intends to expand the listing so that  it  is

more  comprehensive.  I also urge more  established  VWOs

and  people  sector  organisations to take  such  support

groups  under their wings, to use their premises  and  so

on,  in the spirit of people sector partnership.   So  to

the  lady  that  Miss  Penny Low has mentioned,  I  would

encourage her to approach the NVC and I am sure we can do

something to help her start a new support group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ultimately, Singaporeans must want to be in such

groups.   As  mentioned by Miss Penny Low, Straits  Times

journalist,  Ms Chua Mui Hoong, who recently  shared  the

story of her battle with cancer, recounted in her article

how  she  found comfort in support groups in the  US  but

felt  that those with cancer in Singapore tended to  keep

to  themselves.   Singaporeans  need  to  learn  to  come

together.  This is what social capital is about: building

networks of trust for mutual benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan has also raised the point

about  whether  or not we want to encourage  inter-racial

marriages  and  the adoption of children  from  different

racial  groups.   Sir, this is a personal  decision.   We

support  marriages.  MCDS is pro-marriage and pro-family,

but  ultimately groups will have to decide  what  is  the

best  outcome  for themselves.  Currently, there  are  no

studies  that  we know of to show that marriages  between

two  people  of  different races  would  promote  greater

understanding.   I  can  speak  from  my   own   personal

experience  for my wife is not a Malay.  I  think  it  is

difficult to say whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



or not my son will be more tolerant, or more integrative,

because  it  would depend upon the values of the  parents

and  not  their racial backgrounds.  At the same time,  I

would  like to assure Mr Mohan that we are serious  about

integration  and about the need to promote a more  caring

society.   But that seriousness need not be reflected  in

our  willingness  to encourage such inter-racial  unions.

This  is  ultimately up to each individual to decide  who

should their partner be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also has said that we should

promote  more  schemes to promote compassionate  feelings

towards the poor and the needy among our school children.

As  I  understand it, MOE has a programme to promote such

activities  within the schools and I will not touch  upon

that.  But, at the more general level, I have given  some

examples  on  some of the things that  we  have  done  to

achieve  their objectives.  A lot is being done  by  MCDS

and  its  partners.  I will be most happy to  provide  Mr

Mohan with some of the details of these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I have outlined MCDS' programmes that

will  help  to build our cohesiveness as a society.   But

ultimately,  the  choice is ours.  If  every  Singaporean

sees   the  value  in  persevering  and  continuing  this

experiment called Singapore, then our efforts will not be

in  vain.  Sir, I am optimistic about Singapore's  future

as  a  nation.  Under all that bellyaching and complaints

that  we  hear at our meet-the-people sessions and  other

meetings, lies a strong spirit of wanting to see  through

these difficult times together as a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It warms my heart to see one of my staff, a Chinese

Singaporean,  stopping her car at the top  of  the  hill,

where  MCDS  is located, in order to give a  ride  to  an

elderly  Malay Singaporean man down the hill.  The  basic

human  instinct  to  help  a  fellow  man  is  alive   in

Singapore.   My feeling is that even those who  criticise

do so because they care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Mr Speaker, I am confident that the choice

that  the Old Guard made in 1965, in taking the  leap  of

faith to be on our own, with a vision of a peaceful and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



progressive  nation  that offers  opportunities  to  all,

regardless  of race, language or religion, will  continue

to  be supported and built upon further by generations to

come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have addressed most of the questions, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, many of our disabled are

capable  of  making  valuable  contributions  to  society

should  they  be given the opportunity to  achieve  their

full  potential  and  assistance  to  live  and  function

independently.  Could the Minister tell us  what  support

programmes  and  new  initiatives his  Ministry  will  be

providing   to   disabled  Singaporeans,  especially   to

children  with  special needs?  Sir,  it  is  the  stated

objective  of  the  Government  that  mainstream   public

transportation   system   be  made   progressively   more

accessible to the disabled.  Could the Minister  tell  us

how  successful  his  Ministry has been  in  getting  the

Ministry  of Transport and public transport companies  to

make  public  transportation, especially the buses,  more

disabled-friendly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group that should not be overlooked is our

disabled  sportsmen and sportswomen.  Could the  Minister

tell  us  how much support his Ministry will be providing

through the Singapore Sports Council to the disabled  and

whether  he would consider implementing an incentive  and

reward scheme for disabled sportsmen and sportswomen  who

win  medals at international competitions similar to  the

scheme for our able-bodied athletes?



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing  me  to  speak on this topic.  Like  Mr  Charles

Chong  and many others, under various Ministries we  have

already raised this issue on the disabled.  Today,  I  am

here  to again talk about the disabled and children  with

special needs, but I am parking this right now under  the

Ministry  of Community Development and Sports because  it

is  my hope that the ownership to look at the whole issue

in  an integrated manner will be taken on by the Ministry

so that we can have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



more  integrated approach to issues of the disabled,  and

this includes Ministry of Manpower for job opportunities,

Ministry  of  Transport for better  equipped  buses,  and

accessibility to buildings where the Ministry of National

Development   is  concerned.   I  think   there   is   an

opportunity  here  as  the IMC on Ageing  has  filed  its

report and, with much less work and fewer resources,  one

can  piggy-back ride on that report to look at the issues

related  to  people with disabilities in Singapore.   For

far  too long they have fallen between the cracks, caught

up  in  the bureaucracy, or in silo minds.  This is quite

similar  to  the  crow  situation  that  Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin

mentioned  yesterday, depending on where the crow  lands,

that  is, the Ministry that picks up the issue where  the

disabled are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testimony to how this mindset has played out on the

ground  is evident, if I can give an example.  Imagine  a

disabled person in a wheel-chair coming out of the MRT  - it has to be the North East Line because that is the only

one  right  now  with disabled-friendly  features  -  and

getting to the bus-stop but got stuck because there is no

bus.   A friendly taxi driver picks him up and sends  him

to  a  shopping  complex, but this is a shopping  complex

where the BCA guidelines are not mandatory and perhaps it

does not have a ramp for the person to get in.  So we are

stuck again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this has gone on for far too long and it is

my  appeal  that the Ministry will take the ownership  to

get  representatives  from different  Ministries  to  get

together to look at this issue from the beginning to  the

end.  Even a simple thing like finding a Braille greeting

card is tough in Singapore.  So we have small issues  and

large issues and hopefully we will not have to come to  a

stage  where  we spend $78 million later to retrofit  all

the MRT stations.  It is my hope that this will come true

and  it can begin with a demographic profile study of the

people with disabilities in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to add to what the two hon. Members

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



just mentioned regarding the issue of transport needs.  I

feel  very strongly, Sir, that this issue should  rightly

be a transport issue and not a welfare issue.  What is my

context  for saying so?  We heard earlier today  in  this

House how MOE is providing funding and other support  for

special  education.   MOH is also helping  nursing  homes

managed by VWOs meet their financial requirements besides

other   forms  of  assistance.   In  other   words,   the

educational needs of children with disabilities  and  the

nursing  care  of  older adults are not seen  as  welfare

concerns  and,  therefore,  the  responsibility  of  MCDS

alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the public transport needs of people with

disabilities  should not be so regarded.   However,  Sir,

since  my cut was diverted from the MOT line to the  MCDS

line I shall now flag my question to the Minister on  the

same  lines as my colleagues earlier on.  So, apart  from

the  measures by MOT and LTA to make MRT and LRT stations

and  trains disabled-friendly, what other steps have been

and  will  be taken to maximise opportunities for  people

with  disabilities to utilise public transport, including

taxis, for schooling, employment, social and recreational

purposes?   Sir, in resolving the disabilities' transport

issue  between  the  relevant  authorities,  I  earnestly

request that the gap between goodwill and political  will

be  bridged - since the Minister has mentioned  bridge  a

number  of  times - to avoid any sense of  ill-will  from

emerging later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, one of the most

dreaded  diseases  is  mental illness.   Mental  diseases

cause  loss  of enthusiasm to live and affect  the  self-esteem  of  persons affected.  Human beings are generally

reluctant    to   associate   themselves   with    mental

institutions and mentally handicapped people.  There is a

phobia  of sorts, and unless you have a family member  or

close friend or relative hospitalised there, you try  and

avoid  such institutions.  There is generally,  wittingly

or  unwittingly,  stigmatisation of mentally  handicapped

people in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



society.   This must be looked at seriously and  remedial

measures taken.  What can the Ministry and all of  us  do

to  try and de-stigmatise mental illness and take care of

the  mentally handicapped?  Our Government does care  for

this, but can do more, I believe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Dr Siegmund Freud's day, one may argue that

scientific  advances made in psychiatry, mental  disorder

and  mentally handicapped research have not been so  far-reaching that we now understand fully how the mind really

works,  how mental problems arise and what the cures  are

for   mental   illnesses,   be   it   manic   depression,

schizophrenia or any other mental illness.   The  various

psychiatric  medicines  available  today,  for   example,

Lithium,  Proziac,  Respadol, etc,  and  ECT  doses,  ie,

electrical doses to the brains, have reduced the  problem

of  psychiatry compared to the 1950s.  Equally  important

would  be  the care and concern shown by the  psychiatric

patient's family members, relatives and friends  and  the

community as a whole.  What are the measures taken,  Sir,

by  the Ministry to educate our people on psychiatry  and

the  mentally handicapped and how do we adopt  programmes

to   help   society   to  be  more  knowledgeable   about

psychiatric illness and bring about de-stigmatisation  of

mental  illness  in  our  society?   We  should  try  and

institutionalise  psychiatric  and  mentally  handicapped

support  groups, have websites and promote organisations,

either voluntary or Government-sponsored, and I hope  our

Singaporeans would go the extra mile to do more  for  the

mentally handicapped.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I agree with

Mr  Charles  Chong, Ms Braema Mathi and Mr Chandra  Mohan

that  what we do to help people with disabilities  is  an

important  marker for our maturity as a  caring  society.

So  I  am  pleased  to  announce that  my  Ministry  will

strengthen our disability programmes.  Over the next five

years,  we will spend $60 million more on programmes  for

the disabled.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, our programmes will focus on early

intervention to give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



children  with disabilities the best chance to lead  life

as  independently as possible.  With early  intervention,

we  can  improve the number of disabled children who  can

benefit  from mainstream schooling.  Specialists  at  KKH

and    NUH   estimate   that   with   appropriate   early

intervention,  up  to 80% of children with  developmental

problems  would  be  able to attend  normal  schools  and

subsequently  lead  independent adult lives  compared  to

about  a  third  today.  Those who  cannot  benefit  from

mainstream schooling will have Special Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 300 children aged 0-6 years are already

benefiting from early intervention programmes for infants

and  children.  Take the example of Matthew (not his real

name),  who  suffers from ataxia, a degenerative  nervous

tissue  condition,  and delayed gross motor  development.

Under  the  Asian  Women  Welfare  Association's  Special

School's  early  intervention programme,  he  had  weekly

therapy   and   progressed  well  enough  to   attend   a

kindergarten  class  at  the  PAP  Community   Foundation

Education Centre.  Now 7 years old, he is in Primary  One

in a mainstream school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From April this year, my Ministry will co-fund these

programmes with NCSS to reach more children like Matthew.

There  are  currently  three centres  funded  by  MOE  to

provide early intervention for infants and children.   We

will  now  fund  these, and plan to  set  up  three  more

centres, catering to at least another 150 children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, my Ministry is working with

childcare  centres to take in children with  disabilities

under   the   integrated   childcare   programme.    This

developmental programme enables these children to  attend

the  same childcare centres as non-disabled children  and

interact with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you the example of a girl named Lisa

(not  her  real name), a child who had mild developmental

disabilities  and  attended  the  Presbyterian  Community

Services  integrated childcare programme.  Lisa responded

well to the integrated childcare programme and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



made  great  improvements  in  communicating  with  other

children  and  her teachers.  She has since  gone  on  to

Primary  One, in a mainstream school, and can  now  speak

both  in  English  and  Mandarin.  With  greater  funding

support,  we hope to see more children like Lisa  succeed

in  getting  a  mainstream  education  because  of  early

intervention.   Six centres will provide  places  for  60

disabled children this year.  We plan to expand  this  to

provide  places for 250 disabled children over  the  next

five  years.  More places can be considered if  there  is

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any other person, a disabled person wants to be

gainfully employed, self-reliant and a part of mainstream

life.   To  this  end,  we  will work  with  partners  to

identify  more  jobs and training needs of  persons  with

disabilities.   We  want  to see  more  employers  coming

forward  and  giving  the  disabled  a  chance  to  prove

themselves.   A  company like Trusted Hub,  for  example,

which  deals  in high end digital data storage  solutions

for  office documents, makes the effort to hire  disabled

persons.   They  now  make  up  more  than  70%  of   its

workforce.   We  will  step up efforts  to  raise  public

awareness and correct negative attitudes towards  persons

with disabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistive Technology (AT) can improve the

productivity of persons with disabilities and  facilitate

their  learning  and employment.  The  use  of  Assistive

Technology  is  still  sporadic  today  as  much  of  the

equipment is imported and costly, and so out of reach  to

many  of those who could benefit from it.  To ensure that

disabled   persons  can  afford  and  access  appropriate

enabling   technology,  we  will  set  up  an   Assistive

Technology Fund to provide grants to needy individuals to

co-pay for assistive technology that could enable them to

learn or gain employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give you one example, Sir. The fund

will  help more Singaporeans with disabilities to  manage

their  tasks  expected in the school  or  the  workplace.

Take Ms Lim Lin Li, as an example.  A graduate of Nanyang

Polytechnic in 2001 with a Diploma in Accountancy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



Taxation,  she  is  confined to a  wheelchair  due  to  a

weakening of muscles in her limbs.  She is now working as

an  accounts assistant with the Salvation Army  -  thanks

to  the  special  keyboard and numeric pad  for  PC  work

provided by the Society for the Physically Disabled.  So,

by  the  use  of AT, she is able to work like  any  other

individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the technology alone is not enough. We need

partners  in  the  private and  people  sectors  to  come

forward  and  help  users get the most  of  this  scheme.

Today,  a  number of VWOs are already providing assistive

technology  support  to  their  clients.   They  will  be

engaged to help assess their clients' needs, acquire  the

equipment, train and provide the necessary support to the

users.   My Ministry is still working out the details  of

the scheme which will be released in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has not neglected caregivers of the

disabled.  We are working with NCSS to set up a  one-stop

information and referral centre to help caregivers of the

disabled find the right information, advice and services.

We  will  also  set up Special Student Care  Centres  for

children  with  disabilities while their parents  are  at

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Ms Braema that we need to give

the disabled a helping hand to be part of the mainstream.

The measures I have just outlined will help achieve this.

The  IMC  on the Ageing Population already has its  hands

full  dealing  with  the issues on the  elderly,  and  we

should  let it focus on these efforts.  However, some  of

the   initiatives  for  the  elderly  also  benefit   the

disabled,  eg,  the  work on barrier-free  access.   Over

time, we will see improvements in the situation for  both

the elderly and the disabled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong, Ms Braema and Prof. Ngiam have all

raised  important issues on the transport needs  for  the

disabled.   The  problem of an accessible  transportation

system for persons with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



disabilities  is  not  new.  The  NCSS  has  a  Transport

Financial  Assistance Scheme to help  needy  people  with

disabilities attending approved programmes with MRT,  bus

and  taxi subsidies.  Taxi subsidies are meant for  those

who cannot take public transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary welfare organisations have put two

other  schemes  in place to help those  who  cannot  take

public transport:  there is the contract bus service  for

the   ambulant   but   who  need  a   helper,   eg,   the

intellectually  disabled  and those  with  neuro-muscular

disabilities.   The  Adapted  Vehicle  Transport  Service

(AVTS)  is  for  those  with severe ambulatory  problems,

mostly the wheelchair bound.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCSS spends a total of $1.9 million each year on

these transport schemes for the disabled.  Concerned with

the high cost of AVTS and the long-term sustainability of

the  Transport  Fund, the NCSS formed a Work  Group  with

representatives from MCDS, MOT and LTA in 2000 to  review

transport  options for disabled persons.  The Work  Group

has  studied  various  systems  overseas  and  considered

various  models.   It has recommended a  centralised  and

dedicated  transport  service for the  wheelchair  bound,

including  people with disabilities and the elderly.   My

Ministry  will review this proposal with the Ministry  of

Transport.     As  the  Work  Group's  proposal   implies

considerable cost, there is a need to further  study  how

the  objectives  can be more efficiently and  effectively

implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that the responsibility for

transportation for the disabled cannot lie with the  NCSS

alone.  The schemes by the VWOs target their clients  and

not   the   general   disabled  or  elderly   population.

Furthermore,  the  NCSS  has  no  expertise  to   develop

sustainable  transport  solutions  for  the  elderly  and

people with disabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more disabled and elderly persons who

are  ambulant or semi-ambulant, and who could take public

transport on their own or with a companion, only  if  the

public transport system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



is  disabled-friendly and elder-friendly.  A person  with

poor  or  very  low vision, for example, needs  voice  or

tactile aids to find his way around.  I am glad that  the

MRT  stations, for one, have been progressively made more

accessible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members that transport needs and

solutions  for  the  disabled and the elderly  should  be

addressed.  They depend on mass transport services to get

around,  to work, to socialise, and to study,  just  like

other  Singaporeans.  My Ministry will continue  to  work

closely  with  MOT, LTA and the NCSS  to  look  into  the

transport   needs   of  the  various  segments   of   our

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has also expressed concern for the

support  given to disabled sportsmen.  I will cover  this

under the help for sportsmen in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point raised by Ms Braema on the need

for  a demographic study, I would agree with her that  an

integrated  approach  is needed and  we  need  to  better

understand  where the needs are, and where  our  disabled

are  located.   We  are, at this point in  time,  working

together  with the various Government agencies to  arrive

at  an  integrated  approach, as  the  example  given  in

meeting the transport needs of the disabled.  At the same

time,  we  are  also  doing a study  on  the  profile  of

disabled  persons,  and  this  will  help  us  better  in

devising new policies and programmes to help our disabled

better integrate into society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the care and concern for the disabled, as I

mentioned, is not just the responsibility of MCDS or  the

NCSS.   The needs of the disabled are best met  when  all

relevant  agencies  and partners  play  their  part.   My

Ministry,  as  I  said earlier, will work  with  relevant

partners  in  the public, private and people  sectors  to

strengthen  services for the disabled and  to  create  an

environment for the disabled to participate in the social

mainstream.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, more people have come for help

during  this difficult period.  Over time, some of  these

cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>



will  become "hard". These are people who are  unable  to

find  jobs  over a prolonged period, and their  financial

situations have deteriorated rapidly and deeply.  After a

prolonged  period of unemployment, the chance of  finding

work has become even less.  It is more difficult for them

to  get  back  to  work.  More help is needed  for  these

people.   We need a more focused or targeted approach  so

that  assistance can be rendered to the deserving parties

in a timely manner before the cases become "hard".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is right that we should help those who are

prepared  to  help themselves.  But even if they  do  not

want to put in the efforts to get themselves out of their

predicament,  we  still  need  to  assist  their   family

members,  especially the old and the  young.   The  young

must  be helped with their education.  Without education,

the  young  will go through the same sad path that  their

parents took.  We will then have a group of chronic poor.

Some people want to help themselves, but they do not know

how  to  help themselves.  What are really their problems

and  how deep are their problems?  We need people who can

counsel  them, especially with regard to their  financial

positions  and options.  If they do not understand  their

problems  or how deep are their problems, they  are  less

able  to  find  a  way  out.  It is very  frustrating  to

provide  help  on a piecemeal basis.  They come  in  with

their  utilities supply problem one evening, the  service

and  conservancy  charges next, and you  think  you  have

helped  them  solve their problems.  And they  come  back

with  their  school fees problem, and then they  ask  for

jobs.  Then this problem cycle starts again from the very

beginning.  It is very sad and frustrating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would like to ask the Minister to review

the  help  that is now available to help people  who  are

genuinely  in need.  Is the help provided adequate?   Are

the  resources available adequate?  Can we  also  provide

financial counselling to those in need of help,  so  that

they can have a holistic picture of their problems?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, with the Iraq war

on  now  and due to Singapore's open economy,  many  more

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>



may be affected by the economic situation, either due  to

reduced  income or loss of job.  I would like to  commend

MCDS for the many financial and social assistance schemes

that  they  introduced to help the lower income  families

and  families  that are affected by the downturn  of  the

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two concerns on disabled children. However,

this has been answered by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Mr Chandra Mohan's concern on the mentally

disabled.  In view of this downturn in the economy,  many

are  very  stressed with their financial  and  employment

situation.  Many may have some kind of mental illness but

they are, however, not serious enough to be warded in the

hospital,  and  they  do not have  the  necessary  family

support.   I have just one question.  Is MCDS considering

setting  up  step-down facilities and daily care  service

which   would  be  of  great  help  for  such   families,

especially  when  the  breadwinner is  affected  and  the

spouse needs to find alternative employment to supplement

the family income?



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the many social and financial assistance

schemes  initiated by MCDS and CDCs, would  the  Ministry

consider  streamlining all these schemes and ensure  that

they  are better coordinated with CDCs as a one-stop help

centre?   This is in line with Dr Tan's appeal.  Just  to

give  Members an example.  A family in need of  financial

help to send their children to childcare and student care

centres  will need to understand at least five  financial

schemes  before  she  can apply  -  the  Flexi  Childcare

Scheme,  the  Government childcare subsidy,  the  Centre-based  Financial Assistance Scheme, the Baby Bonus Scheme

where  they  can  use  the money  to  pay  even  for  the

childcare   service,  and  Student  Care  Fee  Assistance

Scheme.    Most   of  these  schemes  have   very   minor

differences.   So  could the Ministry  please  look  into

that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, with the downturn

in  the economy, there are two groups of children whom  I

would  be  very  much concerned about.  The  first  group

would  be  the children from poor families who have  been

previously poor.  Many of these families are large,  they

have  had low incomes and they have been in the cycle  of

poverty with very little support.  MCDS has done much for

this group, but much more needs to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group really would be the ones who might

be  newly  poor,  or newly in need, because  the  parents

previously having been able to look after the family  are

now  in  financial  difficulties,  as  a  result  of  the

economic  downturn.   Some of these  children  and  their

families  have  been unwilling to come forward  for  help

because  of embarrassment.  Others are in great need  but

are  still  in  the  process  of  making  their  relevant

adjustments  to their family lifestyle.   Some  of  these

children  actually  are  in the  kindergarten  age  group

where,  I believe, there is a list of help available,  in

terms  of being unable to pay for children's kindergarten

fees.   But  the long-term impact on the kindergartens  - although it is not compulsory education - would  be  very

important, in terms of giving these children a head-start

in the education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What plan does MCDS have to address this problem?

These children are our future.  I hope that MCDS would be

able to come up with some schemes, maybe for the next few

years at least, to address their needs.  In particular, I

want to bring forth the plight of those children who come

from  families who have actually heeded the nation's call

"to  have  three  or more, if you can  afford  it";   and

sometimes,  there  is  a fourth  child.   Some  of  these

children  will not enjoy many of the subsidies  available

to  the  first and the second child.  Families  may  have

actually  thought  that they could afford  looking  after

these  children, two or five years ago.  But  because  of

the  downturn, they may be in trouble.  Can we find  ways

to help them?



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, the National Council

of Social Service has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>



compiled  a very comprehensive list of all the assistance

schemes   that   are  available  under  this   assistance

programme,  and they update it monthly.  Looking  at  all

the  schemes that are on the website, just as an example,

under financial assistance, there are already 33 schemes;

help  to pay bills, etc, there are 12 schemes; assistance

for  training opportunities, there are 29; on  education,

there  are 49; childcare, there are 6.  The point that  I

am  driving  at is that there are plenty of  schemes  out

there,  and  I  share  Mdm Cynthia Phua's  and  Dr  Tan's

viewpoints too, that it is difficult for a lay person  to

understand  the  schemes.  The schemes are  difficult  to

administer where form filling, checking of document, etc,

are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other point which I am concerned about is

the  criteria  schemes that are used  under  the  various

assistance  programmes.  For example, the CCC  short-term

financial aid programme gives money ranging from  $50  to

$300  for families in distress.  Under the PA, it is $230

to  $670 for different criteria schemes.  So, at the  end

of  it all, we have just one example, ie, from April 2001

to  March  2002, $6 million has been given out  to  5,300

people  under  the public assistance scheme.   When  much

money  is going out to many different people who  are  in

need, we need to ride by them.  When we have this complex

structure  of  different schemes, it  is  also  important

that,  like  what  Mdm Cynthia Phua has said,  we  should

streamline them, and relook the criteria schemes that  we

are using under various schemes.  Maybe the means testing

will be a solution here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is also too much of hopping where

recipients  are  concerned, and that  can  be  a  problem

because we might overlook someone who is really in  need,

because there is usually a quota too on how much aid  one

can give.  Therefore, I ask for a review.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Sin

Boon  Ann and Dr Tan Boon Wan for raising concerns  about

the  poor  and  needy families who may have  fallen  into

financial difficulties due to economic restructuring.   I

believe Dr Warren Lee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>



and Mdm Cynthia Phua have also raised the same concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, our CDCs have seen more applications for

short-term assistance in the past year.  For example, the

number   of   applications  for  the  Interim   Financial

Assistance  Scheme (IFAS) doubled from 5,501 in  2001  to

11,291  in  2002 over the same nine-month period  (April-December) in 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry is committed to helping those most

in  need.   We  will  work with the community  and  other

partners  to ensure that the social safety net meets  the

needs  of  the  poor and the under-educated,  those  most

vulnerable  to  economic restructuring.  Every  case  for

assistance will thus be assessed on its merits and needs.

Social  assistance officers have the flexibility to  help

cases   at   the  margins.   The  help  will   be   given

holistically.    Poorer   families   with    school-going

children,  for  example, may be referred  to  the  School

Pocket  Money Fund for help or to the schools for  school

fee  assistance.   My  Ministry also  provides  financial

assistance for student care services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But social assistance is only a temporary relief.

Work  is still the best form of welfare.  It is not  good

for  a person to remain unemployed for too long.  He will

find  it  harder to get back to work and lose self-esteem

and  respect.  Thus, apart from financial assistance,  we

help  best if we can help the individual get quickly back

to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, I announced that we would link short-term financial assistance to training, re-skilling, and

job  placement  schemes.  My Ministry is working  closely

with  the  Ministry of Manpower and CDCs to  ensure  that

each  client  is able to get back to work as  quickly  as

possible  by  linking  the Interim  Financial  Assistance

Scheme (IFAS) recipients to job assistance services under

the  Distributed Career Link Network for the  unemployed.

The  principle of self-help is an important  one.   Those

able  to  work  will be given the IFAS grants  for  three

months initially, but will be required to show job search

efforts or go for training.  Those who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>



really  unable to find a job after three months,  despite

sincere  effort,  will be given IFAS grants  for  another

three  months, so six months in all.  During  this  time,

the  CDCs  will do their best to help the person  find  a

job.   The assistance is not indefinite, so those on  the

IFAS-job link need to make use of the opportunity to land

a  job  during  the  time they are on the  scheme.   Many

older,  less  skilled and low educated workers  who  have

lost  their jobs will need more help making a  switch  to

jobs  different from what they have been used  to.   They

will  be given job counselling to help them face the  new

realities and find new jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to report that the work ethic is

alive  and  well.   Yes,  needy Singaporeans  are  coming

forward for help, but they do want to get back to work as

soon   as  they  can  and  not  depend  indefinitely   on

Government  handouts. According to CDCs,  from  April  to

December  2002, 97% of IFAS cases were on assistance  for

six months or less.  88% were on IFAS for three months or

less.   Most  of the cases who were taken off  IFAS  were

able   to   find   work   and  regain   their   financial

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example of someone who was on

social  assistance, but has adjusted his job expectations

and  is  now  self-reliant.   He  deserves  our  respect,

because  he  had the will to accept a new job,  albeit  a

lower  paying one, and get back on his own feet.  He  has

displayed the kind of resilience that I spoke on earlier.

This  is a case of a 51-year-old man who was jobless  for

seven  months.  He has three school-going  children.   He

used to have a white-collar job as a storekeeper.  As  he

suffered from poor vision and could not spend long  hours

in  front of his computer, he had to leave his job.   The

family made adjustments.  His wife worked as a babysitter

to support the family.  The CDC helped him with grants on

the  Interim Financial Assistance Scheme for  six  months

while assisting him with job matching.  He was also given

one-off  assistance  of $150 to buy school  uniforms  and

books for his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



children.   When CDC offered him a cleaner  position,  he

accepted the job even though it meant a major job  switch

and lower pay.  This is clearly an example of someone who

faced   reality  and  was  willing  to  adjust  his   job

expectations because he saw the need to get back into the

game.  The family took hard knocks, but they are on their

own feet again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure Mr Sin Boon Ann and Dr

Tan  that my Ministry will continue to review the  social

safety  net  with  partners,  such  as  the  Ministry  of

Manpower  and CDCs, so that the genuinely needy  get  the

help   they  need.  The  Government's  social  assistance

schemes have not shrunk; in fact, the schemes are revised

regularly  and in the past few years, these reviews  were

brought   forward   to  respond  to   the   fast-changing

environment   and  circumstances  on  the  ground.    For

example,  my  Ministry  enhanced  the  Interim  Financial

Assistance Scheme at the end of 2001 to help families  in

purchased  flats with difficulties paying their utilities

bills.  In January this year, the Public Assistance rates

were revised between 13% and 23%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These schemes are augmented by other programmes and

schemes  run  by the community.  Families  in  need,  for

example, can seek help from their Family Service  Centres

(FSCs)   for  counselling,  including  help  with  budget

planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry shares the concern raised by Dr

Warren  Lee concerning children from low-income families,

and  I  take the point also surfaced by Mdm Cynthia Phua.

Let  me  just  elaborate on the programme  that  we  have

started in order to help low-income families to give them

a headstart in school.  Last year, we introduced an early

intervention programme called "Healthy Start" for  babies

and  young children from families `at risk'.   Five  FSCs

now  deliver  this  programme for  families-at-risk  with

newborn  children.  Another two are in the  middle  of  a

pilot programme that reaches out to older children from 2-6 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For children from families earning $1,500 or less,

the Centre-based Financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



Assistance  Scheme  tops  up  the  Government   childcare

subsidies.  The rates were raised in January this year so

that for the very low income, the Government co-pays some

95%  of  the  average childcare fee at a VWO-run  centre.

There  were  1,234 children on the Scheme at the  end  of

last  year.  Children from Public Assistance and  Special

Grant  families receive free childcare and we will ensure

that  cases on the Healthy Start, RUAS (which is the Rent

and  Utilities Assistance Scheme) and the Small  Families

Improvement  Scheme can afford to make  their  co-payment

quantum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these, as mentioned earlier, the Student

Care  Fee  Assistance Scheme supports  children  in  non-profit  Student Care Centres with subsidies up  to  $150.

Families  earning below $2,500 are eligible  but  orphans

and  children from families in difficulties,  such  as  a

parent being imprisoned, or having mental incapacity will

also  be considered.  The CDCs and VWOs may also consider

helping families more with their co-payment when this  is

warranted.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can empathise with families that had coped

well  before  and  who may now feel awkward  tapping  the

schemes.  Some may prefer to withdraw their children from

childcare  or  student care because they  can  no  longer

afford  the  fees.  They should apply for  help.   May  I

assure  Members that the VWOs and the CDCs will  preserve

the   confidentiality  of  all  applications   for   such

assistance schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who need the schemes we offer may need

to  know  about  their benefits.  My Ministry  will  give

wider  publicity  to our schemes.  We will  also  partner

with  VWOs  and self-help groups, who know their  clients

well,  to draw up suitable Family Life Education packages

to help low-income families acquire coping skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ms Braema Mathiaparanam, Mdm Cynthia Phua and

even Dr Warren Lee have raised some concerns about the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



multitude and plethora of schemes which are available.  I

am  not  sure about the number of schemes that Ms  Braema

has  mentioned that is available on the NCSS website, but

I  am  sure these schemes are there to inform.   I  would

assure Members that we would look into all our schemes to

ensure that some form of streamlining takes place. At the

same  time, Sir, I would like to assure Members that  any

one  who needs any help can go down to the Family Service

Centres  or the CDCs, and there will be people  there  to

assist  them  to  navigate and  guide  them  through  the

various schemes which are available, those schemes  which

they are entitled to, and how they could apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, Sir, we have not received any major

complaints  from  our  partners in implementing  some  of

these schemes.  But, I would like to assure Members  that

we  would look into some of the difficulties that Members

may  have come across, and we would study how these could

be remedied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final point I want to make, which Ms Braema

has  raised,  is  the problem of hopping or  shopping  by

various  client  groups.   This is  an  inevitable  fact,

because  it  is very difficult for us to ensure  that  we

have  one  global  system.  But let me  assure  the  hon.

Member  that  if the family enters the FSC,  there  is  a

system  that is in place where we can help the family  to

navigate  all  the possible options and ensure  that  the

family  is  helped.   As  in the  example  I  have  given

earlier,  ie,  the  IFAS scheme, we  not  only  help  the

breadwinner  to  gain employment, but we  also  help  the

family  in  terms  of  school needs and  the  payment  of

utilities,  and whatever assistance that they  need.   In

that  manner,  we  can ensure that there  is  a  holistic

approach towards helping those who are in need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the concerns.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, in order to upgrade the

social service sector, MCDS, in July 2002, increased  the

recurrent funding of programmes run by voluntary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>



welfare  organisations  by about $7  million  each  year.

VWOs  also  depend  on public support, donors  and  well-wishers  for  support.  They need to  be  accountable  to

their   partners  and  supporters,  and  must  use  their

resources effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell us how are VWOs being

assisted  to meet the expectations of their partners  and

stakeholders?



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, in view of the aging population

and the changes in the demographics that we are facing in

the  future, there is going to be a need for workers  who

are specialised in the areas relevant to the needs of  an

aging  population.  No matter how much we think the needs

are,  when  it actually comes to absolute numbers,  these

numbers  are  relatively small, and  training  may  be  a

little bit difficult to fund locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does MCDS have schemes in place for working towards

greater numbers of people who have specialised skills for

the  management of the elderly?  At the same time,  I  am

heartened  by  the  various schemes that  have  been  put

forward  regarding  the retraining of  older  workers  as

healthcare  workers, and as just aides to help  with  the

mobility  and  feeding of the elderly.  I  think  schemes

like  these are very good, but I would also like  to  see

whether  there  is  actually  provision  for  specialised

manpower.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, just a clarification

on  the  earlier cut.  I am very happy that NCSS has  put

all  these  on the website, because it makes it  so  much

easier.  It is just that the criteria scheme is a maze.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is right now regarded as an advanced

society  and I think our needs are getting more  complex.

We have, on the one hand, people who still need financial

aid  on a daily or monthly basis so that they can get  on

with  their lives; and on the other extreme, we also have

people   who  need  help  dealing  with  burn-outs,   eg,

relationships  in  the  office,  home,  school,   and   a

multitude of services have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>



cropped  up  in recent years to try to help  Singaporeans

deal  with  both spectrums and those who  are  caught  in

between.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am raising here is that, as already mentioned

by the Minister, a lot of services have cropped up.  This

is  wonderful because people are taking the ownership and

different  organisations are coming  into  the  scene  to

build  up services for the people in Singapore.  However,

I  would  like  to ask the Ministry on its role  when  it

comes  to the following areas, so that what is given  has

got a certain kind of consistency with it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The quality of training with which these people

who  are dealing in direct services have.  I have  raised

that before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The duplication of services - when cooperative

models  might work better, where economies of  scale  are

also  concerned, who governs, who sets up what  services,

and in what areas, etc?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the whole concept, which the Minister has

already mentioned, ie, social entrepreneurship, how do we

excite  an  organisation to go further perhaps  with  its

project,  such  that we can have sustenance  as  well  as

independent programmes coming through their initiatives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The very delicate positioning between VWOs and

CDCs  is  such  that the ownership of VWOs does  not  get

subsumed  under  CDC activities, so that the  cooperative

model  can  take  place and both parties  work  in  happy

tandem; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The different demands placed on the charity

dollar by different organisations.  I wonder how this  is

governed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Sir, for this cut and

the  others  under  Head I, I would like  to  declare  my

interest  as  a NUS social work educator and  a  resource

person of the MCDS Committee on the Family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the restructuring of the economy and

the  positioning  of  Singapore as a services  hub,  what

developments are in place for our country to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>



a  Social  Services  Manpower Master Plan  for  the  21st

century?



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I would also like

to  declare my interest as a social work educator  and  a

practitioner in social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the social service sector has seen a rise in

the  demand  for  professional manpower.   There  may  be

various reasons that can explain this rise in demand.  In

a  career  talk  on  the  social service  sector  that  I

conducted not too long ago, I was impressed by the number

of  people who are looking for second careers.  Some  are

lawyers  and businessmen, and one a banker.   People  are

more aware of the range of services available as well  as

the  growing diversity of needs, and also their interest.

This  is hardly surprising, as the social service  sector

provides  very  many intangible benefits and  significant

rewarding experiences to its members as they help  others

to enrich their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commensurate with this growing interest in the

social  services,  there seems to be a  proliferation  of

training  courses  run by different organisations.   This

certainly provides opportunities for people to  get  into

this sector.  Their duration ranges from a couple of days

to  a  couple of years, some using the same title though,

eg,  counselling,  family  therapy,  psychotherapy,  etc.

Many  who  are  graduates of these  courses  happily  and

proudly   identify  themselves  as  counsellors,   family

therapists,  and  some as psychotherapists.   They  offer

their services to people who meet them, and the demand is

rising, given the very stressful lives that we lead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, dealing with human lives and emotions is not a

simple matter.  It is complex and requires, among others,

the   person's  proficiency,  maturity  and,  of  course,

competency  in  the  area  of  practice.   Thus,  it   is

imperative that certification of such courses is  checked

and    accredited.    Who   is   responsible   for   such

accreditation processes?  Who is ensuring the  standards?

As  the  sector  is so diverse, what are MCDS'  plans  to

ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>



the  standards and the supply of professionals  into  the

different   sectors?     Who   is   to   determine   what

qualifications allow one to practise in what aspects?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from ensuring that the proper mechanisms

are  in  place to ensure the close monitoring and control

over  the sector, we should also ensure that Singaporeans

are  given adequate information and knowledge to  discern

between    the    qualified   and    the    non-qualified

practitioners.   To many, a counsellor is  a  counsellor.

As  long as you have a good heart, you can listen  to  my

problems,  you  call yourself a counsellor,  you  have  a

paper  that hangs on your wall to support it, I am  okay.

Is  there  any  avenue  for  Singaporeans  to  check  the

authenticity of such qualifications?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister what

proportion  of  our social service sector  personnel  are

Employment Pass holders?  In this regard, who ensures and

monitors that the qualifications that they bring  in  are

accredited accordingly?  This is important, as  they  may

come  from  cultures that are different  from  ours,  and

their intervention may cause more harm than good to their

service users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many people have said that there is an inverse

relationship between the economic downturn and the growth

of  the social service sector, as more people need  those

services.  Let us ensure that the numbers do not increase

because  of incompetent practitioners who enter  when  we

are not keeping watch on the gate.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Sir, our population

is getting more educated and the people are having higher

expectations  about  the quality of  services  that  they

receive.   For the social services, how does the Ministry

ensure  that  the professional service standards  in  the

social   services  are  keeping  pace  with  the   higher

expectations  and changes in the world over  professional

standards?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I fully agree

with Mr Charles Chong that VWOs need to be accountable to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>



well-wishers  and  supporters of  their  programmes.   To

deliver   good   programmes  and  use   their   resources

effectively, VWOs must practise effective governance  and

management.   The  National  Council  of  Social  Service

(NCSS)  has  conducted workshops on board governance  for

over  200  VWO  Board  members,  and  has  also  provided

consultancy  to  several VWOs.  VWOs can also  apply  for

training and consultancy grants from the $30 million  VWO

Capability  Fund  to  upgrade their  internal  management

capabilities.  To expand on current efforts, NCSS intends

to  roll  out a Code of Governance for the VWOs  in  June

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code covers important areas, such as resource

management  and  evaluation  of  outcomes,  conflict   of

interest,  financial  management  and  fund-raising,   to

achieve    high    standards    of    transparency    and

accountability.  The NCSS is in the process of consulting

the  VWOs to improve the Code.  So far, feedback  on  the

Code has been generally positive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members - Dr Maliki, Dr Warren Lee, Prof.

Ngiam  and  even Ms Braema Mathiaparanam  -  have  spoken

about  manpower planning and development  of  the  social

service sector.  My Ministry and the National Council  of

Social  Service have developed a Social Services Manpower

Masterplan  to  ensure  enough trained  manpower  and  to

enhance  professional  standards in  the  social  service

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key strategies under the masterplan are as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Creating more opportunities for school leavers

as well as mid-career entrants to join the sector.  So, I

am  glad that Dr Maliki has been giving talks to bankers,

lawyers and engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Putting in place a comprehensive training

framework.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Addressing issues of attraction and retention

of personnel in the sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to elaborate on these three

strategies.    We   have   created   opportunities    for

Singaporeans  to  take  up jobs  in  the  social  service

sector.    The  recently  introduced  Strategic  Manpower

Conversion   Programme   now  makes   it   possible   for

Singaporeans to make a career switch into the  sector  by

being   trained   as  social  workers  or   social   work

assistants.   By  2006,  we  expect  some  150  graduands

through this programme; some 90 will be trained as social

work   assistants  via  a  Specialist  Diploma  in  Human

Services,  and  about 60 will qualify  as  fully  trained

social  workers via the Graduate Diploma in Social  Work.

This will relieve the shortage of trained social workers,

given  that  only about half of the 120 NUS graduates  in

social  work actually enter the field every year.   Other

than    social   workers   and   assistants,   we    will

systematically bring other critical social  service  jobs

under the ambit of the Manpower Conversion Programme,  so

that  mid-career people can be trained for jobs in social

services.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we started another scheme, "Training for

Employment in the Social Services" (or TESS) in  December

last  year aimed at workers with secondary education  and

below,  particularly  older  Singaporeans  who  may  face

structural unemployment. Generous subsidies now  make  it

attractive  for VWOs to recruit and send older  and  less

educated   Singaporeans  for  training.    The   training

currently   covers  therapy  aides,  nursing  aides   and

healthcare attendants.  The first batch of 32 people  has

been  trained and will be starting work in the  VWOs.  We

hope  to have trained at least 450 persons by 2006, under

the six  certificate programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that with MCDS support, the

National  Council of Social Service will set up a  Social

Service  Training Institute in April  2003.   This  is  a

major  milestone in the development of the social service

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will ensure that the training needs of

all personnel in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



social  service  sector, from social workers,  management

staff,   therapists,   counsellors,   special   education

teachers,  social  work  assistants  to  social   service

volunteers  are systematically addressed.  Such  training

will  help  upgrade the quality of services and personnel

in the social service sector, as well as allow mid-career

people to be trained to take up jobs in the sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Service Training Institute will run a

total  of  119  courses in its first year  of  operation,

enabling  some  768  staff from  the  sector  to  undergo

professional training.  So the concern of Dr Maliki about

the  quality  of social workers or people in  the  social

service  sector  could be addressed if they  undergo  the

training  programme.  Leadership and management  training

for  executive directors and senior managers of voluntary

welfare  organisations will be another key training  area

that   the  Institute  will  be  driving  together   with

accredited institutions of higher learning, such  as  the

Singapore  Management University.  Course  fees  will  be

affordable.   VWOs will also be able to tap  on  the  VWO

Capability  Fund which will subsidise up to  70%  of  the

course fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by Ms Braema Mathiaparanam, there is

a   need  to  develop  specialists  in  the  sector.  The

Institute will organise specialist training in areas such

as  elderly, youth and family services.  My Ministry  and

the   National  Council  of  Social  Service  also  offer

specialist  scholarships  ranging  from  Social  Work  to

Gerontology Counselling and Disability Studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki asked about the accreditation process and

who  would  ensure the standards of training provided  to

social  service  professionals.   As  Dr  Maliki  already

knows,  professionals in the social service sector,  such

as  social  workers,  psychologists and  therapists,  are

generally required to have a minimum undergraduate degree

in  their respective field.  The Ministry is of the  view

that  it is for the industry or professional associations

to regulate themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Service Training Institute, in

consultation  with the relevant professional institutions

and the industry, will,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



however,  look  into the standards of  training  for  all

levels of jobs in the social service sector. It will also

ensure  that  courses  run  by the  Institute's  partners

adequately  equip  trainees for the  job.   For  example,

nursing  aides,  health  attendants  and  therapy   aides

currently  undergo a formal full-time training  programme

ranging  from  one to six months. The training  providers

and the Institute will jointly certify these courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large group of personnel in the social

service sector today, who did not have the opportunity or

lack  the  necessary  qualifications  to  undergo  formal

training.  My Ministry will reach out to them with  "bite-size"  practical  training at the workplace  through  the

National Skills Recognition System.  The eldercare sector

will  be  the first in the community-based social service

sector  where  such modular training programmes  will  be

developed and certified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Government-funded services, my

Ministry   is   working   on  specifying   the   relevant

professional  competencies  which  must  be  met  by  the

service  providers.  For example, counsellors  at  Family

Service  Centres  who  provide counselling  services  are

expected  to possess a Diploma in Counselling in addition

to a Bachelor Degree in Social Work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perennial issue facing VWOs is how to attract and

retain  good  staff.  Our efforts to professionalise  the

sector  through formal and accredited training will  help

attract Singaporeans to make a career in this sector.  It

is  also  necessary  to have adequate  remuneration.   My

Ministry,  together  with  NCSS,  recently  reviewed  VWO

funding and we intend to conduct regular reviews, so that

VWOs  can  pay  appropriate remuneration to their  staff.

Members  may  recall that in July last year, my  Ministry

increased funding to the VWOs by an average of 17%, or $7

million per year.  My Ministry is also working with  NCSS

to  find  ways to reduce attrition in the sector  due  to

factors   such  as  burn-out.   To  this  end,  the   VWO

leadership  and  management staff are being  educated  on

good HR practices and work-life strategies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last but not least, my Ministry will be

launching  a public education programme to introduce  the

social   service  sector  and  career  opportunities   to

students  and  people contemplating a mid-career  change.

This would help Singaporeans better understand the sector

and the various rewarding careers in the social services.

We  also want to correct the wrong impression that social

workers are volunteers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam has also asked how my Ministry plans to

ensure  professional service standards of social services

in  the  light  of higher expectations in the  community.

And  I  believe Ms Braema has also raised the same  issue

with respect to the quality of training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a key factor is the competence and

professionalism  of  the staff.   I have  already  talked

about  the efforts of MCDS and NCSS and the role  of  the

Social  Service Training Institute in ensuring  competent

manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above these efforts, we will be requiring

VWOs, which deliver services funded by MCDS and NCSS,  to

meet    specified   requirements,   including    relevant

professional standards.  MCDS and NCSS have also  put  in

place a Programme Evaluation System (PES) that all funded

VWOs  have to comply with and report on.  This  helps  us

ensure  that  social service programmes are relevant  and

effective,  carried  out  appropriately  and   meet   the

required professional standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of services provided by various

community and religious groups with their own funds,  the

Ministry  encourages them to use programme evaluation  to

ascertain  whether they are meeting their own  objectives

and  to use consultancy services offered by the NCSS,  to

upgrade  their standards. Ultimately, their  funders  and

stakeholders  would have to be satisfied  that  they  are

doing a good job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NCSS has also issued the Best Practice

Guidelines which cover



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



areas  such  as  good  management  and  service  delivery

processes,  for example, in the areas of human  resource,

financial management, fund raising, and case management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me address some of issues raised by Ms

Braema  first.   She  spoke  about  the  duplication   of

services and who is supposed to determine to set up  what

service.  I would like to assure her that there is  close

coordination  between MCDS, NCSS and the  CDCs  where  we

basically do an overall planning in some of the  services

which  are key to the community, to ensure that there  is

minimal duplication to services like Student Care Centres

and  Family Service Centres.   But I can understand  that

as  emerging needs are coming up, there will always be  a

need  for us to review these on a regular basis, and this

is  something that is being done constantly between MCDS,

NCSS and CDCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with her that we should excite the VWOs to

engage in social entrepreneurship.  I will be most  happy

to  listen to any ideas that she may have on how  we  can

encourage  more  of the VWOs to find,  for  the  lack  of

better words, "new revenue streams" from within their own

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of balance between the VWOs and

CDCs,  I  would like to assure her that the CDCs  do  not

provide  services. The services are provided through  the

VWOs.   For  example, Family Service Centres are  run  by

VWOs,  but  they  are linked up with  the  CDCs  for  the

purposes of referral and, in a sense, case management, to

ensure that holistic help is being given to the family in

need.   I  would  like to assure her  that  there  is  no

attempt on the part of the CDCs to take over the role  of

the  VWOs.  But if there is an instance that she has come

across,  we will be most happy to address that,  together

with  the Mayors involved to see if there is any form  of

overlapping between the CDCs and the VWOs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on her point about the different

demands  on the charity dollar, I think this is something

that we have to address on a continuous basis.  I spoke



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



earlier about trying to promote more philanthropy so that

we  have more people who can come forward.  Yet,  at  the

same  time,  as I have said earlier, we need to  be  more

strategic in the way we address this issue.  To bring  in

new  philanthropists into the system, we have to be  able

to  give them a stake in the programme, as in the example

that  I  have given on the Robin Hood Foundation.   I  am

sure  we can find some creative means to bring a lot more

people into the sector by engaging them, not just only as

donors, but also as partners in the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has raised a particular question about the

number  of employment pass holders who are on the  social

service sector.  I do not have the numbers but I will  be

most  happy to provide.  I would like to assure him  that

the  FSCs  and the VWOs are constantly ensuring that  the

standards  of their social workers and people working  in

the  VWOs  are indeed met, because this is important  for

their clients.  But, nonetheless, I will endeavour to get

the numbers for him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the marriage rate among

Singaporeans has shown a steady decline over  the  years.

This  is  in  spite of the efforts of the SDU  and  other

matchmaking agencies and, more recently, the  efforts  of

the Romancing Singapore Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it timely that we review the effectiveness

of  the  programmes and the policies of the  Government's

match-making  agencies  with a view  to  improving  their

success rates?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our total fertility rate has shown a decline

over  the years, from approximately 1.8 in 1990 to  about

1.1   in  2002.   With  the  replacement  rate  at   2.1,

Singaporeans  are  steadily and very  surely  headed  for

extinction,  unless  something is done  to  increase  our

fertility rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, the Prime Minister appointed a Ministerial

Committee to look into the issue of the falling fertility

rate  in  Singapore.  Supporting this Committee  was  the

Working Committee on Marriage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



and  Procreation.  The Ministerial Committee  recommended

the  introduction of the Baby Bonus, the Third Child Paid

Maternity Leave Scheme and additional childcare benefits.

These incentives were mainly monetary in nature, and were

to encourage Singaporeans to have three or more children,

if they could afford it. But if they could already afford

it,  would  monetary benefit alone be a strong  incentive

for  them to have more children?  Surely, there  must  be

other  non-monetary motivational factors that could  make

it more conducive for Singaporeans to have more babies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of our impending extinction, would the

Minister  recommend the formation of an Inter-Ministerial

Committee,  perhaps  named  as  the  Making  Singaporeans

Committee,  that  will  review all  family  policies  and

formulate  new  initiatives to raise our  fertility  rate

before it is too late?



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

wish  to comment on the family planning policies  of  the

Government.  In this uncertain world economic  situation,

the  family  is  the  most important  foundation  of  our

country.  It is the best safety net for us.  It gives  us

stability,  warmth and solace.  The MCDS  has  set  up  a

Public  Education Committee two years ago. The  Committee

published a book entitled: Looking After the Family,  and

had  made some 70 recommendations in 2001.  Some of these

recommendations  were   incorporated  into  some  of  our

national events such as Romancing Singapore.  May  I  ask

the  Minister  whether  any of the other  recommendations

have been implemented?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked whether we need to set up

another Inter-Ministerial Committee as we already have  a

Committee  on Marriages and Procreation.  What  has  this

Committee  achieved since its inception? We may  have  to

take  into  consideration  the  changing  environment  in

Singapore,  and make adjustments to some of  the  present

arrangements. For example, shall we not outsource our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



match-making  activities, instead of  confining  them  to

Government agencies such as the Social Development  Unit,

etc.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the question of marriages and

procreation is not something which can be settled by MCDS

alone. Collective efforts from all quarters are required.

This  matter has a very wide-ranging implication. In MOM,

we have lifelong learning; in MOE, we have sex education,

and  so  on.  Many Ministries have to be  consulted,  and

whatever policy we implement, it must be consistent.  So,

I  would  urge  the  MCDS to combine efforts  with  other

Ministries   and   agencies  to  promote   marriage   and

procreation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people consider this question of marriage and

procreation to be taboo, but I feel we should  not  avoid

discussing  it.   Something has  to  be  done  about  it.

Although  the  efforts we put in may not yield  immediate

tangible  effects, I am sure, in the long run, they  will

bear  fruits and benefit our future generations.  In  the

meantime,  we  should encourage our young people  to  get

married  and  have children while they are  still  young.

Miss the boat, and you will regret for life!



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Charles

Chong has mentioned incentives like Baby Bonus Scheme and

the  Inter-Ministerial Committee.  Mrs  Yu-Foo  has  just

talked about the promotional part, the PEC on the family.

There  are  many  other  efforts  that  MCDS  is  making,

including a very good Work-Life Unit that does tremendous

work   in   supporting  and  promoting   good   work-life

practices.   We  have now maternity leave for  the  third

child,  and  in the civil service, sick child care  leave

has  been extended to fathers as well.  For all of  these

efforts, our fertility rate has not budged one  bit.   In

fact, it has budged, but has gone in the wrong direction.

My   question  now  is:  what  do  we  do  next?   Simple

enhancements  -  like further developing  child-  minding

services  and  home-help  services  to  be  delivered  at

community level, beyond CDC level down to Residents'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



Committees, and even block level, trying to replicate the

old  informal  neighbour-type networks,  and  being  more

targeted with the different messages to different groups,

like  the higher educated women may have more flexibility

in  their  choices,  whereas for  those  from  the  lower

economic strata for whom dropping out of the workforce is

not  an option, and they cannot totally decide on that  - may not actually make any impact at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three big categories of determinants of

fertility rates, and that is, economic, social,  cultural

and  institutional.  And all of them  interplay  and  all

three  of  them are important in a couple's  decision  to

start a family.  Across the board, are we truly doing all

that  we  can to address all the issues in all the  three

areas?   It  is  impossible to try to cover  all  of  the

grounds  in a 2-minute cut.  So, at this point  in  time,

what I do want to raise for Government's consideration is

whether  or  not we should be looking for examples,  like

the  European  experiences, to see what  lessons  we  can

learn from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the traditional and conservative South European

countries of Italy and Spain, the fertility rate has gone

south,  so to speak, all the way to 1.2.  In the Northern

European countries, the Scandinavian countries of  Norway

and  Finland, where the Government has pulled out all the

stops to support family formations, in terms of very high

subsidy  for  childcare, like over  80%,  providing  very

generous   paternal  leave,  and  aggressively  promoting

fathers'  involvement, the rate is at the level  of  1.8.

So,  are we willing to pull out all the stops and  go  to

this  extent?   If we are unable to persuade  more  young

Singaporeans  to get married and to have children,  maybe

to  have  one  or two, or more children, the  only  other

alternative  is  to grow our population entirely  through

incoming migration.  Do we throw in the towel and  settle

for this option?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister share with us what might be the

thoughts of the leadership on this very important  issue,

upon which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



hangs  our  continued  long term existence?   Indeed,  Mr

Charles Chong did talk about extinction.  It is an  issue

as   important,   if   not  more  so,   than   our   cost

competitiveness, which is getting so much attention  now,

and  the  quality of our workforce, as it  addresses,  in

fact, whether we will have a workforce at all.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Sir, like the hon.

Member, Dr Jennifer Lee, the issues regarding the  family

are actually very far-reaching, wide and complex.  Whilst

we are still grappling with various schemes, measures and

policies, I would like to zoom in on two main areas  that

have   to  do  with  changing  the  mindsets  of  couples

intending  to  get married, and couples who  are  already

married,  in  the  hope  that this might  encourage  more

couples  to go in for responsible marriages, and then  to

work at their marriages with the level of commitment that

is  required.   I am referring specifically  to  marriage

preparation courses and marriage enrichment  courses.   I

understand  that  the Government is  not  ready  to  make

marriage preparation courses mandatory for ROM marriages.

If  such is the case, what steps are taken to enhance the

role of religious organisations, for example, mosques and

churches,  VWOs and the GROs in organising such  courses?

We  understand  that with a materialistic  lifestyle  and

with   the   onslaught   of  globalisation,   the   whole

institution  of  marriage and having responsible  parents

and  families is probably in danger of erosion here.   So

we  need to take active steps.  Maybe such courses  could

be  even  eligible for not just subsidies for the service

providers,   but  also  tax-breaks  or  subsidies   under

Continuing Education and Training programme.  We have  to

take  this very seriously now, and not just leave  it  to

individuals  to figure out the value systems,  the  roles

and responsibilities on an ad hoc basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran is not here. Dr Mohamad

Maliki.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, yesterday I spoke

about stress and sex education.  Sir, allow me to mediate

when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



we  are  talking about romance.  Last month, MCDS  ran  a

campaign  to entice Singaporeans to do the little  things

that  will  increase the feelings of love  towards  their

loved  ones.   Some critics are very quick  to  highlight

that  this is the epitome of the sad state of our society

-  not  only  do  we  need to be  taught  on  the  social

etiquette in public toilets, now we need to be taught  or

encourage to show or express our love.  Sir, real or not,

another perception of the Romancing Singapore campaign is

to  address  the  issue  of low marriage  rates  and  the

perennial problem of our fertility rate, which have  been

mentioned by many of the other Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that some $400,000 was spent on

Romancing  Singapore.  I wonder what was  MCDS's  desired

outcome  when  embarking on such  a  one-month  campaign?

Also, since we are talking about encouraging Singaporeans

to  get  married, I would like to discuss  the  role  and

performance of SDU and SDS.  SDU was established in 1984.

Next  year,  it will be celebrating its 20th anniversary.

Sir, this is almost one generation.  We are probably  now

courting the children of our pioneer SDU couples  to  get

married  soon.  Two decades, and we are still needing  to

spend  money to encourage people to get married and  have

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the following

questions:  How much is spent every year on SDU  and  its

related   programmes  that  aim  at  encouraging   family

formation?   How  successful have these programmes  been?

We  saw  the  number of marriages is  coming  down  -  2%

decrease last year.  The proportion of single people over-35  years  has  jumped from 18.7% to 30.3%  in  just  one

decade.   Could  these figures have  been  worse  without

these programmes and efforts?  I would like to ask if the

Ministry  has done a thorough review of these  programmes

to  see  if  they are meeting the needs of  the  changing

profiles of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is crucial, as 20 years is a long time and

the recent MCDS survey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



and  many other surveys have indicated changing profiles,

attitudes and needs of Singaporeans towards marriage  and

family life.  Sir, the Census 2000 also showed the  other

"problem"  with regard to family formation.   The  highly

educated  women  and  the  lowly  educated  men  are  not

marrying.   My undergraduates have no qualms  in  raising

their  hands when I ask how many of them do not  plan  to

get  married.  It is quite worrying.  What is being  done

in this regard, and has there been any improvement in our

efforts in the last two years since Census 2000?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part of romancing, and I must declare that I am

not  an  expert in it, is about appreciation and  respect

for  one's  partner.   It  is  about  understanding  each

other's  expectations.  It is about  being  ready  for  a

commitment.  It is about living lives together within the

same  environment.   And it is about  sharing  a  vision.

Affairs  of the heart are really hard to understand,  but

understand they must.  One of the issues, I think, is for

men  to  understand the changing expectations of women  - not  just about romancing - but about being husbands  and

fathers.  I encourage the Ministry to focus more  efforts

on  the  men  to understand these changes and reciprocate

with appropriate actions as they continue to romance into

the  hearts  of  their womenfolk.   Perhaps  we  need  to

initiate  a  men's movement to catch up with the  women's

movement  that  had started some 30 years  ago.   Indeed,

many of them are leaving their men behind, and my message

to my fellow men - run after them.  Maybe we can give the

men some steroids to stimulate their chase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo is not here. Dr

Maliki again.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> After the men have

chased  them,  let us talk about the babies.   Hopefully,

that  works  out.   Much  has been said  about  declining

fertility.  The rate is reportedly very low.   We  talked

about  the possible extinction of Singaporeans.   And  we

introduced the Baby Bonus Scheme about two years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



back.  What was the target when it started?  How far  are

we  from the target?  How many people have benefited from

the scheme so far?  And I would also like to ask how much

has been spent on the Baby Bonus Scheme.  We all know the

critical  situation for Singapore.  Have we attempted  to

understand  more why Singaporeans are still reluctant  to

have children?  Are there plans to improve the package to

motivate  more  people?  Studies have  shown  that  other

factors are important in the decision to have babies, one

of  them  being  the  rising medical cost.   Perhaps  one

aspect of the bonus would be to help them purchase health

insurance  for  their babies, if this is  really  one  of

their  concerns.  Some have told me that it is the nitty-gritty, even buying diapers and baby formulas could be an

issue  to them.  Certainly, we do not want the Government

to  be surrogate parents to their children.  But I wonder

how  the Ministry has taken all these into consideration,

especially those that have been mentioned by Dr  Jennifer

Lee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another related issue is that we are assuming

Singaporeans  would at least want to have one  child  and

thus  the  bonus  is  only for the  2nd  and  3rd  child.

Perhaps,  if  the situation is desperate enough,  we  may

want  to  consider  extending it for the  1st  child  and

thereby motivate having the 2nd and 3rd, if not more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously we heard that 12,000 abortions take place

every year, on the average.  Every unborn child is a loss

to   our  country.   I  recognise  the  need  for  us  to

understand the reasons behind these abortions.  Are there

examples  in  other  countries on  programmes  where  the

States work with these mothers and motivate them to carry

their  babies  to  full term, and then  perhaps  put  the

babies  up  for  adoption?   Perhaps  we  can  give  them

bonuses.  Such informal schemes are already happening  in

the adoption sector, where the adopting family offers the

mother an ang pow in giving up the baby for adoption.  We

may want to consider that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many people are saying that money is not the

only thing that motivates the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



people  to  have children.  While, in most circumstances,

money talks, in this case, perhaps, we need to understand

what else makes baby talk.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, young

married  couples often worry about who will take care  of

their  babies  when they go to work.  This is  one  major

reason  why they put off having more babies.  They cannot

afford  to live on a single income.  So both husband  and

wife  need  to go back to work, and not all of them  have

mothers  or  mothers-in-law to turn to  for  baby-sitting

help.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has led to the present situation where infants

are  being fostered out to strangers untrained  in  baby-sitting, and with some babies being brought home only  on

weekends, or being cared for by foreign maids.   This  is

less   than  ideal.   We  should  provide  couples   with

affordable  and  quality  infant  care  centres  in   the

neighbourhood that offer full-day care, so  that  working

parents  can take their infants home and spend time  with

them after work.  I believe this is important for parent-child  bonding and for the development of the child.   At

the same time, working parents would have their minds  at

ease during the day, as their infants would be cared  for

by professionally-trained and caring nannies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I did a survey in my constituency to check

the  demand for infant care, and I found that there is  a

need  for  such an infant care centre.  There  is  now  a

dearth of infant care facilities, and the very few infant

care  centres available charge very high rates.  Some  of

such  centres  had previously closed down,  because  they

were losing money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infant care, for babies aged two months to 18

months,  requires a higher staff-child ratio as  well  as

special facilities.  And to provide good quality care  to

infants, we need to provide a ratio of at least one well-trained babysitter to about three to four babies, to make

sure that each infant gets the close attention that he or

she needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast this to the childcare centres for children

above  18 months, where the ratio is one teacher to about

eight  children.  It costs mothers about $400 a month  to

put a child into a childcare centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my constituency, we did our sums and found

that  it  would  be expensive to set up  an  infant  care

centre.  To be viable, the minimum charge to care  for  a

baby  would have to be at least $700 a month.  This would

be too much to bear for most couples who need infant care

services for their babies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Government provides childcare subsidy

of  $150  for  working  mothers and $75  for  non-working

mothers.   It does not differentiate between infant  care

and childcare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to consider giving

grants  to help community-based organisations to  provide

infant care facilities and to provide higher subsidies to

mothers for infant care.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to argue for

more support for the Singapore family, as many others  in

this  House  before me had done so, particularly  in  the

workplace.   I  would argue that it is  in  the  national

interest  to do so if the family is not to end up  as  an

extinct species.  It also makes good economic sense, as a

look  at  many  Fortune 500 companies show that  many  of

these  companies  could  attract  and  retain  the   best

talents, because they adopt family-friendly practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I worry that the lack of employment policies to

accommodate  working  parents is forcing  individuals  to

make  painful choices between job security and parenting.

In  Singapore's case, we have seen the impact due to  the

nature of the roles of men and women in our society,  the

primary responsibility for family care-taking often falls

on   women.   As  a  result,  more  women  have  remained

unmarried or, if married, delay having children.  Despite

all  the  financial incentives, we now  have  the  lowest

fertility rate in 14 years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the tripartite initiatives that are

currently  in  place  to promote work-life  balance,  but

progress  is  still slow.  Such initiatives are  laudable

and  should  continue, but I fear that they  may  not  be

enough.  Dr Jennifer Lee had said that what is needed may

be more than just incremental changes.  To me, any change

would  be better than no change at all.  So I do ask  the

Minister whether he will consider introducing legislation

on  family care leave.  Such a legislation would allow an

employee, both female and male, to take leave  so  as  to

take  care  of  a  child, parent or spouse  with  serious

health  conditions.  Because, now, the issue is not  just

one  of  taking care of an infant or a young  child,  but

because  of the ageing population, there is an  increased

burden  on  families  to take care of  sick  and  elderly

parents as well as sick and elderly siblings.  We do  not

have that kind of a support in our society right now.  If

the  argument against legislation is that it would create

rigidity, an argument which I am well aware of and  I  am

also  equally concerned, coming from the trade union,  or

that  it would increase cost, then I would argue that  it

is equally costly for employers to lose trained staff and

to  incur additional cost to recruit new staff and  train

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the use of such leave can be subject to

conditions,  such as minimum employment  period  and  the

leave  can be limited to one week, for instance.  At  the

end  of  the  day,  I think that society  must  strike  a

balance.   We  want economic progress but  we  must  also

understand that without social progress, there cannot  be

economic  progress.   So  society  must  provide   enough

support to the family, so that the family can nurture and

develop  talents, so that our economy can  grow  and  our

society  can  progress even further.  Sir,  instances  of

such  leave are common in other countries, including  the

US,  which is the bastion of free trade and free  market,

and  it  has the Family and Medical Leave Act  which  was

passed in 1993.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, our young parents have to juggle

their  time  between  their careers and  the  demands  of

parenthood  as most of them are dual income families  out

of  necessity.   They  really do not have  many  options,

apart from leaving their children at childcare centres or

with  maids.   We  may  want to note that,  increasingly,

raising grandchildren is not part of the retirement plans

of many grandparents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS can play a vital role to facilitate the

availability of affordable and professionally run  infant

care  and  toddler care services.  This  would  give  the

quality  assurance and would help ensure the  safety  and

well-being of infants and toddlers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how many childcare centres that cater to

children below 18 months of age are available?  What kind

of  fees  are these centres charging?  Would MCDS support

the  setting  up  of  24-hour care  centres?   The  ideal

caregivers  of  infants  are,  of  course,  the   parents

themselves.   But such centres may be of use,  especially

during  emergency,  for  short  periods  when  there   is

disruption of the usual care arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare centres at the workplace are convenient

for  many  parents.  This calls for more assistance  from

the   Government  to  encourage  employers  to   consider

providing  childcare centres at the workplace.   Have  we

achieved better progress in this area?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, studies have shown that very young children

fare  better  with  family-based childcare.   Would  MCDS

subsidise such family-based childcare in lieu of care  at

childcare  centres?  Granting subsidy here may  encourage

suitable  housewives and retirees to  work  and  to  have

income  whilst  staying home.  These  caregivers  can  be

accredited  or  monitored  and  registered  under   MCDS'

supervision.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I just want to

focus  on  childcare  issues in relation  to  low  income

families.  One of the things that I find quite a  lot  in

my  work  is  that  many low income  families  have  many

children.  And one of the problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



that they face is really the choice of whether the mother

wants to go out to work or not, and that is dependent  on

the  number of children that they have, because childcare

fees sometimes are pretty high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we have the Centre-based Financial

Assistance for Childcare scheme of MCDS, and I think this

is  a very good programme.  I am happy to note that a lot

more  families are participating in this programme.  But,

sometimes,  it also depends on the fees that are  charged

by  the  childcare centres to enable a family to  send  a

child  to the childcare centre.  I just want to make  the

point  that  childcare will benefit low  income  families

because  it  will  not only provide stimulation  for  the

children in their social and intellectual development, it

also  increases the sense of self-esteem  of  the  mother

when she is able to work and be independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have several questions in relation to the

Centre-based  Financial Assistance for  Childcare  (CFAC)

scheme.  First, how many people have applied for CFAC but

not  successful?  What were the reasons  for  them  being

unsuccessful?   Are there plans to review the  scheme  in

the  light of these unsuccessful applications?  Also,  in

that  light,  are there sufficient affordable  places  in

childcare centres for these CFAC applicants to  make  use

of?    Because,  sometimes,  it  really  depends  on  the

location of the childcare centres, and I am not sure  the

extent  to  which such affordable childcare  centres  are

located sufficiently in different parts of Singapore.  At

the  end of the day, if the cash outlay required  of  the

family  is  high,  it will demotivate them  from  sending

their children to childcare centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is that of childcare operators. I

have  heard that sometimes the childcare operators choose

not  to be processed under the CFAC scheme, because  they

find   it   cumbersome.   I  wonder  whether  the   claim

procedures are indeed tedious and cumbersome, which  make

the  childcare  operators  not actually  encouraging  the

potentially  low  income families  from  benefiting  from

childcare.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister can address these issues.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, so far, eight babies

have  been found abandoned here since February last year,

and two were found dead.  In Singapore, it is a crime  to

abandon  a baby.   The parents can be jailed up to  seven

years,  fined  or both.  I know that, in  Singapore,  the

Government has been quite flexible and has not prosecuted

some  mothers  who  have abandoned their  babies  safely.

But,  obviously, the fear of breaking the law has  caused

many  to  abandon their babies unsafely.  This opens  the

baby to the risk of death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should consider adopting the safe haven baby

abandonment  laws  found in many states  in  the  US  and

several  parts  of  the developed world,  which  allow  a

parent  to  anonymously drop off an  unharmed  infant  at

certain  identified places  -  no questions asked.   Such

safe  drop-off points are identified clearly in the laws,

and   they  can  include  places  like  hospitals,   fire

stations, police stations and child welfare agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reservation that some of us may have is whether

such laws might promote irresponsible parenting.  I would

argue  that the intent of these laws is to save the lives

of   the   babies.   The  important  issues  of  teaching

responsibility and good values should be dealt separately

with  other  programmes.  In any case,  consider  how  we

legalise  and even facilitate abortions.  We  do  not  go

into  a  moral tizzy and say, "Oh, we should not make  it

easy  to  abort  so that we don't send the wrong  message

about irresponsible parenting."  But when we try to  save

the  lives of abandoned babies and making it easier, this

concern arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why our authorities seem uneasy with

the  "no  questions asked" rule is their  obsession  with

getting  the  medical history and biological heritage  of

the  abandoned baby.  To get that, they need the  details

of  the mother and the need to interview her.  But if  we

have to choose between a dead baby



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



dumped in the open and to being abandoned safely with  no

medical records, the choice seems obvious to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some states in the US, any information provided

by the parent is on a voluntary basis.  She does not have

to  give  her  name or answer any questions, but  medical

forms  will be offered to her.  She may fill them  up  at

the  safe haven or she may take them home and return them

by mail. All information will be kept confidential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers who abandon babies are typically young,

unmarried  and  pregnant for the first  time.   They  are

often  afraid  that  others will  find  out  about  their

pregnancies and they want utmost secrecy.  Often, mothers

may  see  abandoning  their child as  an  alternative  to

abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we may have a complication if the

mother abandoning the newborn is a foreign maid.  Then we

have  to decide which is more important to us  -   saving

the  life  of  a  baby  or punishing  the  maid  for  her

foolishness and deporting her.  If a foreign  maid  knows

she  will be punished, she will not come forward to leave

her  baby in safe hands.  For me, the choice will  be  to

save the life of the baby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teenage births have risen from 704 in 1997 to

about  850  last  year.  We need to step  up  our  social

programmes aimed at pregnancy prevention, pre-natal  care

and  counselling for at-risk girls.  We must  also  reach

out  to  the boys, perhaps more so to the boys.  We  must

teach the boys the consequences of their actions and  the

need to take responsibility for them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



Girls will not get pregnant if the boys are responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know a case of a teenager who gave birth

alone  in  the toilet and stuffed her baby down  a  pail.

The baby died and it became a Coroner's case in 1987.   I

covered  that  case when I was a court reporter  for  the

Straits  Times, and I learnt that her boyfriend left  her

when she told him about her pregnancy and he did not help

her.   She  hid her pregnancy from her mother by  wearing

baggy  clothes.  And when her mother found her in a  pool

of  blood in the toilet, the teenage girl called out  her

boyfriend's  name and asked her mother to take revenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to act now to make sure that our system

can  address  the multi-faceted problem of  babies  being

abandoned and left to die.
