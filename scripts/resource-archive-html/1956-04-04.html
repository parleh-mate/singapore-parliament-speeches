<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to inform the Assembly that I

granted permission to be absent from the Assembly to the following Members:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MR. L. W. DONOUGH (Retirement) (Tributes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to inform hon. Members that, on

the advice of the Medical Officer in charge of

Officials, the Clerk of the Assembly, Mr Donough,

asked to be allowed to proceed on retirement leave

on the 1st of April last, and that his request has,

with great regret, been granted by His Excellency

the Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not say that His Excellency's regret is

shared by me and, I am sure, by hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Donough joined the Government in the General

Clerical Service on the 10th of April, 1922.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 1st of February, 1941, he was appointed an

officer of the Straits Settlements Civil Service and

on the 21st of October, 1949, an officer of the

Colonial Administrative Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about 19 years in the General Clerical

Service and before he became attached to the

Legislature, Mr Donough served as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Administrative Officer, Department of Supply,

Malaya.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private Secretary to Secretary for Economic

Affairs, Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Superintendent of Census, Malaya

(Headquarter), Ipoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 1st of March, 1948, he became the Clerk of

then Advisory Council and on the 1st of April, 1948,

the Clerk of Councils, Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter post was abolished and a new

appointment of Clerk of the Legislative Council  was

created with effect from the 1st of December,  1951.

Mr  Donough filled that post and became  the  first

Clerk  of this Legislative Assembly during the early

part last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Donough, on his retirement, has thus served

this country for a period of some 34 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My association with Mr Donough has been of a

very  short  duration - just over  a  year - but  during

that  short  period  I have become  aware  of,  his

sterling  quality as a loyal, capable and completely

efficient officer, who has never hesitated  to  give

of his utmost under any circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His grasp of the intricacies of Parliamentary

practice  and procedure is second to none,  and  his

retirement  is indeed a great loss to this  Assembly

and to this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that now that he has been relieved of the

anxieties and stresses of his post, Mr Donough will

soon  recover  his  health, and that  he and  Mrs.

Donough will enjoy a happy and contented retirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I rise to associate  the  Government

Benches   with  the  expressions  of   regret   and

appreciation  which you have just made - regret,  Sir,

that  the  heavy pressure of duties during the  past

year   has   taken  so  grievous  a   toll   on   so

conscientious an officer. We who have known him, we - and this refers to everyone of us - who have benefited

by  his  assistance, his guidance and his  courtesy,

feel a greater regret at the loss of a very able and

a very efficient officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hope, Sir, that not only will he

be fully recovered during the next few months of his

leave,  but that Singapore may yet benefit from  his

services in other departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of all the Members on the

Government Benches, I would like to express  to  Mr

Donough our sincere good wishes on his retirement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  this occasion the Opposition Benches would  also

like to express regret over the retirement of a very

able officer. Indeed, Sir, Mr Donough has proved to

everyone  here that he is capable and that  he  will

render  aid  to  all  Assemblymen,  irrespective  of

whether  they are on the Government Benches  or  on

the Opposition Benches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has shown that he is able to take on work which

should indeed have been done by more people, and  we

have   seen  that  his  Office  has  been  run  very

efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, his deep understanding of

Parliamentary procedure has been of great  help  to

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to express also our wishes for his

happy retirement and quick recovery.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

also  would  like,  if I may, to pay  tribute;  and,

speaking perhaps for once as a civil servant  rather

than  as  a Member of this House, I should  like  to

say,  Sir, that to me Mr Donough was an outstanding

example of the finest type of civil servant. He  was

conscientious,  a master of his subject,  efficient,

and  completely  loyal  to the  principles  of  his

service  and  quite  unsparing  of  himself  in  his

thoroughness  and in his sense of duty.  It  was  by

these qualities that, as you have said, Sir, he  won

his  promotion  from  the Clerical  Service  to  the

Administrative Service and, finally,  to  the  very

responsible post of Clerk of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past three years, Sir, particularly in

the  two  years preceding the constitution  of  this

Assembly, I saw a great deal of Mr Donough  and  of

his  work, and I cannot speak too highly of  it.  He

was never satisfied, Sir, unless everything was done

properly and efficiently, and, as you have said,  he

had  a detailed knowledge of Parliamentary procedure

which was of great benefit to everyone of us in this

House and in the previous Legislative Council; and he

had,  what is more, Sir, an intense loyalty to  the

principles   and   traditions;   of   Parliamentary

government.  He was, quite rightly, most  jealous

of the rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



of   Members   of  the  Legislature   and   of   the

independence of the Legislature from the  Executive,

and  he  defended  both  of those  principles  quite

fearlessly.  He  was  always  respectful   and   yet

dignified, but he was insistent on anything he  held

to  be  right; and both this Assembly, Sir, and  the

previous  Legislative Councils owe him a great  debt

of  gratitude for his knowledge and his wisdom,  and

we shall sorely miss his guidance in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully share the regrets that have been expressed

that  his  keen  sense  of  responsibility  and  his

refusal  to  spare himself in the  service  of  this

Assembly  have overtaxed his health so that  he  now

has  to give up this work to which he was so devoted

and  in  which he so excelled. I know I  can  speak,

Sir,  on behalf of my officials, both in this  House

and  throughout  the public service, in  associating

ourselves with the tributes that have been  paid  to

one  of our colleagues. It is with real regret  that

we  lose  one who was an example to us and a friend,

and  we  join,  Sir, most sincerely in  wishing  Mr

Donough good health and happiness in his retirement,

and  I  hope  that  he will see the  fruits  of  his

labours in the future conduct of this Assembly.

Commerce   and   Industry  whether   an   Industrial

Development Corporation is now in process  of  being

set  up;  and  whether  he  will  make  a  statement

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, discussions with the

Government  of the Federation of Malaya and  various

financial  institutions for a large scale Industrial

Finance   Corporation  are  still  proceeding.   The

Singapore Government is considering, however, taking

direct  action  through  an  organisation  under  my

Ministry   to   stimulate  and   assist   industrial

development not requiring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



major  capital assistance, and I hope that  concrete

proposals will be placed before this Assembly at  an

early date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's economic policy was announced to

this  House  in  His  Excellency's  Address  at  the

inaugural  meeting on 22nd April of last year.  This

policy  has been consistently pursued. I would  also

refer the Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng)  to

the  detailed reply given by my friend and colleague

the  Chief Minister (then concurrently the  Minister

for Commerce and Industry) to the Member for Tanglin

(Mr  Ede)  on trade and industry contained  in  the

Official  Report of the Assembly, Vol. 1, No.  6  of

29th June, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to

me  that that policy has brought nothing tangible to

Singapore,  and we would like to know, too,  whether

he  will  give  an indication that  the  policy  has

indeed been stepped up to get more industries going.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, my answer is that the

Government  is encouraging the industrialisation  of

Singapore as much as possible, and beyond  that,  if

the  hon. Member wishes to have details of  what  we

are  doing, I would like to invite him to come  over

<div align="center"><b>INCIDENTS AT KALLANG MASS RALLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether

he  will  make  a  statement on the  result  of  the

investigations  into  the causes  of  the  incidents

which took place at the Kallang Mass Rally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Yes, Sir,Investigations into the

causes  of  the disorder at the Kallang  Mass  Rally

have not yet been completed, but so far there is  no

evidence  of  any premeditated plan for interference

with the rally or to create disorder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The causes of the incidents appear to be four.

First,   the  collapse  of  the  platform  and   the

consequent   disorganisation  of  the  arrangements.

Second,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



the  angry frustration of a section of the crowd who

were thus denied the speeches they had come to hear.

Thirdly, a heavy shower of rain which caused part of

the  crowd to break into the terminal building; and,

fourthly, the potential hostility to the police of a

certain  section of the crowd. The police  had  been

apprehensive  before  the rally  that  any  incident

might set off serious disorders. The collapse of the

platform  before  the speeches started  disorganised

the   arrangements  and  disrupted  the  loudspeaker

system,   and  the  rally  then  divided  into   two

groups - one group round the platform and one group in

front  of the terminal building. Around the platform

there was a state of disorder. There were shouts  to

beat  up  the police on duty and some of  the  crowd

began  to  pick up missiles to throw at the  police.

Political  leaders there tried to quieten the  crowd

and  songs, such as "Unity is strength", were  sung.

After  about  half  an  hour  the  crowd  round  the

platform moved over to the terminal building to hear

the  speeches,  but owing to the  breakdown  of  the

loudspeakers, they could not do so. At four  minutes

past  six the Parliamentary delegation and  most  of

the  political leaders left. A large section of  the

crowd did not realise that the meeting was over  and

continued  to  shout and make a lot of noise.  About

this  time  it began to rain and most of  the  crowd

started  to  move  off;  but about  3,000  remained,

singing and shouting. There was also some dancing. A

section  of this crowd sought shelter from the  rain

in  the  terminal  building,  breaking  through  the

doors.  As  they  were  disorderly  and  were  doing

damage,  the  police ejected them from the  building

and a police cordon was posted outside the building.

The;  singing  and dancing continued and  it  became

clear that this crowd of about 3,000 was excited and

dissatisfied  and  demanding to hear  their  leaders

speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police on duty were jeered and taunted by

youths  in  the crowd and three spaces were  cleared

for dancing. At about 6.40 p.m. the chanting became



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



more  excited  and  a  number of  youths  were  seen

working up their companions, lobbing pieces of wood,

poles  and banners at the police who remained steady

at  their  posts. Suddenly a section of  this  crowd

picked  up  stones from a heap of rubble  and  threw

them  at the police and at the building. The stone-throwers  were mainly youths and the  stoning  was

started  by  a  small group whose  numbers  quickly

increased  to  about 300 or more.  The  police  then

moved forward with batons, using their raincoats as

shields against the stones, and for about 15 minutes

the  crowd  alternately fell back before the  police

and  advanced  again throwing stones, until  finally

they were dispersed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of several hundred attacked the

police  field  post and the St. John Ambulance  post

with bottles and stones. They also were dispersed by

the police and the whole area was finally cleared at

five minutes past seven.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 police officers suffered minor injuries and 15

members  of  the public were treated for  injuries,

all  of  them minor except one, who was admitted  to

the  hospital with cut in the head. One police  van,

some police radio equipment and a St. John ambulance

were damaged and most of the windows in the terminal

building  were  smashed.  Eight  persons  have  been

arrested and charged with rioting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police had been apprehensive of disorder

because  of slighting references made to the police

at  several  P.A.P. meetings  and  because  of  the

campaign  in the Press by a large group of so-called

Chinese  cultural associations and students  during

the  previous  two weeks protesting against  police

refusals  to issue licences for the performance  of

songs and dances of Communist  meaning. These

organisations held a further protest meeting at  the

Badminton Hall immediately prior to the mass  rally.

After  it,  at  about 4 p.m., some  4,000  to  5,000

youths  from that meeting marched in an orderly  and

disciplined  manner to the rally.   They  carried  a

large  banner depicting the Communist dove of peace.

When  they  encountered police officers  on  duty,

there was organised shouting of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



Merdeka. Their attitude was one of contempt for  the

police   and  very  markedly  different  from   the

friendly and cheerful mood of the vast majority  of

the crowd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot emphasise too strongly, Sir, the danger

to  law  and  order  in  Singapore  of  deliberately

fostering  ill-will and ridicule of the police  who

have  to  maintain  and restore order.  Should  the

authority  of  the  police be undermined,  then  any

incident can lead to serious riots. On this occasion

we  were  fortunate that the vast majority  of  the

crowd  were  good tempered and orderly  and  behaved

like  decent citizens, and the disorderly few never

got out of hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to commend the restraint and

discipline of the police on duty at Kallang and  the

services rendered by the St. John Ambulance  men  on

duty amidst the disorders; and I wish to acknowledge

fully,  Sir  the  efforts made by several  political

leaders,  including Members of this House,  to  calm

down the crowd and get them to disperse.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, the following steps have been

taken to bring the electoral register up to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Approximately 57,000 new voters are being

brought on to the roll.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Enquiry is being made of all new voters who

were recorded as having British nationality but  who

were  born  outside the United Kingdom and Colonies,

the  Federation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak,

to ascertain their citizenship status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) 65,000 changes of addresses have been

recorded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A regular check is being made of deaths

notified  to the Registrar of Births and Deaths  and

all deaths registered. Deletions are also being made

from  the  electoral roll of persons  who  surrender

their  identity  cards  on  departure  from  Malaya.

Approximately  13,000 deletions from the  roll  have

now been made as regards death and departure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The names of persons obtaining registration as

citizens  of  the  United Kingdom and  Colonies  and

naturalised  as British subjects are being  included

in the roll. About 500 persons are affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The names are also being included on the

register of locally domiciled persons serving in the

armed services and with the police who are qualified

as  electors  but do not hold identity cards.  About

1,000 persons are so involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The electoral register has been checked for

duplication and incorrect identity card numbers  and

enquiry is being made in each individual case  where

possible.  There  are  about  450  persons  in  this

category.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Can the Hon. the Chief Secretary

however,  to  say  that the delay extends  to  three

months.  Changes  in  school staffs  operative  from

January make the preparation and checking of the new

year  salary bills a very complicated task. In order

to  assist  schools over the difficult  period,  all

say   that  there  is  a  shortage  of  doctors   in

Singapore.  The Medical Advisory Council advises  me

that  there are 484 doctors on the medical register,

but,  measured  by international standards,  with  a

population  of 1,200,000 in Singapore, we  ought  to

have 1,300 doctors if a full medical cover is to  be

provided for every citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, Sir, is fully explained

in  the  Explanatory  Note attached,  and  there  is

little I think I need add.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does two things. It requires the

registration  of  the name of the child  within  one

year  from the date of its birth and gives a  period

of  one  year in which the name of the child can  be

changed,  as  I understand not infrequently  happens

here.  As  the  law  now stands,  the  name  can  be

registered on payment of a fee for a period of seven

years from the date of birth. This has caused a good

deal  of  trouble over the admission of children  to

schools.   When  parents  come  to  register   their

children,  they  find  that  the  birth  certificate

either has not got a name on it, or it has the wrong

name  on  it,  and  they then  have  to  go  to  the

inconvenience   and  expense  of  making   statutory

declarations  to get the uncertainty put  right.  On

general  grounds as well, it is desirable  that  the

name  of  the child should be registered as soon  as

possible after the child has been born. So the  Bill

requires  that  the name shall be registered  within

one  year.  Provision  is,  however,  made  for  the

Registrar-General in special cases to allow the name

to be registered up to seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main provision of this Bill is that it

ends  the temporary provision which was made in 1946

extending the period for registration to make up for

the  loss  of time during the period of the Japanese

occupation.  That temporary provision is  no  longer

required  and  will  be  ended  when  this  Bill  is

enacted. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill arises from certain recommendations made by the

Hawkins  Commission  on Public Passenger  Transport,

recommendations  concerning  the  licensing  of  the

routes used by buses. The Commission found that  the

existing system of licensing procedures followed was

unsatisfactory, and in this respect they recommended

that  there  should be a single Licensing  Authority

for  the whole island and that this Authority should

not  consist  of an elected body of members  of  the

public;  and  they  further  recommended  that,   in

setting  up  such a Licensing Authority, due  regard

must  be  given  to  the  special  position  of  the

Singapore   Traction  Company  under  the  Singapore

Traction Ordinance. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



Bill  accepts  these recommendations  and  seeks  to

implement them. It sets up a single Authority and  a

common system following very closely section 326  of

the Municipal Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it may be helpful at this stage if I

comment  on  certain clauses in the Bill.  Clause  3

provides that the Authority shall consist of  public

servants.  It is intended at present that we  should

have  three  public  servants as  an  immediate  and

essential   step   to  obtain  a  single   Licensing

Authority.  Later  it  would be  desirable  that  we

should have an expert - probably a single expert - who,

after  becoming a public servant, would be appointed

as  the Licensing Authority. That would be following

paragraph 134 (v) of the Hawkins Report, but for the

time  being  we are following paragraph 245  of  the

report for the interim stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be interested to know the particular

officers  we  have in mind for the  Authority.  They

would  be  the  President of the City  Council,  the

Chairman  of  the  Rural Board,  and  the  Permanent

Secretary  to  the  Ministry of  Communications  and

Works. This would provide that the interests of  the

urban  and  rural areas were adequately  represented

and  that  the Ministry concerned with the operation

of the Ordinance was also represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I should refer perhaps to one

amendment  I  have to move. It was found  after  the

Bill  had been printed that, in fact, the definition

of "public servant" would be held not to include the

President  of  the City Council. It seems  a  highly

legal  point to me, but in any case we have  cleared

it up by an amendment which will make it quite clear

that he is a public servant for the purposes of this

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the general directions in clause 4, certain

recommendations are made in the Hawkins Report as to

what,  for  the  interim  period,  would  be  proper

directions. These are found in paragraph 246 of  the

report.  These  recommendations would  be  that  the

Licensing  Authority  should  not,  at  this  stage,

attempt to achieve any major reorganisation  of  the

routes and that it should,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



for  the  time  being,  confine  itself  to  new  or

extended  routes  where at present no  services  are

provided. Further, that for the time being, licences

should  be limited to six months, as they have  been

in  the  past.  If  later we have  a  single  expert

serving  as  the  Authority, it will  no  doubt  be

appropriate  that  we should cancel  or  modify  the

directions given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 (2) follows section 326 of the Municipal

Ordinance,  and  the point about not  exceeding  one

year  might be queried by hon. Members who will have

noted in the report that it is suggested that if  we

were to maintain a system of separate ownership  for

the  different bus companies, a period of a year for

the  licence is insufficient and they should have  a

longer  period so that they would have some security

and encouragement to invest fresh capital. I am glad

to  report, however, that although this Bill and the

Hawkins Report have been before the public, there is

no  sign whatever of any absence of applications  by

the  bus  companies to extend their routes.  On  the

contrary, the particular urgency of this Bill arises

from  the  fact  that  such an  enormous  number  of

applications  are pending and should  not  be  dealt

with  under  the old system. It is the view  of  the

Government,  in  agreement  with  the  report,  that

separate  ownerships cannot, as things are,  produce

an efficient transport system which really meets the

needs of the travelling public, and consequently  we

should  not  take  any action  which  is  likely  to

perpetuate that system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso to clause 5 (2) may possibly raise a

query  somewhere, and I might deal  with  that  now.

This proviso is necessary because of sections 32 and

63  of  the Singapore Traction Ordinance. I  do  not

think   I  need  quote  those  rather  lengthy   and

complicated  sections, but if anybody wants  to,  he

can  go into them. But, briefly, where the Singapore

Traction Company is referred to in this Bill,  both

in  the proviso to clause 5 (2) and elsewhere, it is

because  it  is  necessary that we should  recognise

that  they  have a charter and they have to  operate

under  it as long as they have not been taken  over.

It would be highly contrary to public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>

policy  to  deprive them of the charter  which  they

have been given by law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be moving one or two other minor

amendments,  Mr  Speaker, in  the  course  of  this

debate. They are not of any great significance. They

are  minor consequential and drafting changes. Sir,

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, previously

the  licensing authority for omnibuses  was  in  the

hands  of  the  City Council and the  Rural  Board.

During  that  period we have many bus routes  coming

into  operation, and, according to my  observations,

we  find that some of the bus routes are confined to

the  city  area whereas others are mainly  in  rural

districts. The difficulty encountered by  the  rural

people to come down town is indeed immense. Take the

case of a person coming down from the R.A.F. base at

Seletar to Tanjong Pagar. He will find that  he  has

to  change  buses twice. Now we hope that all  these

difficulties will be overcome by the setting up of a

single  Authority which will take over the functions

exercised  previously by the City  Council  and  the

Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally believe that any services provided

should work for the benefit of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



large  numbers of people instead of for the  benefit

of  companies, and I hope that when this Bill  comes

into operation, the Licensing Authority will bear in

mind  this fact - that it is to license buses not  for

the  convenience or profit of the companies but  for

the convenience of the people using them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be interesting, Sir, to know why the

powers  vested in the hands of the City Council  and

the Rural Board previously should be transferred  to

a  single  Licensing Authority,  and  why  a  larger

number  of  people should not be more preferable  on

this board. I will raise this question again when it

comes up during the Committee stage and will propose

an  amendment to this effect. We feel, in fact, that

it  would  be better to have more people on  such  a

board to determine the routes of buses. We feel that

not  only should the people at the top of the public

service be given a voice to determine the routes  of

buses,  because  they have good judgment,  but  also

people  who know the rural folks or town  folks  who

are  using the buses should also be given  a  voice.

They  are the people who are going to use the buses.

They are the people who know the difficulties or the

inconvenience encountered, and not people  who  ride

to  and  from their offices in cars. This should  be

borne  in mind, and that is why I feel that to  have

three persons to serve as the Licensing Authority is

not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, today we are coming to a stage where

we  are  asking  for equality for all.  We  are  not

fighting  for  any one section of the public.  If  a

certain  law is applicable to A, it must be  equally

applicable  to  B and to C and to other  people.  We

find  that,  because  of the  old  system,  we  have

preferential treatment for one company  and  another

kind  of treatment for another company. I feel  that

that is wrong and that, if this Assembly is fighting

for  equality and shouting at the top of  its  voice

that it is fighting for equality, then even in small

matters we should also fight for equality.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have here a company that has been given a

charter,  a  company  that  is  taxed  at  a   fixed

percentage.  This company will be able to  go  ahead

with  expansion  feeling very secure  that  it  will

recoup its capital. If this company has trouble with

its  workers, or if its buses get out of  order,  it

need  not  lose money on that account. On the  other

hand,  the  other bus companies have to take  out  a

licence for each of their buses; and whether the bus

runs  for 30 days in a month or one day in a  month,

the  companies  have still to pay the  same  licence

fees. If there is a strike, which may or may not  be

their   fault,  they  may  lose,  because  the   bus

companies  will  still have to  pay  their  fees.  I

certainly feel, Sir, that in an instance like  this,

if   we   cannot  remove  the  special  preferential

treatment  given  to  one  company,  it  should   be

possible  for  us to move the other  way  round  and

allow   the  other  bus  companies  to  enjoy  equal

advantages. Is that not equality? Is that  not  what

we  are fighting for? When that charter or when that

preferential   treatment   has   been   removed   by

nationalisation,  then let us subject  all  the  bus

companies to the same level of taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, licensing as envisaged in this Bill on

the  basis  of  half  a year  or  one  year  is  not

conducive to the expansion of the bus companies,  if

I  am  to invest some money in a project, I must  be

reasonably sure that it will help me to go on  until

at least my bus is out of order or condemned; but if

I have to buy a new bus at great cost and after half

a  year  find  that the licence has been  suspended,

then I may not want to put in as much money into the

business as I would like to. I ask you, Sir, when  a

situation like this develops, who suffers? It is not

the Government, but it is the people who will not be

provided with such facilities. It is the people  who

live far away in rural areas who will not be able to

get their buses as frequently as they should get.  I

believe  such  a matter should be looked  into  very

carefully and the period of licensing extended.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

not  a  great deal I wish to say on this Bill except

this.  I assume that, as the Government has accepted

the  recommendations of the Transport Commission  in

so  far  as  it  has agreed to set  up  a  Licensing

Authority  at  the  transition stage,  it  has  also

accepted  the  recommendation  to  nationalise   the

transport system in accordance with the Labour Front

platform.  That  being  so,  I  consider  that   the

Minister  should tell us more clearly what the  next

steps are which the Government proposes to take.  It

is   unreasonable  to  keep  the  bus  companies  in

suspense  in  this matter. It means  that  they  are

unable  or unwilling to plan improvements  in  their

services,   and  this  means  that  the  unfortunate

travelling  public will suffer. This House  and  the

travelling  public have a right  to  know  what  the

precise  intentions  of  Government  are.  Will  the

Minister  tell  us  whether or  not  the  Government

proposes to carry out its election promises?' On the

assumption  that  it intends to do so,  we  consider

that the next step to take is to appoint as soon  as

possible  a  transport and traffic expert  who  will

have to undertake the task of nationalisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the hon. Member indicate

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I was going on to explain, Sir, that I

thought  that  the sooner this expert gets  down  to

work,  the  better it would be, for he should  be  a

member of the Licensing Authority from the start  so

that  he could direct operations from the transition

stage. I hope that we can have an assurance from the

Minister that this key man is being looked for  now,

and that he will be a man of considerable practical

experience in public transport matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes, Sir. Some interesting points were

raised, Mr Speaker, in this debate. We had  a  very

fervent address to open with - that the Authority must

serve  the people - but it was rather confused.  I  do

not think that the hon. Member quite grasped what it

is all about, but he spoke with great enthusiasm for

the  rights  of  the people and I  fully  share  his

sentiments.  I  have  no  doubt  at  all  that   the

Authority  will  serve the people  to  the  greatest

degree  that  they  can be served  in  the  existing

circumstances where an inefficient past  system  and

the   very  naturally  competitive  claims  of   bus

companies have created what is, in fact, a very  bad

system  where  services cannot run  efficiently  and

where the public suffers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member was concerned about equality of

treatment   for  the  companies,  and,  of   course,

equality is a very desirable thing; but I am  afraid

that  if  you have a millionaire and you cannot  tax

him,  it  is not practical policy that we must  make

everybody  into millionaires, which is broadly  what

he was suggesting. If the Singapore Traction Company

has special privileges by charter, the hon. Member's

solution  is that we should give all other companies

equal  privileges  and then proceed  to  nationalise

them!  A delightful thought, that having given  them

extra privileges we then pay them for the privileges

we have given them, and thus charge the unhappy tax-payer  a  further large sum of money  for  conceding

what we should not have conceded at all! I am afraid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



that  this  is not a very wise financial policy  and

one which I certainly could not advocate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also anxious that six months is the

practice and that a year is the maximum under clause

5  (2)  for  the grant of a licence, and  that  this

might prevent people from putting fresh capital into

seeking  to  expand new routes. He is  living  in  a

happy state of ignorance. If he had referred to  his

own  Party  Members in the City Council, they  could

have  informed him that there are no  less  than  63

applications  now  outstanding for consideration  by

the  City  Council. With this Bill already published

and  if  he regards 63 applications under the shadow

of  nationalisation as intimidating the capitalists,

I  can  assure  him  that they  are  not  so  easily

intimidated. There is no sign at present of a drying-up  of  the desire of the companies to expand  their

services.  Therefore, that particular scare  on  his

part,  I  can  assure him, is quite unnecessary.  He

need   have  no  apprehensions  as  to  the  present

situation.  The  companies are only too  anxious  to

obtain  more routes in order, no doubt, to reap  the

benefit in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede asked that we

should state our policy. This is a favourite request

which comes up again and again. I can bring out  our

little  green  booklet  which  says  that  we   will

nationalise  the public passenger transport  system,

but  I  think I might usefully say a few words about

policy  in general since the Opposition are  anxious

for  it.  Nationalisation is our policy and for  the

purposes of this industry, that means that  we  must

use  public ownership to bring industry under public

control.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest that the Minister

confine himself to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, I have no

particular desire to elaborate on our policy. It can

be  dealt with later, but not in this debate. But if

a question is put down, we can certainly provide for

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is nothing else, Mr Speaker, for me

to  answer in reply except to say that the need  for

an  expert to deal with the situation is very  fully

realised.  Nobody  supposes that  a  body  of  three

public  officers  will, by the mere  fact  of  being

appointed, become immediately traffic experts. All I

can  say  is that they will undoubtedly be far  more

efficient  than  the very large  body  of  popularly

elected  people  who  have  been  dealing  with  the

situation in the past. The point that the larger the

number  of  people dealing with traffic  routes  the

better  is  a  fantastic  misunderstanding  of   the

situation.  The  damage to the transport  system  of

Singapore, the whole muddle and confusion  that  now

exist  have arisen because there has been this large

number of heads all representing people of different

areas  and  all with confused views. The result  has

been  serious inefficiency in the transport  system,

because  there  has  not  been  a  proper  means  of

exercising control over the licensing. I do not wish

to  express  opinions about it, but it is  perfectly

clear that the transport map of Singapore at present

is  a mess, and as long as you continue to have  the

present  system, you will merely get more  and  more

into  a  mess. Very radical steps will be needed  to

get   the   mess  cleared  up  and  to   provide   a

satisfactory system for the future, but those  steps

cannot  be  taken  immediately.  They  have  to   be

prepared for and provided for. But what we can do is

to set up a Licensing Authority which will ensure at

least   that   the   situation  does   not   further

deteriorate  and  that we do  maintain  as  much  of

reason and wisdom in the allocation of routes as  is

possible. Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I have

heard the Minister in charge of this Bill state that

the  present chaotic conditions of licensing are due

to  many heads with confused views representing  too

many  people,  but I believe that that  is  not  the

case.  I  personally feel that the chaos is  due  to

people  who, though they are dealing with licensing,

know  nothing about what is best for the  people.  I

have heard that the three Government servants to  be

appointed are the President of the City Council, the

Chairman  of  the  Rural Board,  and  the  Permanent

Secretary  to  the  Ministry of  Communications  and

Works. They are all fine men, Sir, but I think  that

they  all  ride in cars and that whatever news  they

have  about the convenience of using buses  is  only

second-hand. They do not have first-hand experience,

and  I  believe that if we leave licensing  to  such

people alone, you might have fair licensing but  you

will  not  have efficient licensing.  You  may  have

services  to  which bus owners might  agree,  but  I

doubt whether these people will come to the question

of making them convenient for the people using them.

These  three public servants must be assisted.  That

is  the reason why I propose that amendment. We  may

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



three  good men, but let two other persons who  know

the  difficulties of the travelling public  come  in

and  assist them. It will also give people  who  are

outside  Government service a chance to voice  their

opinions.  I  do  not say that we must  have  people

coming from political ranks. I would say no to that.

They must not be people connected with politics.  If

my  amendment is accepted, the Government  is  still

free to appoint whom they think fit, and I feel that

two  more  knowledgeable heads would be better  than

three  heads  who  do  not know anything  about  the

conditions of the travelling public.

think  they knew enough about the condition  of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think we can accept this

amendment, Sir. It is one which has previously  been

considered  and  I have, in fact,  had  one  or  two

letters from members of the public to say that  they

thought there might be a case for putting members of

the public on this Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out the extremely invidious

and  unpleasant position any such man would have  to

occupy.  There is considerable money to be made  out

of  securing a new route, and consequently a  burden

of coffee-shop talk does attach itself to the people

who have the duty of allocating routes. It would  be

extremely  hard on anybody not a public  servant  to

have to bear that weight of contention when he says,

"I think we should give this route and we should not

give  that." He has to make a choice - "I have to give

it  to  this company and not to that company." These

are  painful and difficult decisions and  it  is  an

unnecessary  burden to impose. To find some  men  to

carry that burden seems to me to be unnecessary. The

hon.  Member  envisages that these two men  will  be

able  to  voice the opinions of the public, but,  in

fact,  the  public have every facility  for  voicing

their  opinions either in this Assembly or elsewhere

or in the newspapers or by direct representations to

the  Minister dealing with transport.  There  is  no

special  advantage  in having their  representations

directly    on    the   Authority   itself.    Their

representations   can  reach  the  Authority   quite

successfully. If we put two people on, who will each

necessarily  reside in some particular district,  to

them  will attach the suspicion that they  are  more

interested  in  their  own district  than  in  other

districts.  It  would  expose  them  again  to   the

question   of   doubt.  These  are   the   sort   of

disadvantages   which  would  follow   without   any

corresponding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>

advantages  in  getting, in fact, any better  advice

than  is available anyhow, and which would be  fully

taken  into  account by the various responsible  and

senior  officers who are envisaged for  the  interim

period as the Licensing Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the hon. Member that the suggestion

of  a  public  body of members of the Authority  not

being  officers of the Government was  dismissed  by

the Hawkins Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should have said in my opening speech that

we  have the Highways Coordination Committee already

set  up  which has already been consulted about  bus

routes  and  bus  matters  and,  in  fact,  it   has

expressed the greatest concern at the possibility of

some  of the applications now pending being granted,

because  it thought it might lead to a very serious

deterioration   in  the  traffic   situation.   This

Highways  Co-ordination Committee will be  available

and  will be used for consultative purposes  by  the

Licensing  Authority  when it is  dealing  with  the

problems of specific routes and whether they  should

be   granted  or  not.  The  Highways  Co-ordination

Committee  includes  the  City  Council,  the  Rural

Board, the planners of the S.I.T., the Registrar  of

Vehicles'  Office, the Public Works  Department  and

the  Police, and thus covers effectively the  wisdom

of  this  country, such as it is,  in  dealing  with

matters  of  transport  and road  communications.  I

therefore  regretfully  say this  amendment  is  not

acceptable to the Government.

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, and the regulations under it as

contained  in the Second Schedule deal with  a  very

complicated   and  technical  matter,  namely,   the

provisions  governing  the awards  of  pensions  and

gratuities  to  members of the public service.  Very

detailed  notes have been added to the  Bill.  These

notes draw attention to and they explain all changes

which have been made to the present law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and main object of this Bill, Sir, is to

consolidate  and bring up to date our  pensions  law

which  is now 27 years old and has been amended  and

needs consolidating and revising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main purpose of this Bill is to provide

one  uniform  scheme of pensions and gratuities  for

all  members of the public service of Singapore  and

that  will  do  away with the invidious  distinction

which  previously existed between those  members  of

the public service who were on what was known as the

Singapore  Establishment  and  whose  pensions   and

gratuities  were governed by the Singapore  Pensions

Ordinance,  and  the other set of  officers  in  the

public service here who used to be on what was known

as  the Malayan Establishment and were on a separate

series of pension regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this consolidating Bill, we have

extended  to all officers in the public service  the

pension   factor  of  one  six-hundredth   (1/600th)

instead     of    one    seven-hundred-and-twentieth

(1/720th)-1/600th being the factor which  previously

was applied to officers on the Malayan Establishment only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of other comparatively minor changes have

been  made  in  the Bill. They are  improvements  to

bring the law into line with modern practice and, as

Members  will see from the Comparative Table printed

at  the  very end of the Bill, we have, to  a  great

extent,  followed the legislation which was  enacted

in the Federation in 1951. There is one change which

perhaps  I  should mention at this  stage  which  is

peculiar to Singapore in the sense that we  are  not

in  line with the Federation on it; and that is that

we have made a change in what is known as the normal

age for compulsory retirement. That at present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



is  55  and in this Bill, clause 9 (a) changes  that

for officers joining the service after this Bill has

been   enacted  whose  normal  age  for   compulsory

retirement  will  be 60. We have made  this  change,

Sir,  to  take account of the fact that the  general

age of the population here has become higher than it

used  to  be, and with the expansion of  the  public

service  we feel that the Government can  no  longer

afford  to allow officers to retire at an  age  when

they  are  still  capable  of  giving  further  good

service  to the public. The change, as I have  said,

will only be applied to officers joining the service

after this Bill comes into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been under consideration for a long

time  and has been discussed in great detail in  the

Civil  Service Joint Council, and the Staff Side  of

that   Council  have  accepted  the  Bill  and   the

regulations as they are printed, subject only to one

reservation. That reservation is that the Staff Side

reserve   the  right  at  a  later  date   to   make

representations asking for an option to retire to be

given  to officers at 45, whereas now it is 50.  The

Staff  Side  are not, at the moment,  pressing  that

point  but  they wish to be free to raise  it  later

should they so decide, and in the meanwhile they  do

not wish the enacting of this Bill to be delayed  on

that account. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we note the

statement of the Hon. the Chief Secretary  that  the

Staff  Side  of the Civil Service has  accepted  the

Bill   with  the  reservation  that  they  can  make

representations   as   to  the   optional   age   of

retirement. I wish to place on record the  point  of

view of my Party that, with rapid Malayanisation  of

the   civil  service,  it  becomes  more  and   more

imperative  that  experienced local officers  should

stay in the service for a much longer time than they

were previously allowed. But at the same time it may

be  in the interest of the country as a whole if the

recommendations  of  the Committee  on  the  Age  of

Retirement, which were published on 19th  September,

1952, were given careful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



consideration, and enacted in an amendment  to  this

Bill. This Committee's Report at page 7 says:



"(a)  that  an  officer  be  allowed  to  retire  on

pension,  and  that  the Government  be  allowed  to

require him so to retire, when, or after, he reaches

the  age of 45, or completes 20 years in the  public

service,  whichever is the later; provided  that  at

the  age  of  50 it should be possible  for  him  to

retire  or  be  retired irrespective  of  length  of

service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)

below, the age of 55 shall continue to be the age at

which Government officers will normally retire;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are in agreement with the

principles set out in clause 9 of the Bill that  the

normal age of retirement henceforth for officers who

join  the service after the passing of this Bill  be

raised  to  60.  It  may seem inconsistent  that  we

should  support the recommendation contained in  the

Committee's Report that there should be an  optional

age  of  retirement for serving officers  of  45  or

after 20 years' service, whichever is the later. But

one must consider the problem historically. Sometime

before the war the Government first, I think, in the

1930's began to recruit local officers in the  civil

service. It meant, in effect, that the most capable,

the  best  educated  and  those  with  the  greatest

capacity  to contribute to the political development

of this country joined the civil service. By British

traditions,  the  civil service is  neutral.  It  is

there - the  bureaucratic machinery  that  politicians

can  mount  and  operate. But in the  Federation  of

Malaya  they  discovered very early on that,  unless

this  rule was relaxed, it meant that a large number

of  capable men would be debarred from giving a much

bigger  contribution by having a hand in the shaping

of  the  political future of the country. When  this

Committee made this recommendation, I feel that such

considerations must have weighed on its mind. It  is

an open secret that there are many serving officers,

both in the Federation and in Singapore, who are men

who   could   contribute  more  to  the   political

development  of  this  country  than  the  host   of

politicians  that  have so far presented  themselves

before the electorate of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



country.  We therefore wish to place on  record  our

hope  that  in  the  not too distant  future,  after

further  discussions and consultations  between  the

Government and the Staff Side Council, an  amendment

to  this Bill, when it is passed, will be put before

this House incorporating the main recommendations of

this Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have indicated,

the  question of introducing an optional  retirement

necessary to make an amendment to the law  in  order

to bring it about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am somewhat flattered, I think, by the

suggestion that the People's Action Party  is  going

to  have to come to the Government service in  order

to get some people of better calibre into its ranks;

but,  at the same time, we will, of course, have  to

weigh  up  against the advantage that  I  know  that

would  have  for  the body politic the  disadvantage

that  it might have if we lost too many of the  key,

good,  efficient men in the public service in  order

to strengthen the political Parties.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency's permission for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



this  motion to be proceeded with. I will read, Sir,

a few passages from the Washington Declaration:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are conscious that in this year of 1956, there

still  rages the age-old struggle between those  who

believe  that man has his origin and his destiny  in

God  and  those who treat man as if he were designed

merely to serve a State machine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we deem it useful to declare again certain

truths  and aims upon which we are united and  which

we are persuaded are supported by all free nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our belief that the State should exist

for  the  benefit  of  the individual  and  not  the

individual for the benefit of the State,  we  uphold

the  basic right of peoples to governments of  their

own choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These beliefs of ours are far more than theory or

doctrine. They have been translated into the  actual

conduct of our policy both domestic and foreign.  We

are  parties  to  the Atlantic Charter,  the  United

Nations  Charter,  the  Potomac  Charter,  and   the

Pacific  Charter. In  them  we  have,  with   other

friends,  dedicated ourselves to the goal  of  self-government  and independence of all countries  whose

people  desire  and  are capable  of  sustaining  an

independent existence. During the past 10  and  more

years 600 million men and women in nearly a score of

lands   have,   with  our  support  and  assistance,

attained  nationhood. Many millions more  are  being

helped  surely  and steadily toward self-government.

Thus, the reality and effectiveness of what we  have

done is a proof of our sincerity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we know that political independence cannot

alone  assure  men and nations full  opportunity  to

pursue   happiness  and  to  fulfil  their   highest

destiny.  There  is,  likewise,  need  for  economic

sustenance and growth. This, too, we have helped  to

provide.  We  seek to develop with  others  a  large

volume of mutually beneficial trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise we seek, through technical assistance,

the Colombo Plan and other programmes we support, to

help   economic  progress  in  the  less   developed

countries and to raise the living standards of their

peoples. In these programmes we have not sought  nor

desired  extension of either economic  or  political

power.  The purpose is not to dilute but  to  enrich

and secure their freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While resolutely pursuing these aims, which are

the  products of our faith in God and in the peoples

of  the  earth, we shall eagerly grasp  any  genuine

opportunity to free mankind of the pall of fear  and

insecurity which now obscures what can and should be

a glorious future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these sonorous terms, Sir, that two great

leaders   of   the  free  world  have  shown   their

understanding  of the cry of subjugated  people  for

freedom and have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



promised  their unselfish aid and support - moral  and

material.  In the context of this Declaration,  Sir,

Singapore's struggle is but part of a world  pattern

accepted  as  natural,  as  healthy  and   even   as

praiseworthy. There is therefore no need to  explain

why  we want independence and no need to explain  to

these  statesmen why we want freedom, but the  Prime

Minister  and the President have made it clear  that

their  support and assistance is conditional on  two

factors.  The  first is that the  people  desire  an

independent existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to Merdeka Week, I freely admit that I

was  genuinely alarmed at assertions  made  in  very

responsible  quarters that the people  of  Singapore

wanted to pursue their normal vocations and were not

interested in political advance and that the call of

Merdeka   came   from   a   strident   minority   of

intellectuals.  It seemed to me, Sir,  that  such  a

view  could  have  very dangerous repercussions  for

Singapore.  It then seemed to me that it  was  vital

that  we should impress upon all observers who could

influence the Colonial Office of the truth, and this

had to be done before the 23rd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in other parts of the world and we

see today the tragic cost of wisdom after the event.

We wanted none of this wisdom after the event and  I

would  like  to  say for myself, Sir,  I  am  deeply

grateful  to all Parties in this House, and  to  the

majority of the Press, for recognising the peril and

awakening  the people of Singapore to  the  dangers.

Despite   a   sectional  campaign  of  vilification,

distortion and sometimes plain filth, the deep swell

of  the  people's wish came through the  smokescreen

clearly and firmly and I am glad to say that I  have

not  since heard any single responsible person  deny

that  the  great majority of the people of Singapore

actively  desire an end to colonial rule. Sir,  that

first  condition  of the Washington Declaration  can

therefore be taken to be admittedly satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second condition is that the people are

capable  of sustaining an independent existence.  In

the Colonial Office, this is transformed into that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>

famous   three-word  question  before  which   every

colonial delegation trembles. The question is,  "Are

you  viable?"  That  means  merely,  Sir,  "Are  you

capable   of  surviving  economically  without   any

special  external  economic  assistance?"  and   the

answer  for  Singapore is "Definitely, yes!"  It  is

true,  Sir, we receive assistance, for which we  are

grateful, from the Colonial Development and  Welfare

Fund.  We  receive some assistance from the  Colombo

Plan. They are helpful but they are not essential to

our  economy. We go to London, Sir, to seek the gift

of  our  freedom. We go to seek no  gift  of  money,

either in subsidy or in interest free loan or  under

any  other  name  whatsoever. Singapore  financially

undertakes  to  stand on its own  feet.  The  second

condition of the Washington Declaration, signed  but

two  months ago by the Prime Minister of the  United

Kingdom,  is  therefore fulfilled  and  we  can  now

truthfully  say  to  the United Kingdom  Government,

"Singapore is a ripe opportunity for the exercise of

those noble, humanitarian principles embodied in the

Washington Declaration. Help us to our feet."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) says,

"What  is this freedom?" It is independence we seek.

That  is  absolute.  It is independence  within  the

British  Commonwealth, and that is no  qualification

of  the absolute as the Prime Minister of India  has

so clearly demonstrated. Why do we want to be within

the  Commonwealth? Sir, the Commonwealth is a United

Nations  within the United Nations - a  more  flexible

instrument  for  co-operation because  there  is  no

constitution;  a  more efficient instrument  because

the  close  day-to-day relations of  the  individual

members make for a practical partnership. The  over-emphasis  on  European  interests  is  progressively

disappearing and the concept of the Commonwealth  is

emerging  as the most powerful instrument for  peace

and  freedom in the world of today. Furthermore, let

us remember, we who survive by virtue of our trading

activities, that our trade is appreciably within the

Commonwealth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



Singapore is prepared to contribute in full  measure

to  the  defence  requirements of the  Commonwealth.

Singapore  would  welcome an  equal  opportunity  to

contribute to the Commonwealth's policies Singapore,

Sir,  would be proud to be a partner with the  other

independent States within this association known  as

the Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reached this formula, Sir, of independence

within the Commonwealth as the framework of our  own

desires,  we  must  look at the vital  interests  of

other territories in this area. We do recognise that

Singapore is a very important fort in the  defence

strategy of the Commonwealth and its allied  nations

of   the  free  world.  This  is  known,  and  quite

erroneously, as the problem of the external  defence

of  Singapore. I say quite erroneously, Sir, because

it  has  nothing whatever to do with the defence  of

Singapore as such. The primary factor is the defence

of  the  other members of the Commonwealth  and  the

allied nations from Singapore and not the defence of

Singapore.  Now, Sir, having clarified this  concept

of external defence, the question does arise: should

Singapore concede to the Commonwealth the  right  to

use  this  island as a fort? We are realists - I  hope

all of us - and, as realists, we first face the brutal

facts  and the outstanding one is that we could  not

refuse  it  even  if we wanted to. As  a  reasonable

people,  we face realities and accept them. This  is

the reality we must face: that Singapore is vital to

the  free  world strategy to a point that  makes  it

unreasonable and impractical to refuse its use as  a

fort.  In  these  circumstances,  I  understand  all

Parties   are  agreed  that  we  should  allow   the

Commonwealth through the United Kingdom the  fullest

facilities for their defence needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to add this for myself, for some

Members  on the Government Benches and I  trust  for

some  Members on the Opposition Benches.  There  are

other  reasons both moral and material which support

this decision. There are those of us, and of them  I

am  one,  who believe with all our hearts  that  the

institution of parliamentary democracy is the finest

political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



institution for the full development of the  people.

We  believe it is an institution worth fighting and

worth  dying  for. We believe Singapore should  take

its place shoulder to shoulder with the other States

of  the Commonwealth and the free world in any armed

struggle  to  defend  the  ideals  of  freedom   and

parliamentary  democracy.  We  also   believe   that

Singapore should shoulder the obligations as well as

the  privileges of its unique geographical  position

and  finally, Sir, it may seem sordid but it  is  an

important point, I would remind Members of the House

that  one-sixth of our labour force is  employed  by

the  armed forces and the contribution of the  armed

forces   to   our  economy  is  quite  considerable.

Therefore, Sir, whether we approach this problem  as

practical  men  only or whether we  approach  it  as

practical and moral men, the answer is the same.  We

are  all agreed that concurrently with independence,

we  will  give  all  necessary  control  for  United

Kingdom   defence  commitments.  This  agreement   I

understand all Parties are prepared to undertake  to

honour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, external defence is to some extent

affected  by  external  relations  and  by  internal

security.  In  the realm of external  relations,  we

seek  for Singapore the right of full relations with

other   States   both   within   and   without   the

Commonwealth - the  right to appoint  ambassadors  and

High  Commissioners, in fact, the full right  of  an

independent territory - and we are agreed  that  where

action in the realm of external affairs affects  the

external  defence commitments of the United Kingdom,

we  shall  act  in consultation with  Her  Majesty's

Government. Sir, let there be no misunderstanding on

that.  In  matters of peace and war,  in  all  major

matters    which   affect   the   external   defence

commitments of the Commonwealth, we are prepared  to

agree   to   accept  the  advice  of  Her  Majesty's

Government and to follow it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question, Sir, which has been actively

occupying  our  minds  is the question  of  internal

security and especially two aspects of it. The first

aspect   is:  to  what  extent  the  Government   of

Singapore which wants inde-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



pendence can be said to be able to maintain internal

security  with its own forces. Now, Sir,  since  the

war,  we  have  had a really delightful  arrangement

with  the  Federation.  By  this  arrangement,   the

Federation raises all the military forces  necessary

for  Malaya's defence purposes and Singapore  raises

all  the  naval forces necessary for the defence  of

the  coast of Malaya. I trust that I need not remind

Members   of   this   House  that  Malaya   includes

Singapore.   Sir,   this  arrangement   has   worked

exclusively  for the benefit of the Federation.  The

Federation has a Federation Regiment which is  being

used  only in the Federation and we on our part  are

spending  many millions of dollars every year  on  a

Navy employing 84 per cent Federation subjects whose

operational  duties are almost wholly in  Federation

waters  for  Federation  purposes.  We  receive   no

payment  at all for these services. It can therefore

be  seen that we have no regular army units. We have

a  part-time  trained Singapore Military  Force.  We

have a particularly costly Navy beyond our immediate

needs  and  of  little value for  internal  security

purposes and we have a well-trained Police Force  of

some  six  thousand persons. I am advised, Sir,  and

this  I  am  prepared  to  believe,  that  this   is

inadequate for the maintenance of order in the event

of  an  organised  and  maliciously  directed  major

outburst  of violence. In the light of this  advice,

the   Government  is  proceeding  apace   with   the

establishment of an operational Singapore  Battalion

by the 1st of April, 1957; and let me say this, Sir,

I  am told that even that may be difficult. We would

be  quite ready to raise two Battalions if that were

possible  within the time. Even with that additional

Battalion,  which is expected to be  operational  in

April,  1957,  we are advised that  it  would  be  a

matter of prudence for us to enter into arrangements

whereby  the Government of Singapore can  call  upon

Her Majesty's Forces for assistance in the event  of

our  Forces being inadequate for the restoration  of

internal  security. We are very ready to enter  into

any arrangement of that character, but it seems that

there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



a  possibility that the United Kingdom  may  not  be

prepared to give military assistance in the event of

complete  breakdown of internal security  unless  it

has some control over the normal conduct of internal

security in this area. Frankly, Sir, our view of the

matter  is  very  simple. To cede any  control  over

internal   security  is  to  make   a   mockery   of

independence. We are or we are not free and  if  Her

Majesty's  Government insists on  control  over  our

internal security Forces, the Labour Front will  be

no party to any agreement that may be arrived at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other facet of this question, Sir, is that the

Armed  Forces may well desire some form of guarantee

that  the  external  defence installations  and  the

arrangements for external defence efficacy would not

be  prejudiced  by  a serious deterioration  of  the

internal  security position. Sir, this  question  is

under  very active consideration by Members of  this

House  forming the All-Party Delegation and  by  our

Constitutional  Adviser and I can say  that  we  are

hopeful  that some acceptable formula can be arrived

at. I do wish it understood, Sir, that the people of

Singapore go to this Constitutional Conference in  a

spirit  of  utmost reasonableness prepared  to  seek

what  is  just for all parties and not only what  is

right for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have outlined, Sir, broadly, the framework of

our  aspirations worked out with full  consideration

for  the interests of the United Kingdom as we  know

it,  for  it must be understood that apart  from  an

abortive attempt made from Switzerland for a  better

understanding of Colonial Office attitude on some of

the  issues,  I  have not been  in  touch  with  the

Colonial  Office either directly or  indirectly  and

when  we do meet in London, we must anticipate  that

there  will  be  a contribution of  ideas  from  the

Colonial  Office  which  may materially  affect  our

thinking   on  the  approach  to  the   problem   of

protecting  United  Kingdom  interests  within   the

framework of our desire for an end to colonial rule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, Sir, the answer to the Member for

Tanglin  (Mr Ede) is that we seek full  legislative

autonomy   and   equality  in  status   with   other

independent members of the Commonwealth. We seek  an

end  to  Official Members of the Council, an end  to

Official  and Nominated Members of the Assembly  and

an  end to all the Governor's veto powers. In  fact,

Sir,  under  the type of constitution  we  envisage,

there   will   be   no   Governor.   Her   Majesty's

representative  will have only  the  decorative  and

necessary  functions associated  with  the  monarchy

under parliamentary rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other aspect of our talks in

London on which I wish to touch. It is a matter that

has  been hovering like a small but persistent cloud

on the political horizon since first we took office.

I  refer  to the citizenship question. I  think  the

House is aware that the Labour Front considers  that

there  can be no true democracy unless there  is  an

honourable  solution of the citizenship problem.  It

is  our  hope that the issue of citizenship will  be

solved   by  the  creation  of  a  single  Singapore

nationality by the Singapore Independent  Act  which

we  seek  from  the United Kingdom to establish  our

freedom.  The House is aware of the firm  assurances

of my hon. Friend the leader of the Alliance that he

would  support  provisions for  a  single  Singapore

citizenship. Nevertheless, Sir, there does exist the

possibility that the provision for citizenship  will

be  manoeuvred out of the main constitutional  talks

and  should  that occur, Sir, I give the House  this

assurance:  that  the  Labour  Front  Ministers   as

Ministers of the Singapore Government will press  in

London  and,  later, in Singapore, for a  clear  and

early  finalisation  of  this  issue  whatever   the

political cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it will be appropriate at this

juncture  to  deal with some of the  objections  and

with  some  of the arguments we have heard  advanced

against  the fulfilment of our aspirations.  We  who

are  here are Malayans and it may well be that these

objections   will  not  find  voice  or   sufficient

expression  of  a  stridency  which  they  do   find

outside,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



but  I  think  it is important that  the  people  of

Malaya should know what the objections are and  that

the people of Singapore should know what the answers

are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one I will take, Sir, is one that is

beloved  of  Colonel Blimp. It goes  something  like

this:  "Singapore was a swamp with  a  few  malarial

fisherfolk. We bought it. We paid for it.  We  own

it.  With our brains and capital, we made it one  of

the  greatest ports in the world and if you  do  not

like it, you can take a running jump to the land  of

your forefathers." Sir, the principal element in the

growth of Singapore is its geographical position  at

a  time  of increasing trade between East and  West,

and  not  even Blimp has suggested that the colonial

power  should take credit for Singapore being  where

it  is  or for the opening up of trade between  West

and  East.  The  second main element of  Singapore's

growth   is  the  amazing  adaptability,  mercantile

acumen and vitality of our people and here, Sir,  it

would  be  dishonest not to concede, and we  concede

freely,   that  British  administrative  traditions,

British commercial acumen and British capital played

a  key  role in the commercial development  of  this

port;  but  to  seek to hog the whole  credit  is  a

shameless  perversion  of  the  truth - the  truth  of

magnificent co-operative effort between the  various

races,  both Eastern and Western, resident  in  this

island  for more than a century. Sir, even  if  this

were  not  so, even if it were not that  Singapore's

prosperity is due to no single race but to practical

and  harmonious partnership between different races,

and  even if one could accept the legalistic concept

that  Singapore  is owned by the United  Kingdom,  I

would  remind Members that one can own land but  one

does not own human beings. Colonialism may have been

adequate at a time when all were equally transients.

Today  when  we  have more than a million  domiciled

inhabitants, it is utterly untenable. Colonialism in

such  circumstances,  Sir, corrupts  the  ruler  and

warps the ruled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having referred to Blimp, Sir, I think it would be

appropriate to take cognizance, by way of  contrast,

of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



group of responsible British mercantile men who have

written to me and agreed to the publication of their

letter  indicating that they consider the  interests

of   British   capital  and  British  community   in

Singapore  are identical with the interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore. This is the first gesture  of

goodwill and understanding on the part of this  very

important community and I welcome it as one welcomes

the first flowers of Spring; for let this be clearly

understood: the British community may be transients;

British  capital  is not transient. British  capital

has  played  a  vital  role in  the  development  of

Singapore  and it has a vital role to  play  in  the

future   development  of  Singapore.  We  need   the

activities  of  British capital and British  capital

needs the outlet of facilities of Singapore. We  can

both  benefit,  and  benefit  richly,  if  there  is

statesmanlike   acceptance  of  the  realities   and

genuine desire for friendly and honest co-operation.

Sir,  may  I take the opportunity of expressing  the

hope  that  today at least Mr Sutherland,  who  has

been  appointed to represent British capital in this

Assembly, will be equal to his opportunity and  will

be  adequate  to interpret this new spirit  infusing

the  British community when he approaches the issues

involved in this motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another objection, Sir, which we have heard is

that  Singapore  is too small to be  an  independent

territory.    Researches   of   our   constitutional

advisers,  Sir,  have  proved  that  Singapore  will

learn, when our memorandum to the Secretary of State

is  published, that Singapore can proudly  take  its

place as an elder brother to many of the independent

States  who are members of the United Nations today,

older in the status of population and income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still another objection, Sir, is that the true

destiny  of  Singapore is as part of the concept  of

the great Malayan nation and that we should not seek

independence - an independence without meaning - outside

that  concept. I think this House is aware that  the

people  and  the Government of Singapore have  since

last  August repeatedly shown their realisation that

only unity between the Federation and Singapore  can

bring into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



being  a truly great Malayan nation and that without

such  unity,  there  is grave  danger  to  the  very

survival of both entities. I would like to make this

clear,  Sir. We have both officially and  informally

repeatedly  suggested  to  the  Government  of   the

Federation that urgent consideration should be given

to  the  question of a merger so necessary  for  the

healthy growth of both units, but consideration  has

been  as  repeatedly postponed first on  the  ground

that  Singapore  as  a strategic  base  would  never

achieve independence and could only be a drag on the

Federation  which  was seeking its own  independence

and  now,  Sir, on the ground that the  issue  would

delay  and  complicate  the recommendations  of  the

Commission  on the Federation's future constitution.

We,  who  represent the people of Singapore in  this

House,  are deeply conscious of the elemental  truth

that  neither  territory can go far  along  separate

ways  and that in unity we have the potential  of  a

nation  of  strength and stature. Also as  practical

men,  we  say  we cannot await the pleasure  of  the

Federation  before we seek an end to colonial  rule.

Our   desire   for   a  merger  is  concurrent   but

subordinate   to   our  desire  for   freedom   from

colonialism.  One does not conflict with  the  other

and if we do achieve independence, we shall still be

hoping that the Federation will be equal to the rich

opportunities which today's circumstances offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An objection of more substance, Sir, that seems to

find  an  echo  amongst some of our people  is  that

Singapore  is  pursuing the goal of independence  at

far  too  rapid a pace. I do appreciate the courtesy

of  our opponents in not reminding the Labour  Front

that   our  Four  Year  Programme  calls  for  self-government within four years but we, Sir, who  never

seek  to shirk the truth, are conscious of that  and

being conscious we say in all sincerity, "Today,  we

know, delay could be, would be, fatal."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming to office, Sir, we have learned that

the problem of Communism is of a far graver and more

pressing  character than we understood as  citizens,

that Communism is utilising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



the mask of nationalism in order to gain support and

through  this  technique  is  endangering  the  very

existence  of  the people of this  island.  We  have

learned  that  you  cannot ask a subject  people  to

assist  the colonial power to exterminate Communism.

We  of the Labour Front-Alliance Government have for

twelve  months been bedevilled in having  to  divide

our  energies  between the struggle for  an  end  of

colonial  rule  and the struggle  against  the  true

enemy of the people - the Communists. In such division

of  effort, Sir, lies failure. Experience has taught

us  also that it is in the highest degree unwise  to

use  the Oliver Twist technique of taking a  little

and  being ready to go back for more. That way  lies

instability,  and  political  instability  in   this

territory is the very meat of Communism and  is  the

very  poison,  Sir, of our commercial existence.  We

have been reminded of this by the outgoing President

of  the Singapore Chamber of Commerce but he did not

indicate  the way to stability. Maybe the  way,  and

the  only way that any honest man can see,  was  one

that  was unpalatable to him. We believe, Sir,  that

stable  conditions can only be achieved if there  is

an  end to our struggle with the United Kingdom  and

if   there  is  an  honourable  agreement  for   the

foreseeable future guiding our relations. It is only

if  we can feel, "This is it. This is the end of our

struggle",  that we can turn round and move  forward

as  a  free  people united firmly  in  the  will  to

survive  against the leprous forces of this  foreign

ideology  we call Communism. That is the only  hope,

Sir, to stability and the time is now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those who say. "Go slow." Sir, when the

embryo in the egg grows to the point of being  ready

to  peck its way through to the free world and fresh

air, does it make any sense to say. "Go slow, little

chicken.  Stay a few more days there. Grow  stronger

and  bigger  so that you can better meet the  wicked

weather  of  this  world"?  To  go  slow  in   those

circumstances  would mean death. To stay  longer  in

that  egg  would mean suffocation. Unless, Sir,  the

people of Singapore can, in the words of Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



Nehru,  "savour the sensation of freedom", the  time

will  be  too late to call upon them for  that  mass

dynamic  effort  to meet the peril that  is  already

within our gates. It is not the bullets of the armed

forces that will save us from Communism. It is  only

the  spirit of the people and you can only have that

spirit  if  the people are free. So, Sir, though  in

our humility we have originally envisaged four years

for  self-government, we say, "After twelve  months'

experience, in all sincerity, today is not too  soon

for independence." In fact, Sir, the brutal truth is

that today may be too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have earlier indicated what I consider to

have been the very valuable activities of the public-spirited  people of Singapore during  Merdeka  Week.

One  aspect  of  Merdeka  Week,  however,  Sir,  has

brought  to  light an objection that was  till  then

dormant. The disorderly conduct of a small crowd  at

the  end of the rally of the 18th of March has  been

so  exaggerated, so repeatedly played up in an  able

Press  campaign that it has transformed the incident

into   fantastic   proportions   with   considerable

psychological  repercussions. Sections  of  minority

races  in  Singapore  who till then  were  happy  to

envisage  the  possibility  of  an  early   end   to

colonialism have been whipped up to a pitch of  fear

of  possible subjugation by the Chinese  people.  As

one  man put it, Sir, "If freedom means the rule  of

the majority, you are going to replace the arrogance

of  the  Englishman by the arrogance of the Chinese.

What  do we benefit? We prefer the devil we know  to

the devil we do not know." Sir, an insidious part of

this  campaign has been to associate the dangers  of

Communism  with  the  natural  predominance  of  the

Chinese in a democracy. Sir, the minority races are,

in  fact, somewhat confused as to what they fear. It

is  a  composite  picture of fearing  what  one  man

called,  "Peking Merdeka". Sir, in every  democratic

country, there are minorities and the protection  of

minority  rights is inherent in the very concept  of

democracy.    Sometimes,    such    protection    is

incorporated in a constitution. At other  times,  it

is just understood, Sir. It is part of the very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



breath of that concept of political institutions  we

call  "parliamentary democracy". For democracy  does

not  merely mean the rule of the majority. It  means

the  rule  of the majority taking full consideration

of  the  needs  and the interests  of  all  minority

races. Merdeka does not mean, Sir, and it can  never

mean,  the  replacement  of  English  arrogance   by

Chinese  arrogance, English rule  by  Chinese  rule.

Merdeka means the replacement of English rule by our

own  rule,  the rule of the people of  Singapore  of

whom  the majority are Chinese, and we can naturally

expect  that  they will be prominent and predominant

in  shaping the policies of Government. It  is  very

wrong,  Sir,  to  assume that  our  Chinese  fellow-

citizens would find the wine of power so heady as to

go  berserk  and seek the destruction of  legitimate

minority  interests. It is wrong  not  to  give  our

fellow-citizens the credit for the very real virtues

which they possess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Sir, that in the past few months,

there  has been greater prominence placed on certain

unhappy  aspects of the activities of small sections

of  our  country's population but let  us  recognise

that,  for generations, the Chinese have had a  very

raw deal. I am of a minority race through centuries,

Sir. I  can  recognise and feel for  discriminatory

treatment towards minority races and my heart  feels

and  understands the bitterness in the hearts of the

Chinese    who   have   for   generations   received

discriminatory  minority  race  treatment  in   this

territory. This is the heritage of decades but  when

they receive full recognition, full participation in

government  and when, in fact, they find  that  they

are  largely  responsible for  the  conduct  of  the

government,  I  believe that there will  flower  not

Chinese   arrogance  but  the  Chinese  virtues   of

reasonableness  and of justice. The  Chinese  are  a

vital  race and they have a great deal to contribute

to  the future. We should rather look forward to the

flowering  of  their virtues in  common  with  other

races  in this territory under the just reign  of  a

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only argument of any validity which I

have  heard  is that in normal times my analysis  of

the   development  of  the  Chinese   community   in

Singapore  might  be right but today  we  are  going

through  an  abnormal period of  militant  Communist

expansion rampant in Asia viewing Singapore  as  the

ideal point for further expansion in South-East Asia

and,  in  these  conditions,  we  can  expect  heavy

pressure  of  indoctrination on local  citizens  for

subversive  Communist purposes and  that,  in  these

circumstances,  we  can expect tactics  to  maintain

bitterness,  to  maintain and  sharpen  inter-racial

antagonism  and to prevent consolidation of  Chinese

loyalty  and co-operation to the land. It is  argued

that  Communists are never in the majority when they

take  power but act as a well-disciplined  minority.

Their technique is to mislead workers, peasants  and

students, to work up discontent and chaos  and  then

by  surprise  action to seek to slit the  throat  of

democracy and take over control and once in control,

Sir,  that is the end of human liberties; for though

one  can  turn  out the Progressive Party - one  might

even  hope  to  turn out the Labour Front  Coalition

Government - once   a  Communist   or   a   Communist-camouflaged  Party is in power, there  are  no  more

elections and all is tyranny. I will not deny,  Sir,

that  that  is the danger. It is a very real  danger

but  it  is  not  a danger which we  can  escape  by

refusing  to grow. It is not a danger we can  escape

by  remaining  a  Colony. It  is  a  danger  we  can

overcome only if the people of Singapore can act  as

a  united,  intelligent and loyal  group,  and  this

includes  the Chinese people as well as all minority

races.  We  must act as one to preserve our  freedom

and  the  heritage  of  our children.  This  is  our

danger. This is also our opportunity and a wonderful

and  dynamic  opportunity; for in the face  of  this

danger,  we must be conscious that we either produce

a  united people with full co-operation between  all

races,  with  full  trust  between  all  races   and

complete  loyalty of all races to Singapore,  or  we

perish. If we succeed, Sir, we might well make  this

small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



point  on the map of the world the centre of  a  new

stabilising force for the whole of Asia. One  cannot

live,  Sir, unless one has faith in life,  faith  in

the  future and faith in one's capacity to  overcome

the myriad dangers that human beings must face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hate colonialism. I have lived under it all

my   life  and  I  hate  Communism  because  I  hate

colonialism and because Communism is a more  vicious

and more brutal concept of colonialism. If I thought

that  independence would bring about the tyranny  of

Communism in this territory, I would fight  Merdeka.

I  do say, Sir, I believe that it is through Merdeka

that there is any hope of reaching safety and I  say

to  the  people of Singapore - all races - that we  must

have  faith in ourselves. We must have faith in  the

future.  This is the road of life, Sir, the road  of

natural  growth through freedom with all its dangers

and  with  all its opportunities and the  road  lies

through Merdeka. Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly affirms, in the name of the

people of Singapore, its belief in the principle  of

"the  basic right of peoples to governments of their

own   choice",  as  enunciated  in  the   Washington

Declaration  signed  by  Sir  ANTHONY  EDEN,   Prime

Minister  of  the the United Kingdom, and  President

EISENHOWER  President  of  the  United   States   of

America, on the 1st of February, 1956;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its belief that the long term welfare of

Singapore  lies  in close and friendly  co-operation

with   the   United  Kingdom  and  the  Commonwealth

territories;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Assembly instructs its All-Party

Delegation  to the forthcoming Constitutional  Talks

in London to seek forthwith for Singapore the status

of an independent territory within the Commonwealth,

and to offer an agreement between the United Kingdom

Government and the Singapore Government whereby  the

Government of the United Kingdom would in respect of

Singapore exercise control over external defence and

give  guidance in foreign relations other than trade

and commerce.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second  the motion which stands in the name  of  the

Chief  Minister. In doing so, I hope he will forgive

me if I make this introductory observation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two parts in this motion: the preamble

which itself consists of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



two   parts  -  the  affirmation  of  the  principle

enunciated in Washington, and the other, the  belief

that    our    future   lies   with   the    British

Commonwealth - and  what I would  call  the  operative

part -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore the Assembly instructs its All-Party

Delegation  to the forthcoming Constitutional  Talks

in London to seek forthwith for Singapore the status

of an independent territory within the Commonwealth,

and to offer an agreement between the United Kingdom

Government and the Singapore Government whereby  the

Government of the United Kingdom would in respect of

Singapore exercise control over external defence and

give  guidance in foreign relations other than trade

and commerce."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe that my freedom

is a matter for argument and that I must justify why

I  must be free. I am interested to know that Dwight

D.  Eisenhower and Sir Anthony Eden, Knight  of  the

Garter, have reaffirmed the right of all peoples  to

self-determination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My approach to the problem and the approach of my

Party is a straightforward and practical one. If you

confront  the British Government with an alternative

more  unpleasant than the one you ask of them,  then

the   chances  are  that  you  will  get  the   less

unpleasant alternative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom is the birthright of all peoples

everywhere  in  this world. Because  my  forefathers

migrated for purely selfish economic reasons to what

they call the South Seas, a whole generation of some

two  million  Chinese are today left in Malaya  with

Malaya  as their only home and, necessarily thereby,

the  sole  object of their loyalty.  The  generation

that  I  belong  to  grew up under British  colonial

rule.  It is always easy to say, "Let us forget  the

past.  After  all, that was colonialism.  It  was  a

mistake.  Now,  let us get together and  let  us  be

friends."  Commendable sentiment, Sir,  and  one  to

which  I  would subscribe if I found that there  was

sufficient sincerity on the other side. If I believe

that  the British are no longer interested in either

economic,   political  or  military  advantages   to

themselves  more than to me, then there would  be  a

basis  for friendly, comradely cooperation. That  is

the  problem which faces Britain and the  people  of

Singapore and Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the high-sounding words have died down,

one  has to search one's conscience and say,  "Am  I

happier  this  way  or that way?"  Speaking  for  my

Party,  I  do  not think that we have the  slightest

doubt  that  we are happier if British control  were

gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought myself that the first part of

the  preamble  would  have embarrassed  the  British

Prime  Minister.  It  was  only  recently  that  the

constitution of British Guiana was suspended. It was

said  that there, a great error had been made; that,

in  fact, self-determination is only possible  where

you  have  an educated and an enlightened electorate

and not where you have largely an uneducated mass of

people incapable of thinking for themselves but  led

by  political extremists. I shall come back to  that

point at a later stage, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second half which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And its belief that the long term welfare of

Singapore  lies  in  close and friendly  cooperation

with   the   United  Kingdom  and  the  Commonwealth

territories;",



<br><br>I think it is safe to say that no country in Asia or

indeed  any  part  of the world, unless  it  is  the

United  States of America or the Soviet  Union,  can

stand  by itself and pursue a completely independent

policy. We live in an age where balance of power  in

the  old  sense  of the word has been modified  into

balance   of  regional  power  groups.  The  British

Commonwealth is such a power group and as long as it

is to the interest of countries like India, Pakistan

and  Ceylon to stay within the British Commonwealth,

then  it might be to our interest to be part of this

co-operative  experimental  enterprise.  Of  course,

there  were  the  cynics who,  when  India  got  her

independence  and  stayed within  the  Commonwealth,

said  that  it was not without an eye to  the  large

sterling  balances then owing by the United  Kingdom

to  the  Indian Government. I would like to  believe

that  the Indian leaders honestly and sincerely felt

that  perhaps the old world concept of narrow, rigid

nationalistic boundaries and racialistic  approaches

should  slowly give way to a wider and more liberal,

a  more humane and satisfying fellowship of all men.

The  British Commonwealth is perhaps unique  in  the

history of empires in that it did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



crumble  into dust and break away into its component

parts  when  the  centrifugal force broke  down.  If

there  had not been World War II, if there  had  not

been  the Japanese occupation, a lot of things  that

we talk about today would not have happened. The old

pattern broke down after the end of the Second World

War.  The astonishing thing is that even though  the

power  which governs by force is gone, a new pattern

of  that  empire, perhaps at this stage an amorphous

concept, has somehow emerged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Singapore, or even if we were to add the

Federation; for us in Malaya, it is not possible  to

make  any decisive changes in the course of  history

in  South-East  Asia. There are bigger, larger  and

more  decisive forces than Malayan nationalism.  But

one thing is certain. We cannot survive by ourselves

in  the international world unless we also belong to

some  group. It may well be that, like Siam, we  can

play off one side against the other and always trust

to  the  United Nations Security Council to  prevent

either  of the two big power blocs from toppling  us

on  to  their  side irrevocably. But  for  the  time

being, as long as some 300 million Indians find that

it  is  an  advantage to remain within  the  British

Commonwealth,  there is no reason why seven  million

Malayans should not continue on a friendly basis the

associations  of  trade  and  commerce   and   other

cultural  activities that have existed  for  over  a

hundred years between us and the British. All  this,

of course, presupposes that after April, we will get

a constitutional advance. I hope we will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three things that the British Government

can  do:  meet  us the whole way, meet us  somewhere

along the way, or not budge at all. Taking the three

alternatives in the reverse order, if  they  do  not

budge  at  all:  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  has

already  indicated that he does not propose to  stay

in  office.  In other words, the British  Government

must be prepared to revoke the constitution and  run

Singapore  once  again as a Crown  colony  in  every

sense  of  the  word.  The long-term  consequences - I

would not say the immediate conse-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



quences,   for   those   can   be   controlled   and

contained - of such a policy would be catastrophic  to

the   British.   Whether   it   would   be   equally

catastrophic to Malaya depends upon one's  point  of

view,  whether one believes in "revolution" as  used

by Marxists or whether one believes in revolution as

used  by Laski. I prefer, not because I am incapable

of warlike activities, the evolutionary approach. It

is  less  painful and everybody feels a  little  bit

better about it when it is all over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe for one moment that Her Majesty's

Government  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  completely

ignorant  of  the underlying political situation  in

Malaya  and,  therefore, I am  personally  convinced

that   it   would  take  a  lot  of   other   secret

considerations  before the British Government  says,

"No, and absolutely no!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other two alternatives, if one were to

put  them in the balance, the logical conclusion  is

that  the  British Government will find it  wise  to

meet  us all along the way. To meet us part  of  the

way  would  just  sour any possible political  kudos

that might be obtained from a graceful withdrawal. I

do  not  think  any country in the  world  can  more

gracefully   withdraw  from  an  already   untenable

position  than the British. I think they understand,

and  I  hope  the six prominent gentlemen  from  the

British  House  of Commons will help the  others  to

understand,   that  this  is  almost   "an   already

untenable position".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party manifesto says, "We believe in

immediate independence." Perhaps the Hon. the  Chief

Minister will forgive me if I spend a few minutes in

explaining   to  the  House  why  the   P.A.P. has

apparently departed from this stand. So many  things

have  happened in Singapore since the elections held

in March last year that sometimes one feels that one

has  lived  through a decade, not just a  year.  One

thing  is  fairly  certain. No individual  political

force is in control in Malaya. The British when they

put  in  the Rendel Constitution believed, and  they

thought they were right in believing, that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



would  lead  to  a  mild,  gradual  phasing  of  the

different  stages  of evolution  towards  this  very

desirable state of self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. took the lid off the last

elections and out popped the Labour Front.  Sir,  in

this  three-cornered  fight  that  is  going  on  in

Malaya - the   British,   the   Communists   and   the

Nationalists - the position will not  be  re-patterned

if  the  British freeze the constitution.  It  is  a

simple  problem if one approaches it from the  local

man's point of view. Every time the Communist fights

the  British, the Nationalist says to himself,  "Ah,

good,  that will weaken him and perhaps I will  come

in."  Every  time the Nationalist gives the  British

one hard knock, the Communist says, "Good show. That

will knock him out. Then I will come in." As long as

the  British are here the common target, the  common

foe  are the British. It is not possible to face the

question  "What Malaya are we going  to  have?"  The

immediate  question  is, "Can  we  get  rid  of  the

British?"  A  very  eminent old  gentleman  who  was

knighted by the British Government and who is  still

very much alive once told me in an unguarded moment,

which  might  have  cost him the revocation  of  his

knighthood  if he had been overheard, "I don't  like

the Communists but every time they beat the British,

I  say  'Good,  I have got a better  chance  to  win

now.'"  It is the most natural sentiment,  the  most

natural reaction when you are fighting a common foe.

When the British fought the Germans, they were great

friends  with  Marshal Stalin and  they  fought  the

Germans  together. I say that if  such  a  situation

goes on much longer, the outcome will be victory  to

the  local  force that is more tightly organised  to

seize  power.  Eventually a point  will  be  reached

where, like the French in Indo China, the Colony  is

no  longer worthwhile, and then they say. "Well, let

us  call  a  halt to it" and, as in Indo-China,  the

Communist  Party  being the most  tightly  organised

group naturally took the leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been two patterns of development in

South-East  Asia since the war. One  is  the  Indian

pattern and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



other  is  the Indo-Chinese pattern. In  the  Indian

pattern,  you had a nationalist group there  leading

the fight against the British long before the Indian

Communist Party ever came into being. They  had  the

initiative.  They  had  the organisation.  They  had

attracted all the men with the guts and the  ability

and the desire for freedom. When the time came, they

were able to assume power as of right, for power  is

not  a  counter to be bargained for and handed over.

Power is something to be fought for and won. If  you

have  the  wherewithal to take it  and  to  run  it,

nothing will stop you. The difficulty for Malaya  is

that,  unlike India, there was a Communist  movement

some   thirty  years  before  the  first  spark   of

nationalism  spread and caught  fire.  That  is  the

problem  which we face today in Malaya, not just  in

Singapore,  though  some people  in  the  Federation

might  wish  to  believe that the situation  in  the

Federation is something different. It is a situation

which is endemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party believes in an independent,

democratic,   non-Communist   Malaya:   independent,

because we want to get rid of the British or anybody

else  who  wants  to  run this country;  democratic,

because we want to elect our leaders by popular  and

free  elections; non-Communist, because we want free

elections,  not  a  choice on a  straight  one-Party

ticket, and because we do not want to be involved in

a  fight  between  two world power blocs  and  power

ideologies. To a certain extent, it might be  termed

an  escapist  philosophy. It may be that  ultimately

one  has to choose. The time may come. When it does,

perhaps India will have to opt, and when India opts,

I  think the whole of South-East Asia will opt  with

her.  The destiny of Malaya will be determined  more

by  forces  outside  Malaya than  by  forces  inside

Malaya. No one could have foreseen after the war the

tremendous change that would occur when the Imperial

powers  disappeared from Asia.  No  one  could  have

foreseen  the  emergence of a tightly organised  and

effective  China.  No one could have  believed  that

within ten years of the end of the war, the British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



Government would decide that the time had come for a

radical  change of policy. It took them a long  time

to decide this. They tried General Templer first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may be wrong in my appraisal of the

situation.  I  may  be wrong in believing  that  the

British  have weighed the situation and have decided

that  the  best way to meet such a situation  is  to

remove  themselves from the Malayan political arena.

If  I  am  wrong, then I have no choice and then  it

becomes  a straightforward fight between the British

versus  the rest. But if I am right in my  appraisal

of  the  situation, that if the British have decided

that  in  any  event they will lose and  they  would

rather  lose to those who might carry on the liberal

forms   of   government  which  the  Chief  Minister

referred to as parliamentary democracy, then, if  we

can  provide  that  other  force,  I  think  British

interest -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And our interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and, I hope our interest

demand that the British remove themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this proviso -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...to offer an agreement between the United Kingdom

Government and the Singapore Government whereby  the

Government of the United Kingdom would in respect of

Singapore exercise control over external defence and

give guidance in foreign relations..."



<br><br>is  an euphemistic way of saying that we realise the

British  will  not  give  us  complete  independence

because  then  it would mean upsetting international

arrangements  and international bases in  the  world

defence   strategy.  Instead  of  going  the   whole

distance,  we  therefore go  part  of  the  distance

towards independence. But I must say this: no  self-respecting Nationalist can say that that would be  a

satisfactory  state of affairs  for  any  length  of

time.  I  do  not know about Oliver Twist.  I  never

liked Charles Dickens. But I do know this. As a step

towards independence and to seek common ground  with

every political Party in this House, we join in this

demand  that  we  should  have  the  status  of   an

independent State conceding or offering an agreement

whereby we lose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



control  of  foreign affairs and defence.  This  can

only  be  a  phase. It is impossible for  it  to  be

otherwise.  No man can formally postulate  that  you

will  be  always  not quite a full  man.  There  are

forces in Asia more powerful than the British. It is

my hope that all the Nationalist groups in Singapore

and  Malaya will be alive to the identity  of  their

common  interests  and  will  together,  not  as  an

independent Singapore and an independent  Federation

but  together,  as one unit, seek, in  the  not  too

distant future, that complete nationhood. Either you

fight for that, or else you give up the struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After April, we will probably have a new

constitution. It will probably be one which  can  be

revoked - a revocable constitution - but the change that

will  take  place  in  the mind  of  the  people  of

Singapore is an irrevocable one, just as the  change

that took place with the Rendel Constitution was  an

irrevocable change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The astonishing thing about political events in

Singapore is that very few realise at the time  they

happen  the  full  significance of the  events.  The

Progressive Party did not know nor did they  imagine

that  when  they  gave  way to  adult  suffrage  and

automatic  registration, it meant political  suicide

for  a  small  English  educated  middle-class-based

Party, and I do not think this House, when it agreed

to  multi-lingualism, really understood  that  there

was  a  permanent  change in the  whole  concept  of

government in this country.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Flatter yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have a great regard for

the agility and versatility of our illustrious Chief

Minister. I am quite sure he understands that it  is

a very significant change, but I think very few have

really faced up to the problems which are coming  in

the year ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all now together as one united, happy and

cohesive  delegation and far be it from  me  to  say

anything which may in any way break it up - I see  the

Hon. the Chief Secretary is just waiting for me  to

say  something that will break up the  happy  unity,

but the P.A.P. will not oblige him. We, Sir, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



a  definite purpose in mind. Our first objective  is

not  just  to remove his physical presence  in  this

Chamber but we shall remove him and his friends  and

colleagues. It  is  not that we take  any  personal

objection  to  their presence,  but  as  symbols  of

European  authority and representatives  of  British

interests,  they must go. Not only must the  symbols

go  but the substance must also go. That will be the

next  big  fight  if in April we take  another  step

forward towards immediate and ultimate independence - immediate,   for   the  P.A.P. according   to   the

manifesto, ultimate, say the Liberal-Socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Liberal-Socialists support this motion

as  indeed they will have to, even though they  have

seen  fit  to allow a minority Opposition  Party  to

second  the motion. I hope they will make themselves

clear on this point that this is the minimum that we

seek  in  London; that this is the common ground  of

all  political Parties, and from this, there  is  no

withdrawal. When we shout "Merdeka", what we  really

mean  is one more step to Merdeka and what we really

want in the end is Merdeka.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYANISATION COMMISSION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, but for your

ruling that a motion congratulating the Chairman and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



members of the Malayanisation Commission who  signed

the  majority Report was out of order, I  would  not

have   taken  this  opportunity  to  speak  on   the

adjournment. You have indicated to me, Sir, that the

Malayanisation Commission is a quasi-judicial  body.

it  has  not completed its work and until then,  you

have ruled that,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"it is out of order for any Member to move any

motion  or  ask  any  question which  might  however

indirectly   or  remotely  tend  to   influence   or

prejudice the findings of the Commission one way  or

the  other  and  a  congratulatory motion  moved  in

respect  of  an interim report is in my  opinion  of

that  category more especially when it  excepts  two

members of the Commission."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you do not intend by that

ruling that I should make no reference at all to the

contents of the interim Report. The Report has  been

tabled for the information of Members and I trust  I

will be in order if I were to make references to the

text of parts of the Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the hon.

Member's  speech is on Malayanisation in  connection

with the Merdeka Mission?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir. I fully understand the line of

demarcation you have allowed on this motion  on  the

adjournment,  that I can only speak  in  so  far  as

Malayanisation   is  connected  with   the   Merdeka

Mission.  Of  course, it does to  a  certain  extent

conscribe the limits of the subject that I  wish  to

cover  but  I  shall endeavour to  keep  within  the

limits you have laid down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common knowledge that the

Merdeka  Delegation is going to  take  with  it  the

Secretary of the Malayanisation Commission to advise

on  matters connected therewith. I  think it is also

common knowledge that the Director of Personnel (Mr

Higham) will also be in London presumably to  advise

Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies on

matters connected with Malayanisation and personnel.

What  I  do not understand is what we are  going  to

discuss   with  the  Secretary  of  State  for   the

Colonies.  In  the  sitting  last  month   of   this

Assembly, the Hon. the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



Secretary indicated that he hoped that nothing  will

be  said  which  will  put the scare  into  European

officers. He then stood up and gave them a firm  and

categorical  assurance that until these matters  had

been discussed in London, there will be no change in

the  status  quo.  As far as I can  see,  the  only

matter we want discussed and which the Secretary  of

State  for  the  Colonies can  conceivably  want  to

discuss with us on the question of Malayanisation is

the subject of abolition terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Colonial Paper 197 of 1946, which is now

famous or notorious by the repeated number of  times

it  has  been cited by the local Staff Side  of  the

civil  service, the then Secretary of State for  the

Colonies stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If progressive advancement along the road to self-government within the framework of the British

Commonwealth  of  Nations is to be  a  reality,  the

Public  Services of the Colonies must be adapted  to

local  conditions, and must to the greatest possible

extent be staffed by local people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, there is no quarrel with the

principle of Malayanisation to the greatest possible

extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six terms of reference in the

Malayanisation Commission set out in the  letter  of

appointment signed by the Hon. the Chief  Secretary.

It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And whereas the Governor in Council has deemed it

expedient  and  in the interests of  public  welfare

that  a  diligent and full examination  and  inquiry

should forthwith be made into the following matters,

namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Schemes of Service and the present

staffing  of  all  Government Departments  and

Agencies  with a view to recommending measures

to  ensure  the  more  rapid,  systematic  and

complete Malayanisation of the Public Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The possibilities of including or expanding

degree  or diploma courses of study in  Public

Administration and Social Studies with a  view

to enabling the Government to draw on a larger

field of graduates for the Public Service  and

for   that   purpose  to  consult   with   all

educational authorities;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The existing schemes of training including the

making   of  recommendations  for   the   more

intensive  training of local  officers  within

Government departments and agencies;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The abolition terms which might be offered to

expatriate officers in the Public Service and the

making of recommendations in respect thereof;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Public Services Commission Ordinance, 1949

(No. 55 of 1949) and its operation and to make such

recommendations as may be deemed necessary;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The question of Pan-Malayan departments in

their   relationship   to   the   policy    of

Malayanisation."



<br><br>Six  terms of references and not one of them, except

No.  4 which is "the abolition terms which might  be

offered",  concerns the Secretary of State  for  the

Colonies.  The Secretary of State for  the  Colonies

has a right to discuss with the future government of

Singapore  the  question of what its civil  servants

should  be  paid off with and by whom.  But  on  the

principle  of  Malayanisation,  on  the  five  other

matters  set  out  in  the  instructions  from   the

Governor  to  the Commission, there is no  room  for

discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister said on the Budget

debate   when   he  pressed  the  appointments   and

upgrading of certain Europeans in certain expatriate

posts   that  he  was  awaiting  the  Malayanisation

Commission's Report. We have the Report now. It  has

been  tabled  for  over a month. It  is  an  interim

Report insofar as it has further reports to make  on

government  agencies but there is no further  report

on  the question of Malayanisation of the government

itself.  I  must  say that we are disappointed  that

there  has  been no Government policy formulated  in

any  White Paper. This has led to uncertainty as  to

the  extent to which the Report will be accepted  by

the  Government. We then said that  the  Report  was

coming  and before it was even published, we  had  a

feeling that it might not be a sort of Report  which

will  delight the hearts of those who wanted freedom

to  come slowly to Malaya. We are happy to see  that

in this Report in which every political Party had  a

member  or representative who signed the Report,  it

is  suggested, broadly speaking, that we can do away

with expatriate staff in about two or three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is fair

to press the Hon. the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>



Minister for a clear declaration of policy. I expect

the Hon. the Chief Secretary will answer what is the

Government's intention. One thing is clear: if it is

the intention of the Colonial Office to make this  a

bargaining counter, we shall resist. Merdeka  or  no

Merdeka, Malayanisation goes on.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Merdeka comes first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Merdeka comes first. So much the

better, but even without Merdeka, let us take charge

of the control room, as this Report puts it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are parts of this Report which I think

the  House would forgive me if I make reference  to.

The introduction reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Self-government would be an empty phrase unless

the   government  is  entirely  or  almost  entirely

carried out by the people of the country and to have

the  Public  Service staffed by expatriates  at  the

highest   levels   where  policy   formulation   and

execution  take  place would be  derogatory  to  the

dignity  of the people of a self-governing  country.

Therefore,  self-government and  Malayanisation  are

closely  related,  and  in  order  to  satisfy  this

legitimate aspiration complete Malayanisation should

as  far as possible not lag behind the attainment of

self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to place the subject in its proper setting

we  should see it in historical perspective. History

shows that a group of people can only function as an

entity  if  there is cohesion within the group,  and

this   cohesion  does  not  depend  merely  on   the

homogeneity of the population but on the sameness of

purpose  created  by  the  stimulus  of  the  common

geographical  and human environment,  and  can  only

exist if the people are thrown together to brave the

same dangers and share the same fate. There must  be

no alternative. - "



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> On a point of information, Sir. Could I

hear what the Member is saying?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was reading

the  introduction to this Malayanisation  Commission

Report which should be written in gold and put up in

the office of the Chief Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I hope the Member will treat me with

respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It reads on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If a section of the population (that means the

Hon. the  Chief  Secretary)  has  the  option   of

returning to their country of origin when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>



faced  by  some unpleasant challenge,  that  section

constitutes  a weakness to the state and  can  never

contribute to the cultural progress of the  country.

In  other words, success in the building of a nation

can  only be achieved by a group of people  if  they

have  no ties of loyalty with the country which they

have  left - they  must  burn  their  boats  and  give

undivided loyalty to the country of their adoption."



<br><br>It then goes on at great length to prove that if you

are  in  receipt  of  an expatriate  allowance,  you

cannot give undivided loyalty to this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the British Government had carried out a

fraction of the pious protestations they made before

and after the war with regard to Malayanisation, we

would be in a much better position today to run  the

administrative machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a student in the local college here,

the  prizes that one looked forward to in a colonial

Malaya were the two prize appointments a year to the

Straits     Settlements    Civil    Service     but,

unfortunately, they stopped that sometime before the

war.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Just in time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> After the war the British said

that  they  wanted  to help us  to  rule  ourselves,

whereupon  in  order to do it, they  imported  large

numbers  of demobbed European officers to  come  and

help  us  and fill up all the appointments. Now,  we

are told that if we want to get rid of them, we have

got to pay them handsome grants -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Oh, no. Let us be fair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let us be fair and pay them

handsomer  grants  and  get  rid  of  them   faster. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I think it is pertinent to note

that  when  the Federation Merdeka Mission  went  to

London,   they  did  not  discuss  the   policy   of

Malayanisation  because that is  a  purely  domestic

matter  within  the jurisdiction of  the  Federation

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information, if

you would permit me, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, if the hon. Member will give

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall give

the  Hon. the Chief Minister a full opportunity  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 176 of the Malayanisation Commission

Report, paragraph 16 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were also fortunate in that we had, during the

course of our deliberations, the communique relating

to  the arrangement between the Federation of Malaya

Government  and  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the

Colonies   regarding   the   future   treatment   of

expatriate officers in the Federation."



<br><br>Paragraph 17 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Briefly there are to be two clearly defined phases.

Phase One is the period before 1st July, 1957,  when

a  Public  Service Commission with executive  powers

would be established."



<br><br>It  then  goes on to Phase Two. But the question  of

the  speed  of  Malayanisation is a purely  domestic

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already said that

every  Party  in this Assembly is committed  to  (a)

Merdeka  and  (b)  Malayanisation.  Any  Party  that

withdraws  from this Report will find  itself  in  a

very  uncomfortable position in the  next  election,

and   there   will  be  a  next  election   if   the

constitution is not suspended. Of course, if it  is,

then we shall talk about other things. But if it  is

not,  at  some stage or the other, unlike those  who

write letters to the newspapers anonymously and who

do  not  have to worry about what people other  than

the  editor  think  of them, we  have  to  face  the

public. We shall have to tell them that we came here

to  fight  for local rights and we fought for  them,

and  we  fought  to have the Malayanisation  of  the

Public  Service speeded up so that within  the  next

two  years we can say that we are in control of  all

the   key  positions  of  the  administration.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, the English educated class that  hopes

to man the administrative machinery in the immediate

future   when   the  white  man  leaves,   I   hope,

gracefully, can, if given the opportunity, rise  up

to  the  situation which confronts this country.  We

have  no  time  to say, "We must send  a  man  to  a

Teachers'  Training College. He  must  then  take  a

teacher's diploma. He must have the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>



practical  experience."  Nor  can  we  say  that  an

administrator  must have had seven years'  cadetship

before he is capable of running a department of the

administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going through a revolution in Malaya,

although if one were to listen to the goings  on  in

this  Assembly, one would not imagine  that  anybody

here  knew  that  there was a  revolution  going  on

except the Hon. the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Why not you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have lived so closely to

it  that  I  am conscious of it all the time.  I  am

prepared  to say this, that if you do not ride  this

one, you will sink, and ride it we will; but we  are

not going to fight for somebody else's benefit. If I

have to fight the Communists for this country, I  am

going to fight it for myself. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Hon. the Chief Minister

wants me to fight the Communists. That depends  upon

what the Communists are fighting -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am asking you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Answer it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes. I have said that we stand

for an independent, democratic, non-Communist Malaya

and if the Communists want to force this country  to

be Communist, we shall fight them. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But that does not mean that we

can  fight  them in the way in which  the  Hon. the

Chief  Secretary  and  his  predecessors  have  been

fighting them for eight years by -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Twenty-five years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - direct military force. I am

not  saying that it is not necessary because if  you

have  no force and you are overwhelmed, there is  no

time  for  argument and logic. But that is not  good

enough. Basically, it is a question of fighting  for

loyalties. I hope the Hon. the Chief Secretary  will

not put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>



himself out unduly but if he would try to understand

what  I have said, he must realise that if you  want

us  to  fight for democracy, you must make democracy

something  worth  while  to  the  average  man.  The

average worker does not know the difference  and  he

could  not  care  what  the  difference  is  between

Communism,  Socialism, Liberalism and  Conservatism.

All  he  knows is, "Somebody has promised me results

which he has not given to me. He is lazy, wastes his

time  at cocktail parties. He sits and loafs  around

and nothing is done. But that other, he promised me

that  he would fight for this and by God, I saw  him

fight  for it." If you cannot deliver those results,

then you have had it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Thank you. I am much obliged.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The tragedy is, of course, as

this Report so admirably puts it, that when faced by

some  unpleasant  challenge,  that  section  of  the

population  constitutes  a  weakness  to  the  state

because it will return to the country of its origin.

I,  Sir, have no other country to return to. I am  a

Malayan  by birth and I have no choice.  I  am  more

likely to fight for an independent, democratic, non-

Communist  Malaya than the Hon. the Chief  Secretary

can or will ever do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Good.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Does that go for the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, if there is one Party in

this  Assembly, or outside this Assembly,  that  has

consistently  stated its stand and not shifted  from

it and has weathered the storm it is the -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Labour Front.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> People's Action Party. Merdeka!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First, I must have order in

the  Gallery  to  start off with.  This  is  not  an

Assembly where the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>



hon. Member can clown and shout out slogans, however

commendable  they may be. I ask the hon.  Member  to

carry on with his speech in modified terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall

endeavour to modify my terms but I think the  spirit

of that word "Merdeka" cannot be modified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I had intended to state before the Hon.the

Chief  Minister involuntarily provoked such a  reply

was that we have always said that it is not possible

to  get  the people to fight the Communists for  the

British. Today, we heard the Hon. the Chief Minister

say it for us. [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, we say when we go to London

with  this  Merdeka Mission, we  are  not  going  to

discuss  the rights or wrongs of Malayanisation  and

the  speed at which we will do it. We are  going  to

discuss what the Secretary of State for the Colonies

has a right to discuss, namely, abolition terms - what

shall we pay them for the misfortune of having  made

their  careers  in a country that grew  to  maturity

whilst  they  were  serving. But  if  there  is  the

slightest suggestion that we will discuss details of

Malayanisation policy, I think it is only fair  that

we should tell the Staff Side which has made all the

representations  to  the  Malayanisation  Commission

that it will be so discussed in order that they  can

also   have   their  views  put  to   the   Colonial

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

the Russians have a wonderful tradition of making up

that  they discovered everything that has ever  been

discovered by humanity and the P.A.P. is working  up

a tradition analogous in character of seeking credit

for   every   act  of  the  Labour  Front  Coalition

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> God forbid!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Well, you claim to have

discovered Malayanisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. You are addressing the Chair,

Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Forgive me, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  would  remind  the House that this Malayanisation

Commission was appointed by the Government and  that

Malayanisation is a policy which was  outlined  from

the Chair by His Excellency the Governor on the 22nd

of  April,  1955, and that in effect for  the  first

time in Singapore's history, Malayanisation has been

a  reality from the moment that this Government came

into office because there has been no recruitment as

from   that  time  except  with  the  consent,  full

knowledge   and  full  debate  of  the  Council   of

Ministers  in  respect of each and every  individual

case  where it has been considered necessary to  put

up  a suggestion that we should take in expatriates.

Sir,  with  this  background,  this  Government  had

appointed this Commission. It is the confidence that

this  Government had in the men which has  put  them

where they are. It seems to me as somewhat absurd to

suggest  that this Government intends  to  welch  on

Malayanisation except, of course, in order  to  give

the  P.A.P. credit  for  seeking  to  act  in  loco

parentis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the delay in putting a

White  Paper before this Assembly after the  receipt

of  the  Malayanisation Commission Report, I thought

it has been explained fully and I thought that there

was no question of ambiguity. The Secretary of State

for  the Colonies and, in fact, the Colonial Office,

at  all times, in similar cases, take the view  that

they have a certain responsibility to the people  of

the  country and the Colonial Office has in the case

of  the Federation of Malaya, as well, considered it

necessary  to  investigate the  sufficiency  of  the

civil  service after attainment of independence  for

the discharge of the normal duties of government.  I

say,  Sir,  that this did occur when the  Federation

Delegation   went  to  England,  contrary   to   the

assertion made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  and

I  know  for  a  fact that it will occur  when  this

Delegation  goes up to London: that the  issue  will

have to be considered and the Colonial Office will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



seek  to be satisfied that after independence, there

is, in this territory, an adequate civil service for

the normal needs of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the liberty of interrupting the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar when he said, "Merdeka or no Merdeka,

Malayanisation comes first" because I  think  it  is

important to realise this: to us, at least to us  of

the Labour Front Coalition Government, Merdeka comes

first.  It  is  paramount. All other  questions  are

subordinate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Staff Association has made its representations

to  the  Commission. The Director of Personnel  will

not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



there    in    the   position   of   making    fresh

representations, Sir, and we ourselves will have the

Secretary  of  the Commission to assist  us  in  all

matters  in  connection with the discussion  of  the

aspects of Malayanisation other than abolition which

are certain to come up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed after Four

o'clock  p.m. and the Debate having continued  until

the  time  appointed  for  the  termination  of   a

sitting,  Mr  Speaker adjourned the  House  without

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing whether he is aware that the promised installation of electricity supply to Changi Village, 14th milestone, Changi Road has not yet been carried out; and what steps can be taken to solve this immediate need of the people of this area.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> It had been expected that the City Council would be able to extend electricity supplies to 14th milestone, Changi, by November last year. I understand, however, that it has not been possible to carry out this project because of difficulties experienced in getting the site chosen for the electricity substation, which must be in the centre of the village for technical reasons. The Commissioner of Lands is giving the City Council every assistance in obtaining the required site.
