<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion

standing   in  the  name  of  the  Minister   for

Communications, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (2)

of  section  65 of the Road Traffic Act  (Chapter

92)  resolves that the Highway Code published  as

Notification   No.   5  8   in   the   Subsidiary

Legislation  Supplement to the  Gazette  of  17th

January, 1975, as contained in Paper S.L.  17  of

1975, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last Highway Code was passed by a

Resolution of Parliament at its sitting  on  24th

January, 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the issue of the last Highway Code, a

number of developments have occurred on the  road

transportation scene. Several new  traffic  signs

such  as  "Taxi  Stop", "Box junction"  and  "Bus

Lane"  have  been introduced together with  their

corresponding Rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these and numerous other changes, it

was  found  necessary  to  update  the  Code.  In

consultation   with  the  Traffic   Police,   the

Registry  of  Vehicles and the Attorney-General's

Chambers, the new Highway Code was drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Code contains 114 sections as compared

to  107  sections  in  the old  Code.  Eighty-two

sections  of  the old Code were retained  intact,

while 21 sections were revised, and four sections

deleted.  Six new sub-headings have  been  added,

namely  "Keep Left", "White Lines", "U-Turn",

"Following  Distances",  "Speed  and  Stopping",

"Smoky and noisy exhaust". Metric units for speed

and distance have also been included.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Highway Code is the code of conduct for

motorists  and  not  merely a digest  of  traffic

laws.  It lays stress on the responsibilities  of

road users towards each other. Close and faithful

observation  of  the Code will  lead  to  greater

safety on our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.41 p.m.





<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of course we have to approve the

motion  that  has just been tabled, but  I  would

like to take the opportunity of saying one or two

words about the Highway Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make, Sir, is

that  the Highway Code, up to the present moment,

has  been more honoured in the breach than in the

observance.  It is to avoid this amended  Highway

Code becoming a dead letter that I would like  to

say  a few words. You can just take your car  out

on any occasion to any place where there are road

users   and  you  will  find  scores  of  traffic

violations. Take, for example, The most important

rule  that has been given some prominence in  the

Highway  Code,  namely, that of  "Keeping  Left".

Coming down Bukit Timah Road or Dunearn Road, the

two  arterial  roads that lead into  and  out  of

Singapore, you will find lorries, supposedly with

discs    indicating    their    maximum    speeds

permissible, keeping grimly to the right side  of

the  road and those vehicles keeping to the  left

side  of  the road are those which are trying  to

overtake  those that are keeping  grimly  to  the

right side of the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that of the speed limit, which

is  again another point that is stressed in  this

Highway Code. I think the general tendency is for

people to drive at least 10 miles per hour faster

than they are allowed to drive. Perhaps this  has

been  taken into account. But let us not  make  a

hypocrite  of  the law, a mockery  of  the  code,

feeling we can allow people to drive faster  than

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



should.  In  order to inculcate a respect  for  the

code,  one  has to implement this code. This  is  the

reason   why   I   am   making   this   remark   that

implementation  of the code has not been  successful.

There  has  been  a  safety  campaign  recently  with

certain  limited success achieved.  But  I  think  we

have  to  emphasise in all areas, especially  in  the

Government   departments  as  some  of  the   biggest

sinners are the Government departments indeed  -  you

find  PUB  and PWD vehicles and all sorts of vehicles

belonging  to  the  Government breaking  the  traffic

regulations almost gaily -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Also the Police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, including the Police and the Army.

In  fact,  yesterday  when I  was  driving  home  very

carefully,  I  was overtaken by a Police vehicle  that

was exceeding the speed limit.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Take down the

number!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> There is no point reporting the fact to

the  Police  that one of their vehicles has  exceeded

the  speed limit because they will say that I do  not

have  my car properly checked for speed. So in  order

to make that report justifiably to the Police -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> They might be chasing after somebody!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> No. This vehicle had a 30 mph disc on

its back. What is the use of putting a 30mph disc on a

vehicle  that  is supposed to be chasing  after  other

vehicles? Going through this Highway Code, Mr Speaker,

Sir, just listen to this:

`When  being  overtaken, never  speed  up  to  prevent

another driver from passing.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



`In  traffic hold-ups, do not "jump the queue".' These

are  the things that are actually happening, but  they

are incorporated in this Highway Code as offences. You

must  forgive  me  for  being  a  little  excited,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,I have been coming to this  House  and

repeating, this again and again but no action has been

taken to push across the idea that the Highway Code is

a  very  important instrument of civic education.  The

Highway  Code  lays  stress  on  responsibilities  and

courtesy  and it is an important instrument  of  civic

education. I think the Government should do all it can

to  put  across  this idea of proper  conduct  on  the

public road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section  65  of  the  Road Traffic Act  (Chapter  92),

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provision for

the   Privy  Purse,  which  includes  the  President's

salary,  the  NWC  supplement  and  the  annual   non-pensionable  allowance, because of  certain  decisions

concerning the President's emoluments. The House  will

recall  that  on 20th March, 1973, the Prime  Minister

announced  that  the  President's official  emoluments

would  be raised from $4,000 per month, which is  tax-free, to $12,000 per month, with $4,000 tax-free.  The

House  was  informed then that the President  did  not

wish to make use of the increase in his salary. It has

been  decided,  however,  that  as  from  FY  75,  the

President will be paid his full salary of $12,000  per

month, but the entire amount will he subject to income

tax. Action will be taken to amend the Income Tax  Act

which   specifically  provides   that   the   official

emoluments of the President shall be tax exempt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase under Class II expenditure is required

largely  to meet increasing expenses such as the  1974

NWC  wage supplement, normal increments and the higher

rate of CPF contributions for the President's personal

staff.   For  Classes  Ill  and  IV,  however,  lesser

provisions are now required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the

Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves that

the Schedule to the said Act be varied by deleting the

figures   "$56,320",   "$686,720",   ~`$220,344"   and

"$14,773"  appearing in the second column thereof  and

substituting   therefore  the  figures  "SI   87,050",

"$823,250", "$200,170" and "$13,750" respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government for the financial year, 1st April, 1975  to 31st March, 1976."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have distributed in advance to Honourable

Members my Economic Survey of Singapore in l974. (See Appendix, cols. 195 - 356.) This Survey  and,  I  might  add, the  (Paper Misc. 2

of 1975.) Memorandum  on  the Estimates and the (Paper Cmd. 3 of 1975) Estimates themselves, have been  the result  of  considerable efforts  by  my  Ministry  to

improve  our statistical data and to present  them  to

Honourable  Members in as complete and  informative  a

way  as  possible. We are conscious of the many  great

defects  still remaining in these documents and  shall

continue to improve on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, they will at least have this immediate

benefit, that Members need no longer hear me, even  in

brief  recapitulation, on the statistical  details  of

our   economic   performance  in  1974   or   of   the

international  events which affected  them.  They  are

dealt with in extenso in the Survey and for those  who

have  not  the time or convenience to read it  all  at

once, an adequate summary has also been provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only remind Members that our real rate of

growth  in 1974 was 6.8%, although at current  prices,

it was 26.2%. Members need not be told that for a non-oil  producer, a real rate of nearly 7% growth in  the

circumstances of 1974 is not unsatisfactory.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Diversification of Economic Activities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic strategy puts great importance on

diversification  of our economic activities.  We  have

tried to widen the base of our manufacturing sector by

introducing  new  skills and products particularly  in

metal    and    precision   engineering,    chemicals,

electronics and transport equipment. As a  result,  we

have  now these new industries in addition to our main

manufacturing   activities:  shipbuilding   and   ship

repairing  (14.8% of total value added),  refining  of

petroleum  (20.3%)  and electrical machinery  (21.6%),

resulting  in an even spread with no single industrial

group  accounting for more than 22% of total  earnings

in manufacturing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other economic sectors, notably trade and services,

`have  also  helped  in our plan for  diversification.

Although entrepot trade's share of GDP has fallen, its

nature  has gradually changed from trading  in  mainly

traditional products to trading in capital goods, such

as   machinery,   telecommunications   equipment   and

industrial  raw materials which in 1974 accounted  for

22%  of total re-exports. Domestic trade has of course

gained   from   increased  industrial  production,   a

substantial  portion  of which  is  exported.  In  our

trading  activities, we have had  also  an  increasing

diversity of markets. This has been partly due to  the

multi-national companies who have set up industries in

Singapore   and  bring  with  them  the  international

markets to which they are suppliers. Partly also, this

has  been  due  to  our  own efforts  in  seeking  new

markets,  such  as  those in  West  Asia  and  Eastern

Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the services sector, tourism has become

increasingly  important. The relatively slower  growth

of tourists from Australia, US and UK in 1974 was corn-pen  sated  by the high growth of tourists from  ASEAN

countries. In the services sector also, we  have  been

actively promoting our financial centre activities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



and the centre, with foreign banks from a large number

of  countries,  now provides an even  wider  range  of

financial and banking facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction activities which suffered a setback in

1973,  due  to  high  prices of materials,  have  also

bounced  back, registering a positive growth of  5.5%.

Although  private  sector construction  has  declined,

this  was  more  than  offset by the  acceleration  of

public construction which rose substantially by 22% in

real  terms. As a result, the construction sector  has

once again contributed to the continuing health of our

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beneficial effect of a diversification of

activities  was  amply demonstrated in 1974.  Although

manufacturing  activities  slowed  down  considerably,

trade  and  services remained buoyant, accounting  for

more  than half of the increase in our Gross  Domestic

Product.



<br><br><i>Healthy Balance of Payments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vulnerability to external influences has also

been  lessened  by  our continuing  sound  balance  of

payments  which  will enable us to  pay  for  the  raw

materials  we  need for both growth  and  consumption.

Further, our export-oriented industries, services  and

tourism have all helped our balance of payments to end

the  year with a comfortable surplus. In spite of  the

openness  of  our  economy,  we  have  been  able   to

implement our monetary policies effectively  while  at

the  same  time maintaining a high degree of  monetary

discipline.



<br><br><i>Stable Employment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these advantages, we have managed to maintain

reasonably  full employment. As a result, unemployment

so  far  has  not yet become serious. Of  a  total  of

16,940  workers retrenched in 1974, 79%  were  females

who  were  mostly secondary wage earners and  only  3%

were skilled workers. Most of these retrenched workers

moreover have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



found  alternative employment, many in new industries.

For  1974,  a  total of ISO concerns  employing  9,030

persons  were  registered as permanent  new  factories

compared  with 190 concerns employing I 1,140  persons

in  1973.  As a result, our unemployment rate remained

stable  at  4%.  In the meantime, employers  began  to

learn  how  to work equally well with less labour.  In

addition,   there   is  now  less   job-hopping.   Our

industries are therefore leaner and more efficient. So

far we have been more fortunate compared to some major

industrial  countries where greater  unemployment  has

resulted in considerable social strife.



<br><br><i>Prospects for Singapore</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will Singapore fare in 1975 in the midst of

international  uncertainties? Most economic  forecasts

indicate  that the major industrialised economies  are

unlikely  to achieve any significant upturn  until  at

least the second half of 1975. Taking into account the

normal  time lag before such economic revival  affects

the  rest  of the world, I would think that  a  marked

improvement   all   round  in   Singapore's   economic

condition  will not he apparent until the latter  part

of  1975  or  even early 1976. However,  our  economic

structure, strengthened by the diversification of  our

industries  and services, should be able to withstand,

as  in  the  past  year, the impact  of  some  further

recession  provided  the American  and  Western  world

economy does pick up by the first half of 1976 at  the

latest.  To  make assurance doubly sure, however,  the

recently appointed Economic Activation Committee  will

speed  up  the implementation of any anti-recessionary

measures.  The  task  is therefore  one  of  designing

policies  that will help to get us out of the  present

recession  without too much suffering  while  pursuing

and fulfilling our long-term economic objectives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Major Elements of Economic Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the present recession, we should stick to

our  long-term objective of maintaining  a  relatively

high  rate  of  growth.  We  should  consolidate   the

policies  of our Economic Strategy launched  in  1971.

Growth     should    still    he    spearheaded     by

industrialisation.  We should continue  also  to  make

Singapore  a  services centre for technical  know-how,

tourism  and finance. Similarly, we should  give  high

priority  to the training of workers in skills  needed

for our future industries. Measures should, of course,

he  introduced to counter and mitigate the effects  of

the  present recession. But as far as possible,  these

measures  should  be  in keeping  with  our  long-term

strategy.  We  should take advantage  of  the  present

slack   conditions  to  prepare  for   full   economic

recovery.  High growth rates may still  be  achievable

because  the  base from which we are climbing  is  low

compared to Japan, and also because Southeast Asia, as

a  whole,  may  well develop faster  as  a  result  of

increased oil prices, especially Indonesia.



<br><br><i>Industrial Development Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our industrial development policy would be to get

industries   to   increase   the   degree   of   local

manufacturing in their products by workers doing  more

and  more skilled jobs. The success of the policy  can

be  measured by the value added by each worker in that

industry.  Investment commitments  for  the  past  few

years indicated a growing trend in the value added per

worker  from  $14,000  in 1972  to  $32,000  in  1974,

reflecting  the increasing sophistication  and  higher

skills required of industries that would be set up  in

the near future. To meet the needs of such industries,

we   shall   have  to  make  sure  that  the  required

facilities  (land, utilities, buildings if  necessary)

are   developed  and  readily  available.   Our   only

requirement should be that such facilities are put  to

the best use.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of recession, there may be a greater need

for  financing on preferential terms. Our  efforts  to

promote supporting industries would be helped by  such

financing. I announced sometime ago a special fund  to

assist skill-intensive industries bearing higher risks

than    those   normally   acceptable   to   financial

institutions. The Capital Assistance Scheme, for which

$100  million has been provided in the Budget for  the

financial  year  1975,  will be  administered  by  the

Economic  Development Board. The  assistance  to  such

industries  will include Government taking  up  shares

which  the industrial venture partner can buy back  at

his  option, long-term loans or Government  guarantees

for  such  loans,  as well as shorter-term  loans  for

working capital. For other industries, long-term loans

are   available   at  preferential  rates   from   the

Development  Bank of Singapore (DBS). In  addition,  a

separate  export  financing  scheme  with  an  initial

provision  of $100 million has also been  set  up  and

administered   by  the  DBS  to  assist   our   export

industries.  I  should, however, emphasise  that  such

assistance  is given mainly to industries  which  have

higher  skills or technology and, as far as  possible,

have established markets and proven performance



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financial assistance, we shall be

making  greater  efforts  to promote  investment.  The

Economic Development Board has been reorganised to  do

this   more  vigorously.  Our  efforts  will  now   be

concentrated  where they should be, at the  investment

centres.  In addition to the nine centres  already  in

operation,  two  more  promotion  centres  are   being

established  in Houston and Copenhagen. These  centres

will  have  top-level staff and be directed  from  our

headquarters in New York to ensure proper attention to

all investment inquiries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also examining our tax incentives

legislation to see whether any additional incentive is

required to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



further  assist the promotion of desirable industries.

One  such area is the tax exemption period for pioneer

status which in suitable cases may need to be extended

from  the present five years to a maximum of 10 years.

This extension may make it sufficiently attractive  to

industries  to  set up here which require  substantial

investments  and  have long gestation  periods  before

profitability can be achieved. It would also  help  to

resolve  a  problem  of our present export  incentives

scheme  which gives an export certificate  holder  the

tax incentive when he exports his product but not when

he  sells  it  to a local manufacturer  who  needs  to

incorporate  it  in an, export product.  At  the  same

time,  I  am  removing  the  $1  million  fixed  asset

requirement   for  pioneer  status   for   small   but

especially high quality product industries to  provide

supporting services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board has often been asked

to  find  joint venture partners by both  foreign  and

local  parties.  It will now establish  a  Bureau  for

Joint  Ventures  which  will  collect  and  distribute

information  to  interested parties  and  provide  all

necessary assistance for such joint-venture projects.



<br><br><i>Export Promotion Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present export promotion efforts need to be

improved  during this recessionary period when  demand

the  world over has declined substantially. First, our

Commercial  Secretaries Service will  be  expanded  so

that  the  new  export markets can be  identified.  We

already have representatives in 13 countries. We shall

strengthen   the   existing   centres   through   more

experienced  staff  and set up centres  in  new  areas

including  West Asia and Eastern Europe to assist  our

manufacturers  and traders to explore new  markets  by

providing them with information and contacts.  Second,

the Government has agreed in principle to establish an

export   credit   insurance   guarantee   scheme    in

conjunction with the Banking and Insurance Community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



Detailed  discussions  on the  implementation  of  the

scheme  are  now  being  held.  Third,  to  help   our

exporters,  arrangements are now  being  finalised  to

enable  banks  to  rediscount export  bills  with  the

Monetary  Authority.  There  should  therefore  be   a

cheaper  source of financing for exports.  Fourth,  we

are   studying  various  ways  to  build  a   stronger

organisation for export promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, our usual export promotion activities

will  continue.  These  include  the  organisation  of

seminars  and  workshops on export promotion  for  our

local  industries  as  well  as  the  organisation  of

private  trade  missions and trade fairs.  It  is  our

intention   to   encourage   a   greater   degree   of

participation  from the private sector,  although  the

Government  may  still  play a  leading  role  in  the

organisation of such missions.



<br><br><i>Construction Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under world recessionary conditions, we shall step

up  construction activity to offset the expected  fall

in   output  and  employment  in  other  sectors.  New

construction  will  also help to  meet  infrastructure

demands  when  the economy recovers fully.  The  major

Statutory  Boards and Ministries will  press  on  with

their  development  plans. For  financial  year  1975,

Public Sector Development Expenditure is programmed to

increase  by almost $1,290 million to $3,080  million.

The  Government's  direct development  expenditure  is

expected  to amount to $630.6 million, an increase  of

$193.8   million  over  the  previous  year.   Special

emphasis will he placed on the provision of industrial

infrastructure, utilities, transport and communication

and housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for private sector construction, the Government

has  so  far introduced two measures to stimulate  it.

Banks  are  now allowed to include, for up  to  2%  of

their statutory liquidity reserve requirements,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



amounts  lent  on  mortgages of  new  properties.  The

restriction   on   the  purchase  of   properties   by

foreigners has also been amended to allow them to  buy

flats and apartments in buildings of not less than six

storeys.  This  in practice means the  more  expensive

apartments  for  which there is less demand  by  local

residents.  Private developers should play their  part

to  stimulate demand by lowering the present  property

prices which appear to be still excessive.



<br><br><i>Monetary Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coming year, monetary policy will continue

to  be directed at maintaining monetary stability  and

the   promotion   of   economic   growth.   Our   main

instruments,   the  variation  of  the  minimum   cash

balance,  which  banks and finance companies  have  to

maintain  with the Monetary Authority, and adjustments

in  interest  rates  will continue to  play  important

roles.  The  development of Singapore as  a  financial

centre will continue to receive special attention.



<br><br><i>Manpower Development Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now make a few remarks on our manpower

training  which  is  by  its  nature,  long-term.  Our

economic  strategy  recognises the  need  to  increase

skills  in our labour force, to assist us in promoting

industries requiring more skills, as well as  to  make

the  best  use  of  our workforce.  We  should  expand

training   and   re-training   programmes   during   a

recession,  when workers will be less fully  employed.

We  should use this vacant period in the lives of  our

workers  for  more  industrial training  so  that  our

labour  force  will be ready for more qualified  tasks

when the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, the Industrial Training Board has

increased  its industrial training capacity. Enrolment

in  1975 is up at 6,890 from 5,150 in 1974. The number

will be further increased later this year when we take

in more trainees. Training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



will be improved in quality by lengthening the training period and changing the course content to meet future industrial needs. Private sector training will be similarly improved by better use ofour Joint Industrial Training Centres. In addition to the present two centres, with RolIei and TATA, the third Joint Industrial Training Centre with Philips will begin training by July 1975. The Government has provided $10.5 million for industrial training in 1975. Of this, $8.5 million will be for more industrial grants and Joint Industrial Training Centres and $1.9 million will be used to send trainees overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aim in our manpower training is to change work

attitudes.  For  the higher skill industries,  workers

must  be prepared for longer and more intense training

periods. Our workers must increase their productivity,

through higher skills which can only come by hard work

and   diligence.  We  can  continue  to  achieve  more

economic progress only if our workers are prepared  to

tackle  difficult  tasks with greater  "value  added",

rather  than go for "cushy jobs". The ultimate  limits

to our productivity are the technological standards we

can  achieve,  which in turn means  the  standards  of

technological skills our workers are prepared to exert

themselves to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote industries requiring more skills, better

wage  rates  will be paid by these desired industries.

Wage  increases must, wherever possible, be pegged  to

productivity. Employers should, therefore, continue to

improve  their methods of working, to use less  labour

by   putting   in   more  equipment   and   machinery.

Productivity increases depend as much on workers as on

employers.  Both sides must play their parts  for  the

Government's  plans to establish more skill  intensive

and higher value added industries in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks on Economic Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our anti-recessionary measures within the coming

year would probably have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



inflationary  effects. To counter these  effects,  we

have some spare capacity at present for production  to

meet  any  additional demand for goods  and  services.

Declining  world demand has meant generally stable  or

lower  prices  for  most  raw materials  required  for

production. By buying our raw materials from  as  many

sources as possible, we can in any case ensure that we

buy   where  we  are  the  least  affected  by   price

increases. The Government will also continue to ensure

that  insofar  as  the domestic sector  is  concerned,

there will be as little profiteering as possible.  Our

people  should also conscientiously cut  out  wasteful

consumption.  The  aim is for our economy  to  recover

from  recession  without setting off another  bout  of

inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking anti-recessionary measures, we shall at

the  same  time  keep to our long-term objectives  and

policies.  We  have  the advantage  of  a  diversified

economy.  Next  our  sound foreign  exchange  reserves

position. We should still be able to achieve  economic

growth,  though probably at a lower rate than  in  the

years 1969-1973.



<br><br><i>The FY 1975 Budget</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Budget Estimates for the

financial  year  1975-76.  These  should  be  examined

against  the  economic  background  discussed  in  the

Economic    Survey    and   my   preceding    remarks.

Traditionally,  the  Budget  outlines  the  Government

expenditure for the year against its expected  revenue

and   upon  Parliamentary  sanction,  remains  as  the

control  document for the financial year. The  Budget,

however, also plays an increasingly important role  as

an instrument of economic policy. Budget proposals not

only  reflect the requirements of Government business.

They  can  also  respond to needs and changes  in  the

economy.  Thus,  the  Budget for  FY  75  is  counter-recessionary  in  its allocation  of  more  funds  for

development  purposes. At the  same  time,  its  usual

restraint on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



recurrent  expenditure  can  be  exercised   also   to

increase productivity in Government operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total provision for recurrent expenditure in FY

75 under the Main Estimates, excluding the transfer of

$500  million  to  the Development Fund,  is  $2,146.3

million. This has increased by

$326.8  million or 18 per cent over the provision  for

FY  74. The increase is spread between Other Operating

Expenditure   accounting   for   $220   million    and

Expenditure on Manpower accounting for $106.8 million,

The   need  for  the  increased  provision  for  Other

Operating Expenditure is due to the increasing  volume

of  Government business and the general rise in prices

of supplies and materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Manpower costs, the main reason for

the  increase  is the National Wage Council  award  in

1974 and the consequent increase in CPF contributions.

These  alone  account for $86 million. To offset  this

sizeable increase in Manpower costs, stringent control

has been exercised over increases in new .posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have continually exhorted the private sector to

increase   productivity  to  improve  our  competitive

position  in  the international market. Mindful  of  a

similar need for productivity in the public service, I

have asked my Ministry to place continued emphasis  on

developing  greater  administrative  skills,  adopting

innovative   ideas,  improving  work  procedures   and

methods,  and making greater use of machines  wherever

practicable. Admittedly, productivity is not as easily

measurable in certain services as it is in others. But

to   enhance  efficiency  and  performance,  a  simple

principle  is  to insist always on output  of  a  high

quality.   Manpower  increases  have  been   supported

selectively  and only in cases where  the  needs  have

been clearly demonstrated. Such increases have, by and

large, been confined to Ministries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



and  Departments  with  major  development  programmes

under implementation. As a result, the net increase in

the  permanent establishment for FY 75 including those

posts  created by Establishment Warrants during FY  74

has  been  kept  down to 1,689 posts or  2.7%  of  the

establishment level in FY 74.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the total provision in the Development

Estimates  has  been  allowed to  grow  from  $1,561.6

million  in  FY 74 to $2,188.2 million in  FY  75,  an

increase  of  4O.l%. This emphasis  on  development  I

earlier  indicated as being responsive  to  needs  and

changes in the economy in the Budget's increasing role

as an instrument of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards and Government companies providing

the   main   thrust   of  development   and   economic

infrastructural activities take up more  than  70%  of

the provisions under the Development Estimates. Direct

development  expenditure by Government Ministries  and

Departments also show a substantial increase of $193.8

million  or 44.4%. Such increases are consistent  with

the   policy   of   accelerating  public   development

activities during the recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation of funds is, however, only the first

step  in the development programme. The more important

step  is to get the accelerated programme implemented.

This  will  be the concern of the Economic  Activation

Committee  which  has been recently set  up  for  this

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before passing on to the next part of my Statement,

I should like to comment briefly on the presentational

changes  that have been incorporated in the  Estimates

documents.   Honourable   Members   are   aware   that

improvements have been made to the Estimates format in

the   last  two  Budgets.  Further  to  these  earlier

efforts, my officers have introduced more improvements

which   rationalise  the  way  in   which   Heads   of

Expenditure are established. Each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  is  now given only one Head of  Expenditure,

thereby  facilitating  inter-Ministry  comparisons  of

total allocations. The subhead codes have been refined

to  enable  Government Expenditure  to  be  classified

according  to  the economic impact of the expenditure.

These changes should provide useful information to the

Government  data  bank  and enable  a  more  effective

evaluation   to   be  made  of  the   efficiency   and

utilisation of our monetary allocations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these improvements in presentation, the

Treasury  Memorandum on the Estimates  which  must  be

considered part of the Budget documents has also  been

improved  in coverage and analysis of each  Ministry's

total  expenditure. As it also explains in detail  the

provisions under each Head of Expenditure, it makes it

unnecessary  for me to repeat in this  Statement  what

has already been said.



<br><br><i>Revenue</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury Memorandum also shows in detail how the

revised  yield  from individual items of  revenue  has

varied  from  the estimated yield in FY  74.  It  also

shows the yield we expect in FY

75.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated revenue of $2,647.5 million for

FY 75 represents a meager 5% increase over the revised

estimate  for  FY 74. Revenue in FY 73 was  27%  above

that in FY 72, and in FY 74 it was 13.6% above revenue

in  FY  73. Members will note the appreciable slowdown

in the rate of growth of revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated recurrent expenditure of $2,646.3

million  for  FY  75 is 6½% higher  than  the  revised

figure for FY 74. It includes the $500 million which I

propose to transfer to the Development Fun d.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the $500 million to be transferred from

the  Consolidated Fund, the Development Fund  will  be

augmented by the proceeds of new loans, both  domestic

and foreign, which I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



propose raising in the coming year. The Fund will also

benefit  from investment income and from repayment  of

loans  made to statutory boards and companies  in  the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, the estimated development expenditure of

$2,188  million, which is 60% higher than the  revised

figure  for FY 74, will exceed what is available  from

all  these sources by $245 million. This then  is  the

gap that has to be bridged, partly by new taxation and

partly by a drawdown from the Development Fund.



<br><br><i>Taxation Policy and Changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have on many occasions, and in previous budget

statements,  stressed  that it  was  the  Government's

policy  to give priority to economic growth, which  in

turn would bring increased revenues to finance growing

public expenditure. At the same time, we would improve

our  tax  collection machinery so as to  maximise  the

yield from existing taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to the marked slowdown in the rate

of growth of revenue since FY 73. In the coming fiscal

year, recurrent expenditure is expected to increase by

6½%  as against a growth of only 5% in revenue. We are

also approaching the effective limit for improving the

collection  machinery. Beyond this limit,  expenditure

on  further improvements will not yield a commensurate

increase  in  revenue. We thus have to  introduce  new

taxes  or increase the rates of existing taxes in  the

coming fiscal year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided against introducing any new taxes for

the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for increases to existing taxes, at a time when

rising  world prices are forcing a reduction,  or,  at

best,   preventing  any  improvement,  in  our  living

standards, I am reluctant to increase taxation lest it

should  raise  the  prices  of  essential  goods   and

services,   especially  food  and   clothing,   public

transport and housing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So additional revenue will have to come from

increased taxes on tobacco, liquor and cars, not basic

to life for the average family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware of the various measures introduced

by   the  Government  over  the  last  few  years   to

discourage  smoking. During calendar  year  1974,  the

total  consumption  of cigarettes showed  no  increase

over  1973  hut there was a marked shift  of  consumer

preference  in  favour of the more expensive  imported

brands.  The  duty on tobacco and cigarettes  will  he

increased, with immediate effect, as follows:



<pre>



                        Per Kilogram



                        From     To



Leaf  tobacco           $29.10   $32.00

Imported cigarettes	$32.50   $38.00

Locally manufactured

cigarettes              $ 3.00   $ 3.50

Pipe tobacco            $25.40   $28.00

Cut rag                 $27.60   $30.00



</pre>



Allowing  for  a  possible drop in consumption,  which

will  not  be  unwelcome,  the  increased  duties  are

expected  to  yield additional revenue  of  about  $9«

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs and excise duties on liquors will also he

increased. On beer and stout, the customs duty will be

increased by 15% and the excise duty by 8%. On  brandy

and  whisky, the customs duty will he increased by 3%.

Full details of the increases will be announced by  my

Ministry  later today. Additional revenue expected  is

about $6 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Annual Licence Fee (or road tax) on petrol-driven motor vehicles, including station wagons, will

be revised with immediate effect as follows:



<pre>



                        Revised     Old

                        rate        rate

                        per cc      per cc



1000 cc and under       20 cts      14 cts

1001 cc to 1600 cc      25 cts      17 cts

1601 cc to 2000 cc      30 cts      22 cts

2001 cc to 3000 cc      40 cts      35 cts

3001 cc and above       65 cts      60 cts

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



Thus,  a  3000  cc  car will now  have  its  road  tax

increased  by $150 from $105O per annum to $1,200  per

annum  as against the 1000 cc car which will have  its

tax  increased by $60 from $140 per annum to $200  per

annum.  Private hire cars will also be taxed  on  this

basis,  but  there will be no change in the  road  tax

payable  on  taxis. Cars registered  in  the  name  of

companies  will be taxed at twice the rate  applicable

to  those owned by individuals. Diesel tax on  private

motor  vehicles  based on six times the  road  tax  on

petrol-engine  vehicles will increase proportionately.

In addition, under income tax legislation, the capital

allowance  allowed for company cars  registered  after

today will be restricted to a maximum of $15000. There

will,   however,  be  no  change  in  the   Additional

Registration  Fee  on new vehicles, whether  owned  by

individuals or companies. Additional expected is about

$26 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases I have announced will yield additional

revenue  of  only  S4l.5  million,  compared  to   the

expected deficit on the Development Estimates of  $245

million. Four-fifths of the deficit will thus have  to

be financed by drawdowns from the Development Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against these tax increases, perhaps Members will

welcome  the  slight tax concession I now  propose  to

offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our rapid economic development in the last few

years, it has become apparent that we need our skilled

and  experienced people to go on working beyond  their

normal   retirement   age.  And  our   equally   rapid

development in medical facilities has made our  people

capable  of  working  beyond 55  years  old,  the  old

retiring age or even 60, the new retiring age. But  it

must be recognised that such people will need to spend

more  money staying healthy and getting to work.  With

effect  from  the 1976 year of assessment,  therefore,

the  earned income relief will be increased  from  the

present $1,000 to $2,000 for those over 55 years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



old and to $3,000 for those over 60 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the cost of this tax concession

will be some $4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like, in conclusion of my

remarks on the financial policy of the Government  for

the  financial  year 1975, to stress  once  again  the

crucial  importance of worker-management  co-operation

and  their  working  in  with Government  policies  to

ensure  Singapore's continued progress and prosperity.

If  our efforts are united, we should be able to  face

this troubled future with cautious optimism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
