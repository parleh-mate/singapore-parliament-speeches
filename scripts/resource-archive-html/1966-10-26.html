<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have to inform hon. Members that

at  10.30 a.m. on the 18th of October, 1966, I received

to hand a letter dated the 4th October, 1966, under the

hand  of  Dr  Fong Kim Heng, who was elected  to  this

House  as Member for Joo Chiat, resigning his  seat  in

Parliament. Members will recall that Dr Fong has  been

ill  and has had to apply for periods of leave. In view

of  his  continued ill-health Dr Fong states  that  he

feels it his duty to resign his seat. Dr Fong's letter

was received in my office on the 4th of October, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further have to inform hon. Members that at 10.30

a.m. on the 18th of October, 1966, I received to hand a

letter  dated the 8th of October, 1966, signed  by  Mr

Chia  Thye Poh who was elected to this House as  Member

for  Jurong. This letter was delivered to my office  on

the  8th  of October, 1966. The material part  of  this

letter reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Party" (i.e, the Barisan Sosialis) "has decided

that    all   Barisan   'MPs'   will   resign    their

'Parliamentary' seats as from today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 9 Barisan MPs are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Koo Young (Thomson)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Miss Loh Miaw Gong (Havelock)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Chan Sun Wing (Nee Soon)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Lee Tee Tong (Bukit Timah)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



I had to consider the effect of this letter in the

light of the Constitution, in particular, of Article 30

(2) (c) which provides that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The seat of a Member of Parliament shall become vacant, if,

by writing under his hand addressed to the

Speaker, he resigns his seat in Parliament;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of another letter I have received from Mr Lee

Tee  Tong, who was elected to this House as Member  for

Bukit  Timah, what I say hereafter on Mr Chia's letter

has no reference to Mr Lee Tee Tong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given Mr Chia Thye Poh's letter considerable

thought   in   view  of  the  particular  circumstances

affecting  certain of the Members named in the  letter.

To  my  mind, the provisions of Article 30 (2) (c)  are

clear  and  preclude  resignation  by  an  agent.   Any

resignation   to  be  effective  must,  amongst   other

requirements,  be  by writing under  the  hand  of  the

Member concerned and of no one else. I have, therefore,

come  to the conclusion that the letter signed  by  Mr

Chia  Thye Poh is ineffective for its expressed purpose

in so far as the following 7 persons are concerned:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Mr Koo Young - Member for Thomson



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mr Ong Lian Teng - Member for Bukit Panjang



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Mr Poh Ber Liak - Member for Tampines



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Mr Tan Cheng Tong - Member for Jalan Kayu



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Miss Loh Miaw Gong - Member for Havelock



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Mr Chan Sun Wing - Member for Nee Soon



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Mr Wong Soon Fong - Member for Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Thye Poh's own position caused me further difficulty in that, although the letter was under his hand and was addressed to me, he did not, in so many words, "resign his seat". However, after studying the matter and giving it considerable thought, I have come to the clear conclusion that Mr Chia Thye Poh's

personal intention was to resign his seat and  that  he

has adequately given effect to that intention by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



signing  that  letter addressed to me in the  terms  in

which  it was written and by causing that letter to  be

delivered to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have to inform hon. Members that at 10.30 a.m.

on  the  18th of October, 1966, I received  to  hand  a

letter  dated the 4th of October, 1966, under the  hand

of  Mr Lee Tee Tong, who was elected to this House  as

Member   for  Bukit  Timah,  resigning  his   seat   in

Parliament.  This letter was received in my  office  on

the 14th of October, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of Article 91(4) , the

resignations  of Dr Fong Kim Heng, Mr Chia  Thye  Poh

and Mr Lee Tee Tong have effect from 10.30 a.m, on the

18th of October, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I report to the House that the seats of

the  Members for Joo Chiat, Jurong and Bukit Timah  are

vacant.

<div align="center"><b>NON-SINGAPORE CITIZENS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Entry into Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if

he will consider permitting the entry into Singapore of

non-Singapore citizens over the age of, say,  60  years

whose sponsors can adequately provide for them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the existing rule

is that widows of 65 years and above and widowers of 70

years  and above will be considered for admission  into

Singapore.  I  am  prepared  to  revise  this  rule  by

including widowers who are 65 years and above. However,

the Government has examined the question of whether the

age limit should be lowered to 60 years and has come to

the  conclusion  that,  for the  moment,  it  would  be

inadvisable indeed to permit immigration of aged people

below 65 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the House is aware that as a little

island  State,  it  is very necessary  indeed  that  we

should  exercise a firm immigration policy.  Otherwise,

faced  with our own population expansion together  with

an  influx from other territories, we might in the near

future



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



be encumbered with considerable social problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, for the information of the Member, to

tell him that last year a total of 26 applications were

approved  and  this year, from January to September,  a

total  of  39  applications  have  been  approved.  The

majority  of  applications  which  were  rejected  were

mainly  because the applications referred to those  who

were  below 65 years old. Another major reason was that

the applicant was living with other children either  in

China   or  in  India,  and  therefore  could  not   be

considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also further emphasise that this regulation

concerning  admission  of aged parents  into  Singapore

refers  expressly to widows or widowers and that  these

persons should provide full evidence that they have  no

other  means  of support if they are not  permitted  to

enter  Singapore. I can assure the Member,  as  I  have

done  at  the  last sitting, that all applications  are

considered  on compassionate grounds but, at  the  same

time, we have also got to be fair not only to ourselves

but  to  the State so that we do not see that Singapore

is encumbered with unnecessary social problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): A

supplementary question, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned this

question. In my constituency there is a resident who is

a  citizen of Singapore and who has a mother of over 60

years  of  age in China. Several years ago  he  made  a

request  for her to come to Singapore but  it  was  not

approved.  The  reason was that he had  a  relative  in

China to support her. The complaint of this resident is

that  this relative of his mother in China has  already

been  transferred to another place in China. So I would

like  to ask whether the Minister will reconsider  this

application.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Minister can

answer that without notice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. If the Member

will give me the name of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



the applicant, the reference number of the letter which

he  received or which his constituent received from the

Controller of Immigration, I will look into the matter.

But I must emphasise to him that there must be absolute

proof  that  there is nobody in China  who  could  look

after the applicant. The Member has forgotten that  the

ruling applies only to widows who are 65 years old  and

above, and if she happens to be 62 years old, then I am

afraid  she  is  not  covered by  this  regulation  and

therefore cannot be granted admission.

Defence,  with the resumption of normal relations  with

Indonesia,  whether steps will be taken to contact  the

owners  of  the  premises of the  Kebun  Ubi  Community

Centre  at  Jalan Penggaga with a view to  regularising

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to

both parts of the question is "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No improvement to the building will avoid flooding

considering  building a community centre  elsewhere  in

whether  it is Government policy that women  could  and

should  also  share  in the task  of  safeguarding  the

immediate steps to create more opportunities  for  them

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the

Government's policy that women should share in the task

of  safeguarding  the security of our  young  Republic.

They  take  a rightful place in the ranks of  both  the

Police and the Army. The number of policewomen required

is, however,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



limited  by  the  fact that in the  field  of  criminal

activity,  particularly where violence is  used,  women

have not yet achieved equality with men. Therefore,  it

is necessary to employ more policemen than policewomen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the Army, women cannot be used as combat

troops,  but  they  are usefully engaged  in  clerical,

nursing and communications work.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can

I supplement my question? If there are posts at present

which  need women to come forward to serve the country,

especially posts in the Police Force, will the Minister

consider   providing  women  with   these   facilities?

According to him, certain posts are not quite  suitable

for  women, but I understand that in the Police  Force,

certain  posts  are quite suitable for women.  Will  he

consider providing better facilities for women to  join

the Police Force?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at present the

number of posts in the establishment of policewomen  is

something  like 245 - in that order of  magnitude  -  I

have not got the actual figure. Most of these posts are

filled. There are only a few vacancies, possibly  about

half a dozen. These will be filled in the normal course

of work.

before the end of the year in ten countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, diplomatic missions have been established

in   the   following  countries:  Australia,  Cambodia,

Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

In  addition, a permanent mission to the United Nations

has  been  established in New York. It  is  hoped  that

expenditure, last year this House voted  a  sum  of  $� million  for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This  sum

was  spent  on setting up the Ministry itself  and  two

overseas  missions - one in Kuala Lumpur and the  other

in  New  York. This year, a sum of $4 million has  been

voted.  However,  since most of the  overseas  missions

were  not  fully established until the middle  of  this

year,  the expenditure for the first half of  the  year

was below the expected average. Members will appreciate

that  until  the missions have been fully in  existence

for  at  least a year, it will not be possible to  give

reliable estimates of the annual expenditure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there was a serious  outbreak  of  pest

infestation in vegetable farms in Kampong Potong  Pasir

recently, The pest was identified as Diamond-Back moth.

In  early 1965 this species attacked vegetable farms in

Changi and Punggol, but with the assistance rendered by

the  officers  of  the  Primary Production  Department,

these farms soon became free from infestation. In March

1966 the Diamond-Back moth appeared in large numbers in

and  around  Kampong  Potong Pasir.  Teams  of  Primary

Production officers were immediately despatched to  the

scene to help combat the pest. They discovered that the

farmers there had been indiscriminately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



spraying their vegetable crops with all types  of

insecticides  which  proved to be ineffective,  because

the   pests   had  developed  a  resistance   to   such

insecticides.   The  problem  was  further   aggravated

because  the  Potong Pasir farmers, owing  to  economic

considerations, were unwilling to adopt  crop  rotation

which  is one reliable method of pest control  and,  in

fact, has proved effective in combatting the same pests

in Changi and Punggol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the advice of the Primary Production Department,

many  farmers in Potong Pasir have now agreed to  adopt

rotation of the crops. As a result, the extent  of  the

damage  caused  by  the  insect has  been  considerably

reduced. The Department has also recommended to farmers

the  use  of the moth alluring lights trap at night  to

kill  as  many  moths  as  possible.  In  addition,  by

carrying  out  extensive experiments and field  trials,

the   Department   has  found  an   organo   phosphorus

insecticide  sold  under  the trade  name  "Phospherin"

which  is  effective  against  the  Diamond-Back  moth.

Orders  for this effective insecticide have been placed

with overseas companies, and sufficient quantities  are

expected to arrive very shortly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department has also carried out

film  shows, lectures and discussions with  farmers  to

acquaint   them   with  the  latest   information   and

techniques   in   agricultural   pest   controls    and

eradication.  The  Department  has  also   helped   the

affected  farmers  to  obtain  social  welfare  aid  to

overcome their temporary hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pest infestation at Kampong Potong Pasir, though

not completely removed, has been minimised to a great

extent. It is expected that with the massive use of the

organo phosphorus insecticide after its arrival, the

pests will be wiped out.

National Development if he will consider converting the

existing  parking  lots in front  of  shop-houses  into

reserved lots for shopkeepers who may be willing to pay

the  fee for such parking lots as is charged for season

parking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Car Parks

Division  has a total of 7,076 parking lots,  of  which

3,493  or  approximately 50 per cent are delineated  in

the  central  business districts where the  demand  for

parking facilities is ever-increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of such facilities in certain areas has

added  to  traffic  congestion; hence  specifically  to

allocate  any  portion  of  a  road  frontage  for  the

exclusive use of shopkeepers will further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



aggravate   the   situation.  Requests  and   petitions

received  by  the Car Parks Division for implementation

of parking schemes in areas where such facilities have

not   been  provided  are  indications  of  a   general

awareness  of  the  advantages of having  as  many  car

parking lots as possible to enable shoppers to  have  a

readily  available place to park their  vehicles.  Only

recently  shopkeepers in Beach Road have petitioned  to

the   Member  of  Parliament  for  Kampong   Glam   for

restoration of parking lots which were deleted  by  the

Car  Parks  Division.  Similarly, shopkeepers  in  Arab

Street  have  also requested the Division to  implement

the pay parking scheme in this area for the convenience

of their customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view of my Ministry is that it will be wrong to

convert   the  existing  parking  lots  in   front   of

shophouses for the exclusive use of the shopkeepers, as

this  will only affect business transactions and  drive

away  customers to localities where parking  facilities

are more readily available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out that with the constant phenomena

built  up in motor traffic at the rate of 700 new  cars

per  month, there may come a time when parking  on  the

roads will be totally amended to prevent the city  from

being  strangled. In anticipation of this, my  Ministry

is  already preparing plans for more multi-storey, off-the-street  and underground car parks to be constructed

at  which  vehicles  will be allowed  to  park  without

detriment  to the traffic flow which is the  life-blood

of the city.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> A supplementary

question. Mr Speaker, Sir, from the answer given to me

just now by the Parliamentary Secretary, the Government

is  only  catering for the needs of the motorist.  Will

the Government also consider catering for the needs  of

the  shopkeeper  who is doing business  connected  with

loading  and unloading if, in front of his shop,  there

is  a  parking bay which is occupied by a motorist  who

parks his car there, and this brings about difficulties

in loading and unloading?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

raised by the hon. Member for Bras Basah is whether  we

can  provide parking lots for loading and unloading  in

front  of  shophouses. In fact, in every busy  business

centre  when a parking scheme is introduced, there  are

one  or  two  parking  lots reserved  for  loading  and

unloading. As I have just mentioned, we cannot  reserve

a  parking  lot  for every shopkeeper for  loading  and

unloading.  In drawing up the lines in one  street,  we

can  only  provide one or two parking lots for  loading

and unloading where there is a need for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> If the Department concerned does

provide  a parking bay for loading and unloading,  say,

about  50  feet  away from a shop which  requires  this

facility,  then  it does not serve the purpose  of  the

shopkeeper.  What I am asking is this: if a  shopkeeper

has  made an application to convert the parking bay  in

front  of  his  shop for his real need of  loading  and

unloading,    will   the   Government   consider    his

application?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

very simple. If the shopkeeper wants to make use of the

existing parking lot for loading and unloading, he  can

occupy the vacant parking lot for that purpose provided

he pays the charge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> But when the parking bay in front of

the  shop is being occupied by a motorist who parks his

car  there, how can the shopkeeper make use  of  it  to

load and unload the goods from the lorry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a supplementary, but the

earlier question is. Do you wish to answer it, Mr Ho?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, I consider this a

very simple question. He can find his own answer!

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister of State

(Prime  Minister's  Department)  whether  consideration

will  be given to establish a post office in the  Delta

Constituency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

There  are  already two post offices in  the  immediate

neighbourhood,  viz., Alexandra Road  and  Tiong  Bahru

Post   Offices,  to  meet  the  needs  of   the   Delta

Constituency  and,  therefore,  it  is  not  considered

necessary   to   establish  a  post   office   in   the

constituency itself.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would  like  to  put  a supplementary  question  to  be

answered by the Minister of State, and that is, whether

he  is  aware  that  the development  of  Singapore  is

proceeding  ahead  in order to meet  the  changes,  and

these   changes   are  such  that   they   are   beyond

description. For example, in the past, there were  only

about  14,000 voters in this constituency. But  at  the

present  moment the number of voters is more than  four

times  that  in  the past. This means there  are  about

70,000 voters in this constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask the Minister is

whether he is aware that the changes in the Tiong Bahru

area  have  been very considerable. In the past,  there

were  only about 12,000 voters. But now because of  the

housing  development  in  this  area  this  figure  has

increased  to  about 60,000. In view of these  changes,

can  the  Minister say that the needs in the past  have

been   satisfied  and  whether  such  needs  have   not

increased in view of the changes?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

realise that the rate of advance is rapid and that the

number of voters has increased. We also realise our

responsibility that there are two post offices in the

immediate neighbourhood of Delta Constituency. The

increase of the voters can be met by increasing the

staff.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

still have a supplementary question to ask. The

Minister has mentioned just now the present services of

the two post offices, but in fact there is only one.

That one is in Tiong Bahru. I would like to ask him

whether he knows that, of the two post offices, one

belongs to Queenstown and the other to Tiong Bahru, and

whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



he  knows  that the Tiong Bahru post office,  which  is

very  small, is situated in a shophouse of the  Housing

Board? If there are ten persons in the post office,  it

will be jammed up. In view of this, can he honestly say

that  this post office itself is enough to satisfy  the

local needs, and whether he is prepared to go there for

an investigation?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): At this stage, I am

satisfied with the service provided by the post offices

there,  as  I have received no complaints of inadequate

service  from  members of the public. However,  if  the

hon.  Member is really having difficulty, I  will  look

further into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can I ask another

supplementary question, Sir? The Minister of State  has

said  that  he has not received any complaints  of  the

inadequacy of the postal services. But as a  Member  of

the constituency, I have personally received complaints

on  this matter. If I receive many complaints, will  he

be prepared to consider increasing the postal services?

Perhaps  the Member for Tiong Bahru himself may  ask  a

similar question?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Minister of State did, in

fact,  say  that he would make an investigation  if  he

received  complaints.  So  perhaps  Madam  Chan   could

forward all complaints received by her to the Minister?

<div align="center"><b>DRIVING TESTERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> asked the Minister of State

(Prime Minister's Department) if applicants for driving

licences  have  a  choice  in  the  identity  of  their

testers;  if  he  is aware that certain applicants  for

driving  licences are refusing to be  examined  or  are

otherwise avoiding being tested by particular  testers;

whether  he  will  inquire into  the  causes  for  such

refusals; and what steps he proposes to take to  remove

those causes.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

applicants  for  driving licences cannot  choose  their

driving tester. There are 20 driving testers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



the  applicant  for  a  driving  licence  has  to  take

whichever  driving tester is assigned  to  him  by  the

Licensing Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously very undesirable to allow the

applicant  for a driving licence to choose the  driving

tester  who is to test him. A person who has refused  a

driving  test by one tester cannot be assigned  another

driving tester. If the department is to allow this,  an

applicant,  by  refusing several driving  testers,  may

finally get a tester of his choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that certain applicants for driving

licences have withdrawn from taking their driving  test

when  they  have  been  assigned a  particular  driving

tester.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have enquired into the cause of their withdrawals.

It  is not the applicants who have refused to be tested

by   a  particular  tester  but  it  is  their  driving

instructors who have refused to allow them the  use  of

the  instructors' vehicles when applicants are assigned

to  a particular tester. I have also enquired into  the

reasons for this action by certain driving instructors.

These  instructors had made certain general  complaints

against  a particular tester. In view of the generality

of  the  complaints,  the  instructors  concerned  were

requested    to   submit   specific   complaints    for

investigation  by  the Registrar  of  Vehicles.  A  few

specific  complaints  were subsequently  made  and,  on

investigation, it was found that they had  either  been

settled previously or were unjustified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that the method chosen by certain

driving instructors to redress their grievances is most

improper.  My  Ministry  is  prepared  to,  and   will,

investigate  specific  complaints  of  misbehaviour  or

misconduct  against any tester, but we will  not  allow

ourselves   to   be  intimidated  or   pressurised   by

individuals or groups of individuals who have seen  fit

to choose strong-arm methods for the redress of alleged

grievances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Can the Minister tell this

House why is it that this is a complaint of the Driving

Testers' Association and not an individual complaint? I

would ask the Minister to inform this House whether  he

will  take  into consideration the complaints  of  this

Association?

Ministry has received the complaints referred to by the

hon.  Member just now, but we must judge the complaints

on  their  merits.  It is because  the  nature  of  the

complaints   is  general  that  my  Ministry   has   no

alternative but to turn down the allegation made by the

Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Just now the Minister of State has

stated  that there are 20 driving testers.  Why  is  it

that  only one particular tester is being boycotted  by

the  driving instructors and why are the other  19  not

boycotted? What is the reason for it?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the answer

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not proposed to place a zebra crossing at Changi

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is an international

trading  centre.  It  is, therefore,  logical  that  we

should  join  in international communication  projects,

and  SEACOM  is such a project. We should, however,  be

able   to   know   the   extent  of  our   commitments.

Unfortunately, our resources are limited  and  we  must

make  the best use of them. From the estimates,  I  see

that  our original commitment was some $10 million.  We

are  now, however, asked to increase our commitment  by

some  $2 million. The reason given is that the increase

is  necessary because of the re-routing and increase in

the  capacity of the cable. It is, therefore,  relevant

to  ask  whether  Singapore was consulted  on  the  re-routing and also on the increase in the capacity of the

cable to be laid. Can the Minister assure us that  this

will  not be an open-handed commitment in which we will

be  asked  to  increase our contribution from  time  to

time?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  to clarify the doubts of the Member for  Choa

Chu Kang, I would like to inform the House that the re-routing  of the SEACOM cable was contingent on  account

of  Indonesian confrontation. The original plan  called

for  a  cable  which would run from  Australia  to  New

Guinea,  New  Guinea  to Jesselton,  and  Jesselton  to

Singapore.  However, when confrontation  broke  out  in

1963, the plan had to be revised, and consequently  the

cable went up to Hong Kong, Hong Kong to Guam, Guam  to

New Guinea and New Guinea to Australia. Singapore, as a

partner  of  SEACOM, has always been consulted  on  any

changes in plans in cable routing, and the increase  in

capacity is to the advantage of all SEACOM partners. In

fact,  from  what I gathered just now, the forecast  is

that even the capacity of 160 two-way channels will  be

very  much limited in the near future, when the project

itself  opens. That is one of the reasons why ways  and

means  are  now  being studied as  to  how  to  improve

telecommunications between SEACOM neighbours -  between

Singapore  and Australia on the one hand, and Singapore

and Tokyo, and Singapore and Europe, on the other hand.

I can assure the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



Choa  Chu Kang that all plans have been considered very

carefully.  It  is  not  the intention  of  the  SEACOM

partnership to waste money unnecessarily. In any  case,

this is an investment because telecommunications brings

in  revenue  and the expectations are that we  will  be

able to recover our capital expenditure within the next

6 to 7 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, telecommunication is vital to an

international  trading centre like Singapore.  I  think

the  Government  deserves to be  congratulated  on  its

decision  to  acquire the assets of Cable and  Wireless

Limited and on its firm stand in its negotiations  with

the  Malaysian Government in regard to the  acquisition

of Cable and Wireless Limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I want to raise is one of detail only. I

just want to know whether we are paying the right price

for the Company's assets. I have been trying to do some

research  on  my own, but, unfortunately, without  much

success.  Through the kind help of the House Librarian,

I  managed  to get a copy of the Company's  Report  and

Accounts for the Year ending 31st March, 1964 -that was

just  before the Company was acquired by the  Malaysian

Government  then.  Unfortunately, the Report  contained

only  consolidated accounts of the Cable  and  Wireless

Group  as  a whole, with no breakdown for the Singapore

operations, and without any indication of the value  of

the  assets  in Singapore. I should be pleased  if  the

Minister would enlighten us on this point.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang  had earlier indicated to me what information

he   required,  I  myself  could  have  done  a  little

investigation into this enormous volume of files  which

began  since 1962. In that year the lease of Cable  and

Wireless  Limited was expiring and we had proposed  the

formation of an Overseas Telecommunications Board which

would  have,  as  partners,  the  Singapore  Government

holding  51  per cent of the shares and the Company  49

per  cent.  In  fact, at that period we  had  conducted

investigations into the capital assets of the  Company.

I  can  assure  the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  that  an

enormous  amount  of detailed work has  gone  into  the

valuation  of  the  plant and removable  and  immovable

property  of Cable and Wireless. He need not fear  that

we  have  been cheated or over-paid on account  of  the

take-over. I will only add that there has been  justice

done to both sides, to the Company and also to us.

experience of such bad treatment. The usual  excuse  is

that the doctors in charge are over-worked. If that  is

the reason, the remedy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



is  surely  to  engage  more doctors  and  improve  the

Speaker,  Sir, under subhead 013 of Head D  04,  it  is

recorded  that  outpatient attendances  have  increased

five  times  in  the last decade while operations  have

increased about four times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the improvement to existing wards and the increase

in  the  number  of wards, I regret the conversions  of

Wards  Nos.  61  and  62 into paying-class  wards.  The

increase  in  the number of outpatient attendances  and

operations shows that the people involved are not well-to-do people and if we increase the number of wards  to

paying-class   wards,  this  will  not   overcome   the

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker. Sir, may I answer the criticism of the  Member

for  Choa  Chu  Kang in the first place? I  believe  he

indicated  that  there  was not enough  information  in

Paper  Cmd.  24  of 1966 on the request for  additional

funds to provide improvements to the Orthopaedic Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give a little background history of

this particular item - Improvements for the Orthopaedic

Unit in Outram Road Hospital. The original plan was  as

late  as  1958  - eight years ago  -  and  it  was  then

something like a $ 1� million proposal which in  1959  I

felt was excessive, and I had it brought down to a  sum

of  $300,000. There were therefore considerable savings

for  the State of more than $1 million. Of this reduced

sum of $300,000, unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance

provided  only $50,000 for 1966. Later on, an  approved

transfer of $75,000 was granted, and the request in the

Command Paper is for a sum of $224,400 which is  really

in keeping with a contract which has been let for a sum

of $339,967.80. This does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



include,  however, a vote for "Furniture and Equipment"

which  is  estimated at nearly $110,000, but  this  sum

will be entered in next year's Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that will meet the Member's request for more

information on the expenditure of this sum of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer his second question that the outpatient

service in the hospital is bad, I am sorry to hear that

he has had an unhappy experience in the hospital and  I

would  appreciate  it if he would put  this  matter  in

writing, indicating the day when he was at the hospital

and  where  he felt he had not been fairly treated,  so

that I can investigate further into the matter. Because

I think it is pretty dangerous sometimes just to listen

to  one  complaint and "tar" the whole service.  In  my

opinion  -  as  the Member himself has admitted  -  the

doctors  might have been grossly over-worked  and  were

therefore  perhaps a little short of temper during  the

wee  hours of the morning. However, if I can  get  more

information,  I  will be in a position  to  investigate

into  the matter fully and give a firm decision on  it.

But I do not think that it is as simple as suggested by

the Member, that to meet the situation, all we need  do

is  to  employ more doctors. It is not that we  do  not

wish   to  employ  more  doctors.  There  are  on   the

establishment  450 doctors, and at the moment  we  have

close  to 400 doctors. The vacancies are there.  It  is

available  for  any doctor who wishes to  apply  to  be

considered for appointment, and it is very rarely  that

we  turn down any application from a doctor who  wishes

to join Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards improvements to the conditions of service,

etc.,  this is something which I, as a Minister,  would

very  much  like  to  encourage and support.  But  here

again, there is my colleague, the Minister for Finance.

In  addition, there is already a Salaries Commission in

existence  and I do not think that we should anticipate

events  or  to  say  things which would  embarrass  the

working of this Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered the comments of the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang  and I will now answer the  Member  for

Kampong Kapor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not appear to be happy over the fact that the

funds asked for are for the renovation of Wards 61  and

62  into paying-class wards, because he feels that this

would not meet the situation of those less able to  pay

after being admitted into the hospital. It is important

to  remind him that the majority of cases admitted into

the  Orthopaedic  Unit  are  in  respect  of  accidents

arising  out of employment or motor traffic. In  almost

every  instance, it is the employer who will be bearing

the expenses for such treatment. Therefore, it will not

in  any  way increase the burden for the less fortunate

members of our public if they are admitted into  paying

wards, because it is the employer who will have to meet

such   liability   under  the  workmen's   compensation

insurance which every good employer takes up to protect

his liability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the numerous accidents which we have -

something like 100 motor accidents a day - every car on

the  road  is  covered  compulsorily  with  third-party

insurance, and therefore personal injuries as a  result

of   motor   accidents  are  rightful  claims   against

insurance companies. I have already indicated  sometime

ago  that  it is our intention to make it so,  so  that

insurance companies will meet these dues. In the  past,

for  some queer reasons, the Government hospitals  have

not  taken  the  trouble  to send  bills  to  insurance

companies  and  I  think it is time that  this  serious

loophole in the revenue of the State should be plugged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can therefore assure the Member for Kampong Kapor

that   by  having  more  paying-class  wards   in   our

Orthopaedic Units we shall not be penalising the poorer

sections  of the public, because we shall  be  able  to

recover  most  of the dues from employers or  insurance

companies.  It is anticipated that we will be  able  to

get  at least $� million each year by this process  and

therefore  we  shall  be able to  recover  all  capital

expenditure probably in a matter of years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new subhead, Mr Speaker, Sir, this House is

asked  to  approve a sum of some $6�  million  for  the

improvement  of  Television and Broadcasting  Services,

again  without  this  House  being  supplied  with  any

information  or  a  detailed breakdown  of  the  amount

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated that there is urgent need for the

improvement   of   television   and   radio   services,

especially  the radio services, since our independence.

We  are  a  multi-racial,  multi-religious  and  multi-lingual  society  professing and practising  democratic

socialist  principles.  We should  therefore  make  our

policy  known to all our people at home and to  project

our  image  abroad, and the best means of doing  so  is

through the television and radio services. But it  does

not  mean that this House will approve some $6� million

without  knowing how the money is going to be spent.  I

understand  that the sum is in addition to the  sum  of

more than $3 million that has already been spent on the

new Television House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing I would like to say about

television, and that is commercial advertising.  Whilst

we  appreciate  that  it  may  be  necessary  to  allow

commercial advertising in television to help it pay its

way, commercial advertising seems to be now getting out

of  hand,  especially during what are called the  "peak

hours"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



when the amount of advertising time is fast approaching

that  of  the ordinary programme time. If this tendency

is  not  checked, we may soon get into  the  ridiculous

situation  of having the "Radio Weekly" detailing  only

the  commercial  programmes  and  leaving  us  to  have

glimpses  of  cowboys shooting Indians in  between  the

commercials.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> On the first query by the hon.

Member,  I wish to inform the House that the  need  for

improving  and  expanding  our  television  and   radio

services has become extremely urgent. Included in  this

expansion  scheme  are  additional  and  more  powerful

transmitters   for  both  radio  and   television   and

additional studio facilities for television. The sum of

about  $6� million is therefore required. Actually  the

total sum involved is $6.5 million and the breakdown is

as follows -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio Service - radio transmitters are about $2.5

million,  the frequency modulated transmitter  is  over

$300,000,  and  there is also some payment  of  customs

duties  which  amount  to  $160,000.  T.V.  Service  to

increase  T.V. cover amounts to about  $870,000;  T.V.

equipment (non-engineering) is about $570,000. And  the

Studios - four T.V. studios - works and buildings  cost

about $400,000, and equipment about $1.4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second query in which the hon. Member expresses

his  fear  of commercial advertising, I wish  to  state

that it is necessary to get income from advertising  to

buy more expensive and better quality films as well  as

to  cover part of the cost of running the T.V. station,

which is, as we all know, an expensive affair. Compared

with  other countries, Mr Speaker, Sir, the  frequency

of   advertisements  appearing  on  T.V. here  can  be

considered low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the House, Sir, the cost of

running T.V. Singapura is approximately $6 million  per

year,  and  the revenue from commercial advertising  is

about  $3� million per year. Anyway, Sir, I can  assure

the hon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 07 be reduced

by $10 in respect of new subhead 024.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two points to be

considered  here.  The first point  is  whether  it  is

necessary to disturb the present natural environment of

MacRitchie Reservoir. The second point is whether, even

if  it  is  decided that we should do so, it is  not  a

question of wrong priorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

MacRitchie Reservoir is a natural beautiful park as  it

is.  I  have  visited it, and it has all the  aesthetic

features  of a natural environment - tall shady  trees,

soft  green  grass,  birds  singing  overhead,  insects

humming around. Mr Speaker, Sir, attap shelters cannot

take  the  place  of shady trees, and  paved  footpaths

cannot  take  the  place of soft  green  grass,  and  a

floating  fountain and a tea kiosk will not, I  submit,

Mr Speaker, Sir, improve the aesthetic features of the

park.  When  concrete and mortar  and  a  motorway  are

brought  in,  the  natural  environment  of  MacRitchie

Reservoir will be no more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that the P.W.D. will be in charge of the

project. The P.W.D. is a solid, hardworking department.

Unfortunately, it has so far not proved itself  capable

of being the author of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



aesthetically  beautiful  project.  Take  the   Raffles

Underground Car Park and Garden, Sir. It is  functional

but it is ugly. It has a fountain and a flower bed, but

fountains  and flower beds alone do not make  beautiful

gardens.   It   is  the  arrangement  -   the   overall

arrangement  -  of  these things that  makes  beautiful

gardens.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if Mount Faber  is  another

place  to judge by, I feel very apprehensive about  the

natural  beauty of our park at MacRitchie Reservoir.  I

do  not  think we have improved Mount Faber, scenically

speaking.  On  the other hand, I have heard  a  lot  of

complaints that the cosiness of the place, the  romance

of it, is being spoilt. The harsh public lighting is no

substitute for the soft moonlight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even granted that we are so insensitive as to

prefer  a man-made fountain to a natural running stream

and  decide that this project should be proceeded with,

regardless, there is still the question of priority  to

be  considered. We are a small country. Our  resources,

as  I  have  said  just  now,  are  limited.  We  must,

therefore,  make  the best use of  them.  We  are  here

proposing  to spend a quarter of a million  dollars  on

something  that  needs no improvement, whilst,  at  the

same  time,  in  the rural areas basic  amenities  like

electricity and piped water have not been provided for.

In  my constituency in Choa Chu Kang, for example, Sir,

there  are areas - and indeed large areas - where there

is  not  even  piped water, not to say  the  luxury  of

public  lighting. And the money to be  spent  on  these

projects could be better spent, I submit, on the  rural

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a quarter of a million dollars could be channelled

into  the rural areas, it would do a tremendous lot  to

improve  the  basic  standard of living  of  the  rural

people.  It would be little comfort to the rural  folks

to  be  told  by the Minister for National  Development

that  they  could watch coloured water playing  in  the

floating  fountain in MacRitchie Reservoir,  when  they

have  not even piped water at home to drink or to  use.

That  is the irony of this project, Sir, and I  beg  to

move.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on this

new subhead 024, I would like to know from the Minister

for Law and National Development whether the purpose of

this vote is to make a park for the people of Singapore

with the idea of reducing the dust and filth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier about my suspicions regarding

payments  made to the Ministry of Health, I  am  rather

worried  if  the use of the car park, as  mentioned  in

this  scheme,  is to be paid for, as  is  done  at  the

Airport at present, because it will be a burden to  the

people  who want to make use of the car park. Normally,

people  who  visit parks like MacRitchie Reservoir  are

usually poor. Although we see them going there in cars,

these cars are sometimes borrowed from their friends or

hired.  For example, on a Saturday if someone wants  to

go  for a ride or stroll in MacRitchie Reservoir during

the  day, he has to pay car park charges at High Street

and then in the evening he will have to pay again. This

will be a burden, Mr Speaker. There are also occasions

when  rich  people go to the parks, but they  will  not

make visits to MacRitchie Reservoir as they have better

places  to  go to which are in line with their  status.

But  there  are  also rich people who go to  MacRitchie

Reservoir.  I  would like to know once again  from  the

Minister  concerned whether the use  of  the  car  park

proposed in this scheme will be paid for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would like to speak on this item to express some of  my

personal  views.  On  the question  of  establishing  a

paying  car  park,  some Members have  expressed  their

objection to paying car parks in certain areas. I  feel

that in some places it is necessary to have paying  car

parks. For example, on a public holiday many people  go

to  the MacRitchie Reservoir grounds. So if there is  a

car park, it will be a great convenience to the holiday

makers and visitors. And if the authority should impose

a   fee  of,  say,  40  cents  per  hour  it  is  quite

reasonable.  Otherwise, without this  imposition  of  a

fee, there will be some jaga kereta boys operating in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



this area. They will demand payment from motorists,  an

act  which  is illegal. So the payment of 40 cents  per

hour  or  20  cents per half hour is quite a reasonable

measure.  Government will in turn provide the necessary

facilities  and  make use of the money  in  some  other

fields and the public will benefit.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst it is desirable

that  development should, as far as possible, be spread

throughout the island so that our population living  in

the  various  constituencies are all catered  for,  the

hard  economic facts are that it is necessary to ensure

that   the   total  quantum  of  funds  available   for

development projects are utilised in the best  possible

manner.  Although it is the aim to provide as  large  a

number  of  the  population  as  possible  with   basic

amenities,  like light and water, the deterrent  factor

is  often  the  heavy capital expenditure  involved  in

bringing  electricity  and  water  supplies  to  remote

kampongs   off   the  beaten  track.  Choa   Chu   Kang

Constituency   is   one  such  area.  The   authorities

concerned  in  deciding whether to extend  supplies  to

specific  areas have to have regard for  the  economics

involved.  A  sufficient rate of return on the  capital

invested  is necessary so that the scheme is economical

and  the  Public Utilities Board is able  to  meet  the

requirements  of  the  World Bank  in  respect  of  the

prescribed rate of returns for loans. Nevertheless,  as

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang will be aware, during the

last  six years a sum of $700,160 has been expended  to

provide  water and electric services for Choa Chu  Kang

alone.  This figure of over $700,000 is only for  water

and  lights, and has nothing to do with roads or  other

amenities. On water supplies alone a sum of $65,230 was

spent.  On electric supplies a sum of $595,930.  Street

lighting in the Member's constituency cost $39,000.  So

as  far as Choa Chu Kang Road is concerned - this is  a

road  - water and electrical mains have been laid right

up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



to the  end  of  the  road, and I can assure  you,  Mr

Speaker, that Choa Chu Kang is a long road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other long road in that district is Lim Chu Kang

Road.  On that road electrical mains have been laid  up

to  the  19th  milestone, two miles from  the  end.  No

doubt,  in  due course, supplies will be extended  upon

request and, on the basis of determined priorities,  to

extend these to the end. Despite all endeavours,  there

will  be  villages  in  outlying  areas  far  from  the

electricity   and  water  mains  where   it   will   be

exorbitantly   expensive  to  provide   the   necessary

amenities.  In  many of these areas, for  example,  the

Southern  Islands, Changi, Tampines and Sembawang,  the

number  of consumers is relatively so small as to  make

the project completely uneconomical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of the high cost involved can be seen from

the  fact  that to provide one mile of water  mains  in

Lorong  Buang  Kok,  the cost was nearly  $100,000.  To

provide  electric supplies to 290 houses  at  Choa  Chu

Kang  Road from the 13� milestone to the 14� milestone,

just  one mile, the cost was $163,740; while to provide

one  mile of street lighting from Bukit Panjang Village

to  Yew Tee Village, the cost was $23,000. That I hope,

Mr  Speaker, should dispose of the Member's  arguments

as to priorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang also made the suggestion

that  things at MacRitchie Reservoir should be left  in

their  natural beauty. He does not want me  to  disturb

the  birds.  I  can  assure him  that  the  development

envisaged  at MacRitchie does not involve  the  cutting

down  of  trees  or  turning  the  reservoir  into   an

artificial   garden.  The  development  envisages   the

minimum  clearance of shrubs and undergrowth  only  and

the  provision of certain facilities, leaving the trees

and  the landscape and the birds as far as possible  in

their natural state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this town is expanding fast. There is an

acute shortage of lungs and open spaces as a result  of

our  tremendous housing programmes and the idea  behind

the MacRitchie scheme is to enable full utilisation  of

one existing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



open  space by the population. The Member for Choa  Chu

Kang  will  agree that a healthy community is  a  vital

necessity.  The  provision of  facilities  like  a  tea

kiosk, a bandstand and a fountain at minimal cost  will

attract even more people to this already popular  spot.

Not  only  will the people in the neighbouring  Thomson

and  Sembawang  areas  but  also  those  from  outlying

districts,  including Choa Chu Kang and Kampong  Kapor,

will  be attracted to spend a pleasant evening  in  the

environs  of this reservoir by the provision  of  these

minimal  facilities. A tea kiosk is necessary in  order

to  keep out hawkers from the reservoir parks so as  to

reduce  the  chances  of  water pollution.  A  floating

fountain  in  the reservoir itself should  enhance  the

beauty  of  the area at little expense. In  short,  Mr

Speaker, the project envisages the enhancement  of  the

natural  beauty  of  the  place  by  the  provision  of

additional  features  and  not  the  creation   of   an

artificial  garden. I am sure that when the development

is  completed  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  will  be

pleased with the results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor has been harping on the

charges  which, he says, we might introduce at the  car

park.  He  says,  "Do  not  charge."  The  Member   for

Sembawang says, "Charge."

I  can  assure  both Members that before any  fees  are

imposed  careful consideration will have to  be  given.

There must be a period of trial and experiment. At  the

moment,  there  are no car parking fees  at  MacRitchie

Reservoir,  though, I believe, the place is  packed  in

the  evening and at night. We will only introduce  fees

for  parking  at MacRitchie should the demand  for  car

parking  spaces  exceed the amount of space  available,

and that, in fact, is the whole basis of car parking in

Singapore. Unless we charge fees for parking,  the  day

will  come  in Singapore, and it will come  soon,  when

there is complete traffic chaos in the town. But no one

has moved an amendment to the other subhead which deals

with  the underground car park, so I will not make  any

comments except to say to the Member for Choa Chu  Kang

that though he does not like the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



underground  car  park at Raffles Place,  it  serves  a

useful  purpose and in fact a hundred per cent  of  the

car  parking  places at the Raffles Car  Park  are  now

fully used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mount Faber, he is entitled to his own views.

But  you get a lovely view from Mount Faber, and if  he

does not like it, I suggest he go elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not quite

satisfied  with the explanation given by the  Minister.

While it may be quite true that a tremendous amount  of

money  is being spent in the rural areas - and  he  has

given me figures for the amounts spent in Choa Chu Kang

in  respect  of water and lighting - the  fact  remains

that  in these rural areas the basic amenities of  life

are  not satisfied. My thesis is that unless and  until

such  amenities are satisfied, it is against  socialist

principles  that  the  urban  areas  should  be   given

amenities that are not the basic requirements of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that it is a matter of opinion whether Mount Faber is a better area after a tremendous amount of money has been spent on it. I do not think it improves it scenically and I am sure a lot of people do not think so. If that is the case, why should we spend money on something that is not

necessary  while, at the same time, leaving  the  basic

requirements  of  life  not  satisfied?   Take   public

lighting in Mount Faber, for example. I am sure  it  is

not  appreciated there. In fact, I think it does  cause

considerable  annoyance to a lot of people,  especially

loving  young couples who visit Mount Faber. Funds  for

such public lighting could very well be spent and would

very   much   be  appreciated  in,  for   example,   my

constituency.  That, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is  my  thesis:

that the Minister has got his priorities wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang argues that

until  every  house in his district  is  supplied  with

light  and  water, my Ministry should not  do  anything

about building parks or fountains.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an argument which I cannot accept. It will

probably be 10 to 15 years before every householder  in

his  district is supplied with light and water. I  have

given  the reasons why up to date water and electricity

supplies  have  not reached every remote  farm  in  his

district. Does it mean that I can do nothing to improve

the  urban  areas  until I have satisfied  every  basic

requirement of his constituency? I can assure him  that

we  are  spending more money every year  on  the  rural

districts.  And this goes for every rural  district  in

Singapore. Urban areas receive much less; then come the

semi-urban or semi-rural districts; then come the rural

districts. If we were spending more money on the  urban

districts than on the rural districts, then I would say

we  are  wrong.  But  we are not doing  .that.  We  are

spending  more money in his district, which  is  rural,

than,  say, my district in Tanglin which is semi-urban.

But  if  not every householder in his district of  Choa

Chu  Kang  has light and water, I can assure  him  that

there  are people in my constituency in Tanglin who  do

not  have  light  and water too. There are  many  other

constituencies which do not have these basic amenities.

But  does  it mean that we cannot build a fountain?  We

have  built  so  many  flats in Singapore  and  we  are

building  more. We have spent hundreds of  millions  of

dollars  providing  housing. If I were  to  accept  his

argument,  it  means that until we  house  everyone  in

Singapore,  no  fountain  should  be  erected.  But   a

fountain is a thing of beauty, and all he has to do  is

to visit the three fountains, the giant fountains which

have  been recently erected. I have not heard one  word

of  criticism. The only words I have heard are words of

praise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mount Faber, he grumbles about providing

lights. When we do not provide the lights, he grumbles.

When  we provide the lights, he grumbles too. I believe

he  is  the only bachelor in the House. But before  you

pull me up for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



being personal, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I should  not

say anything further on that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, can I contribute

something towards -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Most certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am inclined to

agree  with  the  Member for Choa  Chu  Kang  that  the

provision  of  basic amenities for the rural  areas  is

more urgent than that for the urban areas. I think  the

Minister is a little unfair when he says that even when

we  provide lights, the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  does

not like it, and when we do not provide lights, he also

does  not  like it. I think that is not  the  point  of

complaint  of  the  Member. He  simply  said  that  the

$30,000  which the Government wants to make use  of  to

develop  MacRitchie Reservoir, could be better utilised

to  develop the rural areas or places mostly  populated

by poor people who are in need of amenities. I remember

at  our  last sitting the Member for Delta also  shared

the same feeling that whenever a fountain is built,  it

is  built  in the bourgeois area, say, in a place  like

Tanglin  which is well provided. There is no  necessity

at all to build another fountain. That is all, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  various speakers  have  spoken  on  the

question before the House. I would also like to express

my views and my feelings. I feel that this amount to be

voted  for  actually exceeds what the  Government  have

allocated  for the Urban and Rural Services  Committee,

and  exceeds  the Committee's approval to be  spent  on

Redhill, because the total expenditure on Redhill  does

not exceed $30,000. Since the expenditure on building a

car park, attap shelters, garden seats and other things

at  MacRitchie  Reservoir  exceeds  the  sum  spent  on

Redhill  to provide basic facilities for the  residents

there,  most of the poor people there may have  adverse

reactions to this sort of measure. As to the  car  park

to be provided in MacRitchie Reservoir. I myself do not

have a car, so I will not be making full use of the car

park. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



in  Redhill there are many people who are still  having

difficulties  in  their livelihood and  they  have  not

reached a decent standard in their livelihood. I  think

it  is  better to promote and raise the living standard

of   the   people   in   my  constituency   and   other

constituencies  than  spend more  money  on  the  areas

already  developed. What we want is something  to  meet

the urgent needs and not to add more to what is already

there. In other words, what we want is to have coal  in

winter  rather  than add more flowers to  a  bloom.  In

Redhill  and  other places we need further development.

If sums are allocated for such development and when the

living   standard  of  the  residents  in  the  various

constituencies can be raised by the vote, then  I  will

be  glad  to  see the Minister allocate  more  sums  to

beautify parks and the scenery at certain places, or to

place certain singing birds in certain areas, including

the  rural areas. I have no objection then. But,  first

of  all,  we must try to raise the living standard  and

provide  basic living amenities to these people  before

we  vote  for  something to be spent on  areas  already

developed.  I can say that this kind of action  is  not

100  per cent socialist. The building of a car park and

the  planting of flowers in a public park -  I  do  not

understand whether all this has anything to do with our

socialist principles. What we should be concerned  with

is  how  to  raise the living standard of the  poor  to

match  that of the rich. We should not allow  the  poor

people  to  be  poorer and the rich to  become  richer.

There  is  a strong contrast between the poor  and  the

rich. If we enhance this difference, then I will not be

happy to see it. There are millions of birds perched on

trees  singing all day long, but they would not  please

me.   I   think  this  sort  of  ideology   should   be

reconsidered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendment of the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  to  reduce the vote by $10 and I agree  with  his

sentiments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I quite understand the anxiety of certain

Members  of  this House. Being members of  a  socialist

party, they are a bit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



worried  that there has been money spent on  what  they

consider to be the richer sector of the community.  But

I  would like to ask them to consider whether it is  in

the  interest of the country as a whole if  we  are  to

stop   developing  the  other  sectors  and   keep   on

concentrating  on bringing the poorer  sectors  up  and

letting the other sectors just -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> The need is greater.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Quite agreed. The need is greater.

But  do  we ignore entirely the other sectors  and  let

them run derelict? Is that our idea of development?  If

these Members look at the Budget, they will notice that

quite a large proportion of our expenditure is spent on

social  services and on the infrastructure of  economic

development  -  all with the purpose of  uplifting  the

standard  of living of our people. It is also our  duty

to  see  that the other sectors are not left  derelict,

that  their  standard  of  living,  their  standard  of

cleanliness and their standard of aesthetic beauty  are

not  brought  down  to those of the poorer  sectors.  I

think  that  must be kept in mind before they  make  up

their   minds   about  voting  on  this   supplementary

estimate.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, before you address and in

order  to  avoid the necessity of your speaking  again,

may  I  inquire if there is any other Member who wishes

to make a contribution to this debate?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to make

clear  one matter which seems to be disturbing  several

Members  of  this  House, and this is the  question  of

fountains and I will come to the point. There  are  two

fountains  in my district of Tanglin. One is at  Farrer

Road -half that fountain is in my constituency and  the

other  half is in Ulu Pandan. There is another fountain

at  Tanglin Circus, half of which is in my constituency

and  the other half in River Valley. Putting two halves

together, I have got one fountain. Now, I would like to

assure  all Members of this House that when  the  sites

for those fountains were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



chosen,   I   was   not  the  Minister   for   National

Development. I propose to give you the history of these

fountains.   The  question  of  fountains  at   traffic

circuses  was first raised by the Prime Minister  in  a

memorandum  dated  the 7th of November,  1963,  to  the

Minister for National Development. At that moment,  Mr

Speaker, I was happily seated in your Chair. The Public

Works  Department was then requested to draw up a  list

of  likely sites where fountains could be put  up.  The

following  sites were submitted: Orchard  Road  Circus,

Raffles  Place, King George V Park, Guillemard  Circus,

the  roundabout  at Farrer and Holland  Roads,  Tanglin

Circus, Empress Place and Finlayson Green.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was all in 1963. Sketch plans and estimates of

costs   of   these  fountains  were  approved   by   my

predecessor,    the   then   Minister   for    National

Development, and submitted to the Development  Planning

Committee  for approval on the 2nd of June,  1964.  The

plans  were  to  build  small fountains  costing  about

$35,000  each  at these eight sites. The  Minister  for

Finance  - and I do not mean Mr Lim Kim San; that  was

Dr  Goh Keng Swee - in his capacity as Chairman of the

Development Planning Committee, disapproved of the list

submitted and commented - "Better to have two or  three

lavish  fountains than a large number of scraggy ones."

As  a  result, the Scientific Adviser was requested  to

have  a  discussion with the Deputy Director of  Public

Works, the Chief Planner and the Chief Architect on the

final plans regarding sites and sizes for some prestige

fountains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting held on 16th October, 1964, at the Prime

Minister's  Office,  fresh plans for  bigger  fountains

were considered and it was decided to proceed with  the

three fountains at the three sites just mentioned. That

was  the  16th  of October, 1964. I was  appointed  the

Minister  for Law on the 1st of November, 1964.  I  was

still  then Speaker of this House. I was only appointed

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



Minister for National Development on the 9th of  August

last  year. So in case Members of this House think that

I  only build fountains in my own district, I hope that

the  facts I have just presented will satisfy them that

I  had nothing to do with the planning of the fountains

and,  in  particular,  I had nothing  to  do  with  the

choosing of these sites for the fountains.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me hasten to

assure  the Minister for National Development  that  I,

for   one,  was  not  thinking  that  he  was  building

fountains  for himself. But there is still the  general

principle  of priorities, and on this point  I  am  not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed copies of the Bill distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Betting and Sweepstake Duties Ordinance, as

it stands now, does not provide discretionary powers to

exempt  any  sweepstake from duty. This was appropriate

when  all  sweepstakes were organised  for  the  direct

benefit  of racing clubs or associations. But  where  a

sweepstake is organised for the purpose of raising much

needed  money for approved public welfare  projects  of

one  kind  or another, the old provisions are  obsolete

and  it  becomes  necessary  to  provide  discretionary

powers  to enable sweepstakes to be exempted from  duty

so  that  the proceeds may be applied directly  to  the

approved objects of the Sweep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Mr Speaker, Sir, I may say that owing

to  the  increasing demand for funds to finance welfare

and  other  charitable organisations in the State,  the

possibilities of a Public Welfare Lottery were explored

as  long  ago  as November 1965. The growing  needs  of

voluntary welfare bodies in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



were  stressed  by  the  Singapore  Council  of  Social

Service  in a letter to the Minister for Social Affairs

dated  April 6, 1966, which expressed support  for  any

move  to set up a Public Welfare Lottery. Subsequently,

it  was agreed that the Singapore Turf Club may  run  a

Singapore  Sweep  in place of one of the  Club's  usual

unlimited sweeps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements are under consideration to ensure that

all funds will be utilised for public projects, such as

a  national  stadium or for welfare purposes,  and  the

exemption now provided by way of clause 2 of this  Bill

will  enable  this to be done. But powers are  provided

for  the  Minister not only to exercise discretion  but

also to impose such conditions as may be deemed fit  to

ensure  that exemptions are applied in respect  of  the

proper purposes only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of constitutional changes, the opportunity is

also  taken in clause 3 (a) to delete the reference  to

"the  Colony"  in  section  3  of  the  Ordinance   and

substitute it by the word "Singapore", whilst clause  3

(b)  provides  for the transfer of the power  to  grant

extensions of time for the payment of duty - an act  of

an  administrative  nature -  to  the  Commissioner  of

Stamps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 4 of the Bill makes unpaid duty a debt

due  to the Government of the Republic of Singapore  in

conformity  with the other duties collected  under  the

provisions of other revenue laws in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

astonished  to  know  that  the  Minister  for  Finance

intends  to  introduce this Bill on  a  Certificate  of

Urgency.  It is as if Singapore is facing an  immediate

invasion  that  such  a Bill must  be  passed  in  this

Parliament with such an urgency. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  believe  that any government in  the  world  which

professes  and  believes  in  socialism  will   promote

gambling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  This is not a Bill to promote gambling. It  is  a

Bill to give me power to exempt duty on sweepstakes run

by the Club with a certain objective.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree it is not a

Bill



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, the Minister's point was that you

should  confine  yourself to the narrow  ambit  of  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Even if it is not a Bill but an

amendment   to   the  Betting  and  Sweepstake   Duties

Ordinance, I think it still runs counter to the  belief

that the P.A.P. professes and believes in socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fail to see the need for the

Government  to introduce this Bill on a Certificate  of

Urgency. This method of a Government-sponsored lottery,

even though it is for a praiseworthy cause, is a rather

controversial topic. I am not speaking here only as the

Secretary-General  of the N.T.U.C.,  but  also  as  the

Member for Bras Basah Constituency. You may be aware of

the  view  of the N.T.U.C. in relation to any  form  of

gambling,  that it does not, in principle, support  the

idea  of  the  Government  of  Singapore  sponsoring  a

lottery.  As  you  may also be aware, I  have  recently

conducted  a  series  of house-to-house  visits  in  my

constituency. In the course of such visits, I have been

given  to  understand  by a substantial  number  of  my

constituents  that  they are not very  happy  over  the

question of Government sponsoring a lottery. What  will

happen  is this. On the day of the drawing of this  so-called welfare lottery, you will -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order, Sir. This is not

a welfare lottery. This is a Singapore Sweep.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Never mind. It is the raising of

funds by means of a lottery. We are all aware that only

the  poor  people will contribute towards buying  these

lottery  tickets,  and you will  find  that  20,000  to

30,000  housewives will buy lottery  tickets  and  they

will  curtail their expenditure on marketing and  food.

What happens is this, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir. When the husband comes home, he will find

that  variety in the food on the table is missing,  and

the  so-called  Sweep ticket, instead of assisting  the

poor,  I  am afraid is going to bring about unhappiness

in all the families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will agree that if you take

money from the rich and give it to the poor, that is  a

credit. But here, we are taking money from the poor and

giving  it  to the poor. I do not see any  credit.  But

some  of  you  may  take the cynical  view  that  I  am

criticising for the sake of opposing. This is  not  so.

Because  it is the man who has interests in  the  Party

will  only  criticise. A number of my constituents  who

are unhappy and who object to the Government sponsoring

a  lottery  may  be misunderstood that  they  are  only

voicing their apprehension in order to defend their own

illegal livelihood. But before any of you come  to  the

wrong conclusion that such persons are objecting to the

idea  of  the Government sponsoring a lottery  with  an

ulterior motive, I wish to impress upon you that  these

persons  are  responsible and respectable citizens  who

are  engaged  in making an honest living and  are  also

members of civic organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for these reasons that I am of the firm opinion

that  this Bill relating to the proposed Social Welfare

Lottery,  or whatever name it may be called, should  be

exposed  to  a  thorough public debate, but  not  on  a

Certificate of Urgency as if we are facing an immediate

invasion  from  our neighbours. And one  way  to  gauge

public feeling on this matter of the Government sponsor

ing  a lottery is to let the Bill be dealt with by this

House in the normal manner. By introducing such a  Bill

on  a  Certificate  of Urgency, the Government  is,  in

effect,   preventing  Members  in   this   House   from

discharging  their  obligations  to  their   respective

constituencies. It is impossible for them to  ascertain

the  feelings of their constituents towards the  Social

Welfare Lottery Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir ----



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

This is not a Social Welfare Lottery Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is purely a question of force

of habit on the part of Mr Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> That is why I say it does not matter

under  what name it is called! It is raising  money.  A

rose by any name smells just as sweet. I am sure it  is

not  the  intention of the Government of  Singapore  to

rush  the proposed Bill through this House in order  to

forestall the marshalling of public opinion against its

passage.  I  say  this  with  confidence  because   the

Government  subscribes to the practice and doctrine  of

socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the essence of democratic socialism

is  that there should be, as far as possible, an  equal

distribution  of wealth, and one way of achieving  such

an  equal  distribution is by minimising  the  possible

range  of  income. In this society where  a  person  is

allowed  to  enjoy an unearned income, that is,  income

from a lottery which is not given to him because of his

work or occupation but because of the windfall from the

lottery  there  is  a basic contradiction  between  the

concept  of  sponsoring a lottery to  raise  funds  for

social  objectives  and the concept  of  promoting  any

measure that would enable a person to enjoy an unearned

income.  In Singapore as it is, we have quite a  number

of  lotteries  and games of chance where  a  person  is

given  the means to obtain such an unearned income.  We

have,  for  example,  horse racing,  the  illegal  four

digits,  the  Chap  Ji Kee. And I know  that  the  only

argument that the Minister for Finance can put is, "Oh,

because  we  cannot stamp this out, we  cannot  control

this  illegal gambling, so we must make it legal." That

would be the answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> He is putting words in my mouth!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> He will say it is because

Singaporeans  go to Johore to buy lottery  tickets.  Is

that  a  valid argument? Are you going to tell me  that

because  we  cannot  eradicate  gangsters  so  we  must

legislate and give them a licence so that they  can  go

openly to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



members  of the public and extort money from  them?  Is

this going to be the reply to my criticism?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Are you going to buy tickets yourself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Oh no, no. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Government  wishes to legislate on the proposed  Social

Welfare Lottery, it would appear that its objection  to

the   running   of  an  illegal  lottery   by   private

individuals  or  syndicates is based  not  so  much  on

principle as on the fact that it is deprived of certain

revenues,  in which case it is inconsistent for  it  to

treat  those  persons  who  are  convicted  of  running

illegal  lotteries  and games of chance  as  criminals,

because  their offence is not the crime  of  running  a

lottery  or  games  of chance but the withholding  from

Government   of  certain  revenues  which   they   have

collected  as  profit.  If  the  Government  deems   it

necessary to issue a Certificate of Urgency in  respect

of  the  Bill  on the proposed Social Welfare  Lottery,

then  it  should make it a matter of urgency to  remove

the  offence of running illegal lotteries or  games  of

chance  from  the  Criminal Ordinance  or  the  Revenue

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the more I think of this, the more I

come  to the conclusion that the Government has  issued

this  Certificate of Urgency because it  realises  that

the proposed Social Welfare Lottery will be a financial

success. But I will say this - and I will prove  it  to

the Minister for Finance - that there will be 20,000 to

30,000  unhappy families on the day of the  drawing.  I

have  been  given to understand that the million-dollar

sweepstake lottery organised by the Singapore Turf Club

has  met with a response exceeding the expectations  of

the organisers. I am quite sure that the Government has

issued this Certificate of Urgency in order to cash  in

on the bonanza. While it is praiseworthy for it to find

all means of obtaining more revenue, I think there is a

limit to which a responsible government, especially one

which subscribes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



to  the  principle of socialism, can afford to  promote

gambling  in order to bring in more revenue. I  am  not

objecting  to  this  proposed  Bill  for  the  sake  of

objecting,  but  a  lottery,  while  giving   rise   to

expectations of a sudden windfall, may in the end leave

the  poor poorer and the rich richer, because a lottery

is  a game of chance, and the more tickets you buy  the

greater  are  the chances of winning the  jackpot.  The

poor may strain their meagre resources, like the public

daily-rated employees to whom the Minister for  Finance

has  refused to give even one cent. They may be tempted

to buy and you make them poorer. So the poor may strain

their  meagre  resources  to buy  for  themselves  such

chances  as  are possible of winning the  jackpot,  but

they will not be able to compete with the rich who  are

in  a position to buy many more chances of winning  the

jackpot  and  who, furthermore, are in  a  position  to

afford  it. Because of all the considerations  which  I

have  mentioned,  I strongly oppose the  discussion  of

this Bill by this House on a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to express my views on this Bill. Just now I

have  listened to the Member for Bras Basah's views  on

it. He says that a lottery is contrary to the principle

of  democratic socialism, and that the introduction  of

this  Bill  will  cause a lot of  unhappiness  to  many

families.  But  I  am  of the view  that  it  will  not

necessarily  bring  about  this  unhappiness.  If   the

Member's  reasoning  could  hold  water,  then  I  will

enumerate  two facts to counter his arguments.  Do  you

remember  that  nine years ago when  Singapore  was  in

Malaya  there was the Social Welfare Lottery? Even  now

there is the running of a Social Welfare Lottery.  Many

people  even go to Johore Bahru to buy lottery tickets.

These  people go over there to buy tickets  because  of

economic  reasons. Some buy only two or three  tickets.

This   will  not  be  seriously  detrimental  to  their

economic situation. If they are lucky enough, they  may

get  some prizes which may help increase their  income.

It may help them economically.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we know that for several years

Singapore  has  horse-racing. If the  Member  for  Bras

Basah argues that horse-racing causes many families  to

be  unhappy, then, according to his calculations, there

will be many hundreds and thousands of families who are

very  unhappy. But, on the other hand, we see Singapore

developing  all  the time. According to  a  World  Bank

Report,  the  standard of living of  Singapore  is  the

third highest in the whole of Asia. Whether or not  the

issue  of lottery tickets is contrary to the tenets  of

democratic  socialism, I will say  this  that  in  many

socialist  countries  there is  also  the  practice  of

running lotteries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard the Minister say just now that the

proceeds  from this lottery will be devoted  to  social

welfare  and charitable organisations. It is  meant  to

benefit  the  public  as a whole. A  dollar  from  each

person  will  accumulate into a large sum,  which  will

help  our development and assist in the work of  social

welfare.  It is because of this that I am  not  of  the

view that running a lottery will be detrimental to  the

nation,  or to the economy or livelihood of the people.

On  the  contrary,  it will contribute  to  the  social

welfare work of our country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to express my views on this Bill.  I  agree

very  much with the sentiments expressed by the  Member

for  Bras Basah. At the same time, I beg to differ from

what  the Member for Sembawang has said, and make  some

criticisms of his speech. Our Government is a socialist

government. We understand what is the final  aim  of  a

socialist government; that is, to give to each his  due

and  to  extract from each his ability. If you get  one

dollar from each man so that in the end the money comes

to  fifty  or  five million dollars, then  it  will  be

contrary to the policy of our socialist Government.  It

will  be  to misunderstand our principles. So  I  agree

with the Member for Bras Basah that this Bill should be

debated by the public before it can he introduced  into

this House,

disagreement  with  certain  statements  of  a  certain

Member  here.  The  Minister  has  given  reasons   and

explanations  which  are not entirely  satisfactory  or

sufficient.  Recently  we  have  heard  some  Ministers

saying  that  wages  should be in accordance  with  the

productivity  of the person concerned. In other  words,

it  should  be measured according to a person's  effort

and  performance, and this seems to be contrary to  the

principle  of  this  Bill. If the Government  does  not

clarify the situation further, then the public will  be

led to think that the Ministers are inconsistent, and I

feel this is regrettable. So I hope some Ministers  can

give  explanations to enlighten us all. In view of  the

Finance Minister's inadequate explanation, and also  in

view  of Members' arguments just now, there has been  a

certain  psychological reaction to this  Bill.  I  feel

that  the idea of getting some benefit out of a lottery

is  the normal thinking of any ordinary person.  If  we

can   be  more  practical  in  the  analysis  of  human

psychology,  then we can understand that the  urge  and

desire to get a windfall through buying lottery tickets

is  a  kind  of  economic as well  as  a  psychological

manifestation.  A windfall can be got  through  various

illegal  or  criminal  methods,  such  as  robbery   or

stealing  or smuggling. Through such methods,  one  can

overnight  get some unjust windfall. That is practical.

It  is  more  easily put into practice than  running  a

lottery.  But if you say that it is fair  and  just  on

socialist  grounds that a person can get a windfall  by

striking a lottery, then I do not quite understand  the

meaning  of  "windfall" because from the standpoint  of

socialism,    we   feel   that   there   are    certain

contradictions  and discrepancies there.  We  see  that

nowadays  it  is  difficult to voice  our  thoughts  on

socialism, namely, from each according to his  ability,

and  to  each  according to his need. In the  situation

here  in  Singapore,  most of our people  have  regular

employment. The Member for Bras Basah has said that the

housewives have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



look  after their households, and the breadwinners  are

the  husbands or some other members of the  family.  If

these  breadwinners have no means of sustenance, or  if

they  do  not  depend on their employment but  on  some

windfall  to  look  after their families,  then  it  is

unwise  to  spend  too much money on lotteries  and  we

should  adopt measures appropriate to deal  with  these

cases.  But  if people who are regularly employed  look

for  an  opportunity  to  get a windfall  through  some

unjust or shameful or illegal or criminal methods, then

I say this is contrary to the normal means of earning a

living.  Also  it  cannot be  100  per  cent  sound  or

reasonable  to  support the running of sweepstakes.  We

must  urge  that  our  socialist  policies  should   be

implemented.  Singapore cannot be isolated  from  other

countries.  We cannot build a wall around  it  so  that

other  countries cannot get our people's money to spend

on  their lotteries. But, on the other hand, if we  can

run  our  own  lottery, of course, it will prevent  our

people's   money   from  being   drained   into   other

territories.  The Member for Bras Basah has  said  that

the  rich  get  the money from the poor by  striking  a

lottery,  and  then they spend it on  the  poor  again.

That, I think, is difficult to understand. Is it really

justifiable  to get money from the poor  and  spend  it

back  on the poor? I do not quite see his argument.  We

are used to hearing very often the name of the N.T.U.C.

in  his  talks. I do not understand what is his purpose

in saying this. Is he trying to enhance his prestige by

calling on the name of the N.T.U.C.? Whether it  is  of

any  use  in  doing this in this House I do  not  quite

know. It will have to depend on the Speaker to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is intended that some poor people in Singapore

can overnight become millionaires -- but the chances of

this  happening are very remote, only one  out  of  one

million,  and this is perhaps also not in keeping  with

socialist  principles  - we can  perhaps  increase  the

number  of  prizes by reducing the amount of the  first

prize to, say, $100,000. Perhaps this will provide more

opportunities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



for more people to get rich, and therefore it may be  a

bit fairer. But in the past, from the point of law,  if

people ran illegal lotteries and they were caught, they

would  have to suffer the consequences. From the  point

of  law,  in the past, there was no practice to  regard

the  winning  of  a lottery as a criminal  act  if  the

practice  was  allowable under the law.  So  we  cannot

credit  or  discredit the issue of lottery tickets.  In

principle, we may support this Bill, hut what  we  hope

is   that   in  practice  there  should  be   necessary

arrangements  to  ensure that  the  lottery  system  in

Singapore   will   not   have  any   undesirable   evil

consequences or any disadvantages which will make  many

people  change their correct concept of  life  or  lead

them  to believe that we are indulging in gambling.  So

this  is  what the Government should pay attention  to.

This  is  what I hope the Government can do. Finally  I

would  like  the Minister concerned to clarify  what  I

have asked him to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand

not  to  support this Bill because we know that betting

and  sweepstakes  is a social evil, no  matter  whether

such   betting  is  done  by  an  organised   club   or

association  or an individual, or whether  it  has  the

blessing  of  Government. For a  democratic  government

dedicated to socialist principles to have the  idea  of

running  a  sweepstake or lottery for the  purposes  of

raising funds is very much deplorable. We have a stable

government and an able Minister for Finance  who  knows

ways  and means of how to squeeze money in the  way  of

taxes  from  the general public. Yet the idea  to  have

some  extra measures of free betting and sweepstake  to

find  more money will mean that he is trying  to  sneak

through  the  backdoor and induce  poor  housewives  to

spend more money, and lately day-dreamers to find extra

money  from  their  already  over-burdened  budget  and

eventually  making  them  poor.  We  believe   in   the

socialist principle of making men equal to one  another

economically, but not in making the poor poorer and the

rich  richer. When our neighbouring country was running

the  Social Welfare Lottery, the buying and selling  of

these lottery



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



tickets  was  banned in Singapore on the  grounds  that

this breeds evil. I wonder how, all of a sudden, the so

dedicated  socialist government of Singapore found  fit

to  introduce this free betting and sweepstake to  find

money  for  social  welfare  purposes.  I  hope  we  in

Singapore  are trying to make hard-working, law-abiding

and  good  citizens of our people and not more gamblers

and   bookmakers,  as  I  feel  this   amendment   will

eventually bring about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bras

Basah  has two basic objections to this Bill: (1)  that

it is being introduced on a Certificate of Urgency; and

(2)  because he says it is a betting Bill. I can assure

the  House  that  the  Government is  well  aware  that

because  there  is no Opposition in  the  House  -  the

Barisan Sosialis having resigned or attempted to resign

from  their  seats  and having been derelict  in  their

duties - we must be very careful not to introduce Bills

if  we can on Certificates of Urgency. For instance, if

we  were to introduce the Land Acquisition Bill or  any

Bill  on  the Constitution on a Certificate of Urgency,

that  would be most reprehensible. But we have not done

that. When important Bills come up, because there is no

Opposition, we send them to Select Committee,  so  that

members  of  the  public will have  an  opportunity  to

present their views and the Committee an opportunity to

consider  them. This is what has happened to  the  Land

Acquisition Bill which will be read a Third time today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Betting and Sweepstake Duties (Amendment)

Bill  is  not a Bill to introduce betting in Singapore.

If we have no horse-racing and no sweepstakes, and this

is  a Bill to introduce gambling for the first time  in

Singapore,  then we will never do it this way.  But  if

the  Members who object to this Bill read it carefully,

they  will note that it is a Bill to give the  Minister

powers  to  exempt any sweepstake promoted,  organised,

administered  or  operated  by  any  racing   club   or

association from all or any of the provisions  of  this

Ordinance.  It  does  not give him  power  to  start  a

sweepstake. We have those powers and we have  had  them

for many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



a  year.  All  this Bill does is to give him  power  to

exempt "The Singapore Sweepstake" - if you like to call

it that - from paying 30 per cent tax that should go to

the  Singapore  Government. And I  cannot  see  why  we

cannot  bring  it in on a Certificate of  Urgency.  The

tickets are, at the moment, being sold in Singapore and

the  first  draw will be held in early December.  Hence

the urgency for this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the People's Action Party came to power in 1959,

it  was  a  puritanical Party. It appears to me,  after

hearing  some of our Members today, that we  are  still

semi-puritanical. There was a day when rock-n-roll  was

banned  in Singapore. I myself like rock-n-roll  and  I

saw no objections to rock-n-roll. Today, our youngsters

like  to  do  the Twist. I do it once in a  while,  but

perhaps I am getting too old for it. But I think  there

is  a new thinking now. We have to cater for our youths

and every year there are 90,000 to 100,000 more voters,

and we have to cater for their taste. And if our youths

like to do the Twist, I say good luck to them. The days

of  the  pigtailed school-girls are over,  and  if  the

Barisan Sosialis depend on them, I think they have  not

got  a hope. I only hope that members of our Party will

also move with the times.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel very

uplifted  listening  to the Back-benchers  and  realise

that  they still have a lot of idealism left  in  them.

But  I  would like to congratulate the Member for Bukit

Merah who has idealism tinged with realism. And I would

like  to  inform my friend, the Member for Bras  Basah,

who happens to be missing here, that in my trip through

Bulgaria recently -it is a very socialist country  -  I

found that they run sweepstakes every week. That  is  a

very  strong  socialist country, but they  have  learnt

that  idealism must he tinged with realism. And I  hear

from  my  colleague, the Minister for Foreign  Affairs,

that  in  his trip to Russia and several other  Central

European  socialist countries, they too run  their  own

lotteries. I agree that we should not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



encourage betting or gambling if Members who object  to

it  can assure me that even without allowing betting or

gambling  under control in Singapore, our people  would

not  gamble  at  all  and that  the  20,000  or  30,000

housewives  would  not  feel sorry  or  would  not  buy

tickets from across the Causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reply to the Member's criticism that we are afraid

to  have  a  public  debate on the  pros  and  cons  of

allowing  lotteries to be run in Singapore, I think  my

colleague has answered in some measure the reasons  why

the amendment Bill to the Betting and Sweepstake Duties

Ordinance is introduced on a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I resent very much the accusation of the Member for

Farrer  Park who feels that we are introducing gambling

through  the  backdoor by bringing about  an  amendment

Bill to the Betting and Sweepstake Duties Ordinance. If

it  was  my  intention to introduce, allow or encourage

gambling  through the back-door, I would not have  made

any  amendment to the Ordinance at all, because I would

be  able to get money simply by telling the Turf  Club,

"All  right,  you run it, pay the tax and give  us  the

profits." That would be an easier way of doing it than

by  coming here and seeking approval for this amendment

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, if I can be assured that if we do not allow

the  Turf Club to run this sweep and the population  at

large  would not spend their money on gambling, then  I

would  agree  that we stop gambling here entirely.  But

human  nature  is  such that even if we  do  not  allow

gambling,  a  large amount of money will  be  spent  on

gambling  -  and illegal gambling at that - which  will

encourage gangsterism, protection rackets and all sorts

of crimes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> What are the police doing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I see that our friend is back here!

The  police have not only to look out for gambling  but

they have also other jobs to do. But can the Member for

Bras Basah tell



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



me that it is possible to eradicate gambling? If he can

say  that, then we will give it a try. I think  it  has

been  found that it is not possible at all to eradicate

gambling.  So  if  we allow it to go underground,  more

evil  consequences will follow than if we allow  it  in

the open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand the argument of the Member for

Bras  Basah  and  also the argument of the  Member  for

Farrer Park that the poor will get poorer and the  rich

will get richer because of the sale of lottery tickets.

Do  they  mean  to  say  that in every  instance  where

lottery  tickets  are sold, it is  only  the  rich  who

strike  a  prize?  I think the Member  for  Bras  Basah

contradicts  himself when he says that the chances  for

the  poor  are  less for the simple  reason  that  they

cannot  afford  to  buy more lottery tickets  than  the

rich.  If that is so, then more of the money will  come

from the rich than from the poor!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> On what I said that the rich will become

richer  and  the  poor will become poorer  -  it  is  a

possibility. A rich man buys about 1,000 tickets  in  a

sweepstake, whereas a poor man buys ten tickets. So the

chances  of a rich man winning a lottery are a  hundred

times more than those of a poor man. Therefore, it is a

possibility  that a rich man will become richer  and  a

poor man will become poorer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Then good luck to him!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> That is exactly what I said. The

Member for Bras Basah contradicts himself. He said that

all the money will come from the poor. If that argument

is  right,  then most of the money will come  from  the

rich! [Interruption] And he says, "Well, look, it is so

successful, from what we hear, the sale of  tickets  is

more than what was expected by the Turf Club," it means

that  there is a need for this here, that the  majority

of  the  public are not of the same opinion  as  he.  I

think it is important for me to say that no one is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



under compulsion to buy these tickets. Therefore, if we

want  to eradicate gambling, it is not by shutting  our

eyes to it or wearing blinkers in order not to see that

the  evil  exists, but through education.  That  is  my

reply  to  the  Member for Bukit Merah. It  is  through

education  in  the long run that we  will  be  able  to

change  the  nature of our population. But until  then,

let  us tinge our idealism with a little bit of realism

and  see that whatever money is spent by the people  in

gambling does not leave this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to explain briefly the

necessity  of  this  Bill. The  Malaya  British  Borneo

Currency Agreement, 1960, signed by the Governments  of

Singapore, Malaya and Brunei, established the Board  of

Commissioners  of Currency, Malaya and British  Borneo,

as   the  sole  currency  issuing  authority  in  their

respective countries. Under the terms of this  Currency

Agreement,  any  of the Participating  Governments  can

replace   the  Board  as  the  sole  currency   issuing

authority  by lodging a notice of its intention  to  do

so,  18  months prior to the date it wishes to commence

its  currency  issue. Such a notice of replacement  was

lodged  by the Government of Malaysia on 12th December,

1964. This notice, therefore, became effective on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



12th  June,  1966,  that is, 18  months  after  it  was

lodged,  and  the  Currency Board is  then  obliged  to

relinquish  its right to issue currency  in  Singapore,

Malaysia  and  Brunei. There is, however, provision  in

the  Agreement  for  the Board  to  continue  to  issue

currency  for a further period of six months after  the

notice becomes effective, if it is requested to  do  so

by  the  Participating Governments. Such a request  was

accordingly made and the Board was therefore  empowered

to  issue  currency  in the territories  of  the  three

Governments concerned up to 12th December, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participating Governments had also agreed that the

life  span of the Board should be extended by a further

six  months,  that is, up to 12th June,  1967.  As  the

Currency  Agreement does not provide for  such  further

extension, it is necessary to amend this Agreement. The

purpose of the Bill is, therefore, to give legal effect

to  this  amendment so that the Board can  continue  to

issue currency up to 12th June, 1967.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that this Bill was

referred  to  the Select Committee on  22nd  June  this

year.  Members will also recall that during the  Second

Reading,  I  expressed the hope that  when  the  Select

Committee  calls  for  representations,  persons   with

positive   contributions   will   come   forward   with

suggestions.  I  am, indeed, happy to report  that  the

response  to invitations for representation  was  good.

Eleven  written representations were received  and  the

Select Committee heard oral evidence from six of  them.

Some of these contributions were valuable and many  sug

gestions have been accepted. The Committee's Report was

published on 10th September, 1966, as Paper Parl. 9  of

1966.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill as now tabled before the

House  incorporates the recommendations of  the  Select

Committee.  I do not propose to burden the  Members  of

this House with unnecessary explanations, but there are

two  fundamental  provisions on which there  have  been

representations  which were unacceptable  and  which  I

wish to take this opportunity to reiterate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these is the compensation provision in

the  Bill. As has already been explained in this  House

previously, the principle underlining this provision is

that  no  landowner  should  benefit  at  the  public's

expense,   from  any  windfall  gains  resulting   from

enhancement of land values either through Acts  of  God

or  because of public expenditure in the neighbourhood.

Members  are aware of the phenomenal increases in  land

values  which result when heavily encumbered lands  are

devastated by fire. This fortuitous increase  in  value

will not now go to the landowner. Again, development by

Government and public authorities in areas like Jurong,

Kallang  Basin  and Kranji has resulted  in  phenomenal

increases  in  land values in these neighbourhoods.  It

was  ironical that under the existing legislation, when

additional lands in these areas had to be acquired  for

public purposes, Government had to pay compensation  at

values  which Government itself had helped to  enhance.

The  element of enhancement attributable in these cases

to public participation (as opposed to participation by

the private sector), is the element which under the new

Bill  will  be  creamed off when land is  acquired  for

public purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make today involves the

concept  of  the  Appeals Board. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  a

number  of representations were received by the  Select

Committee  in  which the same point was made.  And  the

point  was this: all appeals should be heard by a Court

of Law presided by a Judge of the High Court instead of

the  Appeals Board, as proposed. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

move  to  take appeals away from the Courts  and  place

them in the hands of an Appeals Board or tribunal is in

conformity with prevailing trends else.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



where  in the world of entrusting matters of specialist

evaluation  to  Administrative Tribunals where  persons

with  the  requisite  expertise can  deal  with  issues

involving  subjects  with  which  they  are  themselves

familiar. Furthermore, procedures before such tribunals

are  less formal, less expensive, more expeditious and,

perhaps, more satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of the Appeals Board envisaged in the

Bill  is  similar to the set-up in the United  Kingdom,

but   we  have  not  laid  down  statutory  limitations

prescribing     minimum    legal    or     professional

qualifications in order not to restrict  the  field  of

selection.   It   is  envisaged,  however,   that   the

Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, both of  whom

will  have  the  status of High Court Judges,  will  be

persons  who  are  either  legally  qualified  or  have

considerable  experience  in  land  administration  and

other  matters. The panel of assessors will be  persons

with  objective minds who will be able  to  assist  the

Commissioner  in  assessing  fair  compensation   after

listening to expert evidence on values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly,

I  would  like  to  associate  myself  with  the  views

expressed by the Minister. Sir, as I see it, this is  a

piece of legislation which definitely favours the  poor

man.  This is what we the P.A.P. Government stands  for

- for   the  poor  man.  Let  me  take  an  example   to

substantiate  my argument. A few years  ago  when  hell

broke  loose in the Bukit Ho Swee area where  thousands

of  people were rendered homeless by fire, what did the

P.A.P.  Government  do then? Did  the  Government  just

merely  say, "Well, we will try to rehouse  them."  No,

far from it, not just trying in that direction. But the

Government  took  immediate steps to provide  immediate

relief  to  the homeless. Then the Bukit Ho  Swee  fire

site was acquired and plans to put up decent flats with

the necessary social amenities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



were drawn up and at once implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if there had not been any fire and had not the

Government  acquired this site, today we will  not  see

the  beautiful symmetry of a clean and healthy location

where numerous blocks of flats for the poor exist. I am

sure  this House will agree whole-heartedly with me  on

this  matter. The Government, on the one hand, acquires

land  for community use and those who think they  would

suffer  as a result should retune their minds and  look

at  acquisition  as a means of allowing  Government  to

continue  to  provide the poor with  decent  homes  and

better  social  amenities.  On  the  other  hand,   the

Government,  with the people's needs uppermost  in  its

mind,  would  continue to fulfil its obligations,  come

whatever the obstacles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that those affected are asking for more

compensation  than what is arrived at by  our  valuers.

They  should have been happy with what they are to get.

In  fact,  I  would say that the land value  should  be

reduced to as low a rate as possible in order to  allow

the  Government to continue to provide such  amenities.

May  I,  Sir, stress that we do not wish to favour  the

land   speculators  who  jump  at  opportunities   when

Government projects or public projects are carried  out

in adjacent lands, thereby helping to boost up the land

value! We come from the masses and our obligation is to

them and them alone. If we allow these speculators free

rein, then chaos and financial difficulties would over-run  us all and the Government would then have to  dish

out enormous sums of money to pay for fantastic sums of

compensation   to  those  involved.   I   think   those

landowners who are rich must be practical. They  should

be  the  first  to come forward and assist  in  nation-building  and make some sacrifices, for, as the  saying

goes,  Sir, "It is in the giving that we receive."  Let

me  ask  them a question. What would happen to them  if

the   country  goes  down?  Where  would  their  landed

properties  be  then? If they would  care  to  look  at

certain  countries not far from us, they would  see  my

point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our main objective is to help establish a more

equal and just society, therefore, our declared aim  is

to  acquire  lands  from time to  time  which  will  be

developed  or  utilised for public purposes,  say,  for

example, to build more schools, clinics, more blocks of

housing   flats,  more  community  centres,  veterinary

extension centres and many others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would urge those likely to be affected

to  think well of others so that the declared  aims  of

the   Government  can  be  achieved  with   as   little

inconvenience as possible.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  this Bill. It is, on the whole, good  for  the

lower strata of society. It is appropriate and in  line

with  our  new  status and new name,  the  Republic  of

Singapore, and consonant with the concept of democratic

socialism  which is strongly opposed by  the  Alliance,

the Barisan Sosialis and other Parties whose aim is  to

perpetuate  bourgeois rule. Why I say so, Mr  Speaker,

is  that lands which are acquired by Government will be

fully  developed  for the purpose of  public  projects;

clinics,  dispensaries, hospitals, schools, cheap  -  I

emphasise   cheap  - flats,  not  high   rental   flats,

community  centres and other projects  which  would  be

enjoyed by the lower class society, not parks like  the

MacRitchie  Reservoir  Park on which  we  have  debated

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is not confiscating properties owned by

landowners,  Mr Speaker, Sir. Before  such  lands  are

acquired  by  Government, they  will  be  assessed  and

adequate  compensation will be paid, which is  not  the

case  in  Communist  countries.  In  other  words,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  both parties benefit. As has  happened,

when a fire breaks out, it is the responsibility of the

government  of the day to rehouse the fire  victims  in

flats  and offer relief. The landowner shakes his  legs

and  when  the land is free of squatters, he  is  in  a

position  to  develop it for his own selfish  interest.

Mr Speaker, Sir, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



appropriate  that this Bill, which will be approved  by

Parliament, will satisfy all parties concerned.



<br><br>7.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

about  this Land Acquisition Bill, we all may have  the

impression that this is one of the important  Bills  to

be passed by this Parliament. I would like to deal with

this Bill in a wider perspective. Inevitably, a country

will have certain laws and rights to the land. This  is

a necessary and an essential feature of the rights of a

country.  And  in the development of a country,  it  is

inevitable that there are certain changes. When certain

countries  change from an agricultural  economy  to  an

industrialised  economy,  it is  necessary  to  acquire

land.  This  is  called land reform. And  at  times  it

happens that this leads to a struggle for power between

the  landowners and the State. In countries  which  are

friendly  with  us, the Eastern European countries  and

Egypt  -  I will just enumerate one example - in  Egypt

there  is  also the problem of landownership and  there

has  been  certain  harm done by the system  there.  So

there  is  a policy on acquisition of land to meet  the

requirement of the country in its development.  To  our

minds, the land is part and parcel of a country and  it

is  the  right of the State to acquire and  manage  its

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our island is a very tiny one and with our limited

land   area,  we  have  to  build  an  ideal   country.

Therefore,  we  must put our land to the best  possible

use  in  order to meet our largest and highest demands.

We  should have proper arrangements and measures in our

island State in order to ensure that every inch of land

can  be  put  to  the best possible  use  in  order  to

maintain  national  development  and  to  promote   the

prosperity of our country, so that we can extract every

benefit out of every inch of land and so that every man

can  be used to the limit of his ability and everything

can be put to the best possible use. We should not have

the  practice  such  as  is  obtaining  in  feudalistic

countries, to divide or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



allot   lands  to  certain  landlords.  But   here   in

Singapore,  we should try to realise our own  paradise.

We  should not allow anybody to waste too large an area

of  land. We do not have too many Christmas Islands  to

be  sold. Therefore, we must make the best possible use

of our land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of Parliament and the general public

regard the passage of this Bill as one of the important

steps  taken  in  the  process of  development  of  our

country.  We  should  concentrate all  our  energy  and

attention  on  the development of our country,  and  in

this   respect,  the  acquisition  of  land   is   very

important.  It  is  a  very essential  feature  in  the

process  of nation-building. We are short of land,  and

there  is a saying that God created the world  and  the

Dutch created land. We should also follow suit to  show

that we can also reclaim land from the sea in order  to

extend  our  land area, which is part  of  our  nation-

building  process.  This is a step  forward  towards  a

better future and the prosperity and development of our

country.  This is an inevitable part of our endeavours.

I  do not view this Bill as a piece of legislation  but

as  a  dynamic  step forward in the right direction  of

nation-building.  I  believe  that  after  the  law  is

amended,  it will already have its own proper  form  to

meet the requirements of the time. Therefore, it is now

tabled in this House for discussion and passage. It has

already  been  considered in Select Committee  and  the

Report  has been published. Advertisements appeared  in

the  Press  on  the  25th and 27th of  June  this  year

inviting representations on the Bill. This is a show of

democracy, and I am very satisfied with the process  of

the Bill. It is also comprehensive in its structure and

takes  into  consideration every aspect of the  problem

arising  out  of  land acquisition. The acquisition  of

land  is  not  always for perpetual possession  by  the

State.  In some cases, land is to be put to use and  is

required for a period of 3 years. Stress is put on  the

use  of land for public requirements and needs. Because

of   this  feature,  the  Bill  has  brought  about   a

socialistic change in land acquisition. In a socialist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



country, it is fit and proper that every inch  of  land

should  be  put to the best possible use to  yield  the

best advantage for the benefit of the people and make a

very  effective contribution to the development of  the

country.  This  is  a  very  essential  feature  of   a

socialistic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another characteristic of this Bill is that landowners

will  not be able to benefit from an increase  in  land

value  by  receiving  a windfall, so  that  nobody  can

speculate in land value. This is also a good feature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like this House to refer to page 18 of the

Bill. There is a provision that compensation should not

always   be  paid  according  to  market  value  before

acquisition,  because there are so many  factors  which

contribute to an increase of land value - some of which

are   illegal.  So  after  careful  consideration   and

deliberate study, the Bill is now in its best  possible

form  and  it will not be detrimental to the people.  I

have  full confidence in it and I believe that when  it

is  put into effect and practice, it will be beneficial

to the people and the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I express my support for the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There has not been a word of criticism. I

have  nothing much to add except to say that I am  glad

that our Back-benchers have realised the importance and

the necessity for this piece of socialist legislation.
