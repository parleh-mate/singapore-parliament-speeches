<div align="center"><b>COMMITTEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Terms of Reference)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Labour and

Welfare what are the terms of reference of the

Tripartite Consultative Committee set up for the three

Services Unions; whether any, and how many, meetings

have been held; and what has been the outcome of such

meetings.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Tripartite

Consultative  Committee,  as  its  name  suggests,  was

merely  to  be  a forum for the exchange  of  views  on

matters  of common interest to the Service Departments,

the Services Unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



and   the   Government,  the  three   parties   therein

represented.   In   particular,   the    subjects    of

transferability  of pension rights and of  ascertaining

whether  public  bodies could find jobs  for  employees

about  to  become redundant in Service  employment.  It

therefore  has  no  specific terms of reference  beyond

these,  and subjects are only brought up for discussion

if agreed by all three parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also agreed that the Committee should not in

any  way  supersede joint consultative machinery  which

already  exists in the various Service Departments,  by

which  conditions  of service and related  matters  are

already  negotiable,  nor  was  it  intended  that  the

Committee  should be a higher tribunal than the  bodies

already  constituted  in  the Service  Departments  for

negotiating  conditions of service, etc.  Nevertheless,

Sir,  through  such  joint  consultations  held  at  15

meetings  up  to  the  end  of  September,  1958,   the

following matters had been resolved satisfactorily:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Recruitment in the Singapore Local Forces

Establishment for clerks, storekeepers, etc, should, as

far  as  possible, be made from the ranks of  redundant

employees who possess the requisite qualifications  and

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Fair opportunity should be given to redundant

civilian  employees  of  the  Service  Departments  who

register   themselves  in  the  Government   Employment

Exchange for whatever jobs are vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Information was supplied by the Labour Department

on  the types and rates of severance pay to enable  the

Services  Unions  to  negotiate their  own  claims  for

severance  pay for redundant civilian employees  to  be

payable by the Service Departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Waiver of hospitalisation deposits had already

been  agreed  in  principle by the Ministry  of  Health

through  discussions  in  the  Tripartite  Consultative

Committee  which has now finalised with  that  Ministry

the   form  of  guarantee  and  the  scheme   will   be

implemented on the 1st of November, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Various avenues of alternative employment for

redundant  employees were explored from  time  to  time

with  very  little result, as there are few  employment

opportunities available.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Information about the basis for transferability of

pension  rights, as adopted in the United  Kingdom,  was

supplied to Services Unions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing  if  he  will  make   a

statement  regarding  the  construction  programme   for

agricultural  roads  in  the  Bukit  Panjang   electoral

division.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for

the  construction and improvement of agricultural  roads

in   the   Bukit  Panjang  electoral  division  of   the

Legislative Assembly, the Rural Board's normal programme

for  1958  would permit the making up of roads totalling

approximately  15 miles in length at  a  total  cost  of

$79,000. To date work has been commenced and is expected

to  be  completed by the end of this year on three roads

totalling  a  distance  of 4 miles approximately,  while

work  on  the  remaining roads, some 12 miles  long,  is

being planned and will be put in hand later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Sir, Government, bearing in mind the

necessity  for  accelerating the  improvement  of  rural

areas, has directed the carrying out simultaneously of a

further  programme of road construction and improvement.

Out  of the provision of $730,000 which was voted in the



Assembly this year, Government will be spending $113,000

on  the  construction of 21 miles of road in  the  Bukit

Panjang  electoral division of the Legislative Assembly.

Up to date two miles of road have already been completed



and 14 miles are under construction and are expected  to

be completed by the end of the year.

<div align="center"><b>STUDY OF CHINESE IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for Education

since  when has Chinese been taught as a second language

in  English  schools; whether he is satisfied  with  the

progress made, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



what steps he has taken or proposes to take to make  the

pupils interested in its study.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Chinese has been

taught  as a second language in some English schools  as

far  back as 1951 and earlier. At the beginning of 1957,

however,  vernacular languages became a compulsory  part

of the curricula in English schools, although it was not

always  possible then to get enough vernacular teachers.

However, Chinese is not affected in this respect and the



Ministry  has an adequate number of Chinese teachers  in

English schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Primary schools good progress is being made,

though naturally some pupils are not very diligent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Chinese teachers in English schools have

been trained and others are undergoing training. This is

tending to make the pupils more interested in the  study

of Chinese. Furthermore, vernacular language marks count

towards  a pupil's position in class and this  gives  an

incentive to study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Secondary schools in Forms II and III good

progress is being made. In Forms IV and V a fair  number

of  pupils  are making good progress but  some  have  no

grounding   in  Chinese  and  found  the  subject   very

difficult when it was made compulsory. In some of  these

cases pupils in this category were therefore allowed  to

drop the study of Chinese.

<div align="center"><b>(Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Health if

he  will  make  a  statement  on  the  progress  of  the

negotiations  between the Ministry  of  Health  and  the

Unions  of  the  Medical and Health  Department  on  the

claims  for  revision  of  salaries  and  conditions  of

service submitted by the Unions since 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> With your permission, Sir, I will

reply  to  this question since the matter is  within  my

portfolio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when Staff Unions of the Medical

Department submitted salary claims in 1956, there were a

number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



claims  in other departments also to be dealt with.  It

was  therefore agreed with the Staff Side of the  Civil

Service  Joint  Council  that all  these  claims  would

receive  consideration in an agreed order of  priority.

In  accordance with this agreement, the medical unions'



claims  came up for examination last year.  A  complete

survey  of  all  the  posts  in  the  various  services

affected was undertaken late last year. Following  this

survey the Government placed before the unions in March

this year the broad outlines of its proposals and since

then   there  have  been  a  number  of  meetings   and

discussions. In the case of certain groups of officers,

only  a  few matters of detail remain unsolved, whereas

in  other  cases it is clear that an agreed  settlement

can only be reached after further discussion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Can the Chief Secretary tell us

when  he  can expect to have all these claims  settled,

because it has been too long a delay since 1956?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I have every hope, Sir, that these claims

will  be  finally settled before the end of this  year,

but I must point Out that in negotiations there are two

sides  to the proceedings and the blame cannot be  laid

entirely at the door of one side.

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Communications and Works)</b></div>



<br><br>10.11 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I have to make a statement on

transport policy, Sir, and I must, with regret,  inform

this  House that I have not been able, after very  full

study, consultation and discussion, to find any way  of

rationalising Singapore's bus system without heavy cost

to  public  funds, involving at least some millions  of

dollars.  The  House  is  also  aware  that  the  funds

available for this sort of purpose are limited  at  any

time,  and  especially  limited  in  the  trading   and

economic  conditions  of 1958.  We  have  not  got  the

necessary cash. The result is that I am not able now to

go forward



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



with  the  Government's policy of  rationalisation  and

unification  as  a basis of later full nationalisation.

The  effect of this will be that we shall have for  the



time being to make the best we can of the existing  bus

system, with all its defects. This will not be easy but

it must be tried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past three and a half years we have in my

Ministry  covered a great deal of the preliminary  work

on  which future action for unification will depend. We

are  now  considering what amendments must be  made  to

match  the  Omnibus  Services  Licensing  Authority  to

changed  circumstances. Probably the  Omnibus  Services

Licensing  Authority, somewhat adapted  in  form,  will

have  to  be  used  as  the main instrument  of  policy

pending   provision   of  the   necessary   money   for

unification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose seeking a new transport adviser to join my

Ministry  for two years under the Colonial  Development

and  Welfare Plan. He will assist us in the  day-to-day

decisions necessary during the interim period prior  to

unification. He will also continue the preliminary work

needed as the basis for unification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will be disappointed that execution  of

our  policy has to be deferred. I am sorry about  that.

They  will, however, remember, I hope, that it is  only



deferred. The essential obstacle is lack of money. When

money  can  be  found,  I  do  not  foresee  any  other

insoluble difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to keep this statement as short as

possible,  Mr  Speaker, so that hon. Members  can  fix

their  minds  on  the main problem of  finance  without

being confused by a mass of detail or by a long history

of  all the different work done and action taken during

the  past  three  and a half years. Hon.  Members  may,

however, want clarification or more details on  certain

points. If they will say what clarification they  want,

I  will  do  my  best,  with your permission,  Sir,  to

satisfy them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

arising  out  of  this,  is this  not  a  case  of  the

for  the  levy  of additional duty on certain  types  of

imported cigarettes and pipe tobacco by relating  it  to

their value and not to their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



weight. It is therefore necessary to provide in clause 2

for  a definition of "value" in section 3 of the Customs

Ordinance. A consequential amendment has to be  made  in

clause 3 (a) to section 12 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the valuation of these commodities is based on

documentary evidence and is already in the possession of

the  Customs Department, for administrative convenience,

the  assessment of the Department should be presumed  to

be  correct unless proved otherwise. This is so provided

in paragraph (c) of clause

3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new basis of levy was imposed on the 3rd of

October when the Customs Duties (Amendment) Order, 1958,

was  enacted. It is therefore necessary that  this  Bill

should  also be operative from that date. Sir, I beg  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sessional Paper Cmd. 33 of 1957 the House was made

aware  of  the  Communist threat to Singapore  and  the

tactics employed by Communist Front supporters in their

efforts ultimately to establish a dictatorial Communist

state.  Since  the  Command Paper was published,  there

have   been   continuing  attempts  by  supporters   of

Communism  to undermine the authority of the Government

and  it  has  been  necessary to  detain  a  number  of

subversive  elements who had succeeded in  establishing

themselves  in  positions of authority  in  respectable

democratic institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1957 subversive elements succeeded in

gaining  control of the Central Executive Committee  of

the People's Action Party and were actively engaged  in

promoting the interests of the Communist Front  amongst

students  and  trade unions. Had these activities  been

allowed  to  continue unchecked, there is little  doubt

that  they would shortly have presented a grave  threat

to   the   security   of  Singapore.   The   Government

accordingly   decided   to  take   action   under   the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance against these

evil  forces.  The justification for  such  action  was

amply  proved  when out of 20 P.A.P. leaders  arrested,

two confessed to being Communists, five were identified

as  members of the Communist under around organisation,

and  the Appeal Tribunal confirmed the detention orders

made  in  every single case. At the same time,  it  was

considered necessary to arrest and detain 15  so-called

trade  union  leaders  who were known  Communist  Front

workers.  In  their  cases  also  the  Appeal  Tribunal

confirmed the detention orders. From statements made by

those detained and from documents seized at the time of

their  arrest,  there was ample evidence  to  show  the

intentions   of   these  people  to  penetrate   legal,

democratic   organisations  in  Singapore  and,   after

assuming  control, to exploit their legal aims  in  the

furtherance of Communist policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some Communist extremists were concentrating

their  attention on political parties and trade unions,

others were directing their efforts to the subversion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



of students. It was known that a number of student

members  of  the  Communist Front were responsible  for

organising  student picnics and social  gatherings  for

the  purpose of indoctrinating those who attended  with

Communist  ideologies. At the end  of  September  1957,

following  the  arrest  of  the  ringleaders  of   this

campaign,  19 detention orders were made and confirmed.

Documents  recovered during Police  operations  against



these students proved the Communist sympathies of those

arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in 1958 Communist sympathisers turned their

attention  to a campaign designed to inculcate  in  the

population   feelings  of  hatred  and  dissatisfaction

towards  democratic government and the existing  social

order.  So-called  "cultural  companies"  published  or

distributed  booklets criticising  the  Governments  of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya and praising the

Communist terrorists in the Federation as patriots  and

fighters  for their motherland, Malaya. In an operation

in  March  1958,  the  Police  raided  8  premises  and

recovered  over  2,000  of these undesirable  booklets.

Evidence was obtained which showed that these "cultural



companies"    were    distributing   the    undesirable

publications  in  the Federation  and  in  Sarawak  and

further evidence proved the association of one  of  the

companies  with  Malayan  Communist  Party  members  in

Johore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 1958 information was available to the Police

that  Communist "power groups" still exist in Singapore

and are made up of highly indoctrinated and experienced

Communist personnel. The duty of these power groups  is

to  use their influence in specific operations such  as

election  campaigns or the capture of control of  trade

unions  or  political  parties.  Information  has  been

received  that extremist control of the P.A.P.  Central

Executive  Committee  was achieved  in  precisely  this

manner  in  August last year. In June this  year,  Sir,

members  of  this  "power group" were  arrested  and  8

detention orders have been made and confirmed.  Two  of

these  detainees  have disclosed that they  were  under

instructions to penetrate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. and  trade unions and  organise  Communist

activities in these legal bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the detentions which have been made and

confirmed by the Appeal Tribunal since the second  half

of  1956  provide a clear indication of  the  ceaseless

vigilance  which is necessary to thwart the  activities

of  a  small but entirely unprincipled section  of  the

community   which  seeks  to  overthrow   parliamentary

democracy,  and  impose upon the  great  mass  of  law-abiding citizens a totalitarian system of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No freedom-loving people will lightly approve

legislation  which permits of detention without  trial.

It  must  however be borne in mind, Sir, that  a  great



part  of  the information which leads to action against

the  Communist and their fellow-travellers is  gathered

from erstwhile accomplices or comrades, or from persons

whose  lives would be in jeopardy if the fact of  their

providing   such   information  were   known   to   the

Communists,  and  for this reason, Sir,  such  evidence

cannot be published in open court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the events of the past three years

and  the  strong evidence that powerful influences  are

still  at  work with the intention of overthrowing  the

present form of democratic Government in Singapore,  it

is  the  clear  duty of the Government  to  retain  the

extraordinary powers given to it under the Preservation

of  Public  Security Ordinance in order to protect  the

security  of  the  citizens  of  Singapore.   The   new

Constitution which is to come into force next year is a

rich  prize  indeed  and we must do everything  in  our

power  to  see that the Communists do not capture  this

prize.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government asks for the extension of the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance for one  year

only  and the power to extend current detention  orders

by  one  year  only, in order that the next Government,

the first Government of the new State of Singapore, may

be  elected and take up office in propitious conditions

and  may  have  a  few months to make up  its  mind  on

whether or not there is a need for further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



legislation  to give it extraordinary  powers  of

arrest  and  detention  to deal  with  the  dangers  to

security  against which, in present circumstances,  the

ordinary processes of law are inadequate defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  new  amending Bill to the original Ordinance  has

come as a big surprise to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill seeks to extend the period of

the  Ordinance from three to four years. I  cannot  see

the   necessity  for  extending  the  period  of   that

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister just now quoted the activities of

the  P.A.P. leaders and the students. All these  P.A.P.

leaders and the students who were considered subversive



at that time are now under detention; some of them have

been  banished. So I cannot see any reason why the life

of this Bill should be extended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Ordinance was first introduced, the then

Chief Minister who was the architect of this Bill,  had

this  to  say. I quote from column 702 of  the  Hansard

dated 21st September, 1955:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, there have been some criticisms - on the face of

them  legitimate,  and  some of  them,  in  fact,  very

constructive - directed against this Bill. The first  one

I will deal with is that it seeks to make law for three

years what has so far been law for only three months at

a  time.  In  the past we had to renew this  law  every

three  months. The question of renewal of a  law  every

three  months was based on the concept of the existence

of an emergency."



<br><br>He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Government has never avoided, and so long as I

survive" -



<br><br>unfortunately, he never survived his term of office -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"on this side will never avoid its responsibilities.

and instead of making it four years and 'passing the

buck' to the next government, we will have to face this

House, at least five months before its dissolution...".



<br><br>Sir, as I said, unfortunately, the then Chief Minister

did not survive his term



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



of  office or else he may now have to swallow  his  own

words.  He  has clearly stated, Sir, that  he  did  not

intend to make this Ordinance a permanent one. If  that

is  so,  why then extend the period from three to  four

years?  If  it is not going to be permanent, it  should

not  be extended. By extending the period for one  more

year, there is the likelihood that it may again have to

come  to this House for a further extension. After  one

year and another, it may then become permanent. Is this

the  policy of the Government, Sir, and if that is  so,

is  it the intention of the Government to tie the hands

of the next Government which may come into power?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance, originally introduced and approved,

came  into operation on 21st October, 1955, which means

that  it  will expire on 21st October this  year.  With

this  amending  Bill,  Sir, the  period  will  then  be

extended to 21st October, 1959. Sir, let us look at  it

this  way. How long is the life of this Assembly?  When

will  this Assembly be dissolved and when is  the  next

election  to be held? According to the Chief  Minister,

he  said  that he will have the election by March  next

year. Then if the election is to be held by March  next

year  and the life of this Assembly is up to March next

year,  why  extend  the life of this Ordinance  further

than  March, 1959? I think the Government is trying  to

pass the buck to the next Government, according to what

the then Chief Minister who framed this Ordinance said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause 3 of the Bill, Sir, seeks power to be

given to the Chief Secretary if the Governor in Council

is  satisfied to extend the period of detention for two

years to a further period not exceeding 12 months at  a

time. Again, Sir, when the Ordinance was passed, it was

on  the  very  clear understanding that the  period  of

detention would only be for two years and no more.  Why

this sudden change of attitude, Sir, on the part of the

Government? Is it to prevent our colleague  the  Member

for  Bukit  Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) from contesting

the  next  election?  Is  that  the  intention  of  the

Government so that he may be further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



detained  while the Assembly dissolves and  we  contest

the  next  election? If so, let the Chief Minister  say

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has caused a lot of misery to the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Oh yes, certainly quite a lot. It

has  resulted in my tabling a motion on 21st April this

year  on  the torture of detainees. The Hon, the  Chief

Secretary is holding his head because he denied at that

time that there was torture by the Police. Whether that

is  true or not, I leave it to the public to decide, it

has  been  debated and I am not prepared to  debate  it

further.  If  any Member would like me to  refresh  his

memory, I would refer him to columns 263 to 270 of  the

Hansard (Vol. 3). There he will find reference  to  the

torture. Apart from this alleged torture, I have on the

Order Paper another motion in my name. This is again as

a   result  of  the  Preservation  of  Public  Security

Ordinance.  This time it is not about  torture, it  is

about banishment and I will come to that later.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order. Is the hon.

Member anticipating a debate on his motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was watching that very carefully and I

do not think he has gone as far as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, because I said that I would come to  that

later and not now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance, detainees born, bred and educated in  Malaya

were  deported  to China. Now I cannot  understand  the

policy  of  the  Government. When these detainees  were

arrested,  they were arrested under this Ordinance  and

not on a banishment order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member now touching

on his motion? If he is, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I was just trying

to  state what harm this new Bill will do to the people

of  Singapore. I would therefore appeal to the  Members

of this House not to accept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



this  Bill. As I have said, it is a question of whether

the people of Singapore will accept this Bill. With all

the  experience of alleged torture - I call it  "alleged"

instead  of "actual" because the Chief Minister  denied

it - and  of  banishment, I am sure that  the  people  of

Singapore  do not want this Bill at all. I  am  against

the Bill.



<br><br>10.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  protest against this Bill. The Chief Minister

has  just  given a catalogue of reasons why  he  thinks

such  an  undemocratic measure is so necessary for  the

democracy of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that since last year, many people

have  been arrested and detained, and no valid  reasons

were  given  to this Assembly or in public  why  a  few

people have been released and many of them are still in

detention  camps. One example I have  in  mind  is  the

recent   release  of  Dr  Chuang.  He   was   released

immediately after the defeat of the Labour Front in the

Kallang  by-election.  One  would  have  thought   that

probably  he  was  detained  because  he  was  plotting

against the Labour Front election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister is not the first politician

who,  in  the  name  of  democracy,  seeks  to  destroy

democracy  by  jailing his political  opponents.  There

were men before him and there might be men after him to

follow his procedure. When I look at the vacant seat of

the Member for Bukit Timah which was caused through the

operation  of this Ordinance, I feel like  asking  this

House to observe two minutes' silence in honour of that

Assemblyman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Silence by you in the House!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes. The Member for Bukit Timah who

continues  to  represent  his  constituency   in   that

national  assembly which is popularly known  as  Changi

Jail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from a brief study of Asian history, I am

convinced  that many of the Asian leaders emerged  from

British  political prisons and I know that the men  who

sit  in  Changi Jail will soon grace the seat of power,

and when they do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



come  to power and the same Ordinance is in force,  how

many  of  us who sit in this Assembly will conduct  our

debates in Changi Jail is a matter for conjecture. Sir,

1  said once that a man who holds the gun will say  the

other  man is a subversive. So we will know, when these

people  who are in Changi Jail are released,  what  the

result  will  be for all the people who are  supporting

this  Bill. I do not, if possible, want to go to Changi

Jail and this is the reason why I oppose this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

should  have  thought that as there are seven  Liberal-Socialist speakers as against three P.A.P., they  would

have given me the courtesy of speaking later on in  the

debate, but they are just moral cowards.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member knows that that

expression is unparliamentary and he must withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very well, Sir. Nevertheless, I

cannot help feeling -

expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I have withdrawn it, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we meet to discuss the Preservation

of  Public  Security  Ordinance  in  circumstances  and

conditions  which are quite different  from  what  they

were  three  years  ago, but the speeches  by  the  two

illustrious  Members on the Opposition side,  serve  to

remind  us how little one can learn in three  years.  I

was  sorry to hear the Hon, the Chief Minister read his

recital  of  subversive activities since the  Bill  was

passed  three years ago. It did not carry that ring  of

conviction   of   someone  who  had   been   intimately

associated with the problem. It sounded like a  recital

having been composed and prepared by someone else.  We,

Sir,  in  the People's Action Party compose and prepare

our own symphony, and I came to this House today with a

statement  on  (1) what we intend to debate,  which  is

important, and (2) what some people might want to  know

about what we intend to do next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the form in which the extension to the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance is being

sought, as an amending Bill to extend it from three to

four years - one extra year to cover the extended life of

the Labour Front Coalition Government until it dies

with this Assembly in April next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes it easier and simpler for us to state our

position clearly and succinctly. Three and a half years

ago, the People's Action Party fought and won three out

of the four seats it contested. One of its promises was

to oppose the Emergency Regulations. Six months after

that, the former leader of the Government, one David

Saul Marshall, tried a sleight of hand in this

Assembly. As he brought in the Preservation of Public

Security Ordinance with his right, he gallantly struck

out the Emergency Regulations with his left. We opposed

it then, and there is nothing that has happened since

September 1955 to have changed our position from what

it was in September 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Sir. We were elected on an election

promise to oppose, and we honour our promises. This is

fundamental to the democratic system; that important

issues are placed before the electorate by those

contesting for power. Whoever is returned to represent

the people has a mandate to do what he promised to do.

This is the essence of the democratic system, otherwise



it ceases to have a meaning. If you have people

periodically and systematically presenting one point of

view at election time, and, having been elected, they

then proceed to do the opposite, then the whole

democratic machinery is negated. If there is to be a

departure from any fundamental pledge given in an

election, then that mandate must be returned and a new

mandate sought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Front wants to know why the people

think that it is anti a lot of things including anti-democracy, civilisation, Chinese, Asian, and why it is

going down the drain. I say, six months from the time

they won the election, they began to die because they,

through the then Chief Minister, had perpetrated one of

the biggest election frauds in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



Malayan  history.  They made the Emergency  Regulations

and  its  abolition a crucial issue. Six  months  after

that,  they  thought that by changing names they  could

get  away with it. What the present Chief Minister said

this  morning  would have carried more  conviction  and

more weight if he had the mandate to do and say all the

things he has done and said, but deep down in his heart

he  knows  that  he had been a party  to  an  electoral

confidence trick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that we are not required by law,

once  having been elected, to abide by what we promised

when we were elected. By law he who wins an election is

a  member for the term of his years of office,  and  he

can  with impunity do whatever he likes during his term

of  office.  But the law does require that  his  office

should come to an end and, if he chooses to go on, then

he  must seek a new mandate. When that time comes those

who  have  forgotten what they promised the  last  time

will   discover  that  the  people  place  very  little

reliance on what they promise this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the secret of long life in politics is not the

continual  formation, dissolution  and  reformation  of

political parties, fronts or movements. It is only  the

dissolute  and  the  debauched who  become  prematurely

aged,  and  who have to go in search of that elixir  of

life  to give them back their lost youth and their lost

vigour. So it is that some people believe that,  having

debauched  themselves in one political party or  front,

they can, like the phoenix, arise from the ashes of the

old  in  the feathers of a new party, front or movement

as  fresh  as  if nothing had happened. In  fact,  Sir,

there  is  no  such  magic  formula  for  longevity  in

political  life other than the simple and the  obvious:

just  honour your promises; do not corrupt and  debauch

your  party. I am confident that he who does that  will

find  that the people are as ready to believe  what  he

says the next time, as what he said the last time. When

you  go  back to renew your mandate, having  faithfully

executed  the  last one, you will find  that  there  is

reliance on what you are now saying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, quite simply, the People's Action

Party  has  no mandate to vote for the Preservation  of

Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



Security Ordinance. But, there may be people - I am quite

sure that there may be some in important positions  not

only in Singapore but across the Causeway -  who may want

to know what the People's Action Party propose to do in

the next elections. Is it going to repeat the same anti-Emergency  Regulations stand? Is it going to make  this

an  election  issue, and then having won the  elections

seek   to   abolish   the  Emergency  Regulations   and

precipitate a crisis? Under normal conditions,  Sir,  I

would  tell such nosey and curious people to  wait  for

the proper time in the next few months when we shall be

issuing our election manifesto. But it may be that  the

Federation  of Malaya would like to know  its  position

vis  a  vis Singapore after the next general elections,

because  the Federation of Malaya has to be represented

on   our  Internal  Security  Council  under  the   new

Constitution. In fact, it is to have the decisive vote.

What  is to happen to these Emergency laws is a  matter



of  some considerable importance to them, because there

are now two political situations; one in the Federation

and  one  in Singapore, both distinct and separate  and

self-contained, with a cordon sanitaire in the  Straits

of Johore. And they would like to know whether there is

going  to  be  a crisis immediately after  the  general

elections,  with an emergency meeting of  the  Internal

Security Council summoned by the British to oppose  any

intended  moves to abolish the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance. In such a situation, the Federation

may find themselves in the embarrassing position of (1)

voting   with   the  British  against   the   Singapore

representatives;  or  (2)  voting  with  the  Singapore

representatives  to  abolish the Emergency  laws  which

they in the Federation still consider necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because this is a fundamental issue that I have

a  mandate  from  my  Party to  state  now  our  future

position. If it were the British Government in  control

of the Federation of Malaya, as it was three years ago,

we  would still oppose the Emergency laws as vehemently

as  we  did three years ago, because then the Emergency

law could be used and were sometimes used, not only  to

curb  the  Communists, but also to  curb  the  militant

Nationalists. It was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



a  simple  issue  then  of the  people  versus  British

imperialism,  and  we  stated  unequivocally  where  we

stood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were asked to vote for these laws three

years  ago,  we  opposed them, for the  centre  of  the

Government  in the Federation was the High Commissioner

and  his nominated officials, and in Singapore  it  was

then, and now is still, in the triumvirate of the three

official  Ministers headed by the Governor  with  over-riding powers. These are men who are not answerable  to

the  people. Their masters are not in Singapore but  in

London. In that situation, we allied ourselves with all

the  anti-colonial forces to fight colonialism  and  we

will  continue  to  do so until the  last  vestiges  of

colonial rule are removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, however, partly as a result of scheming by

the British Raj and partly because of the accidents  of

history,  we  are faced with a separate and independent

Federation of Malaya with no prospects in the immediate

future  of our becoming independent. Next year, we  are

to  be  only  internally  self-governing,  and  in  all

security  matters which effect defence upon  which  the

Singapore  and  the British Governments  disagree,  the

Federation Government is to be the arbiter. We accepted

that  position because we accepted merger as  the  only

way  to independence. If we are prepared to accept  the

Federation and join it as a member state, then it means

that   we   are   prepared  to  allow  the   Government

representing the 11 States in the Federation to have  a

decisive voice in the affairs of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is still our position and it will be our

position  for all the years to come until merger.  This

is  the  basic analysis of our political situation.  If

that   analysis   is  correct,  then  certain   logical

consequences follow. We must recognise that  our  over-riding objective is merger and that means that we  must

acknowledge that until merger the over-riding interests

of   the   Federation  must  prevail  over   Singapore.

Therefore,  we  say  that if we are the  Government  of



Singapore,  we will take no steps which will  undermine

the interests of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Party of the "Left", we may not always agree or

see  eye  to  eye with a Party of the "Right",  as  the

Tunku has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



once  called the United Malay Nationalist Organisation.

But   we   can  assure  them  that  their   views   and



susceptibilities  will  be  given  the   most   careful

consideration  by  us. We state our stand  now  on  the

question of the Emergency laws, and it is this: that as

long  as they are necessary for the maintenance of  the

security  of  the  Federation, so  long  will  they  be

necessary for Singapore. Sir, we state this now in  the

full  knowledge  and anticipation that  there  will  be

political bankrupts and charlatans, those who have, and

those  who  have  not ever graced the  chairs  of  this

Assembly, who will make promises to abolish them in the

next  elections. We have met such types before, and  we

expect  to  meet them in the next elections. When  that

time  comes, we shall justify our view and  our  stand,

that  there will be no abolition of the Emergency  laws

in  Singapore  until they have been  abolished  in  the

Federation. Those who want the Emergency laws abolished

in Singapore should try to help to establish conditions

of  peace  and security in the Federation so that  they

may no longer be required there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Government or any person that seeks in the next

elections  to  say that they will abolish these  powers

will be faced with three positions if they proceed with

and  honour  their promise. Three things can happen - (1)

either the Federation Government votes with the British

against  the Singapore representatives, it having  been

thoroughly antagonized already at that stage  and  then

the  Government  fails with consequent  antagonism  and

hostility  between  the  British  and  us,   which   is

unimportant,  but  also between the Federation  and  us

which  is important; or (2) the unlikely event  of  the

Federation representative saying that he will vote with

the   Singapore  representatives  and  abolish  it  for

Singapore and allow Singapore, if necessary,  to  be  a

rest  camp  and  a  base  for Malayan  Communist  Party

activities in the Federation; or (3) he may abstain and

a  deadlock is created. I am not sure which of the  two

probabilities is the more probable; their  voting  with

the  British against the Singapore representatives,  or

their  abstaining  and creating .a  political  deadlock

which may end up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



with  the  suspension of the Constitution. But  he  who

makes  these promises must be prepared to face his  way

out  of  that  dilemma.  Before these  laws  have  been

abolished in the Federation, any man who believes  that

he  can  abolish  them in Singapore  needs  to  have  a

psychiatric  examination. Before these conditions  have

been   brought  about,  however,  let  all  intelligent

persons,   including  those  who   have   been   called

intelligent persons by the Secretary of State  for  the

Colonies,  for they knowing this full well  proceed  to

promise  these  things  in  the  elections,  let   them

remember that cheats and liars are very easily  exposed

and when they do, humiliation follows with a vengeance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was thrilled to hear the Member for Queenstown

(Mr  Lee Choon Eng), and went into rapturous ecstasies

when  I  heard the Member for Farrer Park  (Mr  A.  R.

Lazarous)  who,  because he had more cars  on  election



day,  defeated his opponent, my comrade Mr Devan Nair,

and he still is my comrade -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous:</b> Still?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let there be no doubts on that

matter. Those who ordinarily believe that they can out-P.A.P. the  P.A.P. will find that they  are  over  the

abyss  where all good Communists or bad democrats  are.

Sir,  we are the extreme left of the democratic  front,



the genuine extreme left. Those who want to out-left us

are  either genuine Communists or bogus democrats,  and

many  a  leader has tried at some time or the other  to

out-maneuver  the P.A.P. The former Chief  Minister  to

this  very day finds it difficult to think of  my  name

without  a  certain degree of hostility and  a  certain

desire for vengeance. I once advised him when he was in

London for the Constitutional Talks, that before making

rash promises about resigning and quitting politics, he

should consider the consequences of his action,  if  he

tried  to be more militant and vigorous than the P.A.P.

He  discovered subsequently that he had overplayed  his



hand. He tried again in the City Council Election,  and

looked  as if he was recovering his hand, and  he  made

the biggest bid of all in the Kallang by-elections, and

he lost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are unmoved by temporary successes or

defeats.  We  are  the products  of  a  movement,  a

movement which began with the Japanese occupation of

Malaya, and which released all those forces of pride

and  self-respect in the subject peoples of Asia and

made them determined never again to allow themselves

to  be dominated by foreign powers. Nobody plied  me

with  tracts,  Sir,  to become a politician.  Nobody

taught me Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin. We were

created by ambitions, not by special agents,  and  I

believe that if we are able to face the future  with

firmness  and  courage and with a  determination  to

succeed, we shall succeed, for if we fail, then  let

me  tell the Member for Farrer Park - I am quite  sure

he will be the first to flee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all colonial territories that have gained

their independence since the end of the Second World

War   have   equipped  themselves   with   Emergency

Laws - India,  Pakistan, Burma, even Ceylon,  and  now

Ghana.  Now, Sir, I do not suggest - I see no Members

on  the Front Bench there who can be as tough as Mr

Udesi,  the  Minister  for Home  Affairs  in  Ghana,

except perhaps the Minister for Education (Mr  Chew

Swee  Kee)  who looks quite tough! But I  would  say

this,  that having seen the historical evolution  of

these  territories, we would be foolish to  try  and

beguile  ourselves with unsophisticated  phrases  of

democracy and liberty and human rights and  freedom,

while we go down the drain. Our situation is neither

new  nor unique in the history of mankind, and I say

quite  frankly  that we shall learn  from  what  has

happened  in these other countries, and  the  P.A.P.

Government will equip itself with Emergency powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also wish to say that the use of these

Emergency  powers  depends upon  the  stand  of  the

persons who are equipped with them, and we stand for

an  independent,  democratic, non-Communist  Malaya.

Within  this  democratic system,  everyone  has  the



right to compete, to preach his political views, but

the  competition must be for the purpose of  working

the  system, not of destroying it. These powers will

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



be  allowed  to be used against political  opponents

within the system who compete for the right to  work

the  system. That is fundamental and basic,  or  the

powers  will  have destroyed the purpose  for  which

they  were forged. If in using these powers you,  in

fact,  negate the purpose for which you  made  them,

then  you will end up with a situation where  force,

and more force, will become increasingly necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Chief Minister, since he

has   recited  all  the  good  deeds  he  has  done,

including  rescuing - one of the popular  beliefs  in

town  is  that the Labour Front rescued  the  P.A.P.

Sir,  I  think they should credit us with  a  little



more  intelligence  and  political  skill  than   is

commonly  believed possible in so-called extremists.

In the first place, let me get the arithmetic right.



The  moderate factor so-called, we have never called



ourselves  moderates because we like to be honest - we

are not moderates and therefore we do not pretend to

be - and  those  who  thought we were  moderates  were

quite alarmed when we won the City Council elections

and  they discovered that we were not moderates, but

we  are  non-Communists and we have said so. In  the

first place, we did not lose control of the Party to

those  who wanted to capture the Party - and  I  will

not say whether they are Communists or not since the

Chief  Minister is so well informed  but  would  not

disclose  his sources we fought to a draw,  that  is

the  first point to remember, six-all, and we  knew,

what  was more, that the other side had a weak  link

because it was really five/six - and we knew full well

it would in a crisis crack up, and crises there were

galore. Sir, if the Chief Minister believed that  he

rescued  the P.A.P., then naturally he must  comfort

himself  with  the thought that perhaps  the  P.A.P.

would  be  grateful  to him for  having  tried,  not



having rescued the P.A.P., to drown the chaps whom  he

fished out of the water. We have no gratitude to him

for trying to do that, and we tell him quite plainly

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



bluntly  that if he wants to make political  capital

out  of this we will give him more than he can  give

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are three things in the catalogue of

events and good deeds that he has done on behalf  of

the  people without having informed them first  that

he  wanted  to do all these things. But he  did  not

listen  and  I  am  making these, I  would  not  say

charges,  but  I am making these statements  in  the

full  knowledge that everybody outside shares  these

suspicions - that he has been playing  the  fool  with

human  lives and liberties. How else can he  explain

why  he  arrested Dr Chuang Chu Lin, held  him  for

many months as a dangerous tool who has been used by

the   Communists,  and  then,  without  a  word   of

explanation,  released him in order  that  he  could

gratefully  shake the hands of the  Chief  Minister?

Why  did  he  arrest and detain Linda Chen  for  two

years  and  tell the world that she was a  dangerous

Communist, and then without so much as an expression

of  regret,  release her as the  others  were  being

banished to China?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he give Mr Lim Kean Chye an entry permit

and  then have him arrested when he arrived? Did  he

not   know  that  there  would  be  retaliation  and

consequences in the Federation? Here was a  man  who

had  been  trying  for years to get  back  into  the

Federation  as of right, as a Federal  citizen,  and

the  Federation Government have refused him  because

they  said that under the Constitution he  had  been

away for more than five years; and knowing full well

these  things, he gave him an entry permit, got  the

man  clapped in gaol, succeeded in antagonizing  the

Federation   to  a  point  where  they   immediately

promulgated  a new set of laws to control  movements

across the causeway. Before anybody with a right  of

entry  into Singapore had a right of entry into  the

Federation. Now the position has altered not only to

the  detriment  of  this  one  person,  but  to  the

detriment  of  the  people of  Singapore  generally,

because  the Chief Minister or his Government  chose

to act in such an arbitrary and desperate fashion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



Sheer recklessness. I say this - no Government has the

right  to play politics with the lives and liberties

of  people, be they its citizens or no.  And  I  say

this  now  for the benefit of all, that  the  P.A.P.

Government will not allow these powers to be used in



this reckless fashion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let this also be made known, that our definition of

the word "subversion" is probably different from the

British definition of that term, and maybe even from

the     Labour    Front    definition    of     that

term - "subversion". In our definition "subversion" is

any  political activity designed to further the aims

and  interests not of our own people but of  foreign

powers;  and  by  foreign powers we  mean  not  just

Russia and China, but also America and Formosa,  and

the Western bloc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let those who are interested to know where we stand

draw  a  lesson from the fate of David Saul Marshall

and the Labour Front. Let them take it to heart, for

that is the way how not to win elections. We in  the

People's  Action  Party  would  prefer  to  lose  an

election  rather than win it on false  premises  and

promises.  We have grown from strength to  strength,

because  we  are  honest and  because  what  we  say

publicly  we honour publicly. We stated three  years

ago  in the then situation that we were against  the

Emergency Regulations. We opposed it after  we  were

elected  in  1955 and in September and  October.  We

will  oppose  it  now because we  are  on  the  same

mandate. But to those who would like to know what we

will  do  in a few months' time, as they have  every

right to know, we say now that if we do not begin to

face up to the future, then we perish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say this, that we in this Assembly must

always  expect  to have those who are denied  direct

entry into the political arena, we must expect  them

to  fight  by  proxy.  If it  were  not  David  Saul

Marshall, it could be the Member for Queenstown (Mr

Lee  Choon  Eng), it could be anybody else.  I  hold

nothing  against  them, but I  would  like  them  to

remember  this: Fight your own battle for  your  own

end, and I state the P.A.P. battle is for an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



independent, democratic, non-Communist Malaya.  We  are

not going to join in this mad crusade of liberating the

unfree world for the free world, of wanting Formosa  to

recapture  the mainland of China. At the same  time  we

state  quite  categorically  that  we  believe  in  the

democratic  system, that we will allow full competition

within  the democratic system, but competition for  the

purpose  of  destroying the democratic system  will  be

resisted; and a Government or any group of persons  who

come  and  tell  the people that they  intend  to  curb

themselves in the name of democracy, human liberty  and

freedom,  would  be the first to flee for  their  lives

when  they  find the policies which they have advocated

come  home to roost. The People's Action Party is under

no  illusions as to the position in Malaya. We know the

position  in  Singapore  vis-a-vis  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  In the next elections we will make  our  stand

clear and justify it against all crackpots, charlatans,

political opportunists and adventurers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  listened with great interest to the  hon.  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  and the manner  in  which  he  has

presented  his  case, by changing the stand  which  his

Party  took  when this Ordinance was first before  this

House  three years ago, when he and his Party  and  the

absent Member violently attacked the proposed Bill.  He

has  now  given us two very ingenious reasons  why  his

Party  has  changed its policy towards the Preservation

of  Public Security Ordinance. The first reason is that

it  is  because  of the whiphand of the  Federation  by

their  having  the  Chairman in  the  Council  for  the

internal  security of Singapore, and so long as  he  is

there,  whatever  happened in the  Federation  to  make

emergency  regulations necessary there will  make  them

necessary  in Singapore. The other reason he has  given

us  is  that  his  Party must follow the  examples  set

before  us  by  the  colonies which  have  just  gained

independence   and  which  all  have   such   emergency

regulations.  But  with  all those  justifications  one

point  stands out clearly, and that is that  his  Party

now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



supports  the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance

and it has made our task much easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has attacked the Government Party for not

following the Party platform during the elections and I

must say that we are the only realistic Party and we

have never changed from our point of view of public

security. I refer to my -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Always colonial stooges!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> That, Sir, is not true. We were the

first to voice independence here and we are on the  way

towards  it.  Sir,  I  read  from  the  Report  of  the

Legislative Assembly sitting on the 21st of  September,

1955 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, Sir, our Party, the Progressive

Party,  has  always been realistic in our  policy  with

regard to the Emergency Regulations."



<br><br>I will miss some irrelevant portions and I go on -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not going to deviate from the course we have

set ourselves and have taken so far. We have supported

and will continue to support the continuance of these

Regulations or other similar laws so long as there is

violence, terror and fear in Malaya. But we must also

remember that, as we have infringed upon the rights of

individuals, we must see to it that no injustice is

perpetrated as a result of these Regulations."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member give the columns,

please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> It is at column 745.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Column 745, thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I can almost say that these

were prophetic words! What we saw clearly in those days

has happened in the course of the last three years and,

to   my   mind,  has  made  the  continuance   of   the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance  for  another

year  a necessity. We in this Chamber must examine with

full  conscience  and review what has  happened  during

these very exciting three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has already in his speech

supporting the motion given details of the necessity of

putting down riots and detaining those persons who have

been responsible for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



the  riots.  Now  these persons, under this  Ordinance,

have  a right to ask for their cases to be reviewed  by

three judges. To my knowledge, all of them have applied

for  their  cases  to be reviewed and  they  have  been

turned  down.  Sir, if we were going  to  question  the

decision  of the three judges who exercise  the  powers

under this Ordinance and who have decided that there is

sufficient  evidence to detain these  people,  then  it

would  be a very sorry day indeed for us, Sir,  for  we

are  then challenging administration of the justice  in

our  country and throwing doubt whether the judges  who

are  sitting in the Courts today have been  correct  in

their  decisions  to throw out these  applications  for

review.  Sir,  since  the  detentions  were  made   and

confirmed  by  the decision of these three  judges,  we

have  some measure of peace and order among us in which

we can work quietly for our next step in the government

of Singapore towards self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these circumstances, Sir, I have no hesitation

whatever  in  supporting this  motion  to  extend  this

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance  for  another

year.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me

to  extend  my congratulations to the hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar who has fulfilled my dream that one  day

the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar must admit that he is

of   the   right-wing  party  when  compared   to   the

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not going into the merits or demerits of the

Preservation  of  Public Security Ordinance.  Today  it

seems  that  storytellers  are  very  popular  in  this

country  and I, therefore, would like to recollect  the

story of what happened three years ago: 27th September,

1955.  The  hon. Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim  Ching

Siong)  shouted,  "This  Bill is  a  colonial  Security

Bill".  The hon. Member for Sembawang (Inche Ahmad  bin

Ibrahim)  said  that this Bill would  deter  the  trade

union movement. The hon. Member for Serangoon said,  "I

prefer the Emergency Regulations because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



the length of time for its review is only  three

months".   Sir,  things  have  greatly   changed   now,

especially  the People's Action Party, and particularly

the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar. He appears to us  as

a very responsible and an entirely changed man, changed

to   such   an   extent  that  he  made   a   statement

contradictory  to  what  he had  said  before,  in  the

Hansard  Volume 1 No. 14 col. 726 in which he said  "If

it  is not totalitarian to arrest a man and detain  him

when you cannot charge him with any offence against any

written  law - if that is not what we have always  cried

out  against  in Fascist States - then what  is  it?"  In

other  words,  the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  said

this P.P.S.O. is a Fascist law! Now he seems to realise

his  responsibility to the people and take it to  heart

and, therefore, he has promised us to change his stand.

But  one  thing which he is not aware of is that  times



have  changed.  No  more 200 strikes - over  200  strikes

during  so  short  a period - no more picketeers  outside

this  House;  no  more  Emergency  appeals  now  except

gangster  activities. The general  election  is  coming

nearer and nearer. If the Government insist on amending

this  law by extending it for another year, I  am  sure

they  will mislead the people into believing that  this

Bill is really helping the People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has confirmed

that  Mr Devan Nair is still his colleague and comrade

and that the hon. Member for Bukit Timah is his comrade

too,  why  do  the  Government  not  release  them   by

withdrawing this amending Bill? Let Mr Devan Nair  and

the  Member  for Bukit Timah take part in  this  coming

general  election. This will serve to confirm  or  deny

the political gossip or rumour that there is really  an

understanding between the Hon. the Chief  Minister  and

the   Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  to  arrest  all  his

opponents in the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important thing is the concept of

democracy. I do not mind



using  the  same words as have been used by the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar. I quote from Hansard No. 14, Volume

1, dated 21st September, 1955, col. 726:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we

must  be  prepared,  in principle,  to  concede  to  our

enemies - even those who do not subscribe to our  views - as

much  constitutional right as you concede  yourself,  My

plea - to  quote  from someone in another context - is  that

the time has come in Malaya for an agonising reappraisal

of  strategy and strength. To go on blindly in the  hope

that somehow or the other suppression can prevent latent

social,   economic   and  political   discontents   from

manifesting  themselves and disrupting the structure  of

society  is a piece of folly to which my Party does  not

subscribe."



<br><br>Sir,  it  is  very  clear. If we want a free  democratic

election and if we have confidence in ourselves that the

democratic  system is much better than the  totalitarian

system,  it seems therefore rather absurd to bar  people

who  do not believe this Bill is in their interests; but

they  merely say it is aimed to bar them from contesting

the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Emergency conditions in the Federation

have  greatly improved. Many black areas have now turned

into  white  areas  and  I think the  stability  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya is obvious. Therefore  I  do  not

think it is wise for this House at this moment, in  view

of  the approaching general election, to amend this Bill

from  three to four years. It will indirectly prove that

we  are  cowards and that we have an inferiority complex

in  that we do not dare to fight a system in which we do

not  believe. Therefore, Sir, I appeal to the Government

to  consider  this point, it seems we cannot  fight  the

King  Kong therefore we put him into the jail, I do  not

think this is a bold and courageous government.



<br><br>11.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

next  year  a  new Assembly will be elected  and  a  new

government will be formed by the majority party  in  the

Assembly.  The  new  government  will  operate  the  new

constitution.  What  should  be  the  attitude  of   the

government  towards the Preservation of Public  Security

Ordinance?  My colleague, the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,

has  made  a general review of the stand which my  Party

will  take  should  it he returned at the  next  General

Elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to elaborate on the subject in one of its

aspects. I want to discuss the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



future    relationship   between   the    self-governing

government of the State of Singapore and the independent

state  of  the Federation of Malaya. It is obvious  that

the  matter  of  internal security is one  of  paramount

importance  in  the  ties  between  Singapore  and   the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems a safe enough starting point to assume that

the over-riding policy of any future government must  be

to secure agreement with the Federation government for a

merger   of   the   two  territories.  Under   the   new

constitution  Singapore will enjoy only  internal  self-government.  For  full Merdeka we must  merge  with  the

mainland. Only lunatics believe that Singapore can be an

independent state on its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that with the next step of our political

development,  we  would have reached only  the  half-way

house  to  full Merdeka, it is important that we  should

then  onwards press ahead and avoid doing anything  that

would  harm  us  in  the last stage of  our  journey  to

freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be clear even to the meanest intellect that

we  must fall in line with the Federation Government  on

matters  of internal security. Let us examine  both  the

constitutional and political position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constitutional position is clear. The supreme

authority  in  matters  of  internal  security  is   the

Security Council. On the Security Council will sit three

Singapore representatives, three British representatives

and one Federation representative. This means that where

Singapore and the Federation are united, they  can  out-vote  the British; where they are disunited, the British

will have the deciding voice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Security arrangement agreed to by the

Singapore  All Party Mission. This is part  of  the  new

constitution. The All Party stand on this matter, and on

all  matters  generally, has been put  to  the  test  of

public opinion in last year's Tanjong Pagar by-election.

It received overwhelming public support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore are pleased that the Federation

Government have agreed to appoint one representative  on

the   Security  Council.  This  is  surely   a   welcome

recognition that internal security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



is  a  problem common to both territories,  as,

indeed, all other important problems are common to both

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's political situation is not complicated.

This  was  not  so two or three years ago in  Singapore



when  democrats, pro-Communists, anti-Communists,  pro-colonialists   and  others  were  contending   in   the

political  arena.  All pretended to be  democrats.  The

picture  was  then confused. When four or  five  armies

join  in the fray, it is not always easy in the din  or

battle  and  in the melee of banners and  uniforms,  to

find  out  who represents what. But now, as we approach

Merdeka,  the  issues are defining themselves  and  the

genuine   democrat   stands  out  from   the   imposter

masquerading in his uniform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation there is armed conflict between

Tunku   Abdul  Rahman's  government  and  the   Malayan

Communist   Party.  Quite  naturally   the   Federation

Government  is anxious that a self-governing  Singapore

will  not  provide  a refuge and a  sanctuary  for  the

M.C.P.'s  hard pressed battalions. It is possible  that

the   Federation   Government  have   exaggerated   the

possibility  of  our island being used as  a  refitting

centre  by the M.C.P. but the anxiety they felt  was  a

real  one and no doubt lay behind their willingness  to

participate in Singapore's security affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the Federation have the Emergency on their

hands,  that  long will they insist that  no  Singapore

government  shall be permitted to give aid and  comfort

to the Communists and their sympathisers. If an elected

Singapore  government  were to attempt  otherwise,  two

consequences immediately follow. First, there will be a

serious division of opinion within the Security Council

between  Singapore and the Federation. As  I  explained

earlier,  any  disunity between the two will  give  the

British representatives the deciding voice. No one need

doubt  as  to how the British will vote. The Federation

view will prevail. The second consequence will be that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



Singapore may well have to forget about merger with the

Federation, at least until it changes by free  election

the  government which has brought it into conflict with

the Federation's vital security interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody likes the provisions of the Preservation of

the  Public  Security Ordinance. But it is  foolish  to

imagine  that a self-governing Singapore will  ever  be

able  to  discard  the Preservation of Public  Security

Ordinance and at the same time hope to merge  with  the

Federation. You can do one or the other; you cannot  do

both. I am quite clear in my mind what I would do given

the   choice   in  a  self-governing  Singapore.   Good

government  does  not depend on the  absence  of  these

powers.  It  depends  upon  their  proper  use   by   a

government answerable to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, the self-governing Singapore is yet

to  be  and  for this reason and for other  reasons  as

explained  by  my  colleague, the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar, I shall cast my vote against the motion.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, from the debate so far two things  have,

to  my  mind,  emerged. Firstly, we see how politicians

lack  understanding. They choose to  be  blind  to  the

happenings  or incidents that are occurring  around  us

every day and therefore they choose to say things  they

do not really mean with an eye to the future elections.

Secondly, the P.A.P are, I think, not courageous enough



to say that their conscience and the facts and evidence

in  their possession warrant their full support of  the

present  Bill  before  the  House.  But  through  their

Secretary-General, the P.A.P. choose to put  the  blame

on  the  existence  of  the  Emergency  powers  in  the

Federation.  They  choose  to  put  the  blame  on  the

Communist    terrorists   fighting    the    Federation

Government,  and  be., cause of the existence  of  that

terrorism  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya,   we   must

therefore, with a view to a future merger, support this

Bill.  I  would  be  happier if the P.A.P. would  come

before us and say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



that,  because  of the existence of the  Communists  and

their    elements   who   are   trying   to    overthrow

constitutional  government, such a law is  necessary  in

Singapore,  without reference to the future merger  with

the  Federation or because of the existence of a certain

situation in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>11.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  Party's  attitude towards the Preservation  of

Public  Security  Ordinance has always depended  on  the

answers to two questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is: To whom are these extraordinary

powers  being  given? The second is: To  what  use  will

these powers be put?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two questions, in fact, are interrelated. We can

tell from the nature of the persons to whom these powers

are given, how they will use these extraordinary powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, a government of Fascists will use

the   Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance   to

strengthen and safeguard their way of life. And in  pre-war  Germany and pre-war Italy, Fascist governments  had

special powers and used them to strengthen their kind of

state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Communist governments will use these

extraordinary  powers  to protect  and  consolidate  the

Communist  state.  In Russia, China and  other  People's

Democracies,  governments  have  arbitrary   powers   of

arrest, detention and even of execution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no doubt that if we had a government of

secret  society  gangsters or their underlings,  such  a

government would use the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance to make Singapore safe for gangsterism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party has, in the past, attacked the Preservation

of   Public   Security  Ordinance,  or   the   Emergency

Regulations as it used to be called, because we know  to

whom  these powers were being given and to what use they

would be put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency Regulations, as you know, Sir, were

first promulgated by a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



colonial regime. It is true that the supporters of  this

regime  claimed that the Emergency Regulations would  be

used  to  preserve  democracy  against  armed  Communist

revolt and subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it may be that the colonial forces genuinely

believed that the interests of colonialism and democracy

were identical. They were only a little less virulent in

their  attacks  on the anti-colonial parties  than  they

were in their attacks on the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as a colonial regime and its journalistic

tools  were unable to distinguish between democracy  and

nationalism, it would have been folly to have agreed  to

extraordinary powers to such a regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, the times have changed. Next year Singapore

is  to  have internal self-government. This is not  full

independence  or  Merdeka.  But  this  is  not  due   to

obstruction  on the part of the British or to  restraint

on the part of Singapore's political parties. Singapore,

by  itself, cannot be an independent state, though there

are  bankrupt  and  desperate politicians  who  hope  to

revive  their political fortunes by pretending  that  it

can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independence for Singapore depends on it becoming a

part of the Federation. My Party's attitude towards  the

Preservation  of  Public Security  Ordinance  is  partly

determined by this aspiration. As long as an independent

Federation  is  at war with the M.C.P., a self-governing

Singapore  cannot  act as though an emergency  situation

does not exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a case of defending democracy only in the

Federation.  It  must be safeguarded in  Singapore  too.

Once  Singapore becomes a self-governing democracy, that



democracy  must be defended by extraordinary powers,  if

necessary.  In  fact,  we  think,  Sir,  that   in   the

circumstances  now existing in Malaya  such  powers  are

necessary.  But  they  should  be  in  the  hands  of  a

democratically    elected    government - a     government

answerable to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it will be hard for a small territory like

Singapore  to  escape subversion once it  becomes  self-governing. And by subversion we mean activity by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



any  group to destroy the democratic system. And  we  do

not care whether such subversion comes from the right or

from  the Communists. Any attempt by any group  to  make

Singapore  subservient to any country other than  itself

or  the  Federation  must be resisted  by  extraordinary

powers  if  need  be. There is only  one  way  of  over-throwing a government in a democracy, and that is by its

citizens voting it out of power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. therefore agree that extraordinary powers are

necessary  to preserve democracy, provided they  are  in

the hands of a government freely elected by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Certainly, or any other government.

Only  such a government can be trusted to use the powers



to strengthen and safeguard democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not the position today. It is not a fully

elected Government that will be exercising these  powers

and  the basic situation is unchanged from what  it  was

three years ago when we voted against this Bill. And  so

vote against we still will.

supported.  Perhaps by this means they hope  to  achieve

the  preservation of the security of their own political

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar points out that the

Government is breaking its promises and indulges  in  an

elaborate  argument  as  to  why  the  P.A.P. is  doing

precisely the same thing. For our part, we still  regret

that  our amendment of three years ago was not accepted,

namely, that the Bill should come up for review  once  a

year  instead of after three years. It would  have  been

interesting   to  see  the  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

very  deeply  surprised that the Labour Front  Coalition

Government  have had to ask this House for an  extension

of  one  year  for  the Preservation of Public  Security

Ordinance.  After going through the speech made  by  the

Chief  Minister - he  was  the  Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare  then - can I have your permission, Sir, to  refer

to  what  he said in the Hansard, Vol. 1, No.  14  dated

21st  September, 1955, col. 748? The Chief Minister said

that  on that day he was one of the Members who  sat  on

the Labour Front Four-Year Programme and that it was  he

who   was   most  insistent  in  wanting  the  Emergency

Regulations  repealed because it was felt, at  the  time

when   they  were  considering  the  question   of   the

Preservation of Public Security Bill, that the situation

in  Singapore  did  not warrant a continuance  of  these

unnecessary and repressive laws. And he went on to  say,

Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we were returned to power, I was still of the

mind  that  we  should  have the  Emergency  Regulations

repealed, but in May."



<br><br>just  one month after they were returned to power,  Sir,

his friends the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is quoting, I

suggest he read the actual words he is quoting.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I thank you for your guidance, Sir, I

will go through the sentence.

over  there, not all may be, but our friends over there,

with  their  friends in the Bus Workers'  Union  and  in

other unions, were responsible for the riots of May 12th

and  responsible  for  the deaths of  so  many  innocent

people."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  after  reading  that speech,  I  feel  that  this

extension  of  the  Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance is not necessary. More than three years  have

passed since he made that speech, and I personally feel

that  the  present  situation  does  not  justify   the

extension of the Ordinance for another year. The Labour

Front  want this extension. For what? For a display  of

their  powers, that they can arrest people and imprison

or  detain  them  without trial. Sir, I still  remember

distinctly that the Chief Minister himself went to  the

Outram  Road  Prison  and  released  the  students  and

workers.  I  refer to the New Year and Hari  Raya  Puasa

when the detainees were released. They were allowed  to

have  three  days' freedom to visit their families.  If

they  are  dangerous  people  charged  with  subversive

activities, I cannot understand why we must grant  them

this  short spell of freedom. To allow them three days'

freedom  simply  shows that these  people  are  not  as

dangerous  as  the Government picture  them.  They  are

being imprisoned at the whims and fancies of the Labour

Front Coalition Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also refer to the detention of the Principal of

Chung  Cheng School. What crime has he committed? There

are  so  many others who were detained. Sir,  if  these

people  were to be punished or deported, it  should  be

done  by due process of law and in accordance with  the

principles of fairness and justice, and they should not

be  detained  and  then released  at  the  pleasure  of

Government. If they are really Communists, detain them.

Why  allow  them this freedom of three  days  to  visit



their families? If they are really bad people, in three

hours they can do a lot of damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel, Sir, that these arbitrary powers

of  arrest  and detention without trial of  people  who

have  the courage to criticise the Government bring  to

mind  the  methods used in the Communist  countries  to

eliminate their enemies. The children and dependants of

these  poor  people who have been detained, through  no

fault of their own, have suffered intolerable hardship,

anxieties  and cruelties. Have the Government  pondered

for  one little moment what anxieties they have  caused

them? I feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



that  this Bill, or this weapon of arbitrary powers  of

arrest and detention without trial, in the hands of the

Government  is,  if misused, against the  principle  of

freedom-freedom  of speech, freedom of association  and

expression - because   this   Bill   seeks   to   curtail

individual  freedom.  To give this  power  again  to  a

tottering Government is one action in which I will have

no part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London to talk about Merdeka. We want to

be free from the shackles of colonialism and we want to

have a free and democratic way of life. Is this another

thing to be introduced here? I can assure you that I am

dead  against the Communists and against the action  of

the  Chief  Minister  in  giving  them  a  three  days'

holiday. But to treat innocent people like that and  go

to the prison to show them to the parents is to display

his  own powers. I will object to that, because I  feel

that  these  people  have been arrested  on  trumped-up

charges   and  have  been  imprisoned  without   trial.

Probably  they  have been tortured, as the  Member  for



Queenstown has said, or beaten up. This sort  of  thing

really reminds me of the methods of the Communists. All

men  are  created equal and by this Bill the Government

is  using  the  power  to eliminate  their  enemies.  I

therefore oppose the extension of this Bill for another

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unless any other hon. Member wishes to

speak? Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br>12.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

as we grow older and older and as the Members of this

Assembly become more and more learned in their ways of

representing the people of Singapore, we find

irresponsible people becoming more and more

responsible, and then we have the sad spectacle of

responsible people becoming more and more irresponsible

as the time draws near to the general elections. We

find Members who belonged to a Party resigning and

walking over to the other side, the Opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



Benches.  We  find  Members  of  one  political   Party

speaking  at variance with the policy of the Party.  We

also  find Members of one Party who are proud to  claim

that  they  are left, and anyone who is more left  than

they must be either Communists or mad democrats. It now

behooves me to reply to all the charges which have been

made  by irresponsible people who put up a pretence  of

being  responsible, and by responsible people who  have

now become irresponsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think I should reply to the charges

of  the  last speaker, the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru.

He says that the Government use its arbitrary powers to



arrest  its  political opponents. Yet  I  think  in  my

opening speech I gave an account of the arrests and  of

the  connections  the detainees had with  the  People's

Action Party. The Party that was most concerned did not

stand  up  and say that the arrests and the  detentions

were wrong. Yet out of the mouth of the hon. Member for

Tiong  Bahru he now says that the Government  has  done

this  thing  in  order to silence political  opponents.

Surely  he  must  have realised by  now  that  if  this



Government had not been firm, if my colleagues had  not

dared to sacrifice their own security and run the  risk

of  being assassinated, he would not have been able  to

sit  here and enjoy the freedom that we are at  present

enjoying because of the actions of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he asks, "Why did I allow these detainees to go

home  and  visit their parents, their wives  and  their

children?"  Surely, Sir, I am very human, if  the  hon.

Member  is not. When the families came to see me,  when

they  cried. I really cried with them. When  they  were

sorrowful,  I  too was sorrowful. When they  said  that

their husbands were taken away, I looked at my wife and

thought, "If her husband were taken away, how would she

feel?" When they said that the children were denied the

loving  care of their fathers who were detained by  the

Government, I looked at my children and said, "Although

your  father is not detained, yet you do not  see  your

father



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



because  of the work that he has to do for the public."

Yet  because  I  showed  some  human  understanding  by

allowing  detainees to rejoin their parents  for  three

days  during  Chinese New Year - that is the custom - I  am

now  accused  by  the hon. Member for  Tiong  Bahru  of

playing with politics, playing with the freedom of  the

people who have been detained, and he charged that they

were my political opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the Government does - if we detain them,

we  are  accused  of  taking action  against  political

opponents;  if we release them even for a few  days  to

rejoin  their families, we are accused of  running  the

risk  of allowing these subversive elements to go back

into  circulation  and  contaminating  the  people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the three members of the People's

Action  Party. The fourth member who is still in Changi

Prison  has  not been named by them. It is indeed  most

significant; whereas the Independent Members named them

as their honourable comrade and colleague. Indeed it is

very wonderful, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have the members of the People's Action Party

been  saying? This law is all right, if we operate  it.

This  law is not all right, because the other  side  is



operating it. We will support any such law because  the

situation  in the Federation demands it, but we  cannot

support  it  now  because it is still  a  semi-colonial

administration that is running it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is just saying to their

comrades, "My comrades, today I must resist, because  I

have  an  excuse to resist the three colonial officials

here;   but  tomorrow  we  want  to  merge   with   the

Federation, so I therefore cannot resist. So  you  must

please understand my reasons. Let us still continue  to

be  friends." That is not the way to carry on. One must

have  the courage of one's convictions and say  whether

it  is right or it is wrong at any particular time. Why

should  it  be wrong now but right tomorrow?  They  are

really going to vote against this, so they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



said,  but  their leader has not said it. Their  leader

has  said so many things that he has even confused  the

hon. Member for Paya Lebar who has complimented him  on

his change of stand. Then the hon. Member for Sembawang

stood up and said, "We oppose the Bill." There you are!

The English language is so difficult to understand.  If

one  knows  how to twist it about, one keeps the  other

side  confused. Now they say they are going  to  oppose

it.  Yet they say, if they are going to come into power

ultimately - well, it is but right they come  in  if  the

public do vote them in - they are prepared to use what we

have  introduced and, now seek to extend for one  year;

they  are prepared to use what they do not want  us  to

use. What strange reasoning!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that I seek to claim credit for having saved

them from being choked by the Communists. I did not say

so. All I said was that out of so many people arrested,

there  were so many connected with the People's  Action

Party.  There were so many confessions from people  who

said  that they were instructed to penetrate  into  the

P.A.P. and use it for Communist ends. What do I want to

claim  credit for, from the Party that is on the  other

side?  I claim no credit for it, nor do I claim  credit

from  the people of Singapore for having done my  duty.

It  is my duty and I will do it irrespective of whether



the hon. Members of the P.A.P. say whether we did right

or  we did wrong. They claim that we played an election

trick  on  the  public, and the hon. Member  for  Tiong

Bahru read out my speech which I made three years  ago.

It   is  true,  Sir,  when  we  contested  the  general



elections  in  1955  we said that we  must  remove  all

repressive laws. But when we got into power  and  found

that  the situation was so bad as to demand the  remedy

of preventive detention, we were not afraid; we are not

moral cowards; we went straight ahead and did our duty.

We  did it and we are proud that we have done it. It is



because of what we have done that Singapore is what  it

is today. The hon. Members of the P.A.P. would not have

been here to crow about their success if action had not

been taken against those that sought to choke them  and

to capture the P.A.P. for their own ends.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they accuse me again of why I released Dr

Chuang  Chu Lin, why Linda Chen was released;  why  Mr

Lim Kean Chye was allowed to come back and yet detained

by  the  police. I must be an evil man  for  doing  all

this, thoroughly evil, so I must be the target not only

of  the  Communists but also a target of the  so-called

freedom-loving  democrats that are now  in  the  P.A.P.

Sir,  when  the  ship  was  ready  to  take  away   the



banishees, we went through every banishee's case to see

whether  or  not we could show leniency and whether  or

not  the security of Singapore would be jeopardised  by

the  release of any banishees, because we are human and

we  can  appreciate  and understand the  sufferings  of

these people. We are now accused of having released Dr

Chuang  whose  release  we now  believe  is  no  longer

prejudicial to the security of Singapore. The same case

applied to Linda Chen. As regards Lim Kean Chye,  I  am

indeed surprised, Sir, that this should have come  from

a very learned member of the Bar. Under the Immigration

Ordinance, any British subject born in Malaya cannot be

denied entry and to that extent Mr Lim Kean Chye could

not  be  denied entry, not that he was given  an  entry

permit  to  enter Singapore. But his sponsor  had  been

advised  by me unofficially that because Lim Kean  Chye

escaped at the time when a warrant of arrest was issued

against  him, there was every possibility  that  if  he

came  back to Singapore, he would be detained.  I  told

that  to  the  sponsor. And yet  the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar would like to twist it round  and  round

and  say,  how steady the P.A.P. are and how weak-kneed

the  Labour Front is. He says that by doing  all  these

things   the  Labour  Front  is  committing   political

suicide. Sir, to him the Party stands first. To me  and

my  colleagues  the country stands  first,  be  it  the

suicide of the Labour Front or not. The security of the

country,  including the security of those that  sit  on

the other side, comes first in our work. If we have  to

do  drastic and unpopular things in order to look after

the  security of the citizens of Singapore, we will  do

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Farrer Park claimed the people

in jail as his comrades and when they were released,

this  side  would be in jail. He thought this  is  a

sort  of game - "When I am out, he is in. When  he  is

out,  I  am  in."  But I can assure him,  Sir,  that

nothing  is going to deter me from doing my duty.  I

have  received a number of death threats and I  have

even  been threatened face to face. Yet I  say,  "To

hell  with you!" I am sorry, Sir. "Out you go!"  Lim

Yew Hock is nobody. But Singapore counts, and it  is

indeed  a  pleasure to lay down one's  life  in  the

service of one's country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid, Sir, that some hon. Members do not

understand why the Bill is an amending Bill. We have

to use this method of achieving the extension of one

year.   If  we  do  not  get  this  extension,   the

Preservation  of  Public Security  Ordinance  lapses

this  month and I am sure the hon. Members who  will

be  wanting to vote against the Bill would  then  be

pleased  to  see all those comrades of  theirs,  now

claimed to be theirs, released.

Opposition,  would like the Government to  bear  the

brunt  of it. We went on exercising the powers under

the  P.P.S.O. and in their heart of hearts they say,

"Well  done, well done, well done! Thank  God!"  But

then  they  come  and say, "You, the  Government  of

Singapore, you the Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock, you

have    done    wrong.   You   have   done    things

undemocratically!" We are used to it,  Sir.  We  can

<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the Bill which was debated this morning by

the  House, the object of the present amending Bill  is

to  extend  the  life  of the parent  Ordinance  for  a

further 12 months with the intention that it should  be

reviewed  at  the  end of that period by  the  incoming

Government.  When the parent Ordinance was  enacted  in

1955,  it  consisted of six Parts  and  in  moving  the

Second  Reading my predecessor expressed the hope  that

at  the  end  of  three years its provisions  would  no

longer be required. In the view of the Government, this

hope  has  not  been  realised and  there  is  still  a

continuing  need  for  the  powers  conferred  by  this

Ordinance, both to counter subversive activities  which

still  constitute a threat to Singapore,  and  also  to

counter the potential threat of violence which is still

with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary for me, Sir, to enlarge upon the

subversive  threat  which was fully ventilated  in  the

debate this morning, but the House will wish me to give

some  account of the way in which the powers  conferred

by  Part  VII which was enacted as recently  as  August

this  year  have been exercised. The House will  recall

that,  as  a  result of the initial sweep made  by  the

Police  against  the leaders of active  secret  society

gangs  in  the middle of August, at the time when  Part

VII of the Ordinance was enacted, 73 persons were taken

into   custody.  Of  these  73,  31  were  subsequently

released  and orders of detention were made  by  me  in

respect  of  42.  Since then, partly  as  a  result  of

further information which has become available  to  the

Police,  orders have been made by me in  a  further  18

cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Committees provided for in section 51 of

the  Ordinance have been constituted and I should  like

to  express  my gratitude to the members of the  public

who  have  accepted duty on these Committees. Two  such

Committees  have  been  appointed  to  deal  with   the

substantial  number of cases to be  reviewed  and  each

Committee  is constituted with a Chairman, an alternate

Chairman and a panel of members, with a provision  that

the  Committee shall normally sit with the Chairman and

two  members  but  that the proceedings  shall  not  be

invalidated  by the absence of one of the two  members.

These provisions were incorporated in the Criminal  Law



Advisory  Committee  Rules  which  were  made  on  30th

September  and  it  is hoped by these  means  that  the

review  of  all the outstanding cases will be completed

as  soon as possible. The Committees are now sitting to

consider  the  references made  to  them  by  me  under

section 48 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was not to be expected that the powers

provided  by this Part of the Ordinance and the  action

taken  to  exercise  them would lead  to  an  immediate

cessation  of all secret society and gangster activity,

nor  indeed  has  this proved to be the  case.  It  did

initially  lead to a substantial drop in the  scale  of

secret  society activity and more particularly  in  the

seriousness  of  the  incidents so classified.  In  the

month  of  September,  there  were  in  fact  26   such

incidents  but  all these were in the nature  of  minor

affrays  arising from spontaneous quarrels rather  than

the   large-scale   planned  gang  fights   which   had

previously  represented such a  threat  to  law-abiding

members of the public. There was however one murder  in

September and, as the House will be aware, two  further

murders of a similar kind have taken place in the  last

few  days.  Both these murders were of a similar  type,

deliberate and vicious attacks and part of the  warfare

between the two main groups of secret societies. In the

murder  at  the Great World on Monday night,  there  is

reason  to believe that the gangsters responsible  came

from a different area, since a number of those in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



the  Great  World area are on the Police 'Wanted'  list

and  have gone into hiding. It would be idle to pretend

that  the  powers conferred by this Ordinance  will  in

themselves prevent further crimes of this kind  but  it

may  prove  necessary  to use  them  more  widely  than

hitherto. Up to now, in accordance with the undertaking

which  I  gave to the House in introducing the Bill  in

August,  these  powers have been used very  selectively

and  only  against those in respect of whom  there  has

been  abundant  evidence to show that they  are  either

headmen  of the particular society operating  in  their

area  or  leading  fighters  who  have  been  the  most

prominent both in committing extortion and in promoting

the  clashes  between one society and  another.  I  can

assure   the  House  that  I  have  examined  all   the

applications put up to me for orders under  section  47

of  the Ordinance with the greatest care, and in  every

case  where I have made an order - always of course  with

the  concurrence of the Attorney-General - there has been

ample  evidence to show the leading part played by  the

detainees in these gangster activities. In most  cases,

Sir, the detainees themselves have admitted having been

secret  society fighters though they have at  the  same

time claimed that they have ceased their secret society

activity some time previously. In all cases, there  has

been   evidence   from  members  of   the   public   to

substantiate  the  case against them  and  the  current

activities  of  extortion and violence for  which  they

have been responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, it must be recognised that this

measure, which has the effect of removing some  of  the

leaders  of  these  gangs  out  of  circulation  for  a

temporary  period  of time, can in  itself  be  only  a

palliative, and what I regard as the most important aim

and  object  of these measures is to give  a  breathing

space  to allow time to build up among members  of  the

public  confidence in order that they can become  freed

from  the terrorism and intimidation to which they have

become  accustomed, so that they will be ready to  give

the necessary co-operation to the Police which will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



ultimately  once again enable this type of  lawlessness

to  be  controlled by the normal judicial processes  of

law.   There  are  two  stages  in  building  up   this

confidence.  The  first  is to induce  members  of  the

public to give voluntarily to the Police information in

their   possession  regarding  the  identity  and   the

activities of these thugs and gangsters who  have  been

intimidating  them.  The  second  stage  is  to  induce

members   of   the  public  who  have  such  first-hand

information to be ready to come forward and testify  in

Court  when  those  responsible  are  arranged  on  the

appropriate charges. We cannot expect to achieve  those

two  stages in a very short time but there are at least

some  signs  that progress is being made in  the  first

stage. More information is being given to the Police by

members  of  the  public, particularly in  relation  to

secret stores of weapons and matters of that kind which

assist  the  preventive side of the Police war  against

these gangs, and there have been more indications  that

members  of  the public are ready to come  forward  and

give  the  Police,  albeit  in confidence,  information

regarding  the identity of the individuals responsible.

I  must  however  emphasise  that  in  this  matter  we



undoubtedly  have  a  very long  way  to  go.  In,  for

instance,  the  case of the first of  the  two  murders

three  days  ago I have referred to, there  can  be  no

doubt that that vicious and brutal attack took place in

the  hearing  if  not in sight of quite a  considerable

number of persons in that area, but no one attempted to

give any information to the Police and it was not until

the  Police themselves were rung up by the Fire Brigade

who  had  been  called upon to provide an ambulance  to

remove the victim that they received any information of

the  crime. On the other side of the picture, one  very

encouraging instance did occur recently when a group of

ten  shopkeepers  from a certain area  arrived  at  the

C.I.D. in  a  body to inform the Police officer  there

that  they  were  prepared to give the  names  of  nine

persons responsible for extorting money from themselves

and  the  hawkers in their area. On the  basis  of  the

information they were prepared to give, it was possible

to  take  action to detain four members of the gang - the

headman, the assistant headman and two of the leading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



fighters, who were so identified, and there has in fact

been  no  further secret society activity in that  area

since.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, Sir, in moving the Second Reading of the

amending  Bill in August that I hoped the  exercise  of

these powers would act as a catalytic agent in inducing

the  public  to free themselves from the  terrorism  to

which  they  had been subjected and to give  increasing

cooperation to the Police to enable the latter to carry

out their task. I sincerely hope that this process will

continue and will be accelerated and that once  members

of  the public realise that the remedy lies largely  in

their  own  hands  and  that  provided  they  are   all

collectively prepared to give the necessary assistance,

the    risk   they   run   of   subsequent   individual

victimisation from other members of the gang  still  at

large is substantially reduced; and in the long run,  I

hope that they will be ultimately ready to come forward

not  only with information to the Police but also  with

information which they are prepared to repeat  in  open

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is one last aspect of the matter to

which  I  would like to refer. In moving  the  amending

Bill  in  August,  I did mention that  one  distressing

aspect of the current situation was the extent to which

young  boys at school had become associated with  these

activities.  In examining the case records  which  have

been put up to me for orders under this Ordinance, in a

large number of cases I have found that the individuals

concerned  have  in  fact been  associated  with  these

activities  from  a  very young  age - in  some  cases

perhaps  14  and  15 years old - and I  would  urge  that

parents  and  school masters should do everything  they

can  to  discourage  boys in their  charge  from  being

caught up in these activities. At the present time,  we

have arranged for a number of senior Police officers to

go  round and give talks in the schools with the object

of  trying  to  discourage this type of affiliation  by

young boys with the secret societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is against this background and to provide the

necessary breathing space to which I have referred that

I ask the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



House to give this Bill a Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just a few

words  to say. The long and dismal account of the state

of  affairs which the Chief Secretary has just narrated

must be one which must lie heavily on the conscience of

every person responsible for the future good government

and happiness of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little to be said on the Bill itself. We

can give ourselves more and more powers but we have got

somehow  to  break through this ring. It is  a  vicious

circle.  The people are scared because they cannot  get

protection. Because they are scared and do not give the

information, nothing can be done and the terror mounts.

I  do not think the use of counter-terror is the answer



to  this sort of situation, but I do believe that it is

not  possible  for  the Police to be  ignorant  of  the

ringleaders  of the secret societies. In  fact,  in  my

contacts  with the Police in the Courts, it has  always

been  my  impression that they knew very well who  were

the men behind it all, but that they were unable to get

their  hands on them. I hope by the time they pass  the

special provisions contained in section 47, the  moving

spirits  could be successfully curbed. I do  not  know,

Sir,  whether  in  fact  we  were  over-optimistic   in

believing that the Police are all that omniscient,  but

I  emphatically state that I refuse to believe that the

Secret  Society Sub-branch of the Police  can  be  that

ignorant of what goes on. There are men there who  have

been  in and out of this "twilight world" which, so  to

speak, adjoins the public and the underworld so that it

is  not possible for them not to know who are the  men.

If  these  powers  have to be used a  little  bit  more



widely   than - as  the  Chief  Secretary   said - at   the

beginning, then I am quite sure there is nobody in this

House  who is going to oppose it. But what we have  got

to  do  is  to  stop this reign of terror where  people

believe  that  it is more profitable to  stand  by  and

watch murder being done, than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



to  inform  the  Police  because in  that  alternative,

something worse may happen to the informers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly now, it is not a question of the

Legislature, because we can give no wider  powers  than

what  we have given, and it is up to the administrators

and  the  policemen - in this case,  the  secret  society

experts - to use them effectively. I sincerely hope  that

when  the time comes to review the position in the  not

too distant future, we will have a much more optimistic

account  of  the situation than the one  we  have  just

received.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if one really

has  the  welfare of the people of Singapore at  heart,

one  should  think  very seriously  of  the  sufferings

caused  to the people living in the area between Lorong

3,  Geylang,  and Paya Lebar and other  ganglands.  The

Hon, the Chief Secretary has tried to give us a  clear

picture of the situation. He is asking for more  powers

than he already has.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem today is not one of giving the Police

more legislative powers. The problem is confined to two

points.  The  first  is:  who is  going  to  solve  the

problem? The second is: how do you exercise the  powers

given?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Press report dated Tuesday, 7th October, 1958

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A man was murdered and two others seriously injured

in the Great World Park in Singapore last night - shortly

after  detectives  had  withdrawn  after  investigating

reports of a gathering of gangsters in the vicinity."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member please identify the

paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> The paper is the Straits Times of

Tuesday, 7th October, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to draw the attention of this House to

that  phrase  "- shortly after detectives had  withdrawn

after investigating reports of a gathering of gangsters

in  the  vicinity." Sir, we know that this was followed

by  a  murder in Silat Road. The House should take note

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



within  48  hours  there  were  two  murders  and   two

seriously  wounded and yet the Chief Secretary  is  now

asking for wider powers than he already has because  he

cannot   cope  with  the  situation.  Regarding   these

incidents, Sir, I want to bring to the attention of the

House  the bold and daring nature of these gang fights.

Sir, on the same day, it was reported:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An eyewitness told the Straits Times: 'I saw a blood-spattered man climb over the three-foot high enclosure

with his assailants at his heels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man collapsed in the middle of the rink. His

pursuers  stood on the concrete enclosure and  threw  a

barrage  of bottles at the man lying prostrate  on  the

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making sure that their victim had had the worst

they could offer, the men ran away.'"

<br><br>Sir,  I  think there must have been at least a thousand

people at the Great World Amusement Park that night and

yet  this  murder took place in spite of the fact  that

the  Police  had  prior information of a  gathering  of

gangsters in the area. The Police officers had been  to

the place and made investigations but immediately after

they left, this murder took place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it should be realised that the

legislation of wider powers by this House means nothing

in  the  eyes  of  delinquents and  members  of  secret

societies.  It is surely a waste of time  if  we  think

that  by  just  passing one piece of legislation  after

another  we  can  put  a stop to these  secret  society

activities. Now, another report reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"SECRET SOCIETY WAR: 'MORE BLOODSHED' WARN THE POLICE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Eu Cheow Eang, the Police Secretary, commenting on the murder in the Great World Park on Monday night

said: 'Blood has been let out. It will continue to flow

as  long as the 08 and 24 secret society groups are  at

war.'"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that the same newspaper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> It is from the Straits Times of

Wednesday, 8th October, 1958.



Sir,  the Police have admitted that as long as  the  08

and  24  groups continue their war, there is no way  of

stopping it. Now, our Chief Secretary comes before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



us  to ask for an extension of the Bill for another  12

months for him to combat the gangster activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that it is high time now for us to make a

review of the whole situation, in view of the fact that

within  48 hours there were two murders and two injured

in  spite  of prior investigations having been  carried

out  by Mr Brian Goodrich, the Assistant Commissioner,

C.I.D.,  and  the  team  of officers  from  the  Secret

Societies  Branch  and  Homicide  Squad,  C.I.D.,   had

visited the Park afterward. Sir, do you not think  that

now  is  the time for the Hon. the Chief Secretary,  to

take  immediate action to review the whole case and  to

see  whether Mr Goodrich is efficient to carry out the

work or not? A few weeks ago, I read the paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Goodrich said, 'Singapore is a city of cowards.'"



<br><br>At  that  time when he issued that statement, I thought

he  was probably right. Now I think the cowards are not

the  people of Singapore but Mr Goodrich himself is  a

coward.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is, of course,

addressing  the Chair and the tone of his voice  rather

frightens the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of the so-called "Operation Dagger" and

the  extraordinary  powers given  to  the  Police,  the

situation   is  deteriorating  day  by  day.  Therefore

something  must  be done. I think the  Hon, the  Chief

Secretary  should state whether he has full  confidence

in them still. If not, it is high time that they should

be reorganised.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have, of course, given the hon.

Member a hint. If he does not take the hint, I have  to

act otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat the same old things I said on

the  subject of how to combat the gangsters. First, the

Minister  for  Welfare should provide more  employment.

Second,  there should be more 'vocational' schools  for



those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



over-aged children - especially for those whose ages are

between 14 to 16 - who failed their examinations and were

required to leave school. Third, we should try to  find

some  isolated island and turn it into a rehabilitation

centre or even into a so-called forced labour camp.  We

have  to do something. We must try to convert and train

these  active  members of secret  societies  to  become

useful  citizens.  Fourth, in a city  of  the  size  of

Singapore,  the  Police should create  another  Special

Branch  called  the  Youth Branch  to  deal  only  with

juvenile  delinquents with the cooperation of the  many

civic  organisations in Singapore. In other words,  the

Police should think of every preventive measure to  put

a  stop  to those juvenile delinquents from joining  up

with  the  wrong  crowd and getting  themselves  deeply

involved in gangster activities. I sincerely hope  that

the  Hon, the Chief Secretary will consider these  four

points.

contribute to this debate is his usual diatribe against

the C.I.D. The C.I.D. are doing a very difficult job in

very difficult circumstances; they are working day  and

night,  and they are working to protect the members  of

not  very much encouragement to them when they have  to

made by the hon. Member for Changi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have every confidence in Mr Goodrich and in

the  officers working under him, and I know  that  they

are  doing everything that lies within their power. But

as the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)

pointed out, the situation today is a very serious  one

indeed and the powers which are being exercised now, as

I  said in moving the motion, can only be a palliative;

and if the type of crime which we have seen in the last

few  days still continues, those powers, as I forecast,

will have to be more widely used, and I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



give  an  undertaking  to  the  House  that  if  it  is

necessary to do so, they will be so used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point on which I would like to

touch. The hon. Member for Changi, if I understood  him

correctly,  said that the Police had prior  information

of  the  attack which led to the murder  at  the  Great

World Park. I have no information to substantiate  that

statement  and, in fact, all my information is  to  the

contrary.  I  do  not believe that the Police  had  any

prior information whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. [Mr

David].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir  I  have the Governor's  consent  to

proceed  with the Second Reading. I beg to move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to implement the recommendations

of  the Malayan Board of Income Tax to amend the Income

Tax  Ordinance. The opportunity is also taken  to  make

other  minor  amendments. The proposed  amendments  are

incorporated in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 13 of the Income

Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (a) of clause 2 confers exemption on the

official  emoluments of the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong  and

the Raja Permaisuri Agong of the Federation, the Deputy

Supreme  Head  of  the Federation,  and  the  Ruler  or

Governor of any State in the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (b) of clause 2 is designed to bring the

provisions  of  the existing law into accord  with  the

provisions  of  the Consular Conventions Ordinance  and

the  Diplomatic Privileges (Commonwealth Countries  and

Republic of Ireland) Ordinance, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (c) of clause 2 makes amendments

consequential on recent changes in the Constitution  of

local authorities in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As subsection (4) of section 13 of the Ordinance now

stands,  employees of foreign principals  who  exercise

part of the duties of their employment in the course of

a  visit to the Colony are chargeable to Colony tax  on

that  part of the earnings from their employment  which

is  attributable to their period of employment  in  the

Colony.  It  has  been represented that such  employees

wishing  to  visit the Colony in the  course  of  their

employment may be deterred by the present imposition of

tax, and paragraph (d) of clause 2 is designed to allow

a  visit  or visits of up to 60 days' duration  in  the

basis   period  for  any  year  of  assessment   before

liability attaches to their earnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is recommended by the Malayan Board of

Income  Tax  follows  the usual form  of  exemption  in

Double Taxation Arrangements with foreign countries. In

such  circumstances, while there is provision to exempt

technicians and managers from payment of income tax  in

the  case  of a film company operating in this country,

but the motion picture artists are not exempted. It  is

considered  desirable to encourage  film  companies  to

come  to this country to make films, and as these  film

artists  form  an  integral part, this  Government  has

decided  that the exemption should be extended to  such

artists.  I propose, Sir to move an amendment  to  this

effect at Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 18A of the Ordinance provides for allowances

for  capital  expenditure on plantations based  on  the

Mudie  Mission  recommendations that  all  new  capital

expenditure on. Plantations should be written  off  for

income tax purposes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



over  a  maximum  period of 10 years. As  the  law  now

stands, all sums recovered on the sale or transfer of a

plantation  require  to  be taken  into  account  under

subsection  3  (c)  up to the amount of  the  aggregate

allowance claimed and allowed under section  18A.  It

has   been  represented  that  allowances  claimed  and

allowed in respect of capital expenditure on that  part

of a plantation which is not sold or transferred should

be  disregarded and that recoveries to  be  taken  into

account  under subsection 3 (c) should not  exceed  the

allowances  claimed  and  allowed  in  respect  of  the

portion  in  which  the  interest  has  been  sold   or

transferred. 'The amendment of section 18A in clause  3

seeks  to ensure that recoveries in respect of  capital

expenditure  shall  be  deemed to  be  income  for  the

purposes  of  subsection 3 (c) of  the  Ordinance  only

where  relief  has been allowed under  the  section  in

respect of the relevant capital expenditure. It is also

proposed   that  recoveries  in  respect   of   capital

expenditure shall be deemed to be income chargeable  to

tax  only  after the point is reached when the  capital

expenditure  originally incurred or  the  consideration

paid  for  such expenditure has been recovered  by  the

taxpayer  in the form of allowances under the  section.

This  amendment will be operative from the date section



18A came into operation, namely, 1st January, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 20 of the Ordinance provides for balancing

allowances  and  charges  in respect  of  machinery  or

plant. Experience has shown that the circumstances  are

too  broadly  defined and are likely to  give  rise  to

abuses. It is proposed in clause 4 to provide a broader

definition  of  the events giving rise to  a  balancing

allowance or balancing charge. The clause also seeks to

provide  that  where a property in machinery  or  plant

passes  by gift or by sale at less than its open market

price, or is sold after the permanent discontinuance of

the trade, profession or business, for the purposes  of

computing any balancing allowance or balancing  charge,

it shall be deemed to have been sold at its open market

value  at the date of the transfer of ownership  or  at

the  date  of permanent discontinuance as the case  may

be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 29 of the

Ordinance to clarify the procedure for determining  the

gross  amount of the income from a dividend  which  has

been  paid  without  deduction of tax.  The  difference

between  the gross and the net amounts of any  dividend

is  deemed  to be tax borne by the shareholder  and  is

available  for  relief or repayment in  his  hands.  No

additional  burden would be laid on the taxpayer  since

difference  between  gross and net amounts  represented

tax  available  for repayment or set off under  section

46.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As subsection (1) of section 44 of the Ordinance now

stands,  dividends paid by companies which are resident

in  the Colony may be paid either without deduction  of

tax  or under deduction of tax at any rate up to 30 per

cent. Practical difficulties have arisen in determining

the   tax  deductible  from  dividends  paid  by   such

companies and the proposed amendment in clause 6 of the

Bill  is designed to allow the deduction of tax at  the

rate of 30 per cent only. The right of companies to pay

dividends without deduction of tax is not accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 68 of the

Ordinance   to  place  upon  employers  the   statutory

obligation  to  advise the Comptroller  when  employees

enter  or  leave  their service, or  leave  the  Colony

temporarily  for a period exceeding three  months.  The

principal  object of this amendment is to  ensure  that

the  Comptroller  is  given sufficient  notice  of  the

departure   of   employees  from  the   Colony   either

permanently  or  for a lengthy period,  in  order  that

steps  may  be taken before their departure to  compute

and collect the tax payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been represented that sections 84 and 93 of the

Ordinance  are difficult to construe and to  reconcile.

It  is  proposed  to amend in clause  9  of  the  Bill,



section 84, by clarifying the circumstances in which an

assessment  becomes  final  and  conclusive,   and   by

precluding  the  revision of any final  and  conclusive

assessment under the provisions of section  93  of  the

Ordinance.  The amendment in clause 10 of the  Bill  is

designed  to amend section 93 by making it  merely  the

authority for the Comptroller to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



repay  tax  when  the  greater amount  has  been  paid

directly  or by deduction than is charged in  a  final

and  conclusive assessment or when an exempt  taxpayer

has suffered by deduction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in clause 11 of the Bill to provide

that taxpayers may claim relief at any time within six

years of the end of the relative year of assessment in

respect  of  an error or mistake made in a  return  of

statement   for   the  purposes  of   assessment.   To

discourage  frivolous appeals, where  the  Comptroller

refuses  to  admit  a  claim  to  relief,  the  clause

requires  the  sum  of $250 to be deposited  with  the

Clerk  to the Board of Review before an appeal can  be

entertained, but provides for the refund of the  whole

sum  in  the event of the appeal being allowed by  the

Board.  Where an appeal is unsuccessful, the Board  is

given discretionary powers to decide whether the whole

or any part should be refunded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other minor amendments most of

which are included in the Schedule to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, out of the improvements

made in the Income Tax Ordinance with the introduction

of  this Bill, I would like to refer in particular  to

clause 2 (d), a matter on which I asked questions last

year,  and  there  is  now an  exemption  of  tax  for

visitors  entering this country for a  period  of  two

months, and I think, as I stated a year ago, that that

was an extremely, restrictive clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome further the amendment to place motion

picture  artists in this category as opposed to  stage

and  radio artists, musicians, athletes, and so on.  I

think  that this is an important point, be, cause  the

point has been made, and notice has been taken by  the

Government, that motion picture artists who come  into

this   country  to  make  pictures  are   not   public

entertainers in this country in the ordinary sense  of

the  'word,  in  that  they come  here  only  to  make

pictures. I think this country has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



been  at  a  great disadvantage in the past in  missed

opportunities  because  this  was  not  provided   for

before.  I  know of a number of cases where production

companies  that  wished to make  pictures  here  which

would  portray  Singapore and the  Federation  on  the

world's  screens  had  been prevented  from  doing  so

because  of  Income Tax restrictions.  I  know  of  an

American  company  wishing to spend something  between

three  and four million dollars in this country making

a  picture next year which would not only be a welcome

revenue to Singapore and the Federation but also would

mean that our country and the Federation will go on to

the  world's screens in the way that Japan is  put  on

the  world's screens today in so many films. I  think,

just  as  Japan has had great advantages in attracting

tourists  to  that country, that we shall now  attract

more  tourists for the same reason. For these reasons,

I   very  much  welcome  the  broad-minded  change  in

Government policy shown on this particular clause.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 56, 57 and 58 of the Merchant Shipping

Ordinance  originally intended to protect  our  seamen,

have  now  in  practice come to militate against  their

obtaining employment. These sections require  that  the

Master  of a foreign ship must deposit a bond  of  $50,

find  an  acceptable resident of Singapore as a  surety

and enter into a crew agreement before the Port Officer

prior  to signing on a seaman who is a British  subject

or  a British protected person. These requirements were

legislated in days when it was not uncommon for seamen,

signed off at a foreign port, to be stranded there  and

were  designed to provide a protection against  such  a

disability.  But times have changed and  most  maritime

nations have now provision for the repatriation of  all

seamen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



signed  off in foreign ports. In consequence, what  was

intended  as a safeguard has now become a deterrent  to

employment, since Masters tend to sign on alien  seamen

in  Singapore  rather  than go  through  the  procedure

required  for  seamen  who  are  British  subjects  and

British  protected  persons. This situation  cannot  be

allowed  to  go  on by the Government  and,  therefore,

since  the  repatriation  of the  seamen  is  generally

secured  by national laws in most countries, it  is  no

longer  necessary  to discriminate in  the  methods  of

signing on, especially where such methods are likely to

lose  employment in favour of alien seamen. This  Bill,

therefore, seeks to remedy this unfavourable  situation

for our seamen, and has the support of the Port Officer

and  of  the Seamen's Registry Board on which both  the

seamen  and  shipowners  are represented.  I  therefore

commend this Bill to hon. Members.

examining  imported  literature has  to  be  considered

against  the statistics of imports. In the  first  nine

months of this year, 14 million copies of no less  than

36,291  publications  printed in the  Chinese  language

sought  importation  into Singapore.  Of  these  36,000

publications,  748  were found to be objectionable  and

were   refused   importation.  These  748   undesirable

publications were the product of 101 Chinese publishing

houses, some situate in the mainland of China and  some

in  Hongkong.  An analysis of these publications  shows

that the great majority emanate from a small number  of

publishing  houses.  Between them, 21  such  publishing

houses were responsible for a total of no less than 502

undesirable publications out of a total of 748.  During

the  same  period 40 gramophone records in the  Chinese

language were refused admittance. All but four of these

emanated from one source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in these circumstances that the Government

is  seeking to amend the existing provision in the  law

to permit the banning of all publications which emanate

from   particular  sources  or  particular   publishing

houses.  As  hon.  Members will be  aware,  this  power

already exists in the Federation of Malaya and has been

exercised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to provide that

the   ban   imposed  on  publications   or   types   of

publications under this section shall also apply to all

translations  of such publications. It is,  of  course,

possible that there will emanate from publishing houses

against  which such a blanket ban has been imposed  the

occasional  innocuous publication for which  import  is

sought.  This contingency is provided for in sub-clause

(4) of clause 3 which enables specific publications  to

be exempted from any such blanket ban.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to add, Sir, that in this matter the

Government has a duty towards the public to prevent the

publication  and  circulation not  only  of  subversive

literature   but  also  of  pornographic  and   obscene

literature. This duty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



is all the more important when it is remembered that  a

high proportion of the population of Singapore today is

of   an   age  at  which  they  are  still  young   and

impressionable and cannot be expected to form a  mature

literary judgment. I should like, therefore, to add  in

conclusion  that the Government has under consideration

at  the  present time whether any further measures  are

necessary  to  control the output  and  circulation  of

harmful   literature,   particularly   the   type    of

publications  deliberately  and  mainly   designed   to

promote sales through their pornographic content.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, it does look very

surprising to see an Opposition Member rise and  second

this  motion. We are very delighted to hear the  speech

just   delivered  by  the  Hon, the  Chief  Secretary,

especially   when  he  touched  on   the   point   that

undesirable   publications   should   include   obscene

literature.  That,  I think, is one step  more  towards

realisation of the controversial problem that faces us - why, on the one hand in the eyes of the Government, the

so-called    "progressive"   literature    is    termed

subversive, but, on the other hand, the Government have

allowed  obscene and harmful literature to pour  in  as

well  as allow it to be published in this country.  So,

while  extending my warm congratulations to  the  Chief

Secretary  on his speech, I would ask him to take  note

of  the  need  to  ban  as  much  obscene  and  harmful

literature as he can in this country.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in so far as the

Chief  Secretary  said that this Bill was  intended  to

shut  out,  shall  we  say,  non-political  undesirable

publications, I think nobody will quarrel with him. But

I  would  like  to  make  this observation  as  regards

political  tracts.  I believe we can  broadly  classify

these  political tracts into two categories: one, those

which are obviously designed for propaganda and do  not

contain  anything  other than a  recital  of  facts  to

glorify



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



the  Communist  bloc; two, those tracts which  are  the

theoretical  and  ideological  dissertations   of   the

Communist bloc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious position which we have today in

Singapore - and  to  a  certain  extent   also   in   the

Federation - is  that  whilst we can purchase  all  these

books  and  tracts  in the English language,  the  same

books  and  tracts in the Chinese language are  banned.

Sir,  you can go to any reputable bookshop in town  and



buy Mao Tse-tung's books in English in four volumes.  I

have  often wondered, Sir, what would be the effect  if

one  were  to  translate them and  print  them  in  the

Chinese  language.  I am quite sure  it  would  not  be

within  the Undesirable Publications Ordinance  because

they  are  published locally. I do not  know  if  steps

would be taken to outlaw such books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, however, that unless we are prepared

to  open  up the minds of our people to free discussion

and  ventilation  of ideas, unless we  try  to,  so  to

speak,   inoculate  the  intellectual  sector  of   the

population from succumbing to these ideas - if we try  to

insulate it -  I do not think, first, that we can succeed

completely,  and  secondly, that  it  is  in  any  case

desirable, because it means that we are admitting  that

the ideas which are being propagated are beyond refute.

and therefore we do not want the minds of the people to



be turned to these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seriously ask the Government to consider this point,

because  as  time  goes on and a rising  generation  of

Chinese-educated  intellectuals comes  into  being,  we

have to cease pretending that China does not exist.  In

fact, nobody pretends it any more, not even Mr Dulles.

We have to explain to our people why it is - as indeed if



we  hope to sustain the democratic system in Malaya, we

must  explain - that  despite all the material  advances,

all  the  longest rivers and bridges in the world,  the

biggest output of textiles in the world, our system  in

so  far  as  we are concerned in Malaya is worth  while

continuing  and  sustaining;  that  despite  all  these

"great  and glorious achievements", there are  hundreds

of people who still want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



come  from  China to Malaya for the simple reason  that

life is not quite so bad in Malaya. If you isolate your

intellectuals  from  a  free  and  open  discussion  of

political ideas as such, as distinct from the technique

of  the revolution, the organisational side of it, then

not  only  will  you fail but you will  also  create  a

dangerous situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although we would not seriously quarrel

with  the  intentions of the Government  of  trying  to

prevent immature minds from being overwhelmed by facile

and  cleverly thought-out propaganda, we should at  the

same  time accept the challenge which is all  the  time

there of the ideological battle - that the history of the

world  is not preordained; that in fact it is not  true

that  history has already been written up a  long  time

ago;  that the world is going to be what Marx  said  it

was  going to be; and that if the Americans had let  go

one  big  bomb  in  1947,  something  else  might  have

happened  to the world - and create in our generation  in

Malaya,   men  of  sufficient  intellectual  fibre   to

withstand  the stresses and strains of the  ideological

battle  between  the two power blocs  which,  far  from

becoming  less  acute as time goes on,  appears  to  be

getting   more   and  more  acute  as  the   cold   war

intensifies.

the  context  in  Singapore at the  present  time,  the

context particularly of the matters that were discussed

in  the  debate this morning; and the second  point  is

that  the literature coming from China -  I do not  think

anyway - would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



come  within  the definition of free thought.  I  would

remind  him of the speech made by Mao Tse-tung  in  May

1942  at  a  literary  meeting in  Yenan  in  which  he

finished  up  by  saying, "From now on  literary  works

under the control of the Communist Party will no longer

be  pure  literary works; they will all be  transformed

into political weapons."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the Public

Entertainments  Bill, as contained in  Sessional  Paper

No. L.A. 12 of 1958, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be seen that the Select Committee held

four  meetings  and considered written  representations

received from and heard oral evidence given by a number

of  interested bodies. A number of amendments have been

made  to the text of the Bill and these amendments  are

incorporated  in the Bill appearing as Appendix  II  of

the Report. Some of the amendments are substantial ones

and  I would like to draw the attention of hon. Members

to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering representations made to the

Committee,  clause  8 has been amended  to  extend  the

maximum period of expiry of a licence from three months

to 12 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 attracted, as expected, most of the

representations  made  on the Bill.  Various  arguments

were  put  forward that the under 16 years of age  non-admittance  provision should be extremely difficult  to

carry out in practice,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



especially  in cinemas. The Government's view  is  that

this  provision should remain, as it is considered that

it  should be enforced in respect of certain classes of

entertainment   which  need  not  necessarily   include

cinemas.  Sir,  in  the  interests  of  youth  welfare,

operators  of  certain types of entertainment  must  be

made  to  realise  their responsibility  in  preventing

underage  children  from entering their  premises.  The

Committee has, however, amended this clause to  provide

for  the  Minister instead of the Licensing Officer  to

prescribe by notification in the Gazette what  type  of

public entertainment is to be made subject to the under

16 years of age provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 11, Sir, objections were raised

against  the  requirement of  giving  security.  It  is

considered,  however, that the furnishing  of  security

has been most useful in the control of certain types of

shows.   However,  in  order  to  meet  some   of   the

representations  made, the clause has been  amended  to

limit  the  powers  of  the Licensing  Officer  and  to

provide  for  the  Minister,  by  notification  in  the

Gazette,  to limit the amount of security and the  type

of  entertainment and also to provide for an appeal  to

the Minister in the event of forfeiture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 13 and 14 amendments have been made to

stipulate  a  reasonable period of  seven  days  within

which the grounds for the refusal of the licence should

be  furnished  to  an applicant. No period  was  stated

previously in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, after considering the representations

made  on clause 22 of the draft Bill, the clause  which

allows  the  Licensing Officer to seek  the  advice  of

bodies  associated with the control of boxing promotion

events  or public entertainment, and provides  that  it

shall  be sufficient ground for refusing an application

if  any  such  body advises refusal, the Committee  has

deleted the whole clause from the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, Sir, are the major amendments to the Bill. The

other  amendments  made are either self-explanatory  or

for  the purpose of improving the drafting of the  Bill

and  do not, I think, call for any comment. Sir, I  beg

to move.

the  main  purpose is to provide minimum  standards  of

Singapore's industry is on the threshold of  expansion,



and it is considered the duty of this Government to see

that  factories  if  erected,  should  conform  to  the

standard set out in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objections put forward to the Select Committee by

various  bodies have all come from existing businesses,

and  to  a  large  extent  their  apprehensions  appear

unfounded.  There is nothing in this  Bill  that  would

involve  drastic changes in their everyday  conduct  of

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a protection for the existing family businesses

that  do  not employ machinery of one kind or  another,

the  Select  Committee has seen  fit  to  increase  the

year.  Since  then it has being extended from  year  to

year and this will be the eighth occasion on which  the

extension of the Ordinance for a further period of  one

year has been moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance gives the Minister powers to make orders

regulating  the import and export of goods. In  keeping

with our policy of placing the minimum restrictions  on

trade,  these powers have been used very sparingly  and

most  imports are placed on open general licence, while

in general exports have been freely licensed. But it is

still necessary to retain powers for maintaining export

control of certain strategic supplies in order that  we

may   meet  our  international  obligations,  as,   for

example,  controlling gold dollar imports  which  is  a

necessary  part  of  our policy  as  a  member  of  the

sterling area. Moreover, with the introduction  of  the

principle of protection of local industry, the need for

the  continuation  of  powers to regulate  imports  and

exports  is  imperative, particularly if a decision  is

made  to  confer  protection by means  of  quantitative

restrictions.  The  Trade  Advisory  Council  has  been

consulted and supports this extension. Sir,  I  beg  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$1,461,162  shall  be supplied to the Government  under

the  heads of expenditure and for the service specified

in  the Schedule contained in Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.

31 of 1958.



Sir,   the   Schedule  consists  of  a  list   of   ten

applications  for  supplementary  provision  amount  to

$1,461,162. The reasons for these supplementary  votes

are  given in detail in the Sessional Paper. There  are

two items which involve a substantial sum of money. One

of  them  refers to the construction of four  secondary

schools for which $1,000,000 has been provided for this

year. Work has progressed faster than was envisaged  at

the  time  when  the  Estimates were  prepared.  It  is

anticipated  that a total sum of $2.1 million  will  be

required  for  progress payments during the  year,  and

supplementary provision of about $1.1 million  will  be

required.  These schools are urgently needed  and  when

they are completed will meet the present demand in  the

various districts. The second one refers to the  Muslim

Welfare  Home for destitute Muslim women. This  project

has  been  under consideration for some time.  A  token

provision  was  provided  in the  Estimates  to  enable

planning to be carried out. This has been completed and

it  has been decided to give this project top priority.

The  Home  will  be  built at  Jalan  Eunos  and,  when



completed, will meet a long-felt want.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this vote is

required by the Department of Information Services  for

civics   programmes  and  I  wonder  if  the  Financial

Secretary  can tell us the persons who are included  in

such civics courses.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I think I can give the Member the



answer. The whole civics programme was first instituted

in the year 1957 as the Government felt a very big need

to  associate  the  masses with  the  Government  as  a

continuing function of the social system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty-one courses were held in the year 1957 and

1,863  persons  representing various  organised  bodies

attended  these courses which were then held  twice  or

thrice  weekly. In the year 1958, more frequent courses

became  necessary  because  of  the  great  demand  and

because  the  advantages accorded to  the  participants

became  more  and more evident. 120 courses  have  been

held  in  the  year 1958 up to date and  3,260  persons

representing  various organised bodies participated  in

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad, Sir, to note that as a result of these

courses,  Government  has been  able  to  instil  civic

consciousness among the people. It is apparent that the

hitherto limited civic consciousness - just like:

"It  is not my business" - plus the inability to conceive

the scale on which Government operates, with consequent

ignorance of what is going on, have given way to a  new

spirit  of civic duties and responsibilities among  the

people.  The  people who have attended  these  courses,

Sir,  were  of  both sexes and came from all  walks  of

life - to  mention  a  few, fishermen, farmers,  hawkers,

industrial workers, insurance men, storytellers,  rural

dwellers, city dwellers, islanders, teachers, taxi men,

barbers, University undergraduates and students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



from  English, Chinese, Malay and Indian  schools.  The

places  visited  in  these civic courses  included  the

Police  Training School, the Combined Operations  Room,

the  General  Post Office, the Immigration  Department,

the  Depart, ment of Information Services,  the  Animal

Husbandry  Station  at  Lim Chu Kang  Road,  the  Civil

General Hospital, the Orthopedic Hospital, Boys'  Town,

the   Fisheries  Department,  the  Government  Printing

Office,  Radio  Malaya, the Social Welfare  Department,

Gimson  School for Boys, York Hill Girls'  School,  all

community  centres,  the Telephone Board,  the  Harbour

Board,  the  Junior  Trades School,  the  Airport,  the

Department  of  Telecommunications, the Asian  Seamen's

Club,  S.A.T.A., the Wireless Station  at  Jurong,  the

Supreme  Court  and  this  Assembly  Chamber.  All  the

participants of these civic courses, Sir,  visited  the

Chamber,  a  fact which emphasises its  position  as  a

centre of a system of parliamentary democracy and makes

more  real to them the debates and discussions as  they

read them, in the papers or hear them on the radio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to these courses, these people have

been  taken  to  a series of lectures on  the  District

Council  elections in each District area and individual

lectures were given to outside groups at their request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure hon. Members will agree with me that it is

important  that  the people have a right  to  know  the

Government  services and the Government servants,  both

to  know just how much the Government services  do  for

them  and  to  be  asked to make positive  and  helpful

contributions   to   the   parliamentary   system    of

Government.  I am sure, Sir, that the hon. Member  will

now be satisfied.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation

to proceed with the motion. I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section 11 of the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 160 of the

Revised  Edition), resolves that the  Customs  (Duties)

(Amendment) Order, 1958, published as Notification  No.

S  238  in  Gazette Supplement No. 66 of  3rd  October,



1958,  as contained in Sessional Paper No. S.L.  39  of

1958, be confirmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been decided to raise the duty on cigars

from $11.00 per lb. full and $10.00 per lb. preferential

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



$16.00  per  lb. full and $15.00 per lb. preferential

respectively, an increase of $5 per lb. in each case to

maintain  the existing differential of $1 per  lb.  The

previous  rates  were imposed in 1947, when  they  were

exactly  twice  those on cigarettes. The  latter  rates

have  been increased twice since then and it is thought

that the rates on cigars should now be increased so  as

to  be  nearer the former differential with cigarettes.

The  increase of $5 per lb. has brought about,  on  the



average,  an  increase of 10 per  cent  in  the  price.

Cigars  are  only smoked by a special group of  smokers



and  this will not therefore cause any hardship. It  is

estimated to yield an additional revenue of $54,000  in

a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to impose a further levy on

the more expensive cigarettes by charging an additional

duty at 35 per cent ad valorem on their value where the

value  exceeds  $15  per  1,000 cigarettes.  Value,  as

defined in the Customs Amendment Bill which was  passed

this  morning,  is "the price which an  importer  would

give for the goods on a purchase in the open market  if

the goods were delivered to him at the place of payment

of  duty and if freight, insurance, commission and  all

other  costs, charges and expenses (except any  customs

duties) incidental to the purchase and delivery at such

place  had  been paid". In this category of  cigarettes

are  Players  Medium  50's, State Express  and  Players

Perfectos Finos. The rate of duty, in the case of State

Express 555 in 10's has been increased from the  former

rate  of  $20.90  to  $26.60 per 1,000  cigarettes,  an

increase  of 80 cts. over the present Federation  rate.

The  existing  price of 45 cts. per 10  cigarettes  has



been  increased to 50 cts. In the case of State Express

555  in  tins,  the  former rate of  $20.90  per  1,000

cigarettes has been increased to $27.10, an  increase

of  $1.30  over the Federation rate. The  $2.35  retail

price  has  been increased to $2.65 per tin. Again,  in

the  case  of  the still more expensive  cigarettes,

such  as the Players Perfectos Finos 50's, the rate  of

duty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



has been increased from $21.06 per 1,000 cigarettes  to

$30.32, an increase of $4.32 over the Federation  rate.

The retail price has been increased from $3.30 to $3.75



per  tin.  It  is  estimated that these increases  will

yield an additional revenue of $2.2 million in a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pipe tobacco is a ready substitute for cigarettes,

there  would  be a loss to revenue should  there  be  a

switch to pipe tobacco. To offset any possible loss  of

revenue,  it  has been decided to impose an  additional

levy  on  the more expensive typpe of pipe  tobacco  by

charging an ad valorem 35 per cent of the value of pipe

tobacco  which  exceeds $7.50 per lb. In this  category

are  the Player's No Name, Three Nuns, Balkan Sobranie.

In  the case of Player's No Name, the rate of duty  has



being  increased by $2.74 per lb., an  increase  of  17

cts. per ounce. This is an increase of 84 cts. per  lb.

over the Federation rate. The rate of duty on the Three



Nuns  has  been increased by $3.22 per lb., an increase

of  20 cts. per ounce. This is an increase of $1.32 per

lb. over  the Federation rate. In the case  of  Balkan

Sobranie,  the increase in duty is $3.60  per  lb.,  an

increase  of 23 cts. per ounce. This is $1.70  per  lb.

higher  than  the Federation rate. On the average,  the



increase  in the retail prices has been about  50  cts.

for  2-ounce tins. This proposal is estimated to  bring



an additional $40,000 in a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether, Sir, the increased levy in duty will

bring an additional revenue of about $2.3 million in  a

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the incidence falls on the more expensive brands

of  cigarettes  and  pipe tobacco, which  are  normally

consumed by the well-to-do, it is appropriate that this

class of the population should bear this increased tax.

This  proposal  is in accordance with the  Government's



policy  that  the burden of additional taxation  should

fall on those who are able to bear

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is rather

surprising  that  the  Government  should  consider  an

increase of duty on tobacco at this moment, it would be

rather  interesting if the Hon. the Financial Secretary

could give us figures on the revenue from liquor before

and  after the increase of duty. I am informed that the

revenue  from  liquor  has dropped  considerably  since

then.  I wonder if the Hon, the Financial Secretary  is

aware  of  a  warning given by the leading tobacco  and

cigarette  dealers  in  Singapore.  I  quote  from  the

Singapore  Standard of 4th October, 1958, and  this  is

the warning given:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leading tobacco and cigarette distributors yesterday

warned  the  Singapore Government that the  extra  duty

imposed on cigarettes and tobacco would have an adverse

effect on the national revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were of the opinion that consumption of

cigarettes and tobacco would fall if duty was raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also warned Government that with the imposition

of  extra duty, there would be an increase in smuggling

of cigarettes and tobacco into the Colony."



<br><br>The  Hon. the  Financial Secretary  told  us  that  he

expects  an  increase in revenue of about  $40,000  per

year  due  to this increase of duty on tobacco  but  it

appears  that the leading tobacco and cigarette dealers

in  Singapore  think otherwise because they  feel  that

with   this  increase  in  duty,  the  consumption   of

cigarettes  will fall. The first warning, as  contained

in  that report, is that if this duty is increased, the

consumption of cigarettes will definitely fall, as  was

the  case  with  liquor after the duty  on  liquor  was

increased.  Sir, if this presumption is  correct,  then

the  result  may  be  that instead of  an  increase  in

revenue,  Government may have to lose some revenue  and

this should be an eye-opener to the Government. So  why

introduce  such an increase of duty on tobacco  at  the

moment  when  Government has experienced a considerable

loss of revenue on liquor after the duty on liquor  was

increased?  Is Government prepared to lose  revenue  on

tobacco  due to this increase in the same way  as  they

have  suffered on liquor? Certainly not!  I  am  afraid

that the Hon. the Financial Secretary may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



come  back to this Assembly with a deficit in  the  new

Budget  and  ask  for more taxes to be  levied  on  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second warning is that smuggling of cigarettes and

tobacco will increase. I agree with that because it  is

obvious that if duty on tobacco is increased, the price

of cigarettes will certainly increase and the smugglers

will turn their attention more to smuggling tobacco and

cigarettes because of the bigger margin of profit  that

would  accrue to them. So this would give the smugglers

more  encouragement  to smuggle tobacco  or  cigarettes

into the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Financial Secretary, he says that

this increase will not affect the lower income group as

he  feels  that  cigars are only smoked by  the  higher

income  group. But does he realise that even the  lower

income group do smoke an inferior type of cigars? It is

only  the rich who smoke the good brands of cigars  but

the  inferior brands of cigars are smoked by the middle

or  poorer class of people and, for his information,  I

have  been told that it is far cheaper to smoke  cigars

than  cigarettes. So if this increase is confirmed,  it

will  certainly affect the lower income  group  and  if

they  cannot afford this increase, I think there is  no

alternative  for  them  but to stop  smoking.  If  they

really  stop  smoking, then where  is  the  revenue  of

$40,000  per year that the Financial Secretary  expects

to get?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, Sir, emphasise that I am against the

confirmation  of  this  increase,  not  because  I   am

personally affected. It is in the interest of the lower

income group that I am against the confirmation of this

increase. I am not a smoker myself. So whether there is

or  there  is  no  increase,  it  does  not  affect  me

personally.  What I am afraid is that those  who  smoke

and who cannot find the money to smoke will have to  be

non-smokers, like myself, and the result may be a  loss

of  an  expected $40,000 per year in increased  revenue

contrary to what the Financial Secretary says.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oppose the confirmation of the Customs (Duties)

(Amendment) Order, 1958, Sir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



myself in agreement with the views of the Member for

Queenstown -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mason -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mason:</b> - but I must congratulate him this

afternoon  at least for avoiding the word "torture".  I

think  he got some of his figures wrong on the  revenue

referred  to by the Financial Secretary, and  if  those

are  wrong, I do not blame him in the least, because  I

was  completely dazed by the mass of figures - the  price

of   Three  Nuns  and  the  various  other  brands   of

cigarettes  that  we  were told  would  now  go  up  or

down - but  I  am  in  agreement  with  the  Member   for

Queenstown  in  being against confirming  this  motion,

because of the enormous expenditure that I envisage the

Customs will be asking for. I cannot believe that there

are  Customs  officers who can possibly be expected  to

cope   with   what   will  undoubtedly   be   a   great

encouragement  to  smugglers even  with  their  present

equipment.  They  will undoubtedly  come  and  ask  for

bigger  and better launches. I understand that, at  the

moment,  they have the greatest difficulty in  catching

the  smugglers with their outboard engines.  They  will

then come back to this House and ask for more money for

bigger  and  better  launches and I  can  foresee  that

whatever  the  figure that is hoped  to  be  gained  in

revenue by these increases - a lot of us are a bit  vague

on  what  that figure will actually turn out to be - will

be more than offset by the very reasonable demands from

the  Customs Department for better equipment to  enable

them  to enforce the laws that this House has seen  fit

to pass.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a rather

important  issue  such as this,  when  we  are  already

envisaging  faster and bigger speed boats  being  asked

for  in  this Assembly, we must not let it pass without

our expressing an opinion on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I do not quite follow the argument of

the  Member for Queenstown. I am quite sure that he  is

all in favour of the workers. I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



quite sure that he would like them to save money. I  am

quite  sure that he would not like them to have  cancer

and his argument is: "If they all gave up smoking, I am

quite sure that he would support them and wish them all

long  life.  If they did stop, we would not bemoan  the

fact  that the expected $2 million increase in  revenue

does not materialise." But when Mr Mason says that  he

thinks we ought not to amend the law, the reason  being

that  it  is  unlikely  that  the  increase  would   be

profitable,  because  any expected  increase  might  be

offset  by  the  increase in the cost of collection,  I

say,  but surely in that case, what we need is a really

good expert who will see that these taxes are collected

efficiently  and  cheaply and if smugglers  do  put  on

faster speed boats, well what the smugglers can buy, so

can  the Government. I am quite sure that it should not

be  beyond  the ingenuity of our Customs Department  to

get  the right kind of speed boats with the right  kind

of  depth  clearance and horsepower so as to make  sure

that no more smugglers get by than what usually get  by

in  any  case. But I would like to say this. I  do  not

believe  that smugglers will smuggle more  because  the

duty  has gone up. They will keep on smuggling  in  any

case  because,  even  at  the  present  rates,  it   is

profitable. If the Financial Secretary eventually  does

collect  $2.2 million extra, good luck to  him.  If  he

does not, he has to think of other ways, because I say,

"If  he wants to put up the duty on tobacco, why should

we object?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Yes, Sir,In answer to the first

point  raised  by the Member for Queenstown  about  the

fall in revenue as a result of the increase of duty  in

1957,  I  wish  to point out that he is  not  correctly

informed.  According  to  the  figures  given  by   the

Department,  in  1956  $9.5  million  was  received  in

respect  of  imported liquor and in 1957 $10.6  million

was received, showing an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



increase  of $1.1 million, in spite of the increase  of

duty. Sir, it is the experience in this country as well

as  in  other  parts of the world, that,  human  nature

being what it is, the increase of duty does not usually

bring about a decrease in revenue, if I may mention the

case  of tobacco, when the rates of duty were increased

in  late 1956, the total amount of revenue received  in

1956  was $35 million, and in 1957, the amount received

was $39 million, showing an increase of $4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second point raised by the Member

for  Queenstown about the likely increase in smuggling,

the  Department  is well aware of this danger  and,  in

fact,   there  is  already  an  organisation   in   the

Department to cope with this work. I am confident  that

the Department will do its best to reduce the extent of

smuggling to the minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there are other point that need

answering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section 11 of the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 160 of the

Revised  Edition), resolves that the  Customs  (Duties)

(Amendment) Order, 1958, published as Notification  No.

S  238  in  Gazette Supplement No. 68 of  3rd  October,



1958,  as contained in Sessional Paper No. S.L.  39  of

1958, be confirmed.

<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Sir, I rise to move

the motion standing in my name, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly views with grave concern and is

profoundly disturbed by the action of the Government of

Singapore in deporting to China the following  persons,

namely,  Fong  Siew  Long, Wong Yih Ching,  Chong  Huan

Teng,  Lim Inn Ping, Neo Ho Lan, Tai Chew Seng and  Bok

Kai  Weng,  although the Government has full  knowledge

that  these  persons were born, bred  and  educated  in

Malaya,  which  term  in law means  the  Federation  of

Malaya  and Singapore, thereby depriving the  aforesaid

natural-born  persons  of Malaya of  their  inalienable

rights  of citizenship, whether of Singapore or of  the

Federation of Malaya, and therefore this House deplores

and strongly condemns the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



Government  for  its high-handed and arbitrary  act  of

banishing these natural-born persons of Malaya to China

against their will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move this motion not for the fun or for the

purpose of a debate, because I know for certain that my

motion will be thrown out. The maximum I may get is one

or  two supporters for this motion, which is always the

case. I move this motion because of the request made by

the  near  relatives of these persons  concerned.  They

have written me a letter and I will now read

it. It is addressed to me and it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the nearest relatives of the above-named persons,

shall be ever grateful to you if you could kindly bring

the  following matters to the notice of the  people  of

Singapore through a debate in the Legislative  Assembly

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above named persons were born and educated in

Malaya and had never left Malaya. They were banished to

China in the most cruel way by the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly do your best to place this matter and explain

to  the  public the inhuman action on the part  of  the

present Lim Yew Hock Government.



<div align="right">With best wishes,"</div>



<br><br>and signed by the near relatives. [Laughter.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it appears to be a laughing matter to Members of

this House though the life of a person or the future of

a  person  or  persons is at stake. I  cannot  see  how

Members of this House could treat it so lightly,  treat

it as a laughing matter, when persons are deported from

the country of their birth; I do not think it should be

a  laughing  matter. From the contents of this  letter,

Sir,  you  can  see  that  the request  from  the  near

relatives  is  to  bring  to  light  the  inhuman   and

arbitrary action of the present Government in banishing

those  persons  concerned to China,  though  they  were

born,   bred  and  educated  in  Malaya.  It   appears,

therefore, to me, Sir, that the Government has not  the

slightest  regard  for human rights. Government  always

has proudly proclaimed to the people that it stands for

democracy  and the freedom of the people. We have  this

morning  heard  so much about democracy.  But  what  is

democracy and where is democracy when it has  time  and

again  ignored the just demands and strong protests  of

the people of Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Second Reading of the Singapore

Citizenship  Bill, the Chief Minister  said - I  think  I

will  have  to  quote what he said in col.  2541,  Vol.

2, No.  36  of  11th September, 1957. This is  what  the



Chief Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We as elected Members of the Assembly owe our power

to   our  representing  the  views  of  the  people  as

expressed  through the secrecy of the  ballot  box.  As

individuals, whatever our abilities or claims, we  have

no  power  other than the power which derives from  the

people."



<br><br>So it is through the secret ballot box that we are here

today. Sir, did the Chief Minister at the time when  he

said   those  words  sincerely  believe  that  he   was

practising democracy? If so, then it is regrettable  to

see that his Government has acted otherwise, by showing

the  lack  of  sincerity  in the  words  of  the  Chief

Minister   himself.  The  arbitrary   action   of   the

Government  clearly  shows  how  desperate  and  short-sighted  is  the  policy  of Government.  Sir,  in  the

universal  declaration  of human  rights,  there  is  a

quotation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest,

detention or exile."



<br><br>Well, does this mean anything to the Chief Minister  or

his  Government? It means nothing, from what I can see,

otherwise  how  could  he explain the  high-handed  and

arbitrary  action by deporting these persons  to  China

against  their will, though the Government  knows  full

well  that they were born, bred and educated in Malaya?

These persons have never travelled beyond the shores of

this  place,  and now they are deported  to  a  foreign

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say now, we always talk about democracy, but do

we practise democracy? We do sometimes practise or talk

of  democracy to deceive the people, not otherwise.  We

also  talk of subversives or subversion. Sir,  what  is

subversion? To quote one instance where the subversives

of  today may be leaders of tomorrow. I will now  quote

"Who was Nkrumah at that time?" Was he not considered a

subversive element by the colonial government  at  that

time? Then who is he today? In 1955 he was quoted as  a

subversive  element. He is now the  Prime  Minister  of

Ghana. Then we have Nehru, Sir. Again, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



was he before? Again, a subversive element. Today he is

the  Prime Minister of a great Asian country. Sir,  can

we  tolerate such subversive elements as opinionated by

the  Chief  Minister? Sir, it would not  be  surprising

that  the  subversive element we have in this Assembly,

the  hon. Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong),

may  one  day  be the Prime Minister or  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  of  Singapore!  Then  where   is   the

subversive element in that Member for Bukit Timah?  You

can never tell, and if the P.A.P. comes into power, he is

released  and  contests  the  elections,  there  is   a

possibility  that he may be the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

of Singapore. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - or the Prime Minister, I am so

sorry. But if he does not contest the elections, and if

the P.A.P. do decide to release him, and because he has

been  deprived the opportunity of contesting the  first

general  elections,  the  P.A.P. may  consider  making

him - if  he  quits  his  own Party - the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Looking at the motion, I cannot

find  the  name of the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong). Neither can I find any reference to  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara. Will the hon.  Member  please

keep to the terms of his motion as closely as possible?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr

Speaker. I was just explaining what "subversive" means,

and  that the day may come when these elements of today

may become the leaders of tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however serious their crime may be, banishment to

a  foreign  country against their will of persons  born

and bred in Malaya - I will emphasize those words because

it  was  not  of  their own free will  that  they  were

prepared  to be deported to China, although  I  believe

that  the  Chief Minister has, in his hands,  a  signed

statement.  The signatories may be forced to  sign  the

statement that they are prepared to be deported.  I  am

just saying - I am not sure - so it is up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



the  Chief Minister whether he has in his hands  signed

statements by such persons that they are prepared to be

deported  to China. In fact, it was against  their  own

will. And if that was the case, the deporting of people

against  their  own  will is  most  cruel  and  a  most

barbaric  form of punishment. This form of  punishment,

Sir, is unthinkable in these days, especially when  the

persons  concerned are natural-born persons of  Malaya.

As  stated in my motion, Sir, the interpretation of the



law  in  section  2 of the Interpretation  and  6eneral

Clauses  Ordinance (Chapter 2) says that  Malaya  means

either the Federation of Malaya or Singapore; so it  is

just  the  same where Malaya or Singapore is concerned.

Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights



states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has a right to a nationality. No one shall

be  arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor  denied

the right to change his nationality."



<br><br>Now  these persons, were they given the chance or  have

they ever applied to change their nationality? No.  Let

us  take their cases, Sir, one by one, or I will  quote

one  instance, the case of Wong Yih Ching.  I  am  told

that  he was born in Segamat, Johore, in 1932.  I  also

understand   that  his  father  is  now  a   registered

Federation citizen. This shows beyond doubt, Sir,  that

the  loyalty  of the father and the son is with  Malaya

and  nowhere  else,  not with a  foreign  country.  His

relatives,  I  am  told again, were  also  educated  in

Malaya  and  none of his relatives had  ever  left  the

shores  of  Malaya. I understand also  that  he  was  a

registered  voter  and  voted in the  last  Legislative

Assembly  elections in 1955. He might  have  cast  his

vote to put the Labour Front into power, or to put  any

one of us here today. If it were not for that vote, one

of  us might not be here today. Now, what did he get in

return  for  casting his vote for us to  be  here?  The

return  that we offered him is to send him to China,  a

foreign  country. It is really curious, Sir, that  this

man,  although  born in Malaya and detained  under  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance and not under

the   Banishment  Ordinance,  is  being  banished.  The

persons mentioned in my motion were arrested under  the

P.P.S.O., they were not detained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



under the Banishment Ordinance, and although they  were

born in Malaya, they were banished. I cannot understand

the  acts of the Government. But some persons who  were

born  in  China  and were actually detained  under  the

Banishment  Ordinance are free to move  about  in  this

country.  This is the type of discrimination  I  cannot

understand. So much has been talked this morning  about

Dr  Chuang; so much has been talked about Linda  Chen;

are  not  these two China-born persons? Were not  these

two persons arrested under the Banishment Ordinance? In

spite  of  the  fact that they were born in  China  and

detained under the Banishment Ordinance, they  are  set

free  without  an explanation from the Government.  But

these seven persons, born, bred and educated in Malaya,

are  banished, though they were detained at  that  time

under   the  P.P.S.O. and  not  under  the  Banishment

Ordinance. I remember, Sir, at one time when  a  Member

of this House tabled questions on the Banishment Orders

in  respect  of those persons born in China (not  these

seven persons), the then Acting Chief Secretary replied

that  those persons were detained and would be banished

after  very, very careful consideration. I am referring

to  those persons who were born in China, that is,  Dr

Chuang and Linda Chen. Now, after the decision has been

taken  with  very,  very  careful  consideration,   the

Government can revoke the Banishment Orders in  respect

of these persons. I cannot understand this. However,  I

am  happy that these persons are now set free,  because

at  that  time when they were detained, I was  in  full

sympathy  with them too. So I am very happy  that  they

are  now  free, as a result of the sympathy, I suppose,

of the Chief Minister. Just compare the vast difference

between  these  two instances - born in Malaya,  detained

under the P.P.S.O. but banished to China; born in China

detained  under the Banishment Ordinance, but are  free

in  Singapore.  What a vast difference!  These  persons

have  no relatives, no brothers, no sisters, nor anyone

in  China,  and China is a foreign place to them.  They

were never educated nor ever went to Formosa; now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



when  they  are sent to a foreign country, how  can  we

expect  them to exist? I cannot understand.  Sir,  both

the    Singapore   Citizenship   Ordinance   and    the

Constitution   of  the  Federation  of  Malaya   confer

citizenship rights on these persons. They ought to have

been  allowed to register themselves either as  Federal

citizens  or Singapore citizens; but just because  they

were detained, they have been deprived of the right  to

register  themselves as citizens of  either  territory.

Article  16  of  the  Federation Constitution  provides



citizenship  by  registration of persons  born  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya after Merdeka  Day.  Therefore,

Sir,  under  this article, these seven  persons  should

have  been entitled and given the privilege to register

themselves  as  Federal  citizens.  According  to  that

Constitution the only qualifications required are:  (1)

that  a  person intends to stay permanently in  Malaya;

(2)  he must be of good character; and (3) he must have

an  elementary knowledge of Malay. These seven persons,

to  my knowledge, do have all these qualifications  and

should be entitled to the protection provided for under

this article.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the hon. Member is misled.

May  I  ask him whether he really means that  he  knows



that they are of good character, in his own opinion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> According to the Citizenship

Ordinance itself, I cannot find the definition  of  the

words  "good  character". As far as that  Ordinance  is

concerned, the word "character" appears only  on  Forms

(A)  and  (B) with a small footnote. So the  expression

"good  character"  as  defined  there  is  not  clearly

understood. Secondly, a man who has not been imprisoned

should be deemed to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



of  "good character". Unless he has been sent  to  gaol

for  more  than  twelve months - I believe  that  is  the

interpretation - then only can we deem such person to be

not  of good character. That is why I say, Sir, in  the

absence of any conviction of any of these persons, they

should be deemed to be of good character. How could you

classify  them  as of "bad character"  when  they  were

never  convicted? I hope that the Chief  Minister  will

agree  with the interpretation of this expression "good

character". Had it not been for their detention, Sir, I

am  sure that they would have got themselves registered

either  as Federal citizens or Singapore citizens;  and

even  then,  if they are released from detention,  they

are  still  entitled to register themselves as  Federal

citizens. This fact was confirmed in a statement  given

to  the  Press  on  the 3rd of September,  1958,  by  a

spokesman  of  the  Ministry of  External  Affairs.  It

appeared  in  the Singapore Standard of 3rd  September.

1958, and this is what appeared therein:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kuala Lumpur, Tuesday - A person who is eligible for

Federal  citizenship is not disqualified from  applying

for  it  even  if  he  is  detained  in  Singapore  for

political reasons. He can still be considered to be  of

good character."



<br><br>This  was  stated by the spokesman - "he  can  still  be

considered to be of good character" although he was  or

he   can   be   detained  in  Singapore  for  political

reasons - that is what is meant by "good character".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was disclosed to The Standard by the Ministry

for  External Affairs spokesman, Inche Zaiton  Ibrahim,

and  the  Senior Registration Officer,  Mr  J.  R.  G.

Jenkins, today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Constitution, a person is considered not to be

of  good character if he has been sentenced to death or

imprisoned for 12 months or more for a criminal offence

within   three   years   immediately   proceeding   his

application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his application succeeds, then he can at any time

return  to  the  Federation without any hindrance.  The

Federation  cannot deny him his right to  return,  said

Inche Zaiton."



<br><br>Just  as the Chief Minister was referring to Mr Lim Kean  Chye - he is a Singapore citizen, be  was  born  in



Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



and you cannot deny him the right to return. Persons

eligible for citizenship can apply from anywhere -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> A point of correction, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> All right, go ahead!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Lirn Kean Chye was not born in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, if I am correct, it was the

Chief Minister himself who said that Mr Lim Kean  Chye

could not be denied the right to return because he  was

born or he is a British subject and you cannot deny him

the  right to enter; but whatever happens to him  after

his entry, it is left to be seen, he cannot say yes  or

no.  Persons eligible for citizenship call  apply  from

anywhere  outside the Federation, as Mr Jenkins  said.

"From  anywhere" means even from outside  Singapore  or



the   Federation  of  Malaya.  They   can   apply   for

registration as citizens.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood the hon. Member to

say  that  he was quoting from a newspaper.  I  do  not

think that that document he is reading from looks  like

a newspaper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Well, Sir, this is an extract from

the Singapore Standard.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Then I might inform the hon.

Member  that  if  a  quotation is to  be  made  from  a

newspaper, that newspaper ought to be produced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. I will bear

that  in  mind in future, and I will produce the  paper

concerned, if I do quote from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is this act of the Government not of oppression?

Is  this  not  cruelty, by sending  people  away  to  a

foreign country? We have legislation in Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  to  punish persons who are cruel to  animals  and

poultry, including fowls. When a fowl is carried  in  a

cruel way, Government punishes the wrongdoer.



Yet  it  is  the  Government which  is  the  wrongdoer,

because  it  commits the extreme cruelty  by  deporting

these  seven  persons  by separating  them  from  their

children,  their brothers, their sisters, their  wives,

or  whatever relatives they may have. So is this not  a

cruel  thing  to  do? Is there no law  whereby  we  can

protect  these persons? If we can have a law to protect

cruelty  to animals, why then cannot we have a  law  to

protect cruelty to human beings? Are human beings worse

than animals? Let us put it that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Assembly we have never passed any law or

rule  to prevent a detainee from being registered as  a

citizen  of Singapore. I cannot remember that. So  then

why  should Government misuse or twist a phrase of  the

law  and thus bring it into disrepute? Should democracy

be  exercised in favour of only the very few  rich  and

self-centred politicians? Justice must be done  to  one

and all, and not only to a very few elected politicians

or  high-class people. Unless detainees can be tried in

the  courts of law, why disregard the law and deny them

this  legal right? Now, take the case of Lim Inn  Ping.

He  was,  I  understand,  a  former  President  of  the



Singapore Taxi Drivers' Union. He was born in  1923  in

Yong Peng, Johore, which is very close to Singapore. He

was  educated  in Malaya, and was also a voter  in  the

Singapore  Legislative  Assembly  elections  in   1955.

Surprisingly, Sir, in the last Cairnhill by-election he



was  a proposer of a candidate who contested that  ward

for  the  by-election. If he is a man of bad character,

if he is a subversive element, why was he allowed to be

a proposer of a candidate to contest the by-election in

Cairnhill? It is rather unfortunate that that candidate

is  not  successful,  so  we  have  a  new  Member  for

Cairnhill sitting with us here. Had that candidate been

the  Member for Cairnhill today and sitting with us  in

this  Assembly, I am sure that I can receive  one  more

vote.  Inn  Ping is married and has a wife in Singapore

also. This man



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



has no relatives, as I have emphasised again and again,

in  China and why should he be banished then? The  same

applies  to the others mentioned in my motion. Many  of

them,   I  believe,  were  also  voters  in  the   last

Legislative  Assembly elections. Had it  not  been  for

their  votes, as I say, the Labour Front may  not  have

come  into power, or some of us may not have been here.

But I think that the votes went to the P.A.P., that is,



for  the  Members  for  Tanjong  Pagar,  Sembawang  and

Ponggol-Tampines. These people are more inclined to the

P.A.P. than anybody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, Sir, is quite clear to us now that the

Government's  action to deport them to China  is  very,

very  high-handed. It is also dictatorial and  a  gross

abuse  of human rights. Therefore, I appeal to  Members

to  support  my motion though I doubt I  can  have  the

support  of  the  whole House. Maybe I  will  have  the

support  of  two or three Members. We must,  therefore,

then  strongly  deplore  and condemn  the  undemocratic

attitude  and the high-handed action of the  Government

to  banish  these seven persons to China against  their

will.  We  must  also  ask Government  to  revoke  this

decision and bring back these persons to their place of

birth, which is Malaya. Unless that is done, Sir, their

parents,  their  wives, or brothers and sisters,  would

never  be  happy,  as  the  Chief  Minister  said  this

morning. He has sympathy, he is human and he knows  the

grievances of these persons. So if he does really  feel

sorry  for  these persons and know what  sorrow  is,  I

think he should with all his power revoked the decision

and bring them back. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to second the motion and reserve my right to

speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have difficulty in

containing myself within parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



language. I listened with dismay to some of the remarks

made  from the Opposition earlier this morning when  we

debated  the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.

I  nearly rose then. I must quote what the hon.  Member



for   Queenstown  repeatedly  used,   words   such   as

"inhuman",  "contempt  for human  rights"  and  "cruel,

brutal, merciless", and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the function of a government to maintain

internal peace and to secure the lives of citizens from

those  who  illegally use force. This House  has  fully

assented  to  that  view  as  regards  secret   society

gangsters.  Everyone recognizes the need for  that,  or

nearly  everybody recognizes the need for that,  except

some  gangsters. Everybody who seriously looks  at  the

facts of the situation knows perfectly well that secret

society   gangsters'  use  of  violence  is   of   less

importance than the Communist use of violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened just now, Mr Speaker, Sir, to be in the

Library   and  read  the  latest  copy  of   the   "New

Statesman". I cannot produce it unless you wish me  to.

But  I  have made a note of the figures quoted therein.



The  Acting Prime Minister of the Federation is  quoted



as  giving  the  following figures  of  people  killed,

wounded  and missing in the course of the Emergency  in

the Federation:

<pre>

               3,674     Malays

              14,213     Chinese

                 765     Indians

                 349     Europeans and

                 240     Aborigines

</pre>

<br><br>These  are  men,  women  and children,  in  many  cases

members of families with their relatives, and these are

people whose relatives are suffering; not suffering  by

seeing  somebody sent overseas, but seeing them wounded

or  murdered;  seeing  their bodies  brought  home  and

having  to do without them forever afterwards,  and  to

know that they died in a cruel and horrible war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member asked, "Are human beings worse than

animals?" The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



answer  is  definitely yes in some cases. Animals  have

not  killed 19,000 human beings in Malaya. It is  human

beings  who have killed 19,000 human beings,  and  will

continue  to do it unless the forces of law  and  order

use the necessary courage in facing this unhappy aspect

of society. It is difficult to contain one's impatience

with people who, for purposes best known to themselves,

get  up and put up an inaccurate and ill-prepared  case

and mix it up with words which ought not to be used  in

this  connection - inhuman cruelty and  phrases  of  that

sort. The inhuman cruelty lies on the other side of the

fence, and it is against that inhuman cruelty that  the

Government  must  act  with  strength  to  protect  the

harmless and innocent citizens of this country.



<br><br>5.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, before I come to the motion itself, I

would  like just to clear up one or two points of  fact

arising  out  of  the  speech of the  hon.  Member  for

Queenstown. In the first place, Mr Lim Kean Chye is  a

British   subject  born  in  Malaya,  and   under   our

immigration  legislation he has the right of  entry  to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is that the hon. Member

referred to one of the persons mentioned in his  motion

as  being married, and he then went on to say that  the

same thing applied to all the others. In fact, all  the

other  six  persons mentioned in his motion are  single

persons with no dependants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to return to the terms of the motion

itself.  The motion, Sir, seems to me to be  rather  an

inept  attempt by the use of confusing language to  try

and  imply  that  the law in this matter  is  something

different from what it is. The Member for Queenstown is

fully  aware  that  if the persons whose  cause  he  is

pleading had any claim arising from their birth in  the

Federation  of  Malaya,  that  claim  could  only  rest

against  the  Government  of the  Federation.  What  is

crystal  clear  is that they are not British  subjects,

nor  are  they  Singapore  citizens  and  can  have  no

conceivable  claim  on  that  ground  to  a  right   of

residence in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



Nevertheless,  he  seeks  by  the  use  of  some  loose

phraseology, associating the Federation of  Malaya  and

Singapore together, to imply not only that birth in the

Federation in some way confers rights in Singapore, but

also   that  the  Singapore  Government  is  under   an

obligation to accept greater responsibilities on behalf

of  these  persons  than the Federation  Government  is

itself  prepared  to  accept.  Looking,  Sir,  at   the

operative  terms  of  this motion - "these  persons  were

born,  bred and educated in Malaya, which term  in  law

means  the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, thereby,

depriving the aforesaid natural born, persons of Malaya

of  their inalienable rights of citizenship, whether of

Singapore   or   of  the  Federation  of   Malaya" - that

phraseology will bear a little analysis. "Malaya, which

term  in  law  means  the  Federation  of  Malaya   and

Singapore". Certainly, Sir, the term "Malaya"  is  used

as  a convenient geographical description for the Malay

Peninsula, including Singapore, but by what conceivable

authority  does the hon. Member claim that the  use  of

this  geographical expression in itself can create  any

rights or obligations? The word "Assembly" is a term in

law used to embrace all the Members in this House, both

Members  on  the  Government Bench and Members  on  the

Opposition    Bench - not   forgetting   yourself,    Mr

Speaker - but it would be equally logical to  claim  that

the  use of the word "Assembly" created and imposed  an

obligation on the Members of the opposite side  of  the

House to vote for the Government. No, Sir, the fact  is

that  this  term  is a descriptive, geographical  term,

whether it be Malaya or the Malayan Archipelago, South-East Asia or anything else, and in itself it can create

no rights and impose no obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on a little further, Sir, with the terms of

this  motion - "thereby depriving the aforesaid  natural-born  persons of Malaya of their inalienable rights  of

citizenship, whether of Singapore or the Federation  of

Malaya" - what rights of citizenship does the hon. Member

refer  to? He must be well aware, or if he is not,  his

advisers certainly are, that citizenship -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I have no advisers, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I beg his pardon! - citizenship both in the

Federation and in Singapore is defined and governed  by

law; and in the law - Singapore citizenship law - there  is

no mention of the word "Malaya". What then does he mean

by the words "whether of Singapore or the Federation of

Malaya"?  Does  he  mean that they  were  born  on  the

causeway?  If  not, is he trying to assert  that  these

persons  in fact had Singapore citizenship? If  he  is,

then  let  him  say  so.  The fact  is  that  he  knows

perfectly  well that he cannot make that assertion.  Is

he then asserting that these persons had citizenship of

the  Federation, Federal citizenship?  Again  he  knows

quite  well that he cannot assert anything of the kind.

Then  what  does  he  mean by this  term,  "inalienable



rights  of citizenship, whether of Singapore or of  the

Federation of Malaya"? I suggest, Sir, that it is  just

a  nice  high-sounding  phrase  which  means  precisely

nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hon. Member is really getting at and what is

behind his motion, I suggest, is the point on which  he

only  touched  very  briefly, and that  is  that  these

persons  ought  to  be  recognised  by  the  Federation

Government  as being eligible and having the  right  to

Federal  citizenship. But that is not the way in  which

he  has expressed his motion: firstly, because it would

be  an  attack on the Federation Government,  which  he

probably is reluctant to undertake; and, secondly, Sir,

because  it  would be ruled out of order  by  yourself;

and, thirdly, because he wants to train his guns on the

Singapore  Government which, as he well knows,  has  no

responsibility  for  the  citizenship   laws   of   the

Federation. Moreover, it may interest him to know  that

the  Federation Government was consulted and  concurred

in  these banishments. I suggest, Sir, that the  action

taken  in these cases is legally unassailable  and  the

hon.  Member  knows it, for all the cloud of  verbiage,

with which he seeks to surround it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then, Sir, are the merits? The hon. Member for

Queenstown  painted  a picture of sorrow  and  hardship

with the evident intention of trying to enlist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



the  sympathy of his hearers for these poor unfortunate

persons.  Here  again, Sir, when the embellishments  of

which  he  is such a pastmaster have been stripped  off

the canvas, what in fact are the realities that remain?

What have these people done to deserve the sympathy for

which he so eloquently appeals? What they have done  is

to  associate  themselves with the  Communist  plot  to

overthrow   democracy  in  Malaya,  which   means   the

Federation of Malaya and Singapore; what they have done

is  to  show their disloyalty to the country  of  their

birth,  whether it be the Federation or  Singapore.  We

are  asked to contemplate their plight in China, but  I

suggest, Sir, that that is a country in which they will

be   able   to   indulge   their   activities - Communist

activities in which they have been engaged - and a  place

also  where  they  will be able to see  to  what  those

activities lead. In short, Sir, I suggest to this House

that  neither  in  law nor in equity does  this  motion

carry  any  substance. On the contrary, in this  as  in

other  measures  to combat the ever-present  threat  of

subversion, the Government has done no more and no less

than its duty by the people of this island.

Constitution of the Federation of Malaya which, for his

easy  reference, is in the Library of this  Assembly - R. 342.595.  It  seems  that these  people  were  born  in



Malaya;  and according to this bit of legalese  in  the

motion:  "depriving the aforesaid natural born  persons

of  Malaya of their inalienable rights of citizenship".

I  went  diligently through this Constitution and  came



across Article 16. The marginal note reads:

before  Merdeka Day. I would therefore like to read  to

the House what Article 16 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to Article 18, any person of or over the age

of eighteen years who was born in the Federation before

Merdeka Day is entitled, upon making application to the

registration authority, to be registered as  a  citizen

if he satisfies that authority -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that he has resided in the Federation, during the

seven years immediately preceding the date of the

application,   for  periods  amounting   in   the

aggregate to not less than five years;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that he intends to reside permanently therein;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that he is of good character; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) except where the application is made within one

year after Merdeka Day, that he has an elementary

knowledge of the Malay language."



<br><br>I  shall  not  harass  the Member for  Queenstown  with

Article 18, but this Article is the saving provision as

to the procedure by which these things are done and the

exceptions to the general rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to draw the attention of

Members  of  the House to is this. There  were  70  odd

banishments, but the Member for Queenstown  has  chosen

to  raise not the principle of banishment as such,  but

the  question  of  the right of these six  persons.  It

means, in effect, a motion of censure on the Federation

Government  Constitution because it has not  recognised

the  principle of jus soli. Sir, that is  a  matter  to

which  I  think the Member for Queenstown may  want  to

apply  himself. I should think it is an extremely large

and  profitable field and he would find a great  number

of  supporters for the principle of jus soli. In  fact,

it  is  one  of  the pivotal points of  the  Federation

Constitution.  But  I  would  advise  Members  of  this

Assembly not to enter into the affray. This is a matter

on  which  we would be well advised not to express  any

opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this categorically: that even on the present

Federation Constitution, my party would be prepared, if

we  had any say in the fate of Singapore, to enter  the

Federation as a member State, accepting the citizenship

clauses and the Articles



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



regarding the acquisition and the loss of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Queenstown could find some

politician  in the Federation to take this  matter  up,

that  is  a matter for him to take up; but for  us  the

motion   really  means:  (1)  condemn  the   Federation

Government  for  not recognising the principle  of  jus

soli;  (2) condemn the Singapore Government for  having

refused to allow Singapore to become a place of  refuge

for  all those whom the Federation Government does  not

want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think those who had advised the Member for

Queenstown on this matter must be fully aware that  the

Federation  Government is consulted on all  banishments

of  persons born in the Federation. In fact, all  those

who  are  intimately associated with the  procedure  in

these  matters will know that they were, in fact,  sent

back  to  the  Federation and boarded  a  ship  from  a

Federation  port. And if the Federation does  not  want

them,  then  I suggest that it is not the  business  of

this   Assembly  to  embarrass  the  position   between

Singapore and the Federation by bringing up motions  of

this  character.  The persons who advised - who  did  not

advise  the  Member  for Queenstown - to  bring  up  this

motion should think well before they do more damage  to

the  already strained and serious relationship  between

the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say flatly and categorically that from time to

time we will have to face stupid, irresponsible motions

which would appeal to the emotions of people. Everybody

feels  sorry for these six persons and their  families;

but  I  would say I am more concerned - may  I  read  the

terms  of  the motion, because I should like to  follow

the  words more closely - I express my grave concern and

am profoundly disturbed by the action of the Member for

Queenstown   in   having  done  something   which   has

aggravated  the  position, and further  I  deplore  and

strongly condemn those who have led him into this  ill-advised course.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed not

surprised to see this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



motion  introduced  in this House  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown. It is a motion which shows disregard of the

facts  and  a  lamentable  ignorance  of  the  law   of

citizenship which was passed by this House  last  year.

The Government does not deny that it had knowledge that



certain  banishees had claimed birth in the Federation.

But  I  do  not  admit, and neither does the  Singapore



citizenship  law  concede, that  persons  born  in  the

Federation of Malaya possess in-alienable rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been pointed out by the Chief Secretary

that  before banishment proceedings were taken  against

these  persons, so honourably named by the  Member  for

Queenstown in his motion, the Federation Government was

consulted  and  the Federation Government  agreed  that

banishment proceedings should be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Queenstown asked me so many

questions and would have this House believe that he  is

the  champion of the poor people who were banished  and

those  who  were  left behind - the relatives  of  those

banished. I do not think, Sir, that the hon. Member can

honestly say that these "near relatives", as he  called

them - perhaps he was just reading a letter signed  "near

relatives"  because it did not mention any names -  that

these  near relatives did not go to his house time  and

again  to  beseech him to help. Sir, I had to meet  all

these  people  who came to the office by their  numbers

without  appointment. They came to the Labour  Ministry

without  appointment. They came to  my  house  at  all

hours  of the day and night. In fact, they cried;  they

wailed; they mourned;  so  much so that at times  passers-by  along

Sims  Avenue thought there must have been a bereavement

in  my  family. I had to bear all that -  not  the  hon.

Member  for Queenstown. To say that I cried is not  it.

To  say  that  I found it difficult to sleep  at  night



because  I  had  to do this is still  not  it.  I  went

through hell. I literally went through that until I was

sick; but because I know that I have a duty to per-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



form  to  the people of Singapore, I did not  shirk  my

duty. The security of Singapore should come first,  and

not Lim Yew Hock, the Labour Front, or the Labour Front

Coalition Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have in this Assembly heard too many times and

much  too  often  criticisms from some Members  of  the

Opposition who are so irresponsible in their utterances

that  I  begin  to believe that they do not  understand

their  responsibilities to their electorate and to  the

country.  I  am indeed surprised to see in  the  motion

that  only seven names were mentioned, six of whom were

represented by one legal adviser. May I tell him, if he

feels  that it would make his case stronger, that there

were  ten banishees who were born in the Federation  of

Malaya and who were banished not so long ago, and  that

despite  his  accusations and irresponsible  utterances

hurled  at us, we will not be deterred? If the security

of  Singapore  is at stake and if it is necessary  that

people  born  in  the Federation have  to  be  banished

because of their subversive activities, this Government

will not shirk its duty.



<br><br>5.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Choon Eng, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply I will

first  deal  with  the Minister for Communications  and

Works. He tells us that the function of a government is

to  maintain peace, and those who illegally  use  force

will have to be punished. I can agree with him.



Those who go against the laws of the Government must be

punished.  The  Minister then  quotes  figures  of  the

number of persons killed - Malays, Chinese, Eurasians and

Europeans.  Sir, my motion in fact does  not  say  that

they should not be detained or arrested or anything. It

is   concerned  with  the  way  in  which  the  persons

mentioned therein were deported. They were born in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  and  they  were deported to a foreign  country,

China.  My  motion  does not say  that  the  Government

should not punish such persons. If anybody transgresses

the  laws  of  the  Government, it is  right  that  the

Government should punish such a wrongdoer by law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Chief Secretary, Sir, he, in

conjunction with the Member for Tanjong Pagar, tries to

interpret  the  term "Malaya" in law. I have  no  legal

background and I am not a lawyer. I bow to both of them

who have gone through a period of legal training. I got

my interpretation of the term "Malaya", which means the

Federation   of   Malaya  and   Singapore,   from   the

Interpretation  and General Clauses Ordinance  (Chapter

2). As I have no legal background, I am not prepared to

argue   this   with   them,  who  have.   Whether   the

interpretation  of  the term is what  it  says  in  the

Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance,  that  is

up  to  the  Government  to say  so.  As  a  layman,  I

interpret the definition as I read it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar says that there were

about 70 banishees and it is rather surprising that  my

motion  only mentions 7 names. The Chief Minister  also

says  that  it  is rather surprising  that  I  am  only

interested in these 7 persons. In my opening  speech  I

emphasised that I tabled this motion because  the  near

relatives  of these 7 persons approached me and,  as  a

man serving the public, if representations are made  to

me,  it is my duty, if I feel it is right, to represent

their cases to this Assembly. If all the 70 persons had

approached me, I would have done the same thing, if  my

conscience says it is right to do so. So it  is  not  a

case of 7 or 70 persons at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister mentions that six of these persons

were  represented by a lawyer. Well, that is no concern

of  mine.  What  I  am concerned is  this:  if  anybody

approaches  me  to represent his case to this  Assembly

and if I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



convinced  that it is in the interests of the  public,

I will do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar says that these people

were  sent to the Federation. With due respect  to  his

legal  qualifications and background, I wonder  why  he

terms  it  that  they  were deported  or  sent  to  the

Federation.  They  were  deported  to  China  via   the

Federation.  I think that is the correct  term,  rather

than that they were deported to the Federation. If they

were  deported to the Federation, then,  as  the  Chief

Minister  says  that  he had consulted  the  Federation

Government,  it was up to the Federation Government  to

decide  whether  they were prepared to accept  them  or

not.  Deporting a person straight to China via a number

of countries through which this person has to pass does

not  necessarily mean that he is deported to all  these

countries. I am quite sure that the boat which  brought

these persons mentioned in the motion to China did  not

call  at  a Federation port only. If the interpretation

of  the Member for Tanjong Pagar is correct - that  these

persons  were deported to the Federation - then  I  would

say  that they were not only deported to the Federation

but  deported also to the many countries at  which  the

boat carrying them would call.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather surprising that, as a legal man, the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar has to use the words  that  I

have  used  in  my motion, and that is, "I  express  my

grave concern and am profoundly disturbed by the action

of  the  Member for Queenstown". He has  been  in  this

Assembly for quite a long time, and if he really  feels

gravely concerned and disturbed by my actions, I  would

invite  him  to  table a motion of this nature  to  the

Assembly,  rather than use the words of my  motion  and

attack me. He has every right to move such a motion  as

a  Member of this Assembly. I will leave that to  him.

He knows better.
