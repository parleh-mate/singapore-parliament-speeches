<div align="center"><b>(Cost savings)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology (a)  what  will  be

the  cost  savings  in  postal  operations  as  a  result  of

automated mailing processing and whether such savings will be

passed on to the public and business community in the form of

lower   postage  rates  as  a  real  incentive  to  encourage

automation;  and  (b)  whether his Ministry  will  provide  a

comparison of postage rates in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei

as  well as a detailed explanation on the recent increases in

international postage rates despite the cost savings  through

automation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  postal  rates were revised on 1st November  this  year,

five  years  after  the last revision in 1995.   During  this

period,  the  cost  of  mail  processing  and  delivery   has

continued  to  rise  due  to  increases  in  wage  costs  and

administration   costs.   However,   with   automation    and

computerisation,   SingPost  is  able  to   increase   labour

productivity and offset some of these cost increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent revision, it has kept the rates for

domestic standard mail, which accounts for more than  90%  of

domestic  total volume, largely unchanged.  The postage  rate

was  raised only for standard mails in the 40-50 grams weight

step, which comprises less than 0.5% of all standard mails.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked for comparison for postage rates in

Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.  Sir, for the basic 20  grams

standard  size mail, our rate is 0.22 cents.  This is  higher

than 0.14 cents in Brunei and 0.22 cents in Malaysia, due  to

higher  wage structure in Singapore.  If we were  to  compare

our rates with economies of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>

similar  wage  structure, SingPost's rate of  0.22  cents  is

lower  than 0.29 cents in Hong Kong and 0.28 cents in Taiwan.

So on balance, IDA's price control framework does ensure that

our postal rates are competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked about international mail rates. The

two  major cost components are operating costs and payment to

destination  countries.  I wish to point out  that  operating

costs  account for only 38% of the total cost.  The remaining

62%  are  payments to destination countries.   The  rates  of

payment are determined by an International Accounting  System

established  by the Universal Postal Union, and the  payments

are  beyond  the  control of SingPost.  The  recent  hike  in

international  postal rates is to allow SingPost  to  recover

part  of  the increase in the rates of payment to destination

countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, is the

Minister aware that the abolition of second-class postage for

printed  materials by SingPost has resulted in a  substantial

increase  in  the  postal  cost for  business  magazines  and

newsletters alike, which can no longer be posted at a cheaper

second-class mail?  The increase of such postal  rates  could

be  as  high as 67% for local mail and over 100% for overseas

mail.   This is definitely not a pro-business approach and  I

wonder whether the Minister could explain this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned

earlier, in terms of international mail, more than 60% of the

costs  are  really  beyond the control of SingPost.   So  the

increase  in  international  mail  rates  is  really  a  cost

increase  that  we have no choice but to  bear.   As  far  as

domestic  mail  is concerned, the priority  is  to  encourage

automation.   For  example, if companies or  individuals,  in

particular  companies,  are able to  take  advantage  of  the

incentive  schemes offered by SingPost, such as the  domestic

mail  bulk  scheme,  ie,  they  lodge  their  letters  in   a

machineable bar-coded and pre-sorted manner, they can enjoy a

substantial discount from SingPost.  So

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>

my  suggestion is for companies, big and small, to take  full

advantage  of  the  efficiency that can be  achieved  through

automation.   In  this way, we can have a  win-win  situation

between SingPost and the users.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Is the

Minister  aware  that, despite the high rates that  Singapore

charges, in this age today, it sometimes takes four  or  five

days for letters to reach the addressee in Singapore itself?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, for the ordinary letters mailed

in  Singapore, IDA does not just control the rates.  It  also

imposes  performance indicators on SingPost.  For example,  a

certain  percentage of the mail would have  to  be  delivered

within the same day and a certain percentage will have to  be

delivered  by  the  next day.  In the example  cited  by  the

Member  regarding the delay of four to five days, if I  could

have  the information, I would be happy to look into it.   To

the  best  of our knowledge, almost 100% of mails are  either

delivered  on  the same day or by the next day.   But,  as  I

said, I would be happy to have the information so that we can

look  into  this particular incident and see how we  can  get

SingPost to improve on its performance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying that I should

send  to him every letter that I have received three or  four

days  after its posting?  If he wants me to do that,  I  will

flood him with them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> No, Sir. This is not what I meant.

What  I  meant is that we are not aware that there  are  many

letters,  as  mentioned by the Member, being delayed  in  the

mail for three to four days.  That is why I am asking for the

feedback.  If it is indeed true that most of the letters sent

to you ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will flood you with them!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> I would be happy to look into that.

<div align="center"><b>WATER CONTAMINATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a) what measures are being taken to  prevent  a

recurrence of the water contamination problem as had occurred

in  Bukit  Timah  Plaza and Chuan Park Condominium;  and  (b)

whether  the roles and responsibilities of management  agents

and  management corporations in the Land Titles (Strata)  Act

are clearly defined.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, there are two parts

to  this  question.  On the first part, at the  Parliamentary

session  on  9th  October  2000, Mr Tang  Guan  Seng,  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary (Trade and Industry),  has  outlined

the  measures  taken  by  the Public Utilities  Board  (PUB),

together  with  the  Ministry of the  Environment  (ENV),  to

prevent a recurrence of the water contamination problem.   If

the  Member  has more questions, he might wish  to  direct  a

question  to  MTI.  Or else, he might want  to  look  up  the

Hansard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On part (b), on the roles and responsibilities of the

management corporations (MCs), these are clearly spelt out in

the Land Titles (Strata) Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things, the management corporation has the

duty  to  properly  manage,  maintain  and  keep  the  common

property  in  a  state of good and serviceable  repair,  keep

proper records and books of account and insure the property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Act, the MC may appoint a managing agent

(MA)  and,  by  a written instrument, delegates  its  powers,

duties  and functions to the MA.  Where the MC has  delegated

the  performance of a duty to the MA, the Act  provides  that

the   MA  shall  be  liable  for  any  contravention  of  the

provisions of the Act in respect of the delegated  duty.   So

the key words are "delegated duty".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MC will have to decide for itself the duties to be

delegated to the MA, and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>

contractual  terms for the appointment.  If the  MA  did  not

perform, the MC may remove the MA from office.  And like  any

other  commercial  arrangements, the MC  may  also  seek  the

appropriate  legal remedies if it can establish a  breach  of

contract or negligence on the part of the managing agent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where there are provisions in the Land Titles

(Strata) Act, which proved to be inadequate, the Building and

Construction  Authority  (BCA) would initiate  and  recommend

amendments to the Act at the appropriate time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak):</b> Sir, can I ask two

questions?   Firstly, at the moment, since the MA's  contract

is  usually  for  only one year, will the  Ministry  consider

giving  a  longer  contract  for the  MA  to  manage  private

condominiums?  Secondly, water tanks.  Does the Ministry have

special  programmes to ensure that MAs check the water  tanks

within a specific time?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The details of the terms of

a contract are between the MC and the MA.  So if the MC wants

to award the contract for more than one year, it is up to the

MC.   Whether the Ministry looks after the water tank safety,

the   answer   is  really  no,  because  the   Building   and

Construction Authority is the authority on building as far as

structural   integrity  is  concerned.   Water  contamination

problems  are  actually  under the purview  of  MTI  and  the

Ministry   of  the  Environment.   But  just  to   give   the

background, after the Bukit Timah Plaza incident, MTI and ENV

have  instructed all MCs to look at their sanitary pipes  and

to  repair  these pipes if they are corrugated  and  to  also

check  their  water tanks.  They have found  that  the  Bukit

Timah   Plaza   incident  was  an  isolated  problem.    But,

nonetheless, the problem has been fixed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can

I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary if he would say that

the  two cases cited are actually of a very different  nature

and whether the real cause of contamination in the Chuan Park

case has been established?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, may I

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Thank you, Sir. The Police's

Public  Entertainment Licensing Unit (PELU)  issues  licences

for public entertainment and meetings, such as plays, operas,

variety  acts, music performances and talks under the  Public

Entertainments Act.  In deciding whether or not  to  grant  a

licence,  PELU  may  consult  the relevant  authorities  and,

amongst other factors, PELU takes into account law and  order

considerations, including racial and religious  sensitivities

that may be evoked.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "Talaq", which explores marital violence and rape

in  the Indian Muslim community, was first performed in Tamil

by the Agni Kootthu theatre group in December 1998, and twice

in  February 1999.  In assessing applications made in respect

of   those  performances,  PELU  sought  the  National   Arts

Council's  (NAC)  views.  NAC recommended  approval.   Hence,

PELU  approved  the licences for the performances.   However,

following the February 1999 performances, both NAC  and  PELU

received  adverse feedback  that the play was  offensive  and

misrepresented the Indian Muslim community and Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, when Ms Thenmoli, the president of Agni Kootthu,

applied  to  PELU on 19th September 2000 for  "Talaq"  to  be

staged  in  Malay and English on 28th and 29th  October  2000

respectively, PELU sought the views of NAC.  NAC advised PELU

to  seek the views of Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), as

the  play had attracted complaints previously.  MUIS informed

PELU  that  they  had received objections  to  the  play  and

recommended  that PELU turn down the application.   When  NAC

learnt of this, NAC decided to organise a preview of the play

on  16th October 2000.  However, Ms Thenmoli at first refused

to   hold  the  preview  on  the  grounds  that  there   were

representatives from the South Indian Jamiathul Ulama  (SIJU)

on  the  preview panel.  PELU therefore could not  grant  the

licence  for  the  performances.   Ms  Thenmoli  subsequently

changed  her mind and agreed to a preview, which was held  on

23rd  October  2000.  Representatives from MUIS,  SIJU,  Agni

Kootthu and PELU were invited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the following day, NAC and the Drama Review

Committee (DRC) recommended to PELU that the staging  of  the

play  could be allowed, but subject to the removal of certain

references   to  Islam  and  the  announcement   before   the

commencement  of  each  performance  and  in  all   publicity

materials that "although the play is based on the experiences

of  an individual, it is not intended to reflect on or defame

the  Indian  Muslim  community  at  large".   In  giving  its

recommendations, NAC also stated that ultimately it was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>

PELU's  prerogative if it wished to place greater  weight  on

MUIS' views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS had strongly objected to the play as it

contained Quranic references and religious connotations  that

might give the audience a wrong impression of Islam.  In view

of  the NAC and DRC's recommendation, PELU sought MUIS' views

on  whether  NAC's proposed conditions were  adequate.   MUIS

replied that the conditions would not adequately address  the

objections  raised  by  them, and  reiterated  their  earlier

strong   objections   to  the  play.    After   taking   into

consideration  NAC's and MUIS' views, PELU  turned  down  the

application,  as  empowered under section 13  of  the  Public

Entertainments  Act.   PELU  conveyed  its  decision  to   Ms

Thenmoli on 25th October 2000, two days after the preview.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore encourages artistic

expression  and creativity.  But artistic works must  respect

religious  sensitivities in multi-racial and  multi-religious

Singapore.    Artistes  should  be  mindful  of  our   social

realities and avoid creating racial or religious tensions, as

they  too  have  a  responsible role to play  in  helping  to

preserve religious and racial harmony in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I, first of all, say I see that the

overworked  Minister of State is again asked  to  answer  all

these questions whilst the Minister is here.  But that  is  a

matter for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I ask the poor overworked Minister of State, do

I  understand that the objections were first raised  by  some

Indian Muslim men or an association representing them?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I do not know whether

the   Member   heard  my  answer,  but  there  were   earlier

performances  in 1998 and 1999 in Tamil, and objections  were

raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By whom?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> By two groups - SIJU and the

Federation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>

Indian   Muslims.   These  were  not  just  individuals   but

complaints from the members of these two groups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Were there any complaints from any

women's organisations?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Not that I know of. I do not

think there were complaints from women's organisations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister of State or his

Ministry make public the objections by MUIS setting  out  how

it offends the Muslim religion or the Koran?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> That is part of the decision-making process. I do not think it is up to PELU to disclose

all  these grounds.  In fact, 11 specific grounds were given,

on  which  the view was formed that there were references  to

Quranic  verses and also religious connotations  which  would

give  a  wrong  impression  of  Islam.   Here,  because   the

performances were in Malay and English - unlike  the  earlier

performances which were in Tamil where probably the  audience

would be a more limited one - there will be larger audiences.

So  this  will lead possibly to people of other races  having

the  wrong  impression of Islam, having perhaps an  erroneous

and  lower impression of Islam than what it actually is,  and

this may lead to misunderstanding amongst the races.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why was MUIS not told that they were at

liberty, if they thought there were wrong interpretations  of

the Koran or anything else, that they could come out publicly

with  their  statement and so let us have  the  debate  open,

instead of all being decided by the "Commissar"?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, it is up to MUIS if it

wants  to disclose the reasons, but in so far as the  process

is  concerned, PELU has the powers and the discretion, and it

has exercised it objectively and correctly.  I think that  is

the important point - taking all views into consideration.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> First, a point of

clarification.  I believe the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>

first  performances of the play in Tamil  were  subtitled  in

English, so they did in fact reach a wider audience than just

the  Tamil community.  In fact, I think, quite a few English-speaking were there in the audience and understood the play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, all of us here fully understand that we live

in  a  multi-racial  society and that we are  very  sensitive

about  not  offending all our various communities with  their

different religious beliefs.  But there is also a danger of ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I ask the Member to ask her

question?

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Yes. How do we guard against being

overly  sensitive so that we are forever caught in a mind  of

not moving ahead when possibly we are overly sensitive to the

sensibilities of certain communities?  I have read  the  play

and the context of it is very largely domestic violence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I remind the Member that you

are not to make statements during Question time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I thank the Nominated

Member  of Parliament for the clarification.  But I think  we

can still see a difference between looking at a play in Tamil

and  then  reading the English subtitles and the actual  play

being performed in English, because for a start, I think  the

audience  mix  will  be vastly different  and  moreover,  the

impact will be vastly different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we talked about whether PELU should be the

authority  for  arts performances.  In the  arts,  some  will

argue that because of the need to balance artistic merit  and

also the desire of artistes to express themselves and try new

things  and, on the other hand, the need to ensure that  some

of  these sensitivities we talk about are observed,  we  have

asked PELU to look at it, do a review, and the Ministry  will

also  be in consultation with MITA to see who should be  that

one-stop agency.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam missed the

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> The answer is yes. Traffic Police takes a serious

pose a danger to pedestrians.  Motorcyclists who park or ride

think the very nature of his question suggests that it

current guidelines to be gazetted as a national monument.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF NCO Clubhouse was built as a clubhouse in 1951

by  the  British  for  their servicemen.   When  the  British

withdrew  in  1969,  the  building was  handed  over  to  the

Singapore  Government.   It became the SAF NCO  Clubhouse  in

1974.   From  PMB's  research, this building  does  not  have

and condition of the building.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, broadly the criteria

are  in  two  groups.   One  group would  be  the  historical

aspects,  and  the  other  group will  be  the  architectural

aspects.  So there are two different bodies looking at  these

two aspects.  The one looking at the architectural aspect  is

chaired   by   somebody  from  URA  who  is   familiar   with

architecture  and so on.  The two different  committees  will

award  points for the two sets of criteria and, if they  meet

the  cut-off  point,  the  building will  be  considered  for

preservation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> In order to encourage and justify

certain preserved buildings for further redevelopments, would

PMB  consider  granting  them certain incentives  to  further

redevelop  such  shabby buildings, for  instance,  by  giving

greater  plot ratio and greater height to encourage  them  to

carry out redevelopment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry and the

PMB  are  aware  that there are costs involved in  preserving

these buildings.  But I hope the building owners realise that

these  are important historical and national assets.  As  far

as  possible,  we have tried to accommodate the  requirements

and  the needs of the owners.  For example, recently,  during

the  opening of the MITA Building, I announced that  we  have

come  up  with  a new scheme known as Monuments  Category  II

where  we allow the building owners to redevelop the building

so   long  as  they  preserve  essential  components  of  the

building.   It  might be certain sections  like  the  facade.

This  is following the approach taken by URA where they  have

conserved  certain areas in Chinatown and  Little  India,  so

that  the development potential of the building is preserved,

the  plot ratio is still allowed within the limits as set out

in the Master Plan, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two buildings which have been gazetted under

this category and these are the MacDonald House where

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>

we  had the bomb incident during Confrontation, and the other

one  is  Cathay Building.  In these two cases, there will  be

substantial redevelopment.   We are only preserving the front

of  the MacDonald House and, for Cathay Building, we are only

preserving the podium and the entrance.  The Cathay  Building

will  be  redeveloped  into a cineplex with  seven  or  eight

cinemas.   It  will  be  a  very interesting  and  attractive

redevelopment.   But  having said that,  I  am  not  so  sure

whether there is a need for further incentives.  I think  the

Ministry has tried to preserve the values of the buildings in

so  far as to allow redevelopment within the limits of  their

potential  under  the Masterplan, but to go  beyond  that  is

something I am not sure whether Government will agree.

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br><i>Reasons for regulation of TCM practitioners</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Western medicine is the main form of

healthcare  in Singapore, Traditional Chinese Medicine  (TCM)

enjoys  considerable  popularity as a complementary  form  of

healthcare.   It  has been estimated that about  45%  of  the

population had ever consulted a TCM practitioner in the past.

About 12% of the daily outpatient attendances opt to see  TCM

practitioners.  Hence,  TCM is a significant  factor  in  the

healthcare scene in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a similar trend in developed countries. In the

West,   complementary   medicine,  including   TCM,   has   a

significant  following.   Some Western  countries  now  allow

insurance  claims or reimbursement for acupuncture treatment.

Acupuncture  and therapeutic massage (or tui  na)  have  been

popular  among  patients suffering from  painful  conditions.

There  is also the popular belief that TCM is milder and  has

fewer  side  effects,  thus making it  a  preferred  modality

amongst  older persons. As the population in Singapore  ages,

it  is likely that there would be an increased demand for TCM

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of TCM practitioners in Singapore is also

sizeable  and it would probably increase in tandem  with  the

demand  for TCM treatment. A list published by the local  TCM

community  in  1997  indicated  that  there  were  1,807  TCM

practitioners in Singapore.  There is probably more now.  The

training  and  experience of TCM practitioners  in  Singapore

vary.   Some  were self-taught.  Some learned from  peers  or

masters, while others graduated from TCM institutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1994, the Ministry of Health appointed a

Committee  to look into the regulation of TCM.  The Committee

recommended  a phased approach, (ie a step-by-step  approach)

to the regulation of TCM practitioners in order to safeguard

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>

patients'  interest and safety, as well  as  to  enhance  the

standard of training and professionalism of TCM practitioners

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phased approach is necessary, given the complexities

of  regulating TCM practitioners.  Take the case of Hong Kong

as  an  example.   Although Article  138  of  the  Basic  Law

provided  for  the  development of both Western  and  Chinese

medicine,  and  there has been a Working Committee  appointed

since 1989 to promote, develop, and regulate TCM, the Chinese

Medicine  Ordinance was only enacted after 10 years  in  July

1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the regulatory process in Singapore, the

Ministry of Health first encouraged the eight main local  TCM

organisations  to  form  the  Singapore  Traditional  Chinese

Medicine  Organisations Coordinating Committee  (STCMOCC)  in

1996.   The  STCMOCC serves as the coordinating body  amongst

the  mainstream TCM community.  It also acts as a channel  of

communication  between the mainstream TCM community  and  the

Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that this arrangement has worked well. The

formation  of STCMOCC has led to the upgrading of  the  local

TCM  training course to a 6-year part-time diploma course  in

1996.   The  STCMOCC has also worked out  a  listing  of  TCM

practitioners  in Singapore. That was how  we  knew  that  in

1997,  there  were 1,807 TCM practitioners in Singapore.   In

fact,  this  Bill  was prepared with useful inputs  from  the

STCMOCC.   The Bill indeed has the support of the  mainstream

TCM community in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Major provisions in the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to present the main

provisions  of the Bill. This Bill is an enabling legislation

to  allow the Minister to declare any type of practice of TCM

for  registration if he is of the opinion that it is  in  the

public  interest for that type of practice to  be  regulated.

In  other words, the Minister will decide which form  of  TCM

practice to be regulated at which point of time.  It will not

be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>

that,  with the promulgation of this Act, every form  of  TCM

practice will be regulated.  Clause 14(1) of the Bill  states

that  the  Minister can regulate by order  published  in  the

Gazette.   This  is  in  line with the  phased  approach  the

Ministry of Health has been adopting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health's intention is to start with

regulating  the  acupuncturists, because  acupuncture  is  an

invasive   procedure  that  carries  risks  of   injury   and

infection.   It  is  estimated that  there  are  about  1,070

acupuncturists  in Singapore. This will then be  followed  by

the registration of TCM general practitioners in about 3 to 4

years' time, and the TCM herbal dispensers at a later date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill takes reference from the existing medical- and

health-related  legislation such as the Medical  Registration

Act, the Dentists Act as well as the Nurses and Midwives Act.

All these Acts are essentially based on self-regulation. This

Bill  provides for the establishment of a Traditional Chinese

Medicine  Practitioners Board appointed by  the  Minister  to

register TCM practitioners, to accredit TCM training  courses

and  institutions,  as well as to regulate  the  professional

conduct  and  ethics of TCM practitioners.   The  Board  will

consist  of  5  to 9 members, comprising peers from  the  TCM

community,  members  of the medical profession,  as  well  as

representatives from the Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board can appoint Committees to which specific tasks

are  delegated.   For  example,  the  Board  may  appoint  an

Examinations Committee to set standards and to determine  the

content  of the qualifying examinations for registration,  as

well  as  to  oversee  the organisation and  conduct  of  the

examinations.  Also,  the  Board  may  appoint  Investigation

Committees to investigate complaints which may lead the Board

to take disciplinary actions against practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TCM Practitioners Board will have disciplinary

powers  to  deal  with any registered TCM practitioner  found

guilty of professional misconduct, professional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>

negligence,  or improper conduct, which renders  him  or  her

unfit to practise.   The Board may -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) caution or censure the practitioner;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) impose a fine of not more than $10,000;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) impose conditions on the practitioner's

registration for a period of no more than three years;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) suspend his or her registration for no more than

three years; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) cancel his or her registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any practitioner who is aggrieved by the decision of the

Board  may appeal to the High Court within 30 days.  A person

whose  registration has been cancelled can apply to the Board

for  restoration  three years after the date of  cancellation

and  not more than once in any period of 12 months.  This  is

similar to the provisions made under the Medical Registration

Act as well as the Dentists Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deter unlawful practice of TCM, the Bill provides for

the  imposition of penalties similar to the provisions of the

Dentists Act. The Courts may fine the offender not more  than

$25,000 or imprison him for a term not exceeding sixmonths or

both.   In  the  case of a second or subsequent offence,  the

penalty  is  increased to a fine of not more than $50,000  or

imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who procures or attempts to procure

registration by fraud shall be liable on conviction to a fine

not  exceeding  $10,000 or to imprisonment  for  a  term  not

exceeding  two  years or to both.  This  is  similar  to  the

provisions of the Medical Registration Act.

<br><br><i>Implementation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health's plan is to

subject acupuncturists to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>

registration by 1st January 2002. Details of the registration

as well as the criteria for registration have been worked out

with  the STCMOCC, the coordinating committee that represents

the mainstream TCM practitioners in Singapore.   The criteria

take   into   consideration  both  experience  as   well   as

qualifications.   Those  who  do  not  have   the   necessary

experience  or  qualifications may  be  required  to  pass  a

national examination called the Common Acupuncture Qualifying

Examination   (CAQE)   before  they   become   eligible   for

registration.   The Ministry of Health and the  STCMOCC  have

initiated the Acupuncture Upgrading Training Course (AUTC) in

order  to  prepare  acupuncturists for the CAQE.  The  course

syllabus  and course structure were formulated and  developed

by the STCMOCC as well as the Ministry of Health, with inputs

from foreign TCM experts.  The first four classes of AUTC had

started  since  September this year.  The response  has  been

very good.  We plan to conduct two or three CAQEs in the year

2001,  so  there should be sufficient time and  opportunities

for  the  acupuncturists to pass their  examinations  and  to

register by 1st January 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the TCM Practitioners Board is formed, it will take

over  these tasks from the Ministry of Health.  The  Ministry

and the Board will maintain close contact with the STCMOCC to

ensure  that  constructive proposals from the mainstream  TCM

community are taken into consideration.  The registration  of

the  acupuncturists  will  provide  valuable  experience   to

prepare  us  for  the  eventual  registration  of  other  TCM

practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, statutory regulation of TCM practice

is  necessary to safeguard patients' interest and safety.  We

have  to  ensure that TCM practitioners are properly  trained

and  qualified  before they are allowed to  practise.   There

should also be a framework to raise the professional standard

of TCM practitioners in Singapore. All these are provided for

in  this Bill.  The mainstream TCM community, represented  by

STCMOCC,   has  played an active part in the  preparation  of

this Bill. This Bill has their support.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

support  the  Bill introduced by the Parliamentary  Secretary

on   Traditional  Chinese  Medicine  (TCM).   With  an  aging

population,   more  and  more  people  are  seeking   medical

attention, and  most elderly people are more comfortable with

TCM,  including acupuncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the Bill cover mainly two areas - one,

the   setting   up   of   a  Traditional   Chinese   Medicine

Practitioners  Board,  and  the  other,  provisions  for  the

conduct of examinations in TCM.  On the establishment of  the

TCM  Practitioners  Board, I wish to raise five points  which

concern public interest:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, with the registration of TCM practitioners,

will   the   medical  certificates  (MCs)   issued   by   TCM

practitioners  enjoy the same status as  the  MCs  issued  by

western-trained  doctors,  and be  recognised  by  Government

departments and employers in the private sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will the receipts issued by TCM practitioners

be accepted by employers for reimbursement of medical fees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if a TCM practitioner is of the opinion that

his patient is seriously ill and warrants immediate attention

by  doctors  in the A&E unit of a Government or  restructured

hospital,  will the referral letter by a TCM practitioner  be

accepted for the purpose?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, currently, pharmacists in Singapore have to be

registered  and  licensed in order to practise.   Under  this

Bill,  will the Chinese drugstores be required  to apply  for

permits or licences to sell herbs or Chinese patent medicine?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, will the Bill incorporate a set of code of

conduct for the Chinese medicine practitioners to follow?  At

the  same time, will the TCM practitioners be required to  be

properly attired when they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>

attending to their patients?   I have occasions to visit  TCM

practitioners  in  Singapore, and  I  notice  that  they  are

usually  not  too particular about their attire.  Some  would

wear  an  open-collar short-sleeve shirt, and some even  wear

the  traditional Chinese pyjama pants when they see patients.

The   practice  in  China  is  quite  different.   All  their

physicians wear smart-looking white physician's coat whenever

they are on duty, giving a very professional image.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at western-trained doctors like Dr Tan

Cheng  Bock, he always wears a tie and he looks very handsome

indeed.  For the lady doctors, like Dr Lily Neo,  she  always

pays  great attention to her attire, and dressed beautifully.

This reflects the professionalism in them.   I hope that  TCM

practitioners in Singapore will also pay attention  to  their

attire.   Once  this  Bill is passed, I  hope  that  our  TCM

practitioners   will  do  their  best  to   reinforce   their

professional image.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Traditional  Chinese  Medicine (TCM) community  in  Singapore

must   be  gratified  and  elated  by  the  introduction   of

Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Bill in Parliament

today  by  Mr  Chan Soo Sen, Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is currently strongly advocating research

and  development   on  the  life  sciences  with  a  view  to

developing  this field into  another pillar of  our  economy.

Now,  through  legislation, the Government has  included  the

practice  of  TCM  in  the  scope  of  orthodox  medical  and

healthcare  industry  in  Singapore,  thereby  according  the

Chinese  physicians  and practitioners in  the  TCM  industry

their   due   legal  status.  This  approach   is   certainly

foresighted, appropriate, and wise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the development of TCM is well

established  with  a  history of a few thousand  years.   The

abundant  knowledge  of TCM is quite profound  and  extensive

since   it  has  taken  generations  to  accumulate   through

continuous  medical  practice and  combat  against  diseases.

Yet,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>

there is still room for the abundant knowledge on traditional

herbal treatment and acupuncture to be further developed.  As

such,   in addition to recognizing and regulating TCM through

legislation, I would urge the Government to allocate adequate

resources  to  train and recruit ample supply of  outstanding

TCM practitioners and researchers to study and develop TCM so

as to make it a part of the development of the life sciences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the escalating cost of

western  medical  treatment  and  medicines,  TCM  has   been

providing our people with an alternative way to seek  cheaper

and  more  convenient health care service.   According  to  a

relevant   statistical   report,   out   of   three   million

Singaporeans, there have been more than  a million visits  to

the  various  TCM  hospitals  and  clinics  every  year.   In

addition,  many people simply go directly to a  TCM  shop  to

purchase  medicine over-the-counter and take it  without  any

medical advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics from 1999 showed that the Chung Hwa Free

Clinic  established  by  the  Singapore  Chinese  Physicians'

Association in 1952 sees an average of 900 patients per  day.

In  other  words, for more than four decades,  it  must  have

treated some eight million patients. The Singapore Thong Chai

Medical  Institution has been receiving  an  average  of  700

patients daily since 1867.  The Public Free Clinic was opened

in 1974 and has about 400 patients every day.  Moreover, many

charities  such  as the Singapore Buddhist Free  Clinic,  the

Singapore  Buddhist Lodge, and the Kwan-In  Welfare  Society,

Singapore,  together receive more than 1,000 patients  daily.

As  to the 1900-odd Singapore TCM practitioners, many of them

see  more than 100 patients each in their respective  clinics

each day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, many people, especially those in the lower

income group, are deeply concerned that the cost of TCM

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>

may  be increased once it is regulated.  I would suggest that

the  Government  refrain from imposing  excessive  levies  or

unnecessary red-tapes when issuing practising certificates to

the  practitioners so as to avoid additional  cost  to  them.

Professional   practitioners  should  also   exercise   self-discipline.  Unreasonable charges may add on medical expenses

of  the  ordinary citizens, bringing them extra  burdens  and

compelling  them to switch to western medicine or even  self-medication  to  reduce  their  medical  expenses.    To   TCM

practitioners it would be more of a loss than a gain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, wholesalers and retailers of Chinese

medicine  also worry that once the law comes into force  they

may  be  obligated  to hire registered TCM  practitioners  or

pharmacists  to be stationed at their shops to operate  their

business   lawfully. Currently, most of the  shops  have  the

owners   or   the  "old-hands"  or  supervisors  to   provide

consultation and to help them dispense the correct  herbs  in

their   correct  dosages  as  prescribed  by  the  physicians

elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, there is no so-called "controlled"

or  "non-controlled"  drugs, as far as  Chinese  medicine  in

Singapore is concerned.  However, the import and retail sales

of  Chinese  herbs  are subjected to strict  control  by  the

Ministry of Health. If any ingredient harmful to human health

is  detected,  import  of the medicine  will  be  immediately

banned and the medicine or herb will be prohibited from being

sold   in  Singapore.  In  other  words,  all  Chinese  herbs

presently  sold  are uncontrolled drugs which  are  safe  for

human consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a common practice to see customers bringing their

prescriptions to the TCM shop for the herbs to be  dispensed.

Selling  the  herbs  and  dispensing them  according  to  the

prescriptions  produced by the customers are also  the  basic

business and service available at all TCM shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, if these shops would have to hire registered or

certified practitioners to run

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>

the  day-to-day  business, life would be extremely  difficult

for  the  TCM  shop-owners. The laws should be enforced  only

after all the conditions are met; otherwise, the business  of

the existing 1,000 or so TCM shops would be severely affected

and  the  overall medical service, health care, and even  the

economy would suffer a negative chain impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a TCM shop sells only patent and common over-the-counter medicines it should not come under the provisions of

the  Bill.   This  is  the same as in the  western   medicine

pharmacy  where the presence of in-house pharmacists  is  not

mandatory  if no prescribed medications are sold in the shop.

I believe that in order to enhance and control the quality of

retail  TCM shops we should consider the present practice  of

the  TCM shops. Only if we take a pragmatic approach can  our

policy  achieve the anticipated results.  If  in  the  future

they  are  required to have registered practitioners  in  the

shop,  they  should also be given ample time to  train  their

staff. Also, for the best result, it is important to have the

cooperation of the TCM community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Government's intention to

establish a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners  Board

to  appraise the practitioners' qualifications and  to  issue

certificates so as to ensure that the practitioners observe a

high-level code of conduct, and to promote TCM education  and

training  plans.  From  the national medical  and  healthcare

standpoint, this Bill is rather critical as it has a profound

impact on our TCM's survival and development. I would suggest

that the Government  invite TCM-related groups to sit on this

Board to tap their expertise and experience.  I believe  with

the  cooperation of the Government and related industry, this

innovative  policy  will  achieve  successful  results.   The

development of our TCM will also attain remarkable results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support this Bill.  As my name was mentioned, I thought I had

better say a few words on this Bill too.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is welcome. As a Western-trained doctor, I

still feel that we should register these practitioners.   The

main  thing  that  we must consider is a  good  standard  and

training   for  all  TCM  practitioners.   Medical   students

training  to become doctors have to go through six  years  of

rigorous training, including one year of medical housemanship

before  they  can come out and practise.  That  is  important

because we are dealing with lives.  For students who want  to

take  up  medicine, they have to achieve very good grades  at

'O'  and  'A' levels.  So we are picking the top of  the  'A'

level  cohort to become doctors.  That should be  so  because

the  training to be a doctor is very tough and we are putting

all  these people out to treat patients eventually.   Rightly

so, we should maintain this very high standard in the medical

schools.   I  am  hoping that with the  registration  of  TCM

practitioners,  all these TCM practitioners  should  also  be

trained  very  rigorously  so that  when  they  come  out  to

practise they will also be of a very high standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we expect the entry for Singaporeans to become TCM

practitioners, let us say at 'O' level or just very poor  'A'

level  results,  we  might be getting poor quality  graduates

from  the  TCM school.  It would be good to maintain  a  very

high standard of entry for these Singaporeans who want to  be

TCM practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng brought up the point whether, having

registered the TCM practitioners, we would recognise them  or

not.   It is a question of registration and recognition.   If

recognition is accorded to them, we must also be prepared  to

recognise the medical certificate.  I am not sure what  level

of  recognition he is talking about.  Is it just  recognition

that  they can practise or recognition at the same  level  as

medical practitioners?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the three

Members  who have supported the Bill and offered constructive

observations and suggestions.  Since most of the  discussions

were in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>

Mandarin,  allow me also to answer the questions in Mandarin,

if Dr Tan Cheng Bock does not mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, I would like to thank Mr Tay Beng

Chuan, Mr Ang Mong Seng and Dr Tan Cheng Bock for their  very

good   and  constructive   suggestions.   Let  me  take  this

opportunity to respond to the issues raised by them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan said that when the Government

registers  the  TCM  practitioners,  it  should  not   impose

excessive  levies  or  red  tapes to  increase  their  costs,

leading to higher fees for the patients.  I can assure Mr Tay

Beng  Chuan that this is not the intention of the Government.

I believe that the Chinese physicians will not and should not

take  the  registration as an excuse to increase  their  fees

either.  I believe the fees would be a very small portion  of

their  revenue..  The doctors, dentists and pharmacists  also

pay  a  one-time registration fee.  The doctors and  dentists

pay  $200  and  the pharmacists pay $100.   Every  year,  the

doctors and the dentists pay a licence fee of $200, while the

pharmacists  pay $100.  Assuming the licence and registration

fees  for  TCM  practitioners are  similar,  these  are  very

nominal sums.  They should not affect the consultation  fees.

I  must  emphasise that these were figures for  illustration.

The  actual registration and licence fees would be determined

by the TCM Practitioners Board after its establishment.  I am

sure  that  the  Board  will  take  into  consideration   the

prevailing charges for the doctors, dentists and pharmacists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure TCM practitioners realise that their fees are

determined  by  market  forces.  As Mr  Tay  Beng  Chuan  has

mentioned,  if the fees are too expensive, the  patients  may

opt  to  see  the western doctors instead.   I  am  sure  TCM

practitioners  will not kill the goose that lays  the  golden

eggs  by arbitrarily raising their fees. If there is a  need,

the  Singapore Traditional Chinese Medicine Organisations Co-ordinating Committee (STCMOCC), the Committee representing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>

mainstream TCM community could, like the  Singapore   Medical

Association  (SMA) for the doctors, provide  fees  guidelines

for  various treatments. If a patient feels that he has  been

over-charged,  he  can  complain to the  Traditional  Chinese

Medicine  Practitioners  Board,  Consumers'  Association   of

Singapore  (CASE),  or  to the courts.   These  are  channels

through which they could seek redress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has also raised the issue concerning

training  of  herbal dispensers working in TCM retail  shops.

The  Government has no immediate plans to make it  compulsory

for TCM retail shops to engage a certain number of registered

TCM  practitioners or herbal dispensers. Even  if  we  do  so

eventually, it would be done in stages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is true that the training standards of

herbal   dispensers   working  in  TCM  retail   shops   vary

considerably.  It is necessary to upgrade their  training  so

that the TCM shops can serve their customers better. Ministry

of  Health  had discussed this with the Singapore Traditional

Chinese   Medicine  Organisations  Committee   (STOC)   which

represented  the TCM traders and retail shops.  We  are  very

happy  that  STOC  recognises this, and  is  planning  for  a

training  course  for herbal dispensers. Ministry  of  Health

will  work  with STOC to work out the course, and  will  help

STOC  to  invite foreign TCM experts to appraise and evaluate

the  training courses. If all parties work together,  we  can

start offering the herbal dispensers' training course in  one

or  two  years' time. This will  make important contributions

towards lifting the service standards of TCM retail shops  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng touched on the professional image and

code  of  conduct for TCM practitioners.  Dr Tan  Cheng  Bock

also  raised  similar concerns.  Under  this  Bill,  the  TCM

Practitioners  Board  will  consist  of  well-respected   TCM

practitioners as well as some western doctors.  They will  be

in good positions to work out the code of conduct for the TCM

practitioners.  I hope the TCM Practitioners

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>

Board  come  out  with  some formal guidelines  so  that  the

registered  TCM practitioners can refer to.  I  do  not  know

whether they would go into details such as male practitioners

to  put on a tie and dressed up as handsomely as Dr Tan Cheng

Bock,  while  the lady practitioners  dress up as beautifully

as Dr Lily Neo, as observed by Mr Ang Mong Seng.  It is up to

the  Board  to  decide. However, the Board can supervise  and

take  disciplinary actions against practitioners who  conduct

themselves unprofessionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Dr Tan Cheng Bock both touched on

the  recognition of  Medical Certificates (MCs) and  receipts

issued  by  TCM  practitioners for the  purpose  of  employee

medical benefits.  I feel that it is premature to talk  about

this  matter  at  this point of time.   Whether  or  not  the

employers  will recognise the Medical Certificates issued  by

TCM  practitioners and  reimburse the cost of TCM  treatment,

will depend on whether the employers are satisfied   that the

Chinese  physicians  are of high professional  standing,  and

whether the employers are comfortable with the authority  and

authenticity of these documents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the professional standard of our TCM practitioners

has  arrived,  more and more employers will  recognise  their

Medical  Certificates.  The Government  cannot  legislate  to

compel  them  to  recognise these Medical  Certificates.  The

decision  should be taken by the employers.  I feel that  the

most  important task for the TCM community now is to  upgrade

their  professional  standard and  image,  not  only  to  the

satisfaction of the patients but also to the satisfaction  of

the  employers.  When this is achieved, the issue of  MC  and

receipt recognition will resolve itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether the Government and

restructured   hospitals  would  accept  referrals   by   TCM

practitioners for emergency treatment.  I must say that  this

problem  does  not exist at all.  If a patient  is  seriously

ill,  whether  or not he has a referral letter by  a  western

doctor or a Chinese physician, he would be attended to by the

hospitals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Tay Beng Chuan have also asked

about   licensing   requirements  to  sell   Chinese   herbs.

Regulating  sales of Chinese medical products does  not  come

under  this Bill.  This comes under the Medicines Act.  Under

the Medicines Act, TCM retail shops do not need a licence  to

sell    approved  TCM  products.   When  Ministry  of  Health

considers whether a certain TCM product is approved for  sale

in  Singapore,  we are concerned primarily  with  harmful  or

toxic  ingredients,  mixing of Chinese  and  Western  medical

ingredients, and excessive claims on the effect.  There  will

be  no  change  as  this Bill has no impact on  the  existing

regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked about the admission

criteria for candidates to be enrolled at training institutes

for  TCM  practitioners. This has been set to be the same  as

entry  requirement to Polytechnics. The institutions training

these  TCM  practitioners are generally  satisfied  with  the

quality of  candidates seeking admission to their institutes.

The  quality has been going up. Some trainees have university

degrees.   I  have  come  across  two  doctors  amongst   the

trainees.  They  felt  learning  about  Traditional   Chinese

Medicine could help in their practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this Bill giving TCM more

status,  I  feel that the quality of trainees going  for  TCM

courses   will  get  even  better.  But  we  cannot   achieve

everything all at once.  The TCM training course duration has

already been raised from five-year part-time to six-year part-time.   One of the TCM organisations is introducing a  three-

year   full-time   course  jointly  with  the   Nanjing   TCM

University.   These  are all signs of  progress.   With  this

Bill,  I  feel that the progress will be even faster and  TCM

will have a better future in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask the

Parliamentary Secretary to clarify a point?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he would leave it to the employers to

decide   whether  or  not  they  recognise  the  TCM  medical

certificate.  Can I ask whether the Government recognises the

TCM medical certificate?  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>

second  point  is  that there must be a minimum  standard  of

entry.   At the moment, having heard what he said,  it  seems

that  you take in anyone who has some qualifications.  But  I

feel that there must be a certain minimum standard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment the

Government  does  not  recognise  an  MC  issued  by  a   TCM

practitioner.  I  do  not  know when  the  Government  as  an

employer will eventually recognise it.  It all depends on how

the  TCM  practitioners   raise their  professional  standard

sufficiently,  to  a  level where we feel  confident  we  can

consider  that  particular question.   The  earlier  the  TCM

community raise their standard, the earlier this question can

be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of minimum entry requirements for

attending  TCM courses, we now have TCM courses conducted  by

two  of  our biggest TCM organisations.  One is in Chung  Hwa

Free  Clinic and the other one is in the Public Free  Clinic.

After they have attended a six-year course, the trainees  are

awarded  diplomas.  Hence it is in order  to  peg  the  entry

requirement to be similar to that of the polytechnics,  which

also offer diploma courses.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Parliamentary  Secretary  has  been  acupuncturing  away  his

points.  What I want to ask him is what measures are there in

terms  of  monitoring abuses and poor standard  of  practice?

What  measures have been instituted or put in place?  Because

there are likely to be abuses and other related problems, how

are  these  going  to be dealt with in the  interest  of  the

public?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Vasoo, you are not seeking

clarification.  You are asking totally new questions and  you

should have participated in the debate earlier on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> No, I am asking him to clarify.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chan, would you like to respond quickly?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that this

question probably would be answered by the TCM Practitioners'

Board when it is set up.  But at the moment, TCM practice  is

not  regulated.  So there is really no channel for this  kind

of  reporting.  But if people are injured because of unlawful

medical  treatment, under the current provisions  the  person

who  gave  that  treatment can be charged under  the  Medical

Practitioners Act.  This is the only recourse that they  have

now.    When  this  Bill  has  been  passed,  when  the   TCM

Practitioners'  Board has been set up, there   will  be  more

recourse for reporting and investigating abuses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Just a point of

clarification.  Going back to the earlier point made  by  the

Parliamentary  Secretary, my question  is:  how  is  the  TCM

institute able to draw capable people if the Government  does

not take the first step of recognising the qualifications  by

the institute?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned

earlier,  there is a big market out there for TCM  treatment.

There  are  people  who  just  somehow  prefer  to  see   TCM

practitioners for certain conditions.  This is  not  confined

only  to the older people.  For example, I know young  people

who  injured  themselves while playing golf telling  me  that

they  go  for  acupuncture.  Also, because of the  increasing

popularity  of TCM treatment even in western countries,  some

of  our  people  are beginning to feel that  TCM  is  a  good

alternative form of medicine. Just imagine there is  no  need

to  take medicine, just go for tui na and acupuncture.  There

are  people who prefer that.  So there is really a market for

TCM  treatment, notwithstanding the fact that  their  Medical

Certificates are not recognised by the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first

of  all,  I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary's

positive replies  to the points raised by us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Government's unwillingness to

recognise  the  MCs and receipts issued by TCM practitioners,

what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>

if  these  receipts  are accepted by  the  employers  in  the

private  sector  for  reimbursement  of  medical  fees?  What

happens when they submit these receipts in their tax returns?

Will  there be any problem?  On the other hand, if these  MCs

and receipts are not recognised,  the practice and future  of

the  TCM practitioners will be affected,  and it will  affect

the  patients too.  People may not want to join the  rank  of

the TCM practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will seriously reconsider the

issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, whether

the employers recognise TCM  MCs or whether patients want  to

see  the  TCM  practitioners would depend very  much  on  the

practitioners  themselves. If they continuously  raise  their

standard  of  practice,  the issue  of  recognition  will  be

resolved as a matter of time.  I understand the aspiration of

the  TCM  practitioners that the Government and the employers

will  recognise  their receipts and Medical  Certificates.  I

would  appeal to them to support this Bill, help Ministry  of

Health  implement  it  well, and upgrade  their  professional

standard and image. I believe the day will come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

Dr Neo, you can move your motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, recognising the need to maintain a

balance   between   the   demands   of   work   and    family

responsibility, urges the Government to promote  (a)  family-friendly and pro-family work practices and facilities and (b)

policies  and  programmes  that support  and  strengthen  the

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of maintaining a balance between work and

family  is  especially important and relevant to us  at  this

very  juncture  of  our  nation's  development.   Harmonizing

family  and  work is the key to happier families, to  promote

stable homes and thereby a stronger nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to balance between work and family has become

an  issue  that concerns everybody and involves equally  both

the  fathers and the mothers of our families.  It is no  more

just  the  concern of fathers alone who used to be  the  main

providers  of  families.   Singaporean  women  do  contribute

substantially to our economy considering that  the  share  of

females in the labour force was 42% last year.  Now more than

ever,  Sir, women are required to be in partnership with  men

to bring our economy to new heights.  This partnership should

embrace  a  wider  field  of various  areas  like  parenting,

household chores, economic contributions, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining a balance between work and family is also a

crucial  factor  in  our  efforts  to  increase  the   "total

fertility  rate"  (TFR) which currently  stands,  Sir,  at  a

dismal 1.5 for Singapore.  At present, many people lament  on

the  lack of time for bigger family due to the need for  both

parents to work.  Therefore, harmonizing work and family will

certainly help address our declining birth rates.  There are,

of   course,   other  contributory  factors,  such   as   the

expectations  of parents and their ability to  better  juggle

and manage their time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that in Italy and Spain, where

traditional gender expectations are similar to Singapore, the

fertility

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>

rates  were  1.2  and 1.4 respectively.   In  these  southern

countries  of  Europe,  most  childcare  is  still   arranged

privately  (grandmothers take care of children while  parents

are  at work and fathers do not look after children at  all).

There is this common expectation that parenting and household

chores  are  the responsibility of the women.  Sir,  this  is

also  the  kind of stereotyped mindset that has been impinged

on  us for decades and is a major stumbling block, apart from

other  factors, for our present predicament.  It is necessary

for  the socio-cultural attitude in Singapore to change  with

regard to gender acceptance.  Men have to reconsider the role

they  must  assume in the Singaporean households.   Are  they

contributing to lighten the load of motherhood?  Are  fathers

still  clinging on to the cultures that foster the  image  of

being  not  manly to do "women's work"?  Are they having  the

"hands-off   attitude"  with  regard  to  child-rearing   and

household  chores?  Sir, these old mindsets must go  so  that

our womenfolk would become more willing to have more children

knowing that they can have the support of their husbands.

<br><br><i>Set up comprehensive formulation and implementation of policies including positive actions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the northern European countries, government

handouts  and support have helped ease the burden of  raising

children.  Denmark has a "total fertility rate" of 1.7, which

is  relatively higher compared to, say, Italy with a  TFR  of

1.2.   Sir,  the level of childcare facilities  and  parental

benefits  seems  to  make  a  significant  difference.   Most

countries  on the southern rim of Europe, such as  Italy  and

Spain,  have  some of the lowest TFR on the  continent.   The

governments there provide much less child-related  allowances

than  the  Nordic countries.  These northern  countries  have

some  of  the  highest fertility rates  in  Europe  and  this

despite the fact that the proportion of women in their labour

force  is  also  among the highest.  Childcare  services  are

widely  available and are subsidised up to 85% in some cases.

In addition, the labour

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>

markets  in  the northern European countries are a  lot  more

flexible  than  in the rest of the region.   Part-time  jobs,

flexible  working  hours and tele-working are  not  uncommon.

Financial support, in the form of birth and child allowances,

is  provided and, in certain cases, up to the time the  child

reaches  adulthood.   It would appear  that  the  higher  TFR

resulted from a more conducive environment for adults to have

children  without  giving up or losing  their  jobs.   Labour

force  incentives are more important than monetary incentives

in their case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the announcement by Prime Minister Goh

on  baby bonuses, maternity leave for third child and setting

up of a Ministerial Committee to study declining fertility is

a good and welcome start.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the incentives in monetary terms may make a

bigger  difference to those in the lower income families  and

not  the  better-off families who will look beyond the  money

incentives   and  look  at  childcare  options,   "stressful"

education,  career  attainment  and  burden-free  lifestyles.

Additionally, administrative and workplace measures  are  the

main  concerns of many higher-income earners.  Incentives  on

getting  employers  to provide practices  that  help  workers

harmonise  work  and family will be useful.  Incentives  that

encourage  companies to follow pro-family policies for  their

workers,  especially for those with young families should  be

offered.  Perhaps, for a start, we may look at the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. There must be a change in the mindset of those

employers who prefer employees with no family commitments  in

terms  of  hiring  and  job  promotion,  and  so  on.    Some

incentives  and  campaigns are certainly needed,  indeed,  in

this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Incentives for big companies to set up their own

childcare centres will ease many parents with the convenience

of  having  their children at or near their workplace.   This

will  benefit  the  working parents as they can  conveniently

deposit  and  pick up their children as well  as  visit  them

during tea breaks or at lunch time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Our Government should consider providing free

medical treatment for our pre-school children.  The Singapore

Government  spends  only about 1.1%  of  GDP  on  healthcare.

This,  Sir, is one of the lowest in a developed country where

the  usual average is about 5% to 7%.  The healthcare  burden

on  the  people is high in Singapore.  The public  healthcare

expenditure  is  1.1%  of  GDP  and  the  private  healthcare

expenditure  is 2% of GDP or twice the amount  spent  by  the

Government.   This  contrasts  significantly  with  that   in

England  where  the  private share  is  only  one  sixth,  in

Australia where the private share is only half, and  in  Hong

Kong  and Malaysia where the ratio is roughly one to one.   I

feel  it  is,  hence, reasonable to urge  our  Government  to

increase   the   spending  on  public  healthcare   for   all

Singaporean  children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Housing is an important consideration to most

people.   The  incentive given to help a young couple  own  a

flat  is welcome indeed.  More help should be given to  those

couples  who prefer to rent flats instead, for a  variety  of

reasons.   In  my meet-the-people sessions, I  have,  many  a

time, found it necessary to sympathise with some constituents

who  needed  rental flats badly due to overcrowding.   Often,

they  were  sharing two-room or three-room flats  with  other

members  of their families.  Worse still, some had their  own

babies coming on the way.

<br><br><i>Promote family-friendly work environment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the United States has never tried shaping the birth

rate or pushing any population policy, yet its fertility rate

of  2.1  is  the  highest  for the industrialised  countries.

Whilst  immigration  is an important contributory  factor,  a

major  difference is made by the US workforce  that  is  more

family-friendly  now and is a source of support  for  working

parents with children.  The US has accommodated the need  for

two-earner  families better than many European  countries  in

various ways.  Companies offer wide-ranging creative services

from  childcare  to shoe repair, from paternity  leave  to  a

cafeteria that prepares take-home meals.  The "Working

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>

Mother"  magazine releases an annual ranking of the  top  100

companies  for working mums, and companies like to  highlight

that inclusion in this special list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a company's bottom-line need not be affected just

because  money is spent on family-friendly practices.   After

all, its money-making ability depends, to a large extent,  on

the  well-being  of  its staff.  The  personal  life  of  its

employees can have a major impact on a company's performance.

Employers  who give their employees flexibility in  balancing

their  work and personal lives will actually see an  increase

in  profits.   I  read in the Straits Times  that  the  First

Tennessee  Bank  in  the United States which  had  taken  the

family-friendly  route,  saw  a  7%  increase   in   customer

retention and a US$106 million increase in profits, two years

after doing so.  Employees who have work-family conflicts are

three  times more likely to think about quitting their  jobs.

In  contrast,  employees who have supportive  workplace  have

greater job satisfaction and are more willing to put in extra

effort  to  help  the company succeed.  Sir, the  Government,

being   the   largest  employer  in  Singapore,   should   be

championing a family-friendly civil service and must take the

lead in this area.

<br><br><i>Facilitate women to participate in the workforce through flexible work arrangements like part-time work, flexi-time work, tele-work, and so on</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility in work arrangements must become more

accepted  by  companies.  The concept must be  such  that  an

employee may work non-normal hours so long as productivity is

not  compromised despite the unusual arrangements.  I am glad

that  some  of our Government Ministries have just started  a

pilot  scheme  of having extended public service  hours  that

will  result  in staff having Saturdays off on  a  rotational

basis.   I  hope this scheme will be extended to  all  public

services in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir, rotation between the staff to

work  certain time slots is possible and can enhance  quality

of life.  With such flexi-time work, parents may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>

then  opt for certain "off-duty" time slots to coincide  with

their children's extra curricular activities, and so on.  The

opportunity for such interaction and contact with children is

important; the prospect of more leisure time is an adjunct of

a developed economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tele-working is well suited to women with young

children.  More such jobs should be made available  to  them.

Employers must trust that work can also be done without staff

at their seats within certain set hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time workers should be reimbursed on their CPF and

medical benefits as for full-time workers.  Also, many  part-time  workers do not get the same career advancement  as  for

full-time  workers.  Contract workers, likewise, should  have

their lot enhanced.  They should be provided adequate "safety

net" benefits.  Perhaps, the Government would look into these

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore is a fast ageing society with a

decreasing  working  to  non-working  ratio,  the  need   for

flexibility  in work arrangement is destined  to  stay.   The

trend, in the not too distant future, will be for more people

to  require time off to look after their aged parents.  Thus,

pro-family  policies at work should encompass the  employee's

responsibility towards their aged parents as well.

<br><br><i>Improve our childcare facilities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is still short of childcare

centres.   MCDS  is  planning  to  increase  the  number   of

childcare  centres by 25% to 58,000 within three  years  from

the present 46,000 places.  We should use this opportunity to

better  plan  the  childcare centres.  And, besides  numbers,

better  childcare  centres should be provided  for  certified

professionals and dedicated staff will give peace of mind  to

parents  who  now want professional care for their  children.

Enhancement of childcare facilities, such as more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>

precinct-based   childcare  centres,  developing   "borrow-a-granny"  and  "share-a-maid" schemes, and so  on,  should  be

further facilitated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have the childcare centres evenly distributed

throughout the island.  In the newer HDB estates, where there

are  more  young children, there is a need for  such  centres

more urgently and in larger numbers.  Cooperation between the

Government,  VWOs and private organisations is  necessary  to

establish and allocate childcare centres.  The aim should  be

to  have  the  centres conveniently located  in  relation  to

either the home or the workplace.  This, in effect, calls for

employers  to  consider providing childcare  centres  at  the

workplace.   In  this respect, Sir, I would like  to  suggest

that  our  Government help private organisations in terms  of

grants towards this cause.  Realising that land cost will  be

a major burden for most operators, it may be worth looking at

ways  to  alleviate  this  to  ensure  these  centres  remain

affordable.  Childcare centres should be provided for private

dwellers  as well.  There are many young families buying  and

moving  into  new  condominiums in areas  with  no  childcare

centres nearby.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of childcare centres that cater to children

below  18  months of age should be increased, as there  is  a

dire  shortage of them.  At the moment, there are only  three

such  centres  catering to a mere 44 babies,  against  40,000

annual births.  I understand that it is difficult to run such

centres and that this could be due to difficulties in  hiring

suitable     care-givers,    including    nurses,     greater

responsibility with children that are young, intensive labour

force in terms of carer-to-children ratio, and susceptibility

of  young  children to sickness.  MCDS should look  to  solve

some   of   these   difficulties   and   facilitate   private

organisations  to  run such centres more  willingly.   For  a

start, the enlistment of retired elderly to care for children

may work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should allow the agencies to provide part-time maids to fill certain situations. There are families

who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>

cannot afford to have full-time maids, but will benefit  from

several  hours  of  help  per  week  from  part-time  foreign

domestic  maids.   Also  ad-hoc child-minders,  as  and  when

circumstances  arise, will be useful, for  example,  to  mind

children who are ill and cannot attend childcare centres  and

whose  parents cannot take emergency leave and so  on.   Sir,

the  recent  shutdown of childcare centres due to  the  hand,

foot  and  mouth disease is a good example where this  scheme

would have served very well.  This would be especially so for

those  parents  who did not have relatives  and  friends  who

could   mind   their  children  for  about  10   days.    The

inconvenience  and economic loss would have been  substantial

as  it  involves  about  140,000 children  in  557  childcare

centres  and 440 kindergartens, if a majority of the  parents

cannot go to work.

<br><br><i>Enhance Family Ties and Obligations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to inspire the young with a deeper sense

of  individual  responsibility  towards  the  family.   Basic

social  etiquette and interpersonal skills should  be  taught

and  promoted.   This  will lead to our  young  being  better

equipped  with  skills  in  handling  boy-girl  relationship,

marriage  and  parental  responsibility,  and  so  on.   Such

"values"  transmission  can  be  done  through  teachers   in

schools,   through   some   sort  of  parent-school-community

partnership,  through  religious and  community  groups,  and

through the media.  The Ministry of Education and Ministry of

Community Development and Sports should look at these  issues

and be facilitative in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, the father had been the sole breadwinner

and  the distant disciplinarian while mother was the nurturer

and  homemaker.   In  the present dual-income  family,  there

should  be  a shift towards this perception of the  roles  of

fathers and mothers.  Parenting and homemaker tasks should be

shared  between  spouses.  The joy of  bringing  up  children

should  be  shared  and experienced by both  parents.   Women

whose husbands do not help out with childrearing and domestic

chores   are  more  stressed  out.   Research  into   marital

satisfaction among Singaporean women

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>

showed  a  direct correlation between stress levels in  women

and the amount of help they get at home.  Sir, many Singapore

men  want  to  be  better  fathers  and  husbands,  but  face

constraints  due to pressure at work and the  lack  of  time.

Therefore,  it  is timely to look towards a family-orientated

society, with priority given to family needs.  I am glad that

our  Government  has  recognised the  partnership  of  child-bearing  and  homemaking by granting paternity  leave.   More

effort  should  be  spent  in  this  area,  such  as  further

incentives and campaign to change the stereotyped mindset  of

many  men  regarding parenting and household  responsibility.

The  Government should take the lead in changing the  mindset

of  fathers  and  encouraging them to be  equal  partners  in

raising families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening family ties, better bonding with extended

families  and  neighbourliness are areas  worth  cultivating.

Community-based organisations should organise more activities

in  grassroots programmes to promote these virtues.  Our CCC,

CCMC,  CDC and Town Councils can be active partners too.   As

the  trend is for Singapore families to get smaller, extended

families will not be the norm soon.  And since they  are  all

working,  many  will  become too busy  for  interaction  with

families and friends.  Such a trend, Sir, is bad and must  be

addressed.  It is disturbing to know that quite a  number  of

couples  did not have anybody to fall back on to  mind  their

children when childcare centres and kindergartens were closed

during the recent hand, foot and mouth disease epidemic.

<br><br><i>Address the Stress of Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study by Dr Stella Quah of the National University

of  Singapore,  on  the Singapore Family, revealed  that  the

greatest  worry for about 45% of them came from the  problems

associated  with  their  children's  education.   Singaporean

parents  have also frequently mentioned children's  education

as the contributory factor in opting for smaller families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I doubt many will fault our education system in

terms of first-rate facilities,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>

in  terms of fantastic academic results, and even in terms of

free  and  fair  opportunities for  all  our  children.   The

Government and educators spare no effort in trying to let our

young have the best.  We should all be glad.  But we moan and

we  are disgruntled and dissatisfied.  And we tell the  world

and  allow the world to tell us how stressed we are from  the

education of our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contend, Sir, that some of the problems may have to do

with  our mindset on "success" and "competition for success".

The  "comparing" nature is something that has been encouraged

in  all  of us because we have been trained to strive  to  be

better  than others, and there is no clear level when  enough

is  enough.  We are a success-orientated nation.  It is  only

natural  for parents to want success and the best  for  their

children.  Having the drive for success and for betterment is

not a bad thing at all.  But when such urge becomes excessive

and  begins to look like a survival prerequisite, then it  is

not  good.  Parents should be supportive and encourage  their

children  in their education, and they should not push  their

children  to  beyond  limits of the children's  capabilities.

This  will cause unnecessary "stress" to themselves and their

children.   Mr Speaker, Sir, not all our children can  go  to

university but the support should be to maximise each child's

potential,  whatever it may be.  Success may not  necessarily

come  from  highest education alone.  Note that our homegrown

and  remarkably  successful businessman,  Mr  Sim  Wong  Hoo,

graduated from the polytechnic and not the university.  We do

have  to  try to convince Singaporeans that success does  not

come  from highest education alone.  The Government must also

show the example by not selecting and promoting people in the

civil service with highest academic qualifications alone  but

also with other and different criteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, 2,358 new cases of children aged below 18 were

registered at Government psychiatric clinics.  In almost  95%

of  the  cases,  the children were not mad;  they  were  just

stressed out.  Half of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>

these  cases  were  children from primary schools,  35%  from

secondary  schools  and  15% were pre-schoolers.   Stress  at

school  was  mentioned  as one of the  reasons  for  becoming

depressed.   My  view is for teachers not to overload  pupils

unnecessarily with homework and tests.  Syllabus needs to  be

revamped  to  make it less demanding so that the teacher  can

complete  it  and the students can understand what  has  been

taught.  For the above-average students, there is always  the

option for them to be given more challenging "add-ons".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our school system so inadequate, Sir, that many

parents  turn  to private tuition for their  children?   Many

from the lower-income group cannot afford this and often feel

pressured for being unable to give their children the  "best"

through   private  tuition.   Personal  coaching   is   often

impossible because they hold full-time jobs.  Moreover,  much

of  the  syllabus is beyond them anyway; this would  be  even

more  so for the lesser-educated parents.  It will be a  good

idea  if  our  schools can provide the same sort of  tutorial

classes  after  normal  school  hours,  not  for  giving  the

children  extra  work but for helping them  cope  with  their

"homework".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as helping parents with school-going kids

balance  work  and  family commitments, we  may  perhaps  try

matching  work hours with school hours.  Sir,  since  we  are

tending  towards  single-session schools,  we  can  have  the

children  stay  back in the school to do their "homework"  or

have  "remedials"  while their parents  are  still  at  work.

Another  way to help parents, especially working parents,  is

to  organise  the  extra-curricular pursuits,  like  learning

drama,  piano, ballet and so on, collectively in the  schools

after  classes.  This will save parents having to ferry their

children  to and from different places for these hobbies.   I

can  see such a system helping Singaporean parents save  much

time,  effort  and  money.   Let us  make  our  schools  more

holistic and comprehensive in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the issue of schooling hours, I submit that

the starting times are far too

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>

early at the moment.  This is especially so if a child is not

in  a  neighbourhood school, because the average journey from

home can easily take 45 minutes.  It is a common sight to see

many  school children at bus interchanges all over the island

at  around  6.20  in the morning.  These children  and  their

parents have to get up very early indeed.  Many of them  have

less than the eight hours of sleep that is needed, especially

for  children.  With the need to revise their schoolwork,  do

homework  and projects, participate in ECAs, go for  tuition,

and  so  on, there is indeed a lot for the children  to  cope

with  in a day.  On top of this, the parents have to rush  to

work,  bring  kids to the childcare centres or  grandparents,

etc, all within that same time-frame.  Pre-school children or

babies  may have to be woken up, sometimes in the wee  hours,

to  fit  around  their older siblings'  schedules.   Sir,  we

should  aim  for  schooling hours to start  at  8.30  in  the

morning.   Most  schools in the Western world  start  anytime

from 8.30 to 9.00 in the morning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been too much emphasis on academic achievement

and  examination-based  orientation  in  our  school  system.

There  is  this  concern that children are only  "exam-smart"

and,  rather than a really well-rounded education, a  lot  of

emphasis  is  given towards passing examinations and  scoring

A's.   This will not hold well in the new economy.   A  well-rounded child may not be exam-smart, scoring straight A's and

all,  but  may be able to think creatively and have a  higher

EQ.   The  Government  has  recognised  that  creativity   is

important and the old way of rote learning is out.   But  can

we  really  grade critical and creative thinking?  And,  Sir,

how  do  we  transit  into the new way?  Are  there  existing

policies that impede this transition?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for the ranking of schools may have to be

expanded to lessen the emphasis on academic achievements  and

grade  scores.   More weightage should be  on  other  markers

relevant  to  the  present times; thus, ranking  should  take

attainments  in  developing  the potentials  of  students  in

information   technology,   sports   and   the   arts    into

consideration.  This will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>

ease  a  lot  of  the  pressures  on  students,  parents  and

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents have expressed their concerns on streaming

of  children  at  Primary 4.  They still  perceive  that  EM1

students will have better peers and teachers, when, in  fact,

it  may not be the case since the difference lies only in the

mother  tongue sessions that the students attend.   Now  that

the  requirements  for mother tongue have  been  relaxed  for

university  entry, parents should be reassured on the  nature

of  streaming at Primary 4.  It is unfortunate that,  in  any

year,  there  is  also some sort of banding of  the  students

involved in Primary 4.  However, banding students has been in

practice  for decades and is something parents have accepted.

It  would  be  worthwhile for the Ministry of  Education  and

schools to put in more effort to better inform the parents on

this issue to alleviate the stress associated with this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having flexibility in varsity-entry criteria will ease

the  stress from many students and parents.  Parents can then

be  at  ease  to  allow their children to develop  their  own

unique  potential  though it may not  conform  to  the  norm.

Universities should not be too fixated on accepting  students

with   a  string  of  straight  A's.   Recently,  a  visiting

molecular geneticist, Professor Tsui Lap Chee, said  that  he

himself  did  not  qualify  for  the  university.    He   did

brilliantly in biology, but merely passed his other subjects.

Fortunately, the Department of Biology's head at the  Chinese

University  of  Hong Kong was so impressed with  his  biology

grades  that he persuaded the University to make an exception

in  his  case.  If the University had not bent the rules,  he

would not be where he is today - a world-renowned pioneer.

<br><br><i>Enhance fertility, childbearing and family bonding</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general tendency for the younger people in

our workforce to put off courtship, marriage and childbearing

to  very much later in their lives.  Often times, the reasons

for  this  trend has to do with the ability to  balance  work

commitments with other aspirations in life.  There are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>

unfortunate  consequences when the pressure to succeed  first

at  work leads to late marriage and childbearing.  Hence,  in

our  efforts to address the balance between work  and  family

commitments,  we  have  to look at alleviating  some  of  the

problems facing us concerning procreation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the following are some aspects worth our

consideration.

<br><br><i>Help the subfertile</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chances that a fertile couple would need more than a

year  to produce a child doubles from 8% when the man was  25

years old to 15% when he was over 35.  If our men do not make

an  effort to date, to get married, to go back early to spend

time  with their wives and their children, how do we  achieve

our   ideal  families?  The  prevalence  of  infertility   in

Singapore is about 10% of married couples, of which  the  men

constitute  about 30% to 40% of the contributory factor.  The

female is responsible for about 40% to 50%. The remaining 10%

to 30% may be idiopathic or caused by contributing factors in

both  partners. Therefore, let us address this sad  issue  at

both  genders  from the outset. These 10% of married  couples

often  have  to  endure  tremendous physical,  emotional  and

financial  hardships.  Sir, I feel that these couples  should

be  helped  as  fertility  medical  treatment  can  be  time-consuming  and very expensive. The Medisave withdrawal  limit

for  the  most  costly  procedure, intro-vitro  fertilisation

(IVF),  should be reviewed. The current withdrawal  limit  of

$2,000  per  treatment cycle up to a maximum of three  cycles

per   patient  for  a  procedure  costing  near  $10,000  per

treatment  cycle  is  far  too low.  Our  adoption  procedure

should  be  made  less  onerous to enable  couples  to  adopt

children.  There  are  many cases where,  despite  exhaustive

treatment,  couples may still not be able  to  conceive.  For

them, adoption is an option and they should be assisted.

<br><br><i>Encourage earlier childbearing</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity and promotion of early childbearing age should

be done extensively

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>

to  educate  the  public  on  the  medical  disadvantages  of

pregnancy in older women.  In Singapore, 16.8% of pregnancies

involve  older  women. This figure far exceeds the  developed

world's  average of 8%.  Here, an average of 17 out of  every

100  women  who give birth is above the age of 35.  Pregnancy

in  older  women carries increased risks for mums and  babes.

These  include  miscarriages,  pregnancy  complications   and

complicated  deliveries.  There is also  a  higher  risk  for

chromosomal  abnormalities, the most common one being  Down's

syndrome.  For women aged 25 and below, the chances  are  one

in  800, but by the age of 40, the rate increases to  one  in

63.

<br><br><i>Enhanced pro-family practices</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancing practices that will promote family unity and

procreation  is  necessary.  For  instance,  the  option  for

mothers  to  have  extended unpaid  maternity  leave,  whilst

available,  is not widely accepted. This common  practice  in

both  the public and private sectors in the western countries

and  in Australia allows for working mothers to extend  their

maternity  leave by up to six months.  Mothers get  to  spend

more  time with their babies during the post-delivery period,

a  time  which  is  crucial for mother-baby  bonding  and  is

certainly a pro-family ideal.

<br><br><i>Expand avenues for courtship and marriage</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One in three Singapore adults in their early 30s is

still single. And 16.5% of them remain single well into their

40s,  compared to just one in 10 in 1990.  According  to  the

<br><br>2000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Census,  27% of men in their late 30s  were  unmarried,

while  18.5% of women in this age group were single.   Unlike

single  women, many of whom are graduates, two-fifths of  the

over  77,000 single men above 35 have secondary education  or

less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Development Unit (SDU) was set up in 1984 by

the People's Association to promote marriage among graduates.

Since  then, 21,400 SDU members have got married. The  Social

Development Service (SDS) was set up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>

in 1985 to create opportunities for non-university graduates.

Since then, 87,000 SDS members had married.  SDU and SDS have

done  well  and should be further supported to  expand  their

roles to achieve higher targets.  In today's context of  busy

schedules  and less time to meet and to court,  more  avenues

for people to interact are essential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One in five single British men and women is turning to

dating   agencies  and  personal  advertisements   to   start

relationship, confirming a trend researchers have found  that

modern  lifestyle  and  job demands are  killing  traditional

courtship.  Facilitating  and  providing  avenues  for  young

people   to  come  together  in  the  schools,  polytechnics,

universities and community centres and so on will  give  them

the  opportunity  to  intermingle  with  peers  within  their

cohorts.   This opportunity may not be there once they  start

their  working  life.  Credible websites  run  by  Government

agencies  or  reputable  private  organisations  that  ensure

correct  and certified data of individuals will be useful.  I

believe  that, in the IT era, this channel will prove  to  be

the  preferred choice for many of our IT-savvy and busy young

people to acquaint and befriend each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, should spearhead more social-support factors. I am of the opinion that encouraging

marriages  with financial enticements would  not  be  a  good

idea.  This  is  in  contrast with the  case  of  encouraging

couples  to  have bigger families with financial  incentives.

Parents  and  young people should abandon  the  mindset  that

students should not court until they have graduated  and  are

established  in  their careers because by  then,  it  becomes

increasingly difficult to meet and to start courting.   Young

people would be well-advised to be responsible adults who are

accountable in relationship, responsible towards  each  other

and  sensible  in  pursuing  studies  simultaneously  with  a

relationship without jeopardizing one for the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, no Government can dictate people to

get married or to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>

more  children.  Our Government, however, can facilitate  the

people  to  fulfill their family wishes and one of  the  best

ways to do this is through helping them to harmonise work and

family.  While the Government can make it more conducive  for

people  to get married and have bigger families, the eventual

result rests on the expectations of parents, their ability to

juggle and manage time better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crux of the whole issue and the solution lies,

ultimately, in the hands of all Singaporeans themselves. They

must  have  the correct attitude towards what  they  want  in

life. They must believe that fulfilment in life depends on  a

balance between their work responsibilities and their  family

needs  rather than a compromise on one for the  other.   This

involves a major change in mindset of  Singaporeans and  this

House  needs  to urge the Government for a positive  move  to

achieve such a change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for this

opportunity to speak on this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our children are the future of the nation. They

are  nurtured  in  the fold of the family. The  family  is  a

pillar  of  the stability of the nation.  There  is  thus  no

question  of the importance of strong families to the  future

of   Singapore.   Many  factors  make  for  a  happy  family.

Government policies impinge on the family.  I am delighted to

note  that  over the years, the Government has  made  visible

efforts to implement family supportive policies. More can  be

done and I am confident that more will be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers from happy families are more productive and I

urge  all  employers to make the effort to make the workplace

an  environment friendly to the family. As an  employer,  the

Government  has been responsive to the needs of  the  family,

introducing  family-friendly practices and facilities.   Many

companies have also put in efforts and funds to do  so.  They

are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>

good examples to follow.  I urge the employers to do more and

others who have not done so to consider and implement family-friendly practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family members, especially parents, also have a

major role in creating a happy family environment.  I want to

add  on  to a point that Dr Lily Neo raised in her address  - stress  caused by the education system.  I believe that  hard

work is necessary for success. Children have worked hard  for

their  success.  There  is  no  alternative  even  for  those

naturally  endowed.   We  should  not  ask  the  Ministry  of

Education to merely make our education system easier for  our

student for his own sake.  MOE has been reviewing the  system

to  make  our  system better able to meet the  needs  of  our

future in the new economy. MOE has adapted our system  to  be

performance-based, each student to work at  his  or  her  own

pace   and   capability.   We  should  espouse  instead   the

philosophy of being the best we can be. Hence, I urge parents

not  to  pressurize their children beyond their capabilities.

They  should not have unrealistic expectation of them, making

unrealistic  demand  on  their  capability  and  performance.

Parents  should  thus encourage their children  to  do  their

best. We should allow our children their time, their space so

that they can have their childhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if every party plays his, her or its part in

promoting the welfare of the family, I am sure the quality of

family life for our citizens will improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, I rise to support the motion

standing in the name of the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC

on family-friendly work practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Prime Minister's speech here in this Chamber

in October one year ago, on his concern that Singaporeans are

not  reproducing  ourselves, increasing  attention  has  been

turned to the subject, once again, of persuading Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>

to   increase   their   productivity  from   the   population

perspective.    Intimately   intertwined   in   the   ensuing

discussions and debate is the subject of the family,  and  of

the  stresses on our current day Singaporean families,  which

surely impacts on our young couples' decisions on whether  to

start  a  family and, in fact, on the size of the  family  to

have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen considerable activity over this period with

the  formation  of  the  Working Committee  on  Marriage  and

Procreation,  involving  an  impressive  panel  of  Permanent

Secretaries,  the announcement of a Ministerial Committee  to

be  led by the Minister without Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon  Heng,

the  establishment  of  a Work-Life Unit  by  MCDS,  and  yet

another  committee on Public Education on the Family, chaired

by  the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary of MCDS.  In between,

there has been a seminar to discuss the preliminary report of

the  Committee on the Family, workshops conducted by  invited

consultants  on  Work-Life Balance, and the  Family  Friendly

Awards, a tripartite initiative of SNEF, MCDS and NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this energy and enthusiasm is certainly a good

start,  but the concern is that this flurry of activity  gets

translated  into  real,  substantial  and  sustained  effort,

policy  reviews and initiatives and programmes for  both  the

immediate and the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Government attention on family-friendly and

pro-family work practices, policies and programmes to support

and  strengthen the family is, to a large extent,  driven  by

the baby agenda.  But, in fact, these practices, policies and

programmes are important for far more than just promoting the

production of babies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening the family is intrinsically important in

itself, especially as we have always held  the family  to  be

the basic building block of our society.  Even more so in the

face of the challenges of the accelerating pace of our modern

working environment, coupled with the influences

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>

that   our   youngsters  are  now  open  to  with  the   easy

accessibility of information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening existing families is important, even if

all our efforts do not result in one more couple deciding  to

have  one  more  baby.   And,  indeed,  helping  Singaporeans

maintain   a   balance   between  their   work   and   family

responsibilities  is  an intrinsic and  essential  factor  in

achieving  the  quality of life that  we  all  aspire  to  as

citizens contributing to a first-world economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same speech last October, the Prime Minister

spoke  of our twin goals of having both a first-world economy

and a world-class home.  He observed that the goal of a first-world  economy was easier to achieve than that  of  a  world-

class  home,  which involves many intangibles and  cannot  be

measured simply by hardware and physical infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that we are still holding on tightly to

all  our  old assumptions and measures of success that  drive

towards  economic  goals, unwilling to explore  shifting  the

balance even just a little, afraid to let go, lest the easier

tangible  goal  slips from our grasp, as  we  reach  for  the

harder to achieve intangible one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we get to that happy state in Singapore where we can

have  a productive, satisfying job that pays reasonably  well

enough  to maintain a decent standard of living and  yet,  at

the  same  time,  look forward to the prospect  of  a  family

albeit   that  it comes with responsibilities, with  pleasure

rather than trepidation?  What does it take?  It seems to  me

it  must  surely have to be a tripartite effort  -  involving

Government, employers and individuals themselves.  All  three

parties have a role to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start with individuals. What is the individual's

role?   It  is certainly essential.  Employers and Government

can  and  must support and facilitate through their policies,

programmes,  services, approach, willingness to be  flexible.

But  the  individual must also be prepared, firstly, to  make

his or her own life choices, for as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>

surely  as  death and taxes, you can be sure that it  is  not

possible  to  have it all.  You have to decide what  is  most

important to you personally, your priorities, and be aware of

the implications of your choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At work, in some companies, some family-friendly

benefits  may  be  readily available, but many,  particularly

those  involving flexible working arrangements, for  example,

will often require the employee to also get engaged with  his

or her supervisor on seeing how to make it work, for both the

employee and for the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans sometimes have a tendency to look to some

higher  authority,  namely, the Government,  to  solve  their

problems for them.  This is particularly likely in situations

where  Government has already signalled that the area is  one

in  which  it has an interest and a stake in prescribing  the

outcome.   If  Singaporeans  take  this  attitude   in   this

instance,  it will be a sorry situation indeed,  as  it  will

surely  make the journey even more arduous and long  and  the

destination less certain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the employers' role? Employers need to do more

than just pay perfunctory attention and lip service to seeing

how  they  can  become family-friendly.  It is  however  much

easier  said  than done.  It involves a lot  more  than  just

introducing   programmes  in  an  ad  hoc  manner.    To   be

successfully  truly  family-friendly  involves  a  systematic

approach, from analysing what your own particular profile  of

employees  truly  need, through enabling and supporting  your

managers and supervisors in dealing with the flexible working

requests  from their subordinates, to achieving all  of  this

while keeping one's cost of operations within reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in truth, in our tight labour market, employers will

find,  over time, that they will be under pressure to respond

to  the  needs  and  wants of a changing and  more  demanding

workforce.  So, why not be proactive about it and,  in  fact,

adopt  family-friendliness  as  a  competitive  advantage  in

recruitment, motivation and retention of good people?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Government's role? Obviously, it is more than

to  exhort  companies  to be family-friendly  and  to  exhort

individuals  -  well,  Government  sends  these  messages  to

individuals that convey tremendous expectations.  To  be  the

best  workers  in  the world, to continuously  upgrade  their

skills and expertise, to engage in life-long learning, not to

neglect  their  children,  and  to  provide  care  for  their

parents, as filial sons and daughters, right up to the end of

their  increasing longer lifespans.  And to do so, if at  all

possible, without foreign domestic help!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts, to date, to grapple with the many issues

that  need to be addressed, have been driven largely by MCDS,

but many more Ministries must be engaged.  Otherwise, we will

never  get anywhere, because there is no simple magic  bullet

that  is  the  solution, but many, many different  things   - policies, programmes, services that impact daily on  all  our

lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, to help companies become more family-friendly, Government's assistance in defraying the cost of

job  redesign  to  facilitate flexible  working  arrangements

would  be most helpful.  It has been suggested that companies

could  apply  for such support under the PSB's Work  Redesign

Assistance  Programmes.   For  this  to  work,  however,  the

criteria  for  support  will need to  be  modified  from  the

relevant programmes as they currently are.  I do not  believe

any  progress has been made in this, possibly because it  may

not  even be registered onto PSB's list of things to  do,  or

possibly because PSB's priorities are set by MTI and  not  by

MCDS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, which I had previously raised with MND

for consideration unsuccessfully, is to require developers of

commercial and industrial complexes above a certain  size  to

put  aside space for child or dependant care centres, and  to

exempt  this  space from the calculation of plot  ratios,  so

that  near-site childcare centres could be available  to  the

workers  and  companies  located  in  these  complexes.   The

Minister, in his answer, had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>

said that Government did not wish to compel developers to  do

this.   It would leave it to the companies themselves.  Well,

we  all  know,  when this Government believes that  something

needs  to  be  done, it has never before had any  compunction

about acting on its beliefs.  In this instance, I would  say,

okay,  do not compel them, but allow the exemption from  plot

ratio calculations for such centres.  And I dare say some may

indeed take up the opportunity to plan accordingly, because I

do  believe  that this may, in fact, be a selling feature  of

the  development.  But for this to happen, the exemption must

come first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, here is another Ministry - MND - that

could  and  should  be  applying  its  thoughts  on  how   to

contribute  to this effort to promote pro-family  or  family-friendly facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that possibly the conviction is not quite

there  in  this effort.  And possibly the conviction  is  not

quite  there  because  we  are still,  all  this  time,  just

scratching at the surface, looking for the easy quick  fixes,

ambivalent about what is truly important to us, and  avoiding

some  real soul searching, including relooking at the  sacred

cows  comfortably ensconced  on the altar of the  first-world

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prioritise between being the best workers in

the  world  and  putting much more attention to strengthening

our  families?   Do we truly believe mothers  should  be  out

contributing to the economy or at home rearing the kids?   Do

we  have  a choice?  Do they have a choice?  We hesitate  and

that is why up to now, we are still ambivalent about actively

promoting  the  setting up of creches for  babies  below  two

years of age.  If we cannot afford to have working mums  drop

out  and  stay  at home, how much role sharing are  we  truly

going to promote without worrying that it will undermine  our

tenet of a patriarchal Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are inordinately driven by elitism. Can we not ease

up  at  all without losing the drive to compete economically?

You are nothing if you are not in that cream at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>

the  top,  not  a scholar, not in one of the top professions.

This  is  what  drives  parents and students,  regardless  of

whatever  other messages the Ministry of Education may  issue

about  there  being  no need to be immoderate  in  pressuring

their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rare Singapore family that does not struggle

with  the  stresses of putting the kids through our education

system.   Add  to that MOE's steadfast refusal  to  entertain

that  there might be any other way or perspective to  explore

in  such  issues  as  ranking and  streaming,  and  how  much

progress  can  we  hope  to  make in  addressing  stress  for

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Working Committee on Marriage and Procreation

published  some  recommendations at the end of  August.   Two

recommendations  for  the civil service   -   three  days  of

paternity  leave  and  flexibility in organising  work  hours

around  a  42-hour  week.  One on building  more  hostels  to

facilitate   the  blooming  of  romance  in  our   university

campuses, and one on helping newly married couples with their

HDB downpayments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Eddie Teo, who heads the Committee, in explaining the

rationale  for  some  of  the  recommendations,  voiced   the

consideration  that  we should not, and I  quote,  "send  the

wrong  signal that Singapore has arrived, and it is okay  for

workers to switch to a less intense pace."  I sincerely  hope

the  Committee does not consider its work done, that  it  has

many   more   recommendations  to  make  to  the  Ministerial

Committee  and  that when it does make these recommendations,

they  will  not simply provide small symptomatic  concessions

but  be  bold  and  sweeping and get down to challenging  our

assumptions  on  where  the balance must  be  struck  between

purely economic imperatives and the building of a world class

home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I rise to

support the motion standing in the name of  Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the workplace is no longer the same as before.

With  new  technology and widespread use of IT, new  mindsets

and different aspirations have drastically changed the way we

work.   The end result is a frenetic pace of work.  We cannot

stop or reverse the changes brought about by the new economy.

Nor  should we.  We must be prepared to change or else change

will  overwhelm  us  and undermine our  survival.    Constant

adaptation and upgrading of skills are the order of the  day.

Workers  should  be  adequately equipped  with  the  relevant

skills  and  knowledge to enhance their employability.    The

changes  taking place at work also have profound implications

on  the  family. As a matter of fact, the trend  of  the  new

economy  plus  the  development  of  our  social  and  family

structure  have  made  it  more and more  difficult  for  our

workers  to  strike  a balance between  the  family  and  the

workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present small-family structure has caused us to lose

the  closely-knit network and mutual assistance among members

of  the family.  In a family where both the husband and  wife

have  to go out to work, they no longer enjoy the support  of

other  family  members  as in the traditional  big  families.

Many workers are sandwiched between maintaining their parents

and   raising  their  young  children.   There  are  abundant

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more and more workers find it difficult to balance

the  demands of work and family.  The gradual rise in women's

participation  in the work force is the key  reason  why  the

family is under more stress now than in the past.  With  more

and  more  women  participating in the labour  force  it  has

become more difficult.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>

Therefore,  we  have to look at this problem.  Although  some

women-folk  are still at home looking after their family  and

children,  many women have to go out to work because  of  the

need for money.  They have to return to the workforce to help

contribute to the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are many women who possess stronger

economic power. They work not merely to supplement the family

income.  In fact, the income of women nowadays contributes  a

greater  portion  to the total income of  the  family.   Many

women are in a situation whereby they simply could not afford

to  give up their jobs to look after the family because  they

know very well that once they drop out of the workforce, they

will not be able to catch up with the fast pace of changes in

the  business  world, and they will lose their  employability

forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the above, we now need to have employers to

look at avenues where they can put in place all the necessary

facilities and flexi-working arrangement to help the women to

balance the needs of work and the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 21st century, the male workers also need

flexible  working arrangements to help look after the  family

and  their children.  The tripartite partnership should  help

to look for such pro-family working arrangements so that they

could balance the needs of family and work responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics show that in Singapore the proportion of

employees  in the flexi- time work arrangement is only  0.06%

in   1998  compared  to  28%  in  the  United  States.    The

experiences  of  family-friendly companies  in  the  US  have

manifested to them the benefits of productivity gains, higher

staff  retention  and  lower  absenteeism  and  reduction  in

recruitment  and training cost.  The report also states  that

by  the  flexi-work  schedule many  advantages  are  derived,

because every time an employee leaves his employment to  meet

family needs, employers not only incur cost in replacing  the

employee but also lose the wealth of experience and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>

tacit understanding and teamwork that has been built up  over

the years.  This type of loss is very substantive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This family-friendly sort of arrangement is not

impossible in Singapore.  In fact, some unions and management

have worked out flexible arrangements, for example, Singapore

Power,  Singapore Technologies Aerospace and the restructured

hospitals  have enjoyed some very successful experience.   At

the Changi General Hospital and Kandang Kerbau Hospital, they

had such a scheme for their staff two to three years ago. The

results have been very encouraging. This experience should be

a  good  example  for the others to emulate.   Besides  lower

absenteeism,  staff morale is higher.  Staff  dedication  and

commitment  became  more prevalent and an enhanced  level  of

service is for all to see.  There are a lot of advantages  in

this sort of practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something that is worth a try. This is a win-win

situation for both the employers and employees.  There is  no

reason  why  we  should not adopt such a practice.   Flexible

working schedules that incorporate lifestyle aspect is a much

better arrangement.  I feel that the employers should believe

in  such  practices.  Be prepared to give them a try and  see

how  the  system  can  evolve.  The management  must  be  the

drivers of such changes.  The employers have much to gain  to

explore  initiatives  such as flexible work  arrangements  so

that they can attract and retain the best employees.  This is

evidenced by the experience in the United States and in  some

of the companies in Singapore.  The Ministry of Education has

set a good example by implementing the new part-time teachers

scheme.  With such an alternative, the teachers need not  opt

out of the labour market totally when they need more time for

family commitments.  So they can be said to enjoy the best of

both worlds with a very good balance between family needs and

work requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this very competitive environment, the

company's business may go up, and sometimes they may go down.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>

When there are more orders coming in, the companies will have

to  meet their obligations, and their margins are often  very

thin.   If they have no orders and if there is no work to  be

carried out, the company's cost remains very high.  Under the

circumstances,  if  the employers do not find  some  ways  to

improve, and make the economics right, in the end it would be

the  workers  who will suffer most.  Many of them  will  lose

their job because the company was relocated to save cost.   I

believe that all the workers and employers know the advantage

of  the  flexi-time  scheme, and  many  of  the  workers  are

actually  taking  the initiative to ask  their  companies  to

allow them to work on a flexible time system so that they can

have more time with their families.  So the management should

respond  promptly  and find feasible ways to  implement  such

flexi-time schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions in Singapore support labour market

flexibility with flexible work arrangements.  The  NTUC  has,

over  the  years,  put in considerable efforts  in  promoting

flexible  and  family-friendly  work  environment  through  a

number  of  tripartite programmes such  as  back-to-work  and

setting up of eldercare and childcare cooperatives, etc.  The

NTUC  also  promotes the employment of part-time workers  and

articulates  the relevant legislation to protect and  enhance

the  benefits  for  part-time and contract workers,  so  that

workers  need not give up their work just because  of  family

commitment.    However,  some  workers  may  still   perceive

flexible work arrangement as their employers' way to  squeeze

more  out  of  them  so  as to make more  profit.   Some  see

flexible   work   arrangement  as  temporary  or   short-term

employment.  I think that workers should not worry  too  much

about this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement would like to work with employers

and  the  Government on this subject more actively.  We  will

have  to  make sure that employers treat workers fairly  when

they  reorganise  work to gain more flexibility.   We  should

also   ensure  that  unions  are  consulted  when   companies

implement new work arrangements.  It is in the trade  union's

interest to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>

help  workers  keep their jobs and have greater certainty  in

their incomes in spite of the peaks and lulls of the business

cycle.   This type of arrangement, on one hand, will  improve

the  company's productivity and, on the other hand, will help

the  workers  to  look  after their  families.   Whether  the

economy  is  booming or whether it is in recession,  we  must

make sure that the worker's job is secure and he will have  a

steady income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to have a uniform style or model and we

do  not  need all the companies to implement such  a  scheme.

Because   in   different  companies,  there   are   different

circumstances and the companies should design their own  work

schedules in a way that is most suitable to them.   In  order

for the companies to implement this flexible wage or flexible

time  arrangement  scheme for the workers,  the  Ministry  of

Manpower  may  want  to review the present  legislation,  for

example,  the  present system of 44 hours a week.   For  some

industries,  particularly in the knowledge-based economy,  we

should  review whether we should have a better reward  system

and  better  wages for the workers who are on this flexi-time

arrangement.  We should look at the results rather  than  the

number of hours they work.  In this way, the workers can have

more  liberty  to  allocate their time so that  they  have  a

balance between their work requirement and family needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has overcome many challenges over the years.

Among  others,  this  challenge of enabling  our  workers  to

balance the work with their family is a daunting one.  But it

is  by  no means insurmountable.  We have proved to  be  very

adept  at  finding innovative ideas and solutions to  resolve

our  present  problems in the past.  This time  round,  I  am

sure,  if  we  have  to make changes, we  should  make  them.

Employers  should  take  an enlightened  view  and  with  the

encouragement  from the Government and the  cooperation  from

the  unions  and  the workers, I am quite confident  that  we

would  be  able  to create an ideal work environment  and  an

ideal home for our workers.

<div align="center"><b>FAMILY-FRIENDLY WORK PRACTICES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion

moved by Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an increase in the number of dual-income

families.  More than 50% of the workforce comprise of working

couples, and it is projected that it is likely to increase to

70%  the  next  decade.   This  therefore  calls  for  urgent

attention as to what support we can give to working couples.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>3.37 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is inevitable that more companies will need to

move  towards  family-friendly work  practices.   Because  if

these  companies  do  not move towards  family-friendly  work

practices,  they are likely to lose younger working  couples.

It  becomes  less  attractive and  therefore  companies  will

inevitably  need  to  think of ways  to  attract  and  retain

younger working couples.  I see that it is very important for

us  to maintain a balance between friendly-work practices and

also the viability of companies.  We cannot separate them and

look at each of them on its own merits.  Therefore, to ensure

that  the  companies are viable, we need also to ensure  that

they provide good support for their workers.  Because workers

who  are  faced  with  various family-related  problems  also

become  very unproductive workers and they incur cost to  the

company, and the company is also likely to become less viable

because of these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are no complete solutions to this whole matter

because we are dealing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>

with  lifespan  issues,  and  lifespan  issues  call  for   a

completely  life-long examination of how we  can  respond  to

human  development.  I think that nobody disagrees that there

is  a  need  for us to look at ways to strengthen the  family

because  strengthening family and giving family the  best  of

support  we  can,  enriches the nation.  We  deal  with  less

social  problems,  less family breakdowns and  other  related

family problems and in the end it is going to be less cost to

the  society  in  any case.  Therefore,  all  the  more,  the

various  views expressed by Dr Lily Neo and Dr  Jennifer  Lee

should be given serious attention.  I hope that the committee

under  the charge of Minister Lim Boon Heng would be able  to

look  at  how we can address some of these issues related  to

family  support and family-friendly work practices.  I  think

we  need to review some of the policies which have impact  on

the  family.   They are rather segmented and  many  of  these

social policies related to families are not comprehensive and

well  coordinated, and there is a need to  re-visit  some  of

these  family support policies.  I am sure Mr Lim's committee

is  actively looking into these and I hope that his committee

is  able  to  come out with more comprehensive policies  that

will  provide  concerted support for families.   This,  I  am

certain, his committee is looking at and they would  not  put

up knee-jerk reaction policies.  More often than not, many of

the  policies  that we have known are policies that  are,  to

some extent, knee-jerk, and they are not going to produce any

comprehensive  impact  in  support  of  family  life.    More

importantly,   Sir,   we  need  to  re-visit   family-support

policies.    Aside   from   promoting  more   family-friendly

workplaces, it is important to look at these policies because

these  policies  are  fundamental to ensuring  that  we  have

strong  families, and strong families mean better workplaces,

and  better workplaces mean more viable companies, and we are

able to make better economic progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to look at the childcare grants. The

childcare grant of $180 may not necessarily be able  to  meet

the  increased cost in childcare.  Today, if you look at  the

average  cost  of  childcare, it is  about  $450  and  above.

Therefore, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>

becomes a burden to many average working families.  So  there

is  a  need to revise it.  Childcare sick leave is only three

days, paternity leave is at the moment being implemented, and

other childcare leave is very limited.  So we have to examine

it and I hope this would be actively reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workplace childcare services also need to be looked at

because  we  want  to encourage clusters of companies  coming

together to promote workplace childcare services and we  need

to  study  the kind of support to be given to these companies

that are interested.  Some of them may not have economies  of

scale  but I think we can look at the clustering of all these

companies  coming together to provide childcare  services  in

urban areas where many young couples work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maternity leave which is now extended to the third

child may need to be looked at in terms of post-natal kind of

leave  where  the mother needs to support a  new-born  and  a

month's  leave  may not necessarily help her to  prepare  and

wean the child because of the requirement to go back to work.

So this can be re-examined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid levy has to be looked at more closely because

there  have been suggestions and viewpoints from many working

mothers  to  re-look at this.  And I hope that the  committee

will actively restudy these issues that have been raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect which we need to assess is the single

session schools and whether single session schools are  going

to be actively promoted.  I hope that this will be stepped up

so  that  it  would  be a solution to the problem  of  giving

support to families, especially families with younger primary

school-going children.  This, I think, should not  remain  as

lip-service.  I feel that the Ministry of Education, with the

recommendations  of the committee, could look  at  how  these

could be implemented as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that I would like to bring to the

attention of the House is that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>

there  are  a  few urgent priorities that need to  be  looked

into.  First, we need to provide more incentives to companies

who are setting up workplace childcare places, as recommended

by  Dr  Jennifer Lee.  And there is this problem that MND  is

not  giving sufficient incentives for companies to  implement

such a scheme.  The plot ratio takes into consideration these

childcare  centres.  If you look at the childcare centre,  it

is  a  social  service.   It  is a  programme  like  schools,

hospitals,  clinics and various other facilities.   They  are

social services which enhance the human social capital.  Such

a  service  that  is undertaken by companies  should  receive

greater  attention and incentives.  So there  should  be  tax

exemptions  for  companies  to take  an  active  interest  by

providing the support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to look at the setting up of childcare

service for children below the age of 18 months because  many

parents  want to work but they are deterred by the fact  that

they  have to look after younger children below 18 months  or

there are problems related to childcare.  Such a service  has

to be stepped up.  Private operators, voluntary organisations

and  other  interested groups can be encouraged to look  into

the  provision  of  such  a service.  Better  incentives  and

support  should  be  given to these groups.   It  is  a  very

specialised  service  as  they are very  young  children  who

require more close attention and care.  This means that  more

resources,  in  terms of manpower, would  be  required.   And

nobody  would  want to go into this field provided  there  is

adequate  support from the Ministry of Community  Development

and Sports as well as the Government itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that we could examine is the need to

develop  a  database  which  should  be  made  available   to

companies, that there are retired housewives and mothers  who

live  in  the  neighbourhood and who want to provide  family-based  childcare  services.   If  a  good  database  can   be

maintained and made available to companies, then it would  be

a  source of support.  Such databases, at the moment, are not

collated.   I  think  some  agencies,  like  family   service

agencies and other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>

agencies  providing childcare services, can provide a  value-added service in this direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect that we need to look at is the flexi-work scheme. With the move towards IT and other information

technology  advancement, the work world is likely to  change.

Therefore,  there is a necessity for companies to  relook  at

how  work  could  be  organised in such a  way  that  working

mothers can do their work within their home setting and  also

have  flexible  work arrangements within  the  work  setting.

This   is  a  matter  of  scheduling  and  reorganising  work

schedules.  I hope that more encouragement and development in

this  direction  can be forthcoming.  With these  changes  in

work arrangements, it would help to provide more support  for

younger  working couples because the work world is  going  to

attract  many  of these people, retain them to be  productive

workers  and contribute to the economic development of  these

companies.   One  has  got  to  respond  fairly  quickly   in

organising friendly work practices within the work world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very important and urgent that we find ways

to  strengthen support to the family, particularly support to

working  couples, so that the more support we can provide  to

them,  the  companies  will become  viable.   When  companies

become  viable, then we would be able to harness more workers

to  work  within the setting.  Otherwise, if we do  not  have

viable  companies that can attract younger couples,  many  of

these  policies  that we talk about remain as  rhetoric.   So

these  issues, I hope, can be urgently looked  into  and  the

Committee  under Mr Lim Boon Heng will address  these  issues

fairly  quickly  and come out with a more coordinated  policy

that  will  encourage families, not only to care  effectively

for   their  children,  but  also  to  contribute  to   their

companies.  This will therefore help families continue to  be

viable and effective as well as help companies to move  ahead

and respond to the changing economic circumstances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  let  me begin at Act 1, Scene 1.  Superwoman  rises  at

6.00  in  the morning, ensures that her domestic  helper  has

prepared  breakfast for her family, especially  her  son  who

needs  to  catch the school bus at 6.30 am.  In between,  she

catches  snippets of Channel News Asia for  the  latest  news

that she might need at work.  She lugs along her hand carried

baggage  to work in a taxi as she is scheduled to  travel  at

5.00  in  the  afternoon to Hong Kong for  business.   During

lunch,  she  rings  her  son's  Chinese  teacher  to  discuss

arrangements for remedial work on Saturdays.  Before she  has

had a chance to respond to all her e-mails, she realises that

she must rush to the airport or she will miss her flight.  On

the  way  to the airport, she rings her mother on her  mobile

phone to make sure that she has kept her appointment with the

physiotherapist.  She next rings her husband to remind him of

his  dental appointment.  By the time she sinks into her seat

on  the  plane,  she  is already thinking about  the  various

marketing strategies for the Hong Kong-based clients.  She is

keenly  aware that competition is intensifying.  But  as  she

dozes  off  momentarily, she could not be more  satisfied  at

work for the adrenaline keeps her going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this one act play describes the multiple roles that

many  Singaporean women and, to a similar extent, Singaporean

men  assume,  namely, as a parent, a spouse, a child  and  an

employee  or  economic contributor, all  at  the  same  time.

There  is a constant juggling of roles and competing  demands

for our finite time and resources.  As such, social norms are

strong  guiding principles that will dictate the  performance

of each of these roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no turning back to the stereotypes of the

past  where the woman has to remain at home, especially after

having   children   and  regardless  of   her   ability   and

preferences.   In  fact,  I believe Singapore  would  be  the

poorer  for  it if these stereotypes were to persist  as  our

competitive strength will lie in our human resources, men and

women alike.  This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>

not  to  say  that  we  should actively discourage  women  or

mothers  who wish to remain at home from doing so.   However,

we should actively help them re-enter the workforce when they

would  like to.  From this perspective, policies and measures

will  hopefully  have their desired impact although  they  do

have  the limitations.  As such, to have a sustaining effect,

the  Government  should  send strong signals  to  help  shape

social   norms.   For  example,  in  land-scarce   Singapore,

especially within the Central Business District, a strong pro-family  signal can be sent via a combination of, firstly,  an

exclusion of childcare resources from the computation of plot

ratios,  which  Dr  Lee  and Dr Vasoo have  mentioned,  or  a

similar  preferential treatment be given.   And  secondly,  a

generous  tax deduction for childcare-related operating  cost

as  an  incentive for property owners and employers.  Another

strong  signal could be to allow young couples with new-borns

to  be  granted  an earlier allocation of  a  flat.   Besides

helping  out with the down-payment, the Government  can  also

enhance  the  ability  to afford a new flat  through  balloon

payment schemes, where necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many suggestions have been made by hon. Members in

this  House,  not  least by Dr Lily Neo, on  how  to  promote

family.   The sceptics would argue that the measures are  not

quite  enough.   But  with  more  concerted  efforts  by  the

Government  and  the community at large, I believe  a  strong

unified message can and will emerge.  I would therefore  like

to  urge  the  Government to continue to  set  the  pace  and

example  by  implementing pro-family measures in  the  public

sector as far as is possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I would like to register my full

support for the motion standing in the name of Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the motion as proposed by Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spelt out in the S21 Report, we want to build strong

families  in  Singapore in the new millennium.  In  order  to

achieve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>

this  national  goal,  we  need to put  in  place  pro-family

policies  to  support family development as  well  as  family

bonding.   The allocation of national resources to build  the

necessary  physical  infrastructure for facilitating  family-friendly  activities  will  signify  the  Government's   firm

commitment to building strong families among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to providing pro-family infrastructure and

facilities,  I  would like to propose the following  for  the

Government to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Build pro-family integrated facilities within HDB

towns.  HDB and town councils must make conscious efforts  to

build  pro-family facilities within HDB towns.  We must  plan

and   implement  improvement  projects  to  encourage  family

members  to  come  together to have  fun.   We  should  build

'social  centres'  where families and  their  neighbours  can

gather conveniently for social interaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical 'social centre' would include facilities for

all  age  groups, such as children playground, barbecue  pit,

fitness  corner,  reflexology path, multi-purpose  court  and

seating facilities.  By integrating these facilities  into  a

'social centre', family members will have ample opportunities

to interact, leading to the strengthening of family bonding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where possible, such integrated facilities should be

located  within HDB precincts or near neighbourhood  centres.

The  increased  accessibility  and  convenience  will  ensure

higher  utilisation  of  such social centres,  enhancing  the

opportunities for families to stay and play together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Build more parks. Living in an urbanised

environment  like Singapore, it is crucial for  us  to  build

more  parks to provide green lungs in our living  space.   In

land-scarce  Singapore,  it is even  more  critical  for  the

Government  to strike a balance between allocating  land  for

public parks and land for pure commercial uses, such as  golf

courses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parks provide excellent venues for families to get

together.  Experiences from several countries have shown that

many  families  do  visit and spend  a  lot  of  time  having

recreation in parks.  Such open spaces also help families  to

relax and unwind on weekends, especially after a long week at

school and work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, parks do not seem to attract enough locals

as  they  generally  lack attractions and  facilities.   Some

parks  charge an entrance fee, which then deters people  from

visiting   them.    There  are  also  instances   where   the

authorities charge car-parking fees and keep up the  pace  of

issuing  parking  summons  after some  parks  become  popular

which,  in  turn,  in the long run, discourage  regular  park

users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should build more national, regional and

neighbourhood parks in Singapore.  More pro-family facilities

such as children's playgrounds, games corners, barbecue pits,

multi-purpose  courts  and open fields,  should  be  provided

within  the  parks  to  attract more  Singaporeans  to  fully

utilise  our  parks.   In addition, the  necessary  transport

infrastructure  should  be built  to  cater  for  a  seamless

journey from home to the park.  For instance, parks should be

easily accessible by public transport and there must be ample

free car-parking facilities for park users who drive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should seriously consider providing

subsidy  for operating all parks in Singapore.   So  far,  no

commercial   parks   have  been  successfully   operated   in

Singapore.   In short, there is a need for more public  parks

to be built in Singapore to support the pro-family movement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Rejuvenate our beaches. We have to rejuvenate and

inject  more  life into our shores and beaches.   Today,  our

beaches  are  not  very  well  maintained  and,  hence,   not

attractive to many Singaporeans.  There is a general lack  of

facilities and activities along our beaches.  Firstly, the

seabed  and  water do not cater well for swimming and  water-sports activities.  Secondly, some of the beaches have  pests

such  as crows and strays which create much nuisance to beach

goers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beaches are good spots for pro-family activities. They

serve  as  good  recreational venues for family  outings  and

picnics.   The  Government  should  place  more  emphasis  in

rejuvenating our beaches.  For example, there should be  more

water-sports  facilities  for  activities  such  as  boating,

windsurfing or canoeing.  We should also increase the  number

of  food  outlets, such as ice-cream, drinks or snack stalls,

to  be  located  along the beaches to add more  life  to  our

beaches.   Some  areas  should be  cordoned  off  to  provide

swimming bays with ample toilet facilities to serve the beach

users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Build more swimming pools within the community.

Based  upon the current planning ratio, some communities  are

deprived  of  swimming pools because they  do  not  have  the

required  population catchment to be entitled to  a  swimming

complex.   This  policy needs to be reviewed if  we  want  to

encourage families to play together.  Swimming pools  provide

good  opportunities for the whole family to keep fit as  well

as to have fun together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter this problem, we can consider building

smaller swimming complexes, ie, maybe a 50-metre pool  and  a

25-metre  training pool, instead of large swimming  complexes

which   are   currently  built  only  for  large   population

catchments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that it is generally expensive to

operate  a  swimming complex as the income generated  is  low

while  operating costs are high.  However, if we look  at  it

from   the  pro-family  as  well  as  the  healthy  lifestyle

perspectives, the benefits to be gained should  outweigh  the

costs in the long run.  Besides, the smaller swimming complex

can  be  built near a cluster of schools and be utilised  for

extra-curricular activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish that, as a good start, the Government

will consider forming a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>

working committee to study the physical infrastructure  needs

for  building  and  strengthening family bonding  within  our

communities.  This should send a clear signal to all citizens

that  the Government is actively seeking ways to improve  the

quality  of  life of all Singaporeans by taking the  positive

step towards fulfilling its commitment to S21.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for

allowing me to join the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I had not planned to join this

debate, and I may not have done so if this morning my 3-year-old  son had not woken me and asked me to play with  him.   I

did  so until 9.30 and then got to the office only at 10.   I

may  not have joined this debate also if my wife did not tell

me, when we were walking at 7.00 am, that she wished we had a

reliable  part-time  domestic help  instead  of  a  full-time

foreign worker we do have.  This is despite the fact that she

runs  her own business and is the primary care-giver for  our

son.  And I may not have joined this debate also if I had not

heard   the   Minister  for  Health  yesterday   defend   the

Government's  policy  not to give any special  assistance  to

single mothers who decide to keep their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we are all in this House in favour of

families  and family-friendly practices.  What I am concerned

about  is that our support becomes merely convention - stated

but   not  practised  -  that  we  replace,  in  this  sense,

motherhood statements with family-hood statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first think of family-friendly practices, I do of

course  think of the women - the wives and mothers among  us.

Too  many have to make a choice between a job they enjoy  and

their  children whom they also enjoy.  And this is a beggar's

choice.   They  should have more options than  this.   Losing

women  from  the workplace is a loss not only to the  economy

but  also  for the women themselves.  Many enjoy  aspects  of

work  and life outside the house, and this is a part of  what

they want for themselves in their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>

training,  in their view of their own self-esteem.   And,  of

course,  they  love  their children.  But  this  is  a  great

sacrifice that need not always be made and may not always  be

best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while they are important, this debate about families

should look beyond women as wives and mothers.  If we do not,

there is a danger that when we think of the family, we assume

and cater only to what some think of as the ideal family, ie,

husband  and wife, children - two or more, please - with  the

assumption  of  a  maid  and perhaps  a  helpful  and  active

grandmother.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this perspective, Sir, it is too easy to think of

family-friendly practices as being primarily and perhaps only

for women as wives and mothers.  While this is the ideal that

some  in our society presently uphold, we have to look beyond

this if we are truly to be family-friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of a family after all, as sociologists tell us,

is  changeable over time, culture and space.  In Singapore in

a  past  generation, extended families were the norm.   There

were  also  families which involved more than one wife,  more

than one mother.  In other countries today, while the nuclear

family is the norm, the exact arrangements of who takes  care

of the children may differ from what we in Singapore think of

as  normal.  We do not have to change our social norms.   But

we  do  need to show true flexibility if we are to  be  truly

friendly to the family.  In this context, I put forward three

suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on fathers. I must confess an interest

here.   I  think we must not be patriarchal.   Even  if  most

Singaporeans still believe that the woman must be the one who

is  the primary care-giver to the family, we must be flexible

enough  to  give  men the option.  We should not  design  the

workplace so that men work too long and too hard without  any

choice,  while women join, inevitably, a sort of  slow  track

or,  as  in Japan, have the primary role in the workplace  as

tea  ladies.  A few men may want to become house-husbands and

the primary care-giver to the children.  More

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>

men  may wish to take on a larger share of the family  duties

while still keeping the wife in the primary driver-seat.  And

even  if  the norm is otherwise, our system must be  flexible

enough to allow for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, single mothers. Our Government has been

reluctant  to  acknowledge singles  and,  especially,  single

parents.  I understand that many do not wish this to  be  the

norm.   Accordingly,  some  incentives  should  go  only  for

couples.  However, we should not go too far in this.  If  one

takes the idea of being a single parent seriously and no  one

takes   it   lightly,  the  pressures  of  money,  time   and

responsibility  are very great, and I think all  Singaporeans

recognise  this.   If, despite all these, a Singaporean  does

make  that  decision, I think we have to have a  system  that

supports and allows that decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion is on dependence on the domestic

maid or helper.  I think, Sir, there is a time and a need  to

seriously  look at the provision of part-time domestic  help,

childcare  centres and other facilities that will enable  the

nuclear family, ie, the mother and the father, to do more for

themselves and more for their children.  There need, in other

words,  to be alternatives to the full-time foreign  maid  as

the  primary  care-giver.  This is important for privacy  and

quality  family  time;   this is important  to  have  parents

recognise  a greater role in the care of their own  children.

There  is not much point in providing more swimming pools  or

more  play  centres  if  all  we see  there  are  maids  with

children,  and  parents  at  the workplace  or  the  shopping

centres.   We  need,  in  a sense, to  ask  the  Ministry  of

Manpower   to  help  promote  and  professionalise  part-time

housekeeping   services  by  Singaporeans   for   Singaporean

families  and,  perhaps, to have a match-making  service  for

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was Tolstoy or some other Russian writer who

said that all happy families are the same while every unhappy

family  has unique cause and character.  In today's world,  I

beg to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>

disagree.   In the face of so many pressures in the workplace

in  competition between companies to get ahead, I think it is

each  happy family now that is unique.  Our system has to  be

flexible  enough, therefore, to acknowledge and support  each

and every family in its effort to be unique and to be happy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Lily  Neo  for

her  comprehensive survey of issues relating to  the  family,

especially  to raising our fertility rate.  I  wish  also  to

thank  all those who spoke, with great spirit in some  cases,

and gave their views and suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the concerns raised are real ones, shared by the

Government.   This is the reason why the Prime  Minister  has

asked  me  and two of my Cabinet colleagues, Messrs  Lim  Hng

Kiang and Abdullah Tarmugi, to form the Ministerial Committee

on Marriage and Procreation to look into these concerns.  The

fact  that the Prime Minister himself raised the subject  and

spoke  of  the  joys of a family at the National  Day  Rally,

shows that the Government is not just concerned with economic

achievements but also with our social achievements.  Dr  Lee,

I  feel, misinterpreted the Prime Minister's statement.   The

Prime  Minister acknowledges that it is far harder to measure

social  development,  not that we are  clinging  to  the  old

economic ones.  Many of Dr Neo's proposals and those  of  the

other  speakers  have actually either been  implemented,  are

being   implemented,   or  are  currently   being   seriously

considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now reply to some of the more specific points

that they have raised.  First, I will start with the physical

ones  that Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested.  I would like him  to

expand  on  his ideas.  But it is not necessary to  form  yet

another  ministerial committee or committee of Parliament  to

do  it.  In the spirit of S21, Dr Teo and like-minded Members

of  Parliament, as well as like-minded members of the public,

can  get  together,  do a study and present  a  comprehensive

report.  That report could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>

be  submitted  to the Ministerial Committee on  Marriage  and

Procreation or, if he feels that he could do so directly with

the Minister for National Development, he is also free to  do

so.  This is what we mean when we talk about participation by

the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo has urged that there be a comprehensive approach

to formulating and implementing policies to address the issue

of falling fertility.  We totally agree with her.  Therefore,

when  the  Government announced the package  of  measures  to

encourage marriage and procreation recently, we stressed  the

need  to  create  a  total environment conducive  to  couples

marrying  and  having more children.  Here, I would  like  to

reiterate to Mr Simon Tay that the Government's objective  is

to  have couples marrying and having more children within the

institution  of  marriage.  So it is  not  the  role  of  the

Government  to  promote single parenthood.  Besides  monetary

incentives like the Baby Bonus Scheme, the measures  included

promoting pro-family work practices, increasing the supply of

quality  childcare centres, easier home ownership  for  young

couples,    public   education   and   creating   socialising

opportunities for the young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key measure is public education. Hence, a Public

Education Committee (PEC) on the Family chaired by the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary for Community Development and Sports,

Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee Shoon, has been formed.  The PEC  will  look

into  a number of the proposals that Dr Neo has raised,  such

as  changing  the  mindset of employers who prefer  employees

with  no family commitments, encouraging earlier childbearing

and  role-sharing, and expanding the avenues for young people

to  socialise.  I do not need to elaborate on this as Dr Neo,

being a member of the PEC, will be familiar with its work.  I

also  note that Dr Vasoo and Dr Jennifer Lee are also members

of  this  Committee.   We hope that Dr Neo  and  these  other

members  of  the  Committee would spare  no  effort  in  this

important task of changing mindsets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, already many existing pro-family

policies. We have, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>

example,   been   advocating  that  the   responsibility   of

parenthood  does  not lie solely with the women  and  fathers

must  share  their  responsibilities  in  bringing  up  their

children.   The  Prime  Minister  reiterated  this  when   he

announced the paternity leave scheme in the civil service  in

August  this  year.   It may not be very  much  of  a  fringe

benefit  in terms of cost but it is a very strong  signal  to

the  public  at large that the fathers also have  a  role  to

play.   MCDS has also been organising and supporting seminars

on fathering to highlight the importance of fatherhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is our pro-family public housing. There

are  rental  schemes  in place for young couples  setting  up

homes  for  the first time.  Those who book a new flat  still

under  construction under the Registration  for  Flat  System

(RFS) or who have been in the queue for at least three months

awaiting  selection of a flat can apply to rent a  three-room

flat  under the Transitional Rental Housing Scheme.  For  low

income  couples,  they could apply under  the  Public  Rental

Housing Scheme to rent a one-room or two-room flat from  HDB,

or  the  Rent and Purchase Scheme which allows them to  first

rent  a  three-room  flat and buy over the flat  subsequently

when their financial situation improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association has also been encouraging

community-based  organisations  to  conduct  more  grassroots

programmes  to  strengthen family ties  and  neighbourliness.

Activities  range  from  family  day  activities  to  festive

celebrations  involving  families.   And  I  hope  that   all

advisers  will  review  the activities  of  their  grassroots

organisations and make sure that they are better focused  and

therefore  more effective in strengthening family bonds.  The

work  is  not  that of just the Government and policies.  The

work  has  to  be done on the ground and I hope, through  the

advisers, that more can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has also implemented several family-friendly initiatives. Apart from the paid marriage and

paternity  leave that were implemented from 1st October  this

year, it has allowed individual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>

ministries and departments to arrange flexi-work arrangements

as  long  as  there is no loss of productivity and  lapse  in

service  standards to the public. These are  in  addition  to

many  other pro-family policies introduced much earlier,  for

example, no-pay leave for childcare, part-time employment for

working mothers and sick childcare leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting family-friendly practices in private sector

companies  is a key strategic focus for both the Ministry  of

Community   Development  and  Sports  and  the  Ministry   of

Manpower.   This is intended not just to improve family  life

but  also work life.  Efforts to encourage employers to adopt

family-friendly  work practices were first initiated  by  the

then Ministry of Community Development and its people sector-led  Committee  on  the  Family.   One  of  the  first  major

initiatives was the launch of the Family Friendly Firm  Award

in  1998.  This was introduced together with the Ministry  of

Manpower, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the

National  Trades Union Congress. The award aims to  recognise

companies for their pro-family efforts and encourage them  to

introduce  and  promote innovative pro-family  practices  for

their employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is well aware of the increasing struggles

for  families  in  coping  with a fast-paced  knowledge-based

economy.  This year, both Prime Minister Goh and Deputy Prime

Minister  BG Lee have emphasised the need to have  pro-family

workplaces.  This  is  particularly so  as  the  dual  income

families become the norm and working hours become longer in a

24  x  7  economy.  But let us pause and think. The  24  x  7

economy  does  not necessarily mean that each person  has  to

work  longer hours in a week.  It is how we roster people  at

work  and  how smartly they work that is important,  not  the

number  of  hours that they spend at work. And  this  is  the

focus  which  all  employers should bear in  mind  when  they

devise  pro-family practices.  It will make a mockery of  the

concept  of  productivity if getting  more  work  done  means

getting the workers to work longer hours.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by Dr Neo, many of the organisations in the

United  States  of America have offered family-friendly  work

practices  believing  that being family-friendly  makes  good

business sense. This is despite their government's negligible

role in promoting family-friendly programmes.  In fact, these

companies  no  longer talk about work-family balance  because

the  word  "balance"  seems  to  suggest  a  zero  sum  game.

Instead,  they  talk  about work-life effectiveness  as  they

strongly  believe  that employees with  strong  personal  and

family  ties would be more effective and motivated  at  work.

Family  and work are not necessarily at odds with each other.

This  represents  a  paradigm shift and reflects  a  holistic

approach.   European  companies  too  have  adopted   family-friendly practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our local companies to emulate these companies.

We agree that employers should, as far as possible, implement

flexi-work  arrangements  to help  Singaporeans  with  family

responsibilities  to participate in the  workforce.  This  is

particularly  so with the availability of IT.   Our  existing

employment  laws are already flexible in allowing  flexi-work

arrangements. What is needed are creative solutions by  human

resource  managers.   Our  laws  also  ensure  that   workers

employed  on a part-time basis can enjoy pro-rated employment

benefits  such as medical leave. Employers are also  required

to  contribute  to  the Central Provident Fund  even  if  the

employee is working part-time.  Nevertheless, the Ministry of

Manpower is reviewing the Employment Act to ensure that  they

continue  to  meet the needs of business and employees.   And

those employers who want to re-design their working hours and

practices   and   who  encounter  some  problems   with   our

legislation  would be encouraged to bring them  up  with  the

Ministry  of Manpower so that they can be taken into  account

when the Employment Act is reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to point out that the paid maternity

leave  in our Employment Act for up to two children  and  the

additional grants for the second and third child are in  fact

more favourable and family-friendly as compared to a number

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>

of  other countries including Australia, New Zealand and some

states  in  the United States of America which  do  not  even

require  employers  to  pay for such  leave  as  a  statutory

benefit.  Such  benefits in these countries  are  subject  to

negotiations between the employer and employee concerned. The

point I want to put across to Members is:  let us look at the

total  package,  not  just  on  specific  measures  that  are

available  in  any  country. We have to  look  at  the  total

package and see how those incentives work before we say  that

we should adopt them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing family-friendly work practices requires

much work to be done in changing our employers' mindsets  and

that  is why the Ministry of Community Development and Sports

set  up  a  Work-Life Unit in September this year to  promote

family-friendly  work  practices. The  Ministry  of  Manpower

itself  has also set up the Human Resource Promotion  Section

in  1999 to promote good human resource (HR) practices. These

measures reflect our commitment to bringing about a workplace

culture change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by Dr Lee, MCDS engaged two leading

American  work-life consultants to conduct awareness seminars

and  training  workshops for HR managers as well  as  provide

consultancy to companies in Singapore.  The response to these

events  was  overwhelming.  Numerous companies  have  already

approached  the  Work-Life Unit to give sharing  sessions  on

work-life  strategies  and to provide  more  information  and

advice.  So an encouraging ground swell has started to  build

up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another initiative which the Ministries are working on

would be the compilation of actual pro-family practices  that

work,  for  example,  K  K  Hospital,  Changi  Hospital,   ST

Aerospace  and others, to show other employers  what  can  be

done  and we will need to provide greater publicity for these

measures that work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to childcare facilities. Dr Vasoo has

asked  for a review of childcare subsidies. We can assure  Dr

Vasoo that the subsidies will be reviewed periodically

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>

to  ensure that they keep pace with the times.  Dr Neo  asked

for  better  distribution  of  childcare  centres.  Childcare

centres  in  private residential areas are set up by  private

operators  and, as in any commercial enterprise, the  numbers

are  determined by the viability of the project.  In new  HDB

estates,  MCDS plans ahead of demand through regular meetings

with  HDB  based  on  the number of dwelling  units  for  the

estate.   For  older HDB estates, we increase the  number  of

centres in high demand areas.  MCDS works closely with HDB so

that  childcare premises are conveniently sited together with

the  housing  blocks.   MCDS will  be  delegating  the  local

planning   of  childcare  centres  to  Community  Development

Councils  (CDCs), which will better enable them to gauge  and

respond to local demand.  Here, Members of Parliament who are

members  of  CDCs can expect to play a greater  role  at  the

local area.  For a start, this will take place starting  with

Marine Parade and Tanjong Pagar CDCs.  MCDS will continue  to

manage  demand  and supply at the national level  and  ensure

that acceptable standards are met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides promoting the setting up of childcare centres in

private   residential  areas,  we  also  encourage  childcare

centres  in condominiums.  URA levies development charges  at

the residential rate instead of commercial rate for childcare

centres  in  condominiums.  URA has also lifted  restrictions

requiring such centres to serve residents only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some financial support and incentives are provided to

employers  who  set  up  childcare  centres  as  an  employee

benefit.   These  include capital grants for  furnishing  and

equipping  new  centres and various tax incentives.   We  can

review these incentives to see whether they are adequate  and

up  them  if they are not, although we should note  that  our

studies  show  a  low demand for workplace childcare  centres

overall.  This is the more important factor than plot  ratios

that Dr Lee, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Dr Vasoo had mentioned.   A

critical  mass  is  necessary for a childcare  centre  to  be

viable,  and  that has been the experience of NTUC  Childcare

for which I have some knowledge.  You must have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>

critical  mass of children using a centre for that centre  to

be  economically viable.  As a rule of thumb, it is now above

100  children  per  centre.  So, there  have  been  childcare

centres at workplaces run by NTUC Childcare contracted by the

employers,  but the number of children had been too  few  for

the  centres  to be viable and, unfortunately,  they  had  to

close down.  I think if we wish to have more such centres set

up  where the parents work, a viable centre would be one that

does  not  specifically serve one employer only, and  has  to

serve  a  number of employers, so that we can get a  critical

mass  of  children using that centre to make the cost  within

reason.    This  is  something which  private  operators  can

examine  and  if there are impediments to the setting  up  of

such  centres,  please let us know and, where  possible,  the

obstacles can be removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS has also studied the obstacles to the development

of  childcare centres catering to children below  18  months.

We are mindful of the fact that many child experts agree that

the  first  few  years of a child's life  are  important  for

parent to child bonding, and that infants are best cared  for

at  home  by their mothers or relatives.  And indeed  surveys

also  show  that  that  is  the  preference  of  the  parents

themselves.   Hence, we should put more emphasis  on  support

for  home  care, such as family-friendly employment practices

and  also  encourage the extended family.  However,  if  dual

income families have no other alternatives to care for  their

infants, we have to promote other care arrangements.  One  of

the measures taken recently was to revise the requirement for

infant  care  centres to have at least one paediatric-trained

nurse  to one state approved nurse.  This does not compromise

standards.   In  fact, when we have trained sufficient  early

childhood   personnel  specialising  in  infant   care,   the

requirement  to have a nurse can be removed altogether.   The

whole  purpose  is,  of course, to bring  down  the  cost  of

operating such centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for allowing part-time employment of foreign domestic

workers,  the  Ministry of Manpower is hesitant to  introduce

such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

an  option.   Currently, there are more than 100,000  foreign

domestic  workers in Singapore.  This number has  doubled  in

the  last  10 years.  Allowing households access to part-time

foreign  domestic workers may greatly increase their numbers,

as  households without foreign domestic workers could turn to

them.  This could increase our reliance on foreign labour and

could have adverse social consequences.  There would also  be

concerns over the question of responsibility of looking after

the welfare and accommodation of these workers.  They may  be

exploited  or abused.  And allowing foreign domestic  workers

to  work  part-time  will stunt the  emergence  of  a  strong

domestic  service sector.  So let us look  at  the  need  and

examine  how  other  countries achieve higher  female  labour

force  participation rates than us without relying on foreign

domestic workers.  I think this is an issue which we have not

examined to any depth.  Why are the Nordic countries,  as  Dr

Lily  Neo  says, reflecting a higher fertility rate than  us,

and  yet  in those Nordic countries they do not have a  heavy

reliance  on foreign domestic maids?  Maybe there are  things

that they can teach us.  And I think one of the possibilities

is  the availability of services using local domestic workers

rather than foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on stress in education. Dr Neo has made a number

of  proposals to fine tune our education system.  She  talked

about homework overload.  I would like to assure her that the

Ministry  of  Education  has a differentiated  curriculum  to

develop  each  child  to  his  or  her  potential.   However,

sometimes  the expectations and aspirations of  parents  come

into  play,  and these have direct impact on their children's

stress  level.   Our message to these parents  is  that  they

should  not stress the child beyond what he or she is capable

of.   Instead,  we should look at the total development,  not

just the academic achievements of the child.  What is already

in  the school curriculum is sufficient.  It is not necessary

to  overload  the  child with a lot of other extra-curricular

activities.   So it is the responsibility of the  parents  to

ensure that there is no such overload.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for providing tutorial classes after school hours, I

understand that the schools today have various programmes and

activities to cater to those who need help with their  school

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On schools starting later and allowing facilities to be

used  by  students  throughout  the  day,  the  Ministry   of

Education  has implemented single session programmes  in  all

secondary schools this year.  Hence, these schools  have  the

flexibility  to  rearrange their formal curriculum  hours  to

accommodate the needs of their pupils by starting  their  day

later.   Co-curricular activities, pastoral  care  and  other

programmes can also be organised after class by the students,

and  also  with the support of the parents.  Primary  schools

will  have  constraints as they run double session programmes

now.  However, this too is being reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education also agrees that children

should  not  only  be  exam-smart.  Hence,  the  Ministry  of

Education  implemented the Thinking Skills programme  in  all

secondary  schools  in 1999, to encourage students  to  think

critically  and  creatively.  It has also  introduced  Inter-disciplinary  Project  Work to all schools  and  have  a  few

challenging "thinking questions" in their examinations.  And,

recently, that caused a little bit of uproar with respect  to

the PSLE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also ranked on both academic and non-academic achievements. The Ministry of Education has also

adopted the school excellence model for all schools this year

to  broaden  the  scope  of the way  schools  are  appraised.

Linked to this is an award system that recognises talents and

abilities in non-academic spheres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities will also implement a new admission

system in the year 2003, moving away from a sole reliance  on

'A'  levels towards a more holistic evaluation of a  person's

potential  to  benefit  from  university  education.   Hence,

performance  in  a  reasoning  test,  project  work  and  co-curricular activities will be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, let me take a step back and ask

all of us to assess our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>

education system.  International studies have shown  that  we

have  a  good  system.   I  hope that  the  Public  Education

Committee will address this and bring home this point to  all

parents,   so   that  there  is  less  stress   come   school

registration time.  It is not necessary to get into  the  so-called list of top schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for stress on academic results, let me reassure

Members of the House that the public service does not promote

on  the  basis  of examination results.  The  public  service

promotes  on  the  basis  of performance,  the  result  of  a

performance appraisal which the public service does, and  not

because  of what kind of examination results that person  has

had  in  school  or  at  university.   And  it  would  be  an

exaggeration,  to put it mildly, to describe  our  system  as

elitist.  We should not confuse meritocracy with elitism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, subsidising health care for children. Dr Neo has

suggested providing free medical treatment for our pre-school

children.   Currently, the Government is already providing  a

national childhood immunisation programme and the development

screening programme which monitors the growth and development

of  infants  and pre-school children free of  charge  at  our

polyclinics.   For acute care, our healthcare finance  policy

stresses personal responsibility for maintaining good health.

Parents should look after the health of their children.   For

children  who  fall sick and seek treatment  in  our  heavily

subsidised polyclinics and public hospitals, the parents have

to pay only part of the cost of the medical service consumed.

The principle of co-payment is necessary to avoid the pitfall

of "free" medical services stimulating insatiable demand, and

to keep the cost of basic health care affordable.  Currently,

our  children  are subsidised at 75% at the  polyclinics  and

between  65%  and 80% in Class B2 or C wards.   Our  children

will  never  be denied access to basic medical  care  because

their  parents are in financial difficulties as  the  parents

can apply for Medifund assistance or waiver of fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point about Government expenditure on health

care, we must bear

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>

in  mind that higher Government expenditure on health care is

often  related  to higher tax rates.  So it  is  one  or  the

other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to liberalising the use of Medisave for

assisted conception procedures (ACP), the Ministry of  Health

has   received   feedback  from  the  public  regarding   the

inadequacy of the current Medisave withdrawal limits  imposed

on  ACP.   It  is currently reviewing the Medisave withdrawal

limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, there are also few procedural impediments

to   childless   couples  adopting   babies.    When   social

investigations  are conducted, they serve  to  safeguard  the

interests  and  well-being of the child to be  adopted.   The

primary problem is the lack of babies, especially local ones,

available for adoption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign adoptions require certain safeguards and checks

to  ensure  that  the  adoptive  parents  see  through  their

responsibility  of  raising  the  child.   We  do  not   want

situations  where parents give up their adopted  child  later

because  of  difficulties in the relationship.   Nonetheless,

MCDS  and  other departments involved will continue  to  look

into facilitating foreign adoption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of what we have discussed are on social

infrastructure  and the soft aspects of the issues,  and  the

building  up  of social capital in our society.   It  is  the

subject of social capital which is completely relevant to the

subject in hand for which we have not fully explored. We will

have  to  understand  not only the work pressures  but  other

factors  at  work that inhibit couples from having  children.

Here,  I think we are going into a much larger area for which

we have as yet little good knowledge.  But we should continue

to examine those factors and address them wherever we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With family-friendly workplaces and family-friendly

environment  and our continual drive in putting forward  pro-family policies, programmes, services and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>

messages,  I  am confident that we can become  an  even  more

family-oriented  society.   I  am  sure  that  the   energies

demonstrated  by  Members of this House will  translate  into

more babies and stronger families.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank  Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng  for his favourable  and  positive

responses.  I would also like to express my gratitude to  all

my  colleagues - Dr Vasoo, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Dr Tan Boon Wan,

Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Dr Jennifer Lee  and  Mr

Simon Tay - who have participated in this debate.  They  have

raised  many  good  suggestions and unique perspectives  that

make this debate interesting and fruitful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On child care centres, Mr Lim Boon Heng said that their

studies showed a low demand for work-place child care centres

overall.   This  is not borne out by the apparent  popularity

and  success in the existing child care centres at workplaces

run  by the Kandang Kerbau Women and Children Hospital,  MCDS

and Ministry of Manpower, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can understand that private organisations would

always consider the cost of providing child care centres.  Mr

Lim  Boon Heng has mentioned about a critical mass for  child

care  centres  to  be  economically  viable.   However,   the

challenge  is  to  re-emphasise that money spent  on  family-friendly  practices  is a draw for the company's  performance

and  attractiveness.  Steps taken by the  Government  to  re-visit   and  review  facilities  in  terms  of  grants,   tax

incentives  and  set  up  such  centres  will  endorse   this

practice.  Echoing Dr Jennifer Lee, Dr Vasoo and Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua,  I  would like to suggest that the Ministry of  National

Development waive development charges for building child care

centres at workplaces and favourably treating this as in  the

category of community service by our Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On school starting later, Mr Lim Boon Heng said that

schools   have  the  flexibility  to  arrange  their   formal

curriculum hours to accommodate the needs of their pupils

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>

by  starting  their  day  later.   It  seems,  however,  that

principals have not taken the initiative to start  later.   I

doubt if it is really in the interest of the students that no

change  in the start-times has been made, especially for  the

single-session  schools.  I therefore feel that  there  is  a

need for positive directive from the Ministry of Education on

this, especially for single-session schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of Medisave for intro-vitro fertilisation, Mr

Lim  Boon  Heng said that the Ministry of Health is currently

reviewing  the  Medisave  withdrawal  limits.   I  hope   the

Ministry  of  Health will give a significant  and  favourable

response on this for the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The opportunity for more births;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Infertile couples' desperation for a child of their own;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Such couples are usually young and can build up their

Medisave savings for many more years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the difficulty for young couples to rent HDB flats,

Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng mentioned existing schemes  available  to

young couples.  However, unless the couples have applied  for

home ownership flats under the RFS as first-timers, they  are

not  eligible to rent HDB flats at the moment.  The other HDB

rental  scheme  available with a $800  ceiling  on  household

income,  which  has been implemented for the past  10  years,

invariably excludes young working couples in today's context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our existing HDB rental policy dashes our hope of

changing the mindset of our young who are postponing marriage

and  starting  family  until they  have  succeeded  in  their

careers  or  have bought their own homes.  Our policy  should

not  be hampering or contradictory in nature.  Therefore,  if

young  couples are not prepared to buy HDB homes for whatever

reasons, they should not be denied the rental of HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister gave several reasons against allowing part-time foreign maids.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>

Sir,  I  would like to appeal for a reconsideration with  the

following viewpoints:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Allowing part-time foreign maids will create

additional demand.  This may not necessarily be so  as  those

who  have  full-time foreign maids may then opt for part-time

ones  to  save cost or to have more privacy and  so  on.   In

fact,  as mentioned by Mr Simon Tay earlier, his wife is  one

of those who prefers part-time maid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Accommodation for part-time maids will be a concern.

This  can be overcome by allowing only those agents that  can

provide  accommodation getting the licence to  recruit.   The

number  of  maids that will be approved will  depend  on  the

space or accommodation available for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Issue of exploitation of maids and illegals working

in  other  sectors.  Here, the agents again have to  be  made

accountable  for  some  code  of  practice  to  address  this

problem.  Sir, deterrent measures can be put in place to deal

with errant agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Over-reliance on foreign maids. The present rules

concerning employer eligibility and maid levy may be  adopted

for  part-time maids to prevent unnecessary and over-reliance

on foreign maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Stunting the emergence of a strong domestic service

sector.   Sir,  this is not valid because Singaporeans  would

not take such jobs which are considered lowly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Boon Heng has said that many European country

families  do not need maids.  I would like to reiterate  that

these  countries have good government and social  support  as

well  as conducive work environment that are pro-family.   If

we  can  match  them  one  day in the near  future,  probably

Singaporean families may not need maids too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would say that social conditions change

and  it  is  necessary therefore that policies  get  adjusted

accordingly  to  suit  the  needs  of  the  time.   Even   if

difficulties abound, the desired outcome must be sought. As I

have said

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>

earlier,  it  may involve a major change in the  mindsets  of

both  the  people and the  Government.  We  need  to  make  a

positive move to achieve this change.  It would be worthwhile

in  the long run if the adjustments can help Singaporeans  to

balance the demands of work and family responsibility better.

You  may  ask  why  there is such a need  for  us  to  be  so

proactive in promoting harmonising work and family now.   Are

we  a nanny state?  Sir, my answer is that Singapore has been

successful  because  the Government was  able  to  anticipate

problems and influence the people at overcoming the problems.

Singapore  is  a small country with a very small  population.

We  cannot just let things drift unchecked all the time.   In

the  case of declining total fertility rates, that will  mean

lesser  and  lesser Singaporeans in the future to ensure  the

survival and prosperity and continuity of this state.  We  do

not   have  the  luxury  of  other  big  countries  with  big

populations to cushion the effect of declining birth rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of it all, if more proactive actions are

taken  to help Singaporeans beget happiness, as mentioned  by

Mr  Simon  Tay earlier, through harmonising work and  family,

our efforts today would have received its honorarium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and

the House for the patience and indulgence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I just briefly

make two very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>

small clarifications.  I was mentioned in particular.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Minister has already spoken. All

to  me  and my wife's wish to have a part-time maid.  I  just

but a part-time Singaporean worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second very brief point which I want to clarify is

that  I  never  said  that I thought that  Government  should

promote  single parenthood, but rather I hope that Government
