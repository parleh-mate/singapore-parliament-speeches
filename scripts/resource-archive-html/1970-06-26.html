question  directed to the Minister for  Defence  in

Question No. 2. I understand that the Hon. Minister

for Defence, in answer to Question No. 2, will also

answer  Question  No. 1. Inche  Abdul  Aziz  Karim,

Question No. 2, please.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Yes, Sir.

Question No. 2.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Thank

you,  Mr Speaker, Sir. As you have indicated, Sir,

in  replying to this Question from the  Member  for

Kallang,  I will also be replying on behalf  of  my

colleagues,  the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development  and the Minister for Finance,  as  all

three Questions asked by the Member for Kallang are

similar in theme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is in the Development Estimates a provision for six rural type community centres calculated at $10,000 each. This is a balance from the bulk provision for 10 rural type community centres and three standard type community centres under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



the  Five-Year Development Plan 1966-70.  As  every

constituency now has at least one community centre,

the  balance of available funds will be  used  only

for  new  community  centres  in  the  resettlement

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social and recreational amenities are being

provided  and  will  be provided  by  the  People's

Association  in consultation with the  Housing  and

Development  Board and the Jurong Town  Corporation

for  the  people residing in and working at Kallang

Basin.  I  am  told,  Sir,  that  the  Housing  and

Development Board has provided a limited  range  of

social  and recreational amenities for its  tenants

in all the housing estates, and Kallang Basin is no

exception.   In  conjunction  with   the   People's

Association, the Housing and Development Board  has

provided a community centre with outdoor and indoor

recreational amenities in Neighbourhood I,  bounded

by  Serangoon  Road, Bendemeer Road and  Boon  Keng

Road.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Does the Minister

consider a ground floor unit adequate to serve  the

needs of a population of thousands in Kallang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sure my colleague, the

Minister    for    National    Development,    will

sympathetically consider the request, if it is made

to  him,  for  the use of a ground floor  unit  for

recreational  activities.  But  I  understand  that

there  is a four-acre ground which the Housing  and

Development  Board has marked out in Kallang  Basin

for  the provision of a park and other recreational

amenities for the residents.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does

the  Minister  think that the People's Association,

the  Housing and Development Board and  the  Jurong

Town  Corporation  have  in  the  past  engaged  in

imaginative  forward plan-fling to  provide  social

and recreational amenities, particularly in Kallang

Basin, where the population is growing day by day?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Can the Member repeat the first

part of his supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Does the Minister think

that  the People's Association, of which he  is  in

charge,  the Housing and Development Board and  the

Jurong Town Corporation have in the past engaged in

imaginative forward planning to provide social  and

recreational  amenities,  particularly  in  Kallang

Basin  where the population, the working population

included, is growing day by day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we could not

have  provided the residents of Kallang  with  what

the  Member  for  Kallang described as  imaginative

planning,  because  Kallang  Basin  is  just  being

populated. However, I do not think it is beyond the

ingenuity  of the People's Association, the  Jurong

Town  Corporation and the Housing  and  Development

Board   to   provide   imaginative   planning   for

recreational   amenities  for  the   residents   in

Kallang.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does

the  Minister agree with the statement made by  the

new  Director of the People's Association that  one

of  the  ways to improve the standard of living  of

the poorer people is to provide adequate social and

recreational  facilities in the form  of  community

centres?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I agree entirely with that

statement and we are doing our very best to provide

adequate facilities. Here again, I must say that in

many   instances  where  adequate  facilities   are

provided, they are not being fully made use of. And

in  many  instances  also, we have  to  close  down

community  centres because they have not been  made

use  of. But where there is a need, we will  always

try  to meet it. If the Member for Kallang can mark

out  any  area  where he thinks a community  centre

will    be    useful,   we   will    consider    it

sympathetically.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Minister will consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



providing  an  additional community centre  or  two

medium-sized  ones in the Kallang Basin  Industrial

Housing Estates, that will be agreeable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as I have already said,

there  is a community centre nearby. We would  like

to  set up a community centre every 100 yards if we

can,  but, firstly, that is beyond our means,  and,

secondly, I do not think we have sufficient land to

do  this. Anyway, there is a four-acre ground which

can  be  fully  exploited to give the residents  of

Kallang  Basin all the amenities that they  require

for  sports, for airing themselves, or their  birds

if  they  keep birds, and for a better standard  of

living.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

present  community centre is just like  the  "Black

Hole  of  Calcutta"!  Will the  Minister  agree  to

rectify the situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We will rectify the situation as

best we can.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Defence has already

answered  Question No. 3 in his reply to  Questions

Nos. 1 and 2.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main objects of this Bill is to

provide  for  more effective action  against  motor

vehicles which emit any smoke or visible vapour  so

as "to cause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



annoyance  or  danger to the public, or  injury  or

damage to any person or property".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present legislation under Rule 104 of the

Motor  Vehicles  (Construction and  Use)  Amendment

Rules, 1963, provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No vehicle shall be used which emits any smoke,

visible vapour, etc., the emission of which  causes

or  is  likely to cause injury or annoyance to  any

person, or damage to property or which endangers or

is likely to endanger the safety of any person'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties for the offence of "smoky exhaust" have

been dealt with in one of two ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) with the Police offering to offending

owners of such vehicles a composition fine  of

$20  under section 79 (1) -of the Road Traffic

Ordinance, 1961; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) on conviction, to a fine not exceeding $400

and  in  the  case of a second  or  subsequent

conviction to a fine not exceeding  $1,000  or

to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three

months  under  section  78  (1)  of  the  said

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, although last year more than 7,000

vehicle  owners paid composition fines of $20  each

for  smoky exhausts, yet the problem has not  shown

any   signs   of  improvement,  that  the   present

legislation  will  have  to  be  amended  so   that

penalties will be made more deterrent if we are  to

expect any marked improvement in the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the launching of the anti-pollution campaign

by  the  Prime Minister on 31st March, 1970, which,

inter  alia,  has, as a target, the eradication  of

the smoky exhausts from motor vehicles, this is the

opportune time to tighten up on the legislation  in

this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has therefore been proposed, firstly, to raise

the  limit of the composition fine from $20 to $50,

and  this  is provided for under clause  6  of  the

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in introducing the subject of "smoky

exhaust"   into  the  body  of  the  Road   Traffic

Ordinance  proper instead of appearing as  a  minor

offence under subsidiary legislation, it emphasizes

the importance which the Government attaches to the

problem  of air pollution and its determination  to

resolve  it, with firm measures wherever  possible.

Clause 3 of the Bill accordingly introduces  a  new

section  28A  and it clearly states that  both  the

owner and the driver of a vehicle are guilty of  an

offence,  if  such  vehicle  emits  "any  smoke  or

visible vapour".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards penalties, on first conviction, the

maximum  fine is to be raised from $400 to $500  to

bring  it  in  line  with  the  maximum  fine   for

littering.  I  am sure Members of this  House  will

agree with me that the offence of air pollution has

more  serious  and  damaging  consequences  to  the

health   of  the  community  than  littering   and,

therefore,  the raising of the fine is a legitimate

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted that a separate subsection (2)

of   section  28A  ensures  that  vehicles  of  the

Singapore  Traction Company are brought within  the

scope   of  the  amending  legislation  for   smoky

exhausts,  as  it is obvious that any strong  anti-

pollution  measures  to  be  taken  must  be   made

applicable  to  all  motor  vehicles  operating  on

Singapore   roads,  and  that  there  can   be   no

exceptions to the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will, I am sure, be

interested  to know that consequent on Government's

decision to raise the taxi fare for the first  mile

from  the present rate of 40 cents to 60 cents with

effect  from next month, i.e., 1st July, 1970,  all

3,800  licensed taxis have been requested to  first

pass the smoky exhaust test - namely, not to exceed

40   smoke   units  as  shown  by   the   Hartridge

Smokemeter.  Up  to Wednesday,  the  24th  of  this

month, a total of 3,166 licensed taxis or more than

80 per cent of taxis were put through the test, but

664  or  more  than 20 per cent failed  it.  It  is

therefore   clear   that   higher   standards    of

maintenance will be necessary if we are to see  the

last of smoky exhausts from our midst.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important purpose of this amendment Bill

is  to  be  found  in  clause 4,  which  introduces

another  new  section 29A, wherein  it  is  clearly

stated  that  "on or after the 1st day of  January,

1971,  every person who drives or is carried  on  a

motor  cycle  shall wear securely  on  his  head  a

protective  helmet  of  a  type  approved  by   the

Minister".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House are probably aware that

since  February this year, all "L" licence  holders

of  scooters and motor cycles are already  required

to   wear  approved-type  crash  helmets,  and  the

proposed incorporation of a new section in the body

of  the  Road Traffic Ordinance proper  once  again

draws  attention to the importance and emphasis  of

Government on the compulsory use of crash  helmets.

It  is  hoped that, in this way, the former  wanton

waste  of  young  lives of our population  will  be

greatly reduced hereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which some motorists are causing

obstruction  or  danger to traffic  by  leaving  or

abandoning  their  stalled  vehicles  on  the  road

whilst they attend to their personal matters first,

before   attempting  to  remove  their  broken-down

vehicles,   or   by  parking  their   vehicles   in

prohibited  areas,  necessitates  an  amendment  to

section  71.  This  is to make it  clear  that  the

Minister may make rules to provide for the  removal

and  detention of such vehicles. The  amendment  is

made in clause 5 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the opportunity is also taken

to   amend  the  existing  definition  of  "unladen

weight"  in  section  2 of the Ordinance.  The  new

definition will enable the Registrar of Vehicles to

prosecute offenders successfully. This amendment is

made in clause 2 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it cannot be denied that at the

present juncture the traffic congestion in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



Republic  is  becoming worse  and  worse.  This  is

particularly so during peak hours. If  there  is  a

traffic jam on a certain stretch of the road,  then

there will be a queue of vehicles as long as a  few

miles.  The  question is how to  enact  the  proper

legislation   and  to  incorporate  the   necessary

measures   so  as  to  improve  our  road   traffic

conditions. We must maintain a free flow of traffic

on    our    roads.   This   is   the   unavoidable

responsibility  of the Ministry of  Communications.

However,   as  far  as  this  amendment   Bill   is

concerned,  there is limited scope for solving  the

traffic problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill contains provisions which deal only

with  the  load  of vehicles, the  control  of  the

emission of smoky exhausts, the compulsory  wearing

of   crash  helmets,  the  enhancement  of  certain

penalties  and  so on. This is only  a  superficial

attempt   to   solve  our  traffic   problem.   The

fundamental  problem  of traffic  congestion  still

remains.  For example, the revision of  our  public

transport system, the widening of our roads and the

safety of road users -these problems have not  been

touched   upon.  Nevertheless,  since  the  traffic

problem  is  becoming worse and worse,  even  these

minor measures are helpful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, the International Seminar on Road Safety, which was held in the Republic and which ended yesterday, tried to find solutions to minimise road accidents. It is expected that this seminar will make many recommendations so that we and other governments

will benefit from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now touch upon certain provisions in the Bill. One of them relates to the compulsory wearing of crash helmets by motor cyclists. This is a very good provision because it will ensure their safety. It will also reduce the rate of fatal accidents among them. The fact that

the  Government has compelled them  to  wear  crash

helmets  has resulted in a great demand  for  these

helmets  and, because of this, the price of helmets

has gone up. This will impose a great burden on the

users



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



of  these  helmets. I hope the Minister will  adopt

measures to ensure that the price of crash  helmets

is reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clause in this Bill provides that certain

categories of traffic offenders will have to pay  a

composition fine of $50 instead of the present fine

of  $20.  Although the increase in the  composition

fine will act as a deterrent on the regular traffic

offenders,  it  is,  however, in  my  view,  a  bit

excessive. If it is only a very minor offence, such

as  parking in a non-parking area or waiting beside

a  white line, then a fine of $50 in such cases  is

very unreasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, taxi drivers will be the people most affected by this regulation because they spend most of their 24 hours on the road in order to earn their livelihood. If the fine is increased to this extent, their livelihood will be made more difficult. In view of this, I suggest that in the

implementation  of such legislation,  consideration

should  be  given to the merits of each  case.  For

example,  those minor cases which I have  mentioned

should not fall within the ambit of this provision.

But  in the case of rash and inconsiderate drivers,

speedsters  or those who dash past traffic  lights,

thereby endangering the lives of other people,  the

punishment  should be adequate in order  to  ensure

that such people obey the traffic rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment Bill reminds me of the policemen on traffic duty and their attitude towards their work. Perhaps this may not have any direct bearing on this Bill, but I wish to mention the traffic police in passing. If the Minister for Communications cannot answer my points. I think the

Minister  for  Defence will do so. I have  received

complaints  from  members of the  public  that  the

traffic  police are on the road not to  maintain  a

free   flow  of  traffic,  but  to  catch   traffic

offenders.  They  hide  behind  pillars  and  other

places and keep watch on passing vehicles. Why  are

they  doing  this?  They do it because,  by  hiding

themselves from the motorists, they will be able to

catch those who break the traffic rules, take  down

the numbers of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



vehicles,  send  them summonses and probably  bring

them  to  court.  Of course, I agree  that  traffic

offenders  must be brought to book and  dealt  with

according to the law. This is part of the duties of

the traffic police. But I think you will agree with

me,  Sir,  that  they have more  onerous  and  more

important  duties to perform, i.e., the maintenance

of  a  smooth  and orderly flow of traffic  on  our

roads.  It is not their duty to hide behind pillars

and  other  places to catch traffic  offenders.  If

they  do  this,  how can they direct  the  flow  of

traffic? This attitude is not correct and should be

rectified  accordingly. I do not know  whether  the

Minister concerned agrees with me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, though this amendment Bill is very limited in scope, it is by all standards a necessity aimed at promoting the free flow of traffic and ensuring the safety of pedestrians so that the roads will no longer remain, as the saying goes, the mouth of the tiger. In view of this, I

support this amendment Bill.

to be a further debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong) rose -

<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. At

first,  I  did  not  intend to speak.  But  at  the

invitation  of  the Minister for Communications,  I

would like to say a few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that I agree with the Member for

Sembawang that this Bill has a limited application?

It  is,  however,  an earnest of  the  Government's

desire  to improve the conditions of road  traffic.

But   in  respect  of  specific  aspects  of   such

conditions, this Bill relates to action to be taken

against  excessive  emission of smoke.  It  ensures

safety for those on motor cycles, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



it  gives  power to the Government to  take  action

against    those   vehicles   that   are    causing

obstruction.  But  the question  of  road  traffic,

safety, observance of regulations, I think,  has  a

wider  reference.  Any  motorist  can  notice   the

flagrant flouting of traffic laws in the very short

distance  that  he  takes  to  cover  the   minimum

journey. I think this flouting of traffic laws will

result  in  the  law  itself  being  brought   into

disrespect. The whole problem of road safety,  road

courtesy, and road traffic has to be viewed in  its

total  context. It is hoped that there  will  be  a

vigorous  attempt  to instil into  our  citizens  a

respect  for the laws of the road and  a  sense  of

social  discipline where the use  of  the  road  is

concerned. This Bill does indicate that  there  has

been  a  certain amount of education preceding  the

intention now to implement rigorously those aspects

which,  as I have said, relate to excessive  smoke,

to  the use of crash helmets and to obstruction.  I

would   earnestly  ask  the  responsible  Ministers

concerned to think of a serious campaign to educate

road-users on their responsibilities and, following

this education campaign, to implement as rigorously

other  aspects of traffic laws as those which  this

Bill  seeks  to  implement in respect  of  what  is

contained here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally, say, Sir, that besides the

question  of  simple implementation, there  is  the

question of furnishing our police officers with the

necessary  equipment and manpower to do  their  job

properly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, first of

all, I would like to answer the comment made by the

Member  for Sembawang on the price of crash helmets

having gone up since Government decided to make  it

compulsory for learner drivers of motor cycles  and

scooters to wear crash helmets. It is true that the

price  has moved up somewhat compared to the  price

existing  prior to the announcement  by  Government

that  it would be necessary for motor cyclists  and

scooterists to wear crash helmets. But  before  the

Government announcement was made, it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



possible  for  importers to bring in crash  helmets

which looked nice but would riot pass the test  and

the  specifications  which would  be  necessary  to

enable  them to be approved. Although the  cost  of

such a test would not have materially increased the

price,  I  think  ii is probably because  too  many

people decided to rush to buy the crash helmets  at

a  certain  given  time. We  feel  that  any  price

control  over  the  import of  such  goods  is  not

something we would like to impose on the commercial

public, and we shall allow the free play of  supply

and demand to operate. However, we are aware of the

possibilities that, if we are to impose  compulsory

wearing of crash helmets suddenly for 100,000 motor

cyclists  and  scooterists, the price  will  really

jump  very high. That is why, in implementing  this

policy,    we    have   tried   to   stagger    the

implementation. We first started off with those who

applied  for  provisional licences  for  the  first

time.  That was November last year. It was  at  the

rate of 1,000 a month. It was only in February this

year  that  we said that all learner drivers  would

need  to  wear these crash helmets and  that  would

involve  10,000 people. We are allowing as much  as

another  10  months, i.e., January  of  next  year,

before  we  require every motor cyclist or  pillion

rider  to  wear a crash helmet. And the  number  is

100,000.  So  we are allowing these  100,000  motor

cyclists this much time to buy crash helmets and to

get used to wearing them. I think that is as far as

we can go in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is very unhappy about

the   increase  in  fines  for  traffic   offences,

especially  the  increase  in  the  composition  of

offences  from  $20 to $50. Nobody  likes  to  have

fines  increased. But unfortunately we  have  found

that,  as I explained in my Second Reading  speech,

although more than 7,000 people have paid their $20

fine,  yet quite a lot of motor vehicles with smoky

exhausts are running on Singapore roads and  making

it very difficult for those who follow behind them.

It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



is  most  uncomfortable and I think  it  is  rather

ruinous to health. Although we have had a period of

education,  there does not seem  to  be  very  much

improvement,  so  we  have no  alternative  but  to

increase the fines. Only when it hurts their pocket

do  these  offenders begin to maintain their  cars,

taxis  or buses properly. The fine is quite costly.

If  it  is $50 a week, it will go up to $200  in  a

month, whereas an ordinary maintenance check  would

probably cost $10 or $20 and it should be good  for

a few months. I can only transmit the Member's plea

to  my colleague, the Minister for Defence, who  is

in  charge of the traffic police, for his  officers

to  use  their discretion and not be  too  hard  on

booking those owners of vehicles that emit smoke on

the  road.  We  hope to see less and less  of  such

smoky exhausts before the year is out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Katong's comment on the

flouting  of  road  traffic laws  and  regulations,

unfortunately  it  is true that it  takes  time  to

educate road users. It looks as if we would have to

spend some time on road education and, at the  same

time,  increase  the penalties for  those  breaking

traffic laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to draw attention to

the  comment from both Members that this particular

amendment Bill is very limited in scope. It is  so.

I  admit  it, But I would like to say that it  will

not be very long before we have another sitting  of

the  House  to consider a White Paper  on  the  re-

organisation of road transport in toto.  The  draft

is  ready and, unless it is cut down, it runs to 50

pages.  So  I  think there will be a  lot  of  good

reading  in it and, I hope, good debating  material

when  it is tabled in the House and we can  have  a

very lengthy session on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, direction of employment is not something new. It was introduced by Government in December 1963 to assist persons adversely affected by confrontation to obtain alternative employment. Members will agree with the principle that first

priority  must be given to our discharged  national

servicemen  to fill job vacancies in the  Republic,

and Government has rightly given an undertaking  to

assist  all  discharged  national  servicemen  find

suitable  employment  in  the  public  or   private

sector.  This  Bill  is  to  give  effect  to   the

principle  I have enunciated and to the undertaking

we have given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a Job Placement Department in

the  Central Manpower Base in the Ministry  of  the

Interior  and  Defence. It has been  assisting  our

discharged    national   servicemen   in    finding

employment suitable to the skills they have  learnt

and  the  training they have received while serving

with the Singapore Armed Forces. Wherever possible,

discharged national servicemen are placed  in  jobs

relevant to their abilities, skills and experience.

This is very important as, upon completion of full-

rime national service, they are transferred to  the

Reserves which form the bulk of our Armed Forces in

an   emergency  and,  therefore,  a  continuity  in

experience  and skill is necessary. I must  say  we

have been most successful in job placement. A total

of  98  per  cent of those discharged in 1969  have

found  jobs. In fact, at times we cannot cope  with

the demand from employers for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



discharged  national servicemen. I understand  that

most  of the national servicemen who have had  some

technical training in the Armed Forces are  offered

jobs by prospective employers even before they have

completed  their national service. For  this  happy

state  of affairs, I must express our gratitude  to

the  first  few  hundreds  of  discharged  national

servicemen who have proved to employers  that  they

are  better  than  average  workers  and  are  well

disciplined and not afraid of hard work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will now empower the Minister to direct

by  order  published  in Government  Gazettes  that

specified   categories  of  employers  shall   not,

without  the consent of the Director of  Employment

appointed under this Bill, engage or re-engage  any

employee   otherwise  than  from  among  registered

persons.  A registered person is a person  who  has

completed full-time national service and whose name

is for the time being on the register to be kept by

the Director of Employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, a register will be kept wherein

particulars  relating  to  the  qualifications  and

skills  of  such  discharged  servicemen  will   be

recorded.  By  this  means,  there  will  be   made

available  to  employers a  reservoir  of  manpower

resources  consisting  of a  representative  cross-

section  of  our  young population possessed  of  a

variety  of  skills and experience from which  they

can draw to meet their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employer is unable to find a suitable

person   from   among   the   discharged   national

servicemen  to fill any vacancy in his concern,  he

may,  upon the presentation of reasonable  grounds,

be  exempted to fill such vacancy with non-national

servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharged national servicemen should, within

seven  days  upon securing employment,  notify  the

authority  of this fact so that correct  statistics

will be maintained; otherwise, they will disqualify

themselves  and  will  not  be  given  priority  of

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employer who contravenes the provisions of

any order made under the Bill will be guilty of  an

offence punishable, on conviction, by a fine not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



exceeding  $2,000, and in respect of each  employee

so employed in contravention thereof, by a fine not

exceeding  $50 for each day on which that  employee

is employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said we have been quite successful in

finding   suitable  jobs  for  discharged  national

servicemen. This is because:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) These men have proved to be well

disciplined and good workers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There are greater employment

opportunities  arising out of the  success  of

our industrialization scheme; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is close liaison between prospective

employers and the Job Placement Unit of the M.I.D.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as employers continue to supply the

M.I.D, with    their   job   requirements    and

specifications,  and we continue to  place  men  in

jobs as successfully as we are now doing, it is not

the  intention  of my Ministry to bring  this  Bill

into force immediately after it has been passed  by

Parliament.  It  will  only be  enforced  when  the

necessity arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  had  assumed that the  necessity  for  the

introduction    of    the    National    Servicemen

(Employment) Bill stems from the difficulties  that

the Ministry of the Interior and Defence might have

experienced  in placing ex-national  servicemen  in

employment,  but now the Minister apparently  tells

us  that this is not so. The Bill will be placed on

a  contingency basis. The Bill assumes somehow that

the  required  skills from the national  servicemen

are  forthcoming, and that the employers  can  find

from  among the ranks of the ex-national servicemen

the  kinds of skills that they want. Similarly, the

national servicemen would accept the jobs which are

readily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



forthcoming. In that kind of situation,  I  do  not

think that compelling the employers to accept those

national servicemen would amount to a very economic

proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have any firm figures to show the extent

to  which the ex-national servicemen have  or  have

not acquired the kinds of technical expertise which

will put them readily in employment. It seems to me

that  if they have not acquired anything else other

than  the ability to shoot straight, then they  are

going to be at a disadvantage when they come out of

service.  Instead  of, or in addition  to,  looking

towards a Bill compelling employers to engage or re-

engage   only   registered  persons,  perhaps   the

Minister   might  consider  means  by  which   more

national  servicemen could be given  the  necessary

skills,  either  during or on completion  of  their

national    service.    In    addition,     perhaps

opportunities for further formal education might be

made   available  by  a  preference   in   granting

bursaries, scholarships and loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One further handicap that I feel some ex-national

servicemen might experience is the lack of  fluency

in  English.  Indeed, with the  foreign  investment

orientation of our industrialisation, I would think

that people who are not fluent in English would  be

penalised.   This   problem  extends   beyond   the

immediate one of ex-national servicemen. It applies

generally  to graduates of non-English schools.  If

language  is  the  barrier, then  perhaps  remedial

courses  in  English might be conducted within  the

national service period and/or upon completion.  If

other  measures are necessary, perhaps the Minister

might  consider  the  provision  of  subsidies   to

employers  to  provide in-plant  training  for  ex-

national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point, perhaps worthy of consideration,

is  the employment of ex-national servicemen in the

public  sector to which this Bill is not  directed.

While  I am sure that the Public Service Commission

is  co-operating fully in giving preference to  ex-

national servicemen, I am told that, in some cases,

processing of applications by the P.S.C.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



takes  up  to three months, which is a long  enough

period  to  demoralise any ardent defender  of  our

Republic's freedom. Perhaps steps ought to be taken

to  strengthen the administrative apparatus of  the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to lend my support to

this   Bill,   because  clearly   our   ex-national

servicemen  are deserving of special  consideration

for their service to the Republic. However, I would

strongly  invite the attention of the Minister  for

Defence to the matter of the employability  of  ex-

national servicemen, especially those who have  not

been  given  training in specific skills,  and  the

measures  that  might be taken to  provide  further

education  and  English language  proficiency.  The

combination of Ministerial exhortation,  the  stick

provided  by  this  Bill, and my proposed  remedial

carrots should be, hopefully, redeeming.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this Bill is aimed at ensuring  that

our  ex-national servicemen will  be  able  to  get

jobs.  Nobody  will quarrel with this.  However,  I

have  certain  comments to make on the  details  of

this Bill, and I hope the Minister will clarify the

few points I am making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this Bill does not compel all those

national   servicemen  who  have  completed   their

national service to register. I would like to  know

whether  those  who have completed  their  national

service  but  who have not registered according  to

clause  4  of the Bill will be at liberty  to  seek

jobs.  Will  any  person be able  to  employ  those

unregistered   persons   who   nevertheless    have

completed their national service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a Labour Exchange at the

Ministry of Labour where those people who  want  to

seek   jobs   can  register.  This  also   includes

discharged national servicemen. Under this Bill,  a

register will be kept by the Director of Employment

wherein  the qualifications of discharged  national

servicemen will be recorded. According to the Bill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



unless there are other arrangements, employers will

have to recruit persons who are registered with the

Director  of  Employment  in  the  first  instance.

Therefore,  those persons who have registered  with

the   Ministry   of  Labour  will  not   have   the

opportunity  to  get  jobs. I would  like  to  know

whether this Bill, after it is passed, will  affect

the Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to know whether the

authorities  concerned have, before  drafting  this

Bill,  considered reorganising the Labour  Exchange

at  the  Ministry of Labour in order to look  after

those who have completed their national service.  I

feel that making use of the Labour Exchange at  the

Ministry of Labour for employment purposes will  be

more   suitable,   because   everything   will   be

centralised. Moreover, we will save expenses  which

will be incurred in setting up a new Register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all along there has been a shortage of labour. Whenever the commercial and industrial sectors want to employ persons, they have difficulty in doing so. I fear that after this Bill is passed, the commercial and industrial sectors will find it unnecessarily cumbersome to

recruit  workers.  Should these things  happen,  it

will   be   an   impediment  to  the  progress   of

industrialisation  in  our  country.  I  hope   the

Minister concerned will clarify the few points that

I have raised.



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am happy to learn the happy state of affairs

described by the Minister for Defence so  that  the

Bill,  when  passed, may not need  to  be  enforced

immediately.   This  Bill  requires  employers   to

recruit   workers  from  amongst  the   ex-national

servicemen  in  the  first instance.  The  Bill  is

before us, I believe, because many of our young men

who are called up for national service, as well  as

their parents, feel concerned lest they lose out in

the  competition  for jobs to  those  who  are  not

similarly  called, to non-citizens  and  to  girls.

This Bill demonstrates to them,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



in  a  concrete  manner, that the Government  fully

recognises    the   contribution   that    national

servicemen   make,  directly  to   our   Republic's

security  and  indirectly  to  our  prosperity  and

welfare. It assures them that they do not  have  to

stand at the back of the queue when they seek  jobs

in civilian life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to learn that employers in the

private sector already realise the worth of our ex-

national  servicemen. It must stand to reason  that

in  a  small country such as ours, we cannot afford

to  waste our most valuable resource- manpower. Our

Singapore Armed Forces not only impart to their men

a  training that promotes physical fitness,  mental

alertness,  discipline  and self-reliance,  but  it

also  improves  their  education  and  skills.  The

S.A.F, make  men out of boys and turn  out  better

citizens,  more  productive workers  and  potential

leaders of our community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our young ex-national servicemen have already

proved to be valuable assets to their employers,  I

hope that this law need not be enforced. But in the

meantime,  Mr  Speaker,  I  beg  to  support   the

National Servicemen (Employment) Bill.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

the  main aim of this Bill is to ensure that  those

who have completed two years' national service will

be  given  priority in employment. This is,  in  my

view,  a very wise measure because, as we all know,

national  servicemen have taken  part  in  national

service  training  in the national  interest.  They

have been trained militarily in order that they can

shoulder the great responsibility of protecting our

country, our lives and our property. Therefore,  to

those  who have sacrificed so much for the national

interest  and  who have spent time  and  energy  on

military training in the defence of our country, it

is  only right that we should look after them  when

they have completed their national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers, therefore, have a part to play in

this respect. If the national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



servicemen are sure of getting jobs after their two

years'  training,  then members of  their  families

will  have  no  worry about national service.  This

will  enable the national servicemen to concentrate

more  on  their  training. In this way,  they  will

contribute more to national defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding what I have said, I have certain misgivings about the administration of this Bill. With the increase of national servicemen in years to come, the task of the Director of Employment, as provided in this Bill, will be made increasingly difficult.

Therefore, there is bound to be some delay  in  the

placement of jobs for the national servicemen. So I

would  like  the  Minister  concerned  to  exercise

proper supervision over the work of this department

to  ensure  that it is efficient and effective  and

that  there is proper liaison between the employers

and the department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, Mr Speaker, at the present

moment  there is some delay in placing  a  national

serviceman in a job. For example, after two  years'

training  a national serviceman should be  given  a

job  as  soon  as  possible by  the  Government  or

through the Government. But in some cases there  is

a  delay of two to three months. I do not know what

the  reason  is, but there is an undeniable  delay.

Therefore,  we  should take  steps  to  remedy  the

situation to ensure that there is no delay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to raise with the

Minister  concerned  is  this.  There  are  certain

national  servicemen  recruited  from  the  private

sector.  I  do  not  know  whether  they  are  paid

according to salary scales provided in the National

Service  Regulations or whether  they  continue  to

draw  the same salary as they have drawn in private

employment.  If  it  is the practice  to  pay  them

according to the rates of pay given in the National

Service  Regulations, then  they  are  at  a  great

disadvantage, and I would like to ask why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Mr Speaker, this is a good Bill in

principle, because it looks after the interests  of

our national servicemen in respect of employment. I

support it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, shall answer

the  last  speaker  first,  i.e.,  the  Member  for

Sembawang. I will appreciate it very much if he can

tell  me of a system whereby a national serviceman,

who is discharged today, can rightaway be placed in

a job tomorrow, it is inevitable that there must be

some  delay in placing national servicemen in jobs.

Usually  we  have  very  early  notification   from

employers of the type of skills that they  require.

Meanwhile we have to match the requirements of  the

employer with the qualifications and experience  of

our  discharged or about to be discharged  national

servicemen. When that is done, we have to write  to

the  employers  and send these national  servicemen

for interview. At the same time, we have to ask the

national  servicemen whether  they  do  want  jobs,

because some of them, as I have said just now, have

probably  been offered jobs or have found  jobs  on

their  own. All this takes time. Therefore,  if  we

can  find  a  system to match the skills  with  the

requirements so that the national servicemen can be

sent  to  the  employers on  the  day  after  their

discharge. I think all of us will he most  grateful

and very happy for the Member's advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether national servicemen

will  be  paid the same salary that they have  been

getting  while  working outside, we  have  our  own

scales  of pay in the Armed Forces. In the  private

sector different employers have different scales of

pay.  And  if  we were to accede to the  suggestion

made  by the Member for Sembawang - that we  should

pay  the national servicemen the same pay that they

have  been getting outside -then my Paymaster  will

probably  have  to include the hundreds  of  salary

scales in the private sector. That, I think, is not

feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Delta - as I have said,

the  system is working quite well now. We are  able

to  place 98 per cent of the ex-national servicemen

who  were discharged in 1969 in jobs. Also  because

of  the  shortage of labour now, it would be  quite

unnecessary to enforce the Bill. That is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



reason why I have said that it is not the intention

of this Ministry to enforce this Bill even after it

has been passed by Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether we can make use of the

present Labour Exchange to do this work, I think it

would  not be possible for the Labour Exchange,  as

it  is  constituted at present, to work efficiently

as  a  job placement unit, in the M.I.D, just  now,

because  the  Ministry  has a  complete  record  of

national  servicemen with us.  Therefore,  when  we

receive the job specifications, it is easier for us

to  marry  them to the requisite skills  among  the

discharged national servicemen, Otherwise  we  have

to  send  the whole lot of particulars of  national

servicemen  to  the  Labour  Exchange   where   the

administration  is probably not  so  au  fait  with

military  reports. This will cause  further  delay,

and greater annoyance to the Member for Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the principle here is that first

priority  for employment is to be given to national

servicemen. We all hope the day will not come  when

the  demand for labour will drop so that those  who

have not done their national service will also have

the  opportunity to be gainfully employed.  At  the

moment things are going on all right. We are  able,

as  I  have  said,  to  place all  our  ex-national

servicemen  in jobs. I have already indicated  that

there  is  nothing to prevent a national serviceman

from seeking a job of his own if he wants to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of Members n general, and the

Member for Whampoa in particular, there is a  joint

M.I.D./ Technical Education Committee looking  into

the  possibility of giving training to  ex-national

servicemen  who have had no training in any  skills

whatsoever while they were in the Armed Forces.  As

for improving their fluency in English, in fact, in

the  Armed  Forces  at  the  moment  a  conscripted

national serviceman is given 180 hours' tuition  in

any language he desires. But we are looking further

into it. When we first started. If a serviceman was

educated  in  English, he was given the  choice  to

take up either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  or  Malay. If he was Chinese educated,  he

was given the choice to learn English or Malay. But

after having worked on it for some time, I think  a

better method now will be to improve the fluency of

the  language  in which the national serviceman  is

educated.  Let  us say a boy has  a  Secondary  III

education  in  English.  The  time  will  be   more

usefully  spent  if he can improve his  fluency  in

English  within the 180 hours of tuition,  so  that

when  he  comes  out  he will  be  more  fluent  in

English,  Mandarin, or Malay, or whatever  language

he is educated in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill, if enforced, compels an employer to register with us, so that first priority will be given to national servicemen for employment. But at the moment in the public sector - in the Public Service Commission, the Ministry of Health, and every other Ministry - we have given

first  priority  to  national servicemen.  That  is

covered  administratively. This is a promise  which

we have made, and we are keeping it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have replied to all the questions raised

or  the  doubts that have arisen in  the  minds  of

Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Bill was referred to

a  Select Committee on the 22nd December, 1969,  to

enable  further  representations of the  profession

and  those  of  the  public  to  be  made  so  that

consideration could be given thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report that 13 written

representations  were  received  and   the   Select

Committee  heard oral evidence on  three  of  these

representations. Some of the contributions made  to

the   Committee  were  most  valuable  and  several

suggestions were accepted. Amongst these were -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the reduction of the period of practical

experience    in    engineering    required     for

qualification under section 8 (c) from three  years

to two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the widening of the powers of the

Professional Engineers Board to include  the  power

to  suspend an engineer from practice for a  period

not   exceeding   one  year  under   any   of   the

circumstances set out in section 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the increase of the penalties that an

unregistered  person will be liable  to  face  upon

conviction for practising or holding himself out as

a professional engineer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report was published on 15th

June,  1970,  as Paper Parliament 3  of  1970.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Bill as now tabled  before  this

House  incorporates  the  recommendations  of   the

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Minister for Law  and  National

Development has just moved the Third Reading of the

Bill.  I  will now avail myself of this opportunity

to  express my support of it, looking at it from  a

slightly different angle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My views on this Bill are applicable also to

Bills  of a similar nature. This Bill, when  it  is

passed  by Parliament, will have certain safeguards

for professional engineers in the execution of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



their professional duties. Their social status will

be  enhanced.  I feel that in this respect  we  are

ahead  of  many  other countries. However,  I  hope

those  of  us who are in the engineering profession

will  not  just  look to the legal  protection  and

neglect their obligation to our people. I would say

the  aim  of  the Bill is not just to  enhance  the

position  of  a  certain group  of  people  in  our

society by having their interests protected by law,

but   it  should  also  enable  the  engineers   to

understand  their  obligations and  duties  to  our

society  and  their part in nation  building.  They

have  an obligation towards the people in assisting

to  bring  prosperity to the country in the  coming

years. We are a democratic society, and anybody who

wants  to  enjoy the protection of his  rights  and

interests   should  also  take  upon  himself   the

responsibilities  and duties  towards  society.  In

this  respect, professional engineers  are  not  an

exception.  We have expressed this basic  principle

in  introducing this Bill, I hope that after it  is

passed.  It  will be able to bring about  a  better

spiritual  liberation  and a  liberation  of  their

minds  so that in their own way they may also  make

their  contribution towards the livelihood  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you will agree with me, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  there  are many professional  people  in  our

country  who  in  the  past  have  paid  too   much

attention  to  their own occupations and  neglected

the  demands  and the requirements of  the  general

masses.  At the same time, some of them  have  also

forgotten the general interest of the country. They

only   look  after  their  own  interest  and   the

salvation  of  their  own existence.  They  form  a

retarding force in our society. If we do  not  take

steps   to  remedy  this  situation,  we  will   be

disappointing   our   people.   Let    professional

engineers  take  this  Bill  as  a  beginning,  and

rectify  this  situation by  earnestly  discharging

their  responsibilities towards  the  people.  They

will  understand that in the new society they  have

certain obligations towards the people. This should

be the basis and correct emphasis of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee benefited from the various

views expressed in the representations. It received

representations    from    professional     bodies,

individuals and members of the public. This  showed

that  they  were interested and had  faith  in  our

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Professional Engineers Board

to  be set up under the Bill will not have an  easy

task,  for example, in the investigation  into  the

qualifications   of  professional   engineers   and

classifying them. I hope the members of  the  Board

will  be  able to carry out the provisions  of  the

Bill smoothly and efficiently, though their task is

difficult.  I  hope  they  will  also   take   into

consideration the representations which  were  made

to  the  Select  Committee in the course  of  their

work.  I  am sure their duties are not easy  but  I

trust  that with extra care they will be successful

in their task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a professional engineer expressed

certain  views  on  the  Bill.  He  said  that  the

penalties  for  certain people  who  infringed  the

provisions   of  the  Bill  should  be   increased.

Legislation has been made to increase the penalties

to  deal  with offenders, Of course, I do not  deny

the  necessity for penalties. But what I would like

to  say is that, although it might be necessary  to

legislate   in  order  to  provide  for  penalties,

legislation to penalise the offenders  of  the  law

should  be  such  as  to aim  at  helping  them  to

distinguish  between right and wrong so  that  they

will be able to do the right thing in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me, finally, to quote something which was said in the press recently. We, as legislators and as Members of Parliament, are not like Tse Ker Liang, a sage in ancient Chinese history, and, at the same time, the people are not simpletons. Our legislation should always aim at

safeguarding society, and not only the interest  of

a  certain  group of people. Since  this  group  of

people  is given the protection of the law,  it  is

their  bounden  duty to contribute  their  services

towards  the  people. Otherwise, when  finally  the

people  deliver their judgment on us, we will  have

been marked as failures.
