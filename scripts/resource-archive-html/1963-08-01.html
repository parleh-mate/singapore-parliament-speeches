<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

the  motion  before the House is of  grave  national

importance  demanding  serious  consideration.   The

Prime   Minister  made  a  three-hour  speech.   The

Opposition listened in silence because we were aware

of   the  importance  of  this  national  issue.  We

accorded,  and  quite rightly, due  respect  to  the

Prime  Minister  for  his  grave  pronouncements  by

listening  in  silence and with great attention  for

three hours. We did not leave the Chamber other than

to  attend  to  the  call  of  nature.  We  did  not

interject but allowed him to make his lengthy speech

although at times he found occasion to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



rub  in  harsh  words against some  Members  of  the

Opposition.  This is typical of the P.A.P. culture.

He  levelled  a  lot of vicious remarks  against  me

personally,  vicious not in the  language  used  but

vicious  in  the intent such personal  remarks  were

meant  to convey. I will reply to some of them later

on in my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown was the next speaker

because he had given notice of his intention to move

an amendment. He started speaking at about 6.20 p.m.

and  he  was  still  speaking up to  the  moment  of

interruption at 12 midnight. In fact,  he  spoke  in

all  for 6½ hours. As was to be expected, Sir, there

were  less and less Members remaining in the Chamber

and  for  some  length of time  all  the  Government

Ministers were not in the Chamber.

There  was  even  a time when there  were  only  two

Government Back-benchers. This clearly shows to  the

Opposition  and  to  the public the  disrespect  the

Government Benches including the Ministers, have for

this  grave  national issue that was being  debated.

They behaved in a very irresponsible manner in their

treatment of the national issue. At 11.30 p.m. that

night,  the Prime Minister and his obedient Minister

for  Finance walked into the Chamber. They were well

dressed  and  were, in fact, sporting  button-holes.

Their  faces  were  red, showing evidence  of  their

having had a boisterous time. In fact, they had just

finished  a dinner given to them in their honour  by

the  Chambers of Commerce in their belief that  with

common market big money can become bigger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they stepped into the Chamber, Sir, the

dignity of the House was insulted and they had to be

pulled   up  on  several  occasions  by  the  Deputy

Speaker. I stood up on a point of order. I said that

the  Opposition  gave  the Prime  Minister  all  due

attention  and  respect during the Prime  Minister's

three-hour  long  speech.  I  called  on  the  Prime

Minister  and his obedient Minister for  Finance  to

accord the same measure of attention and respect  to

the  Opposition. In an undertone, the Prime Minister

remarked   that  I  was  siding  with  the   Barisan

Sosialis. I was not siding with anybody. I was  just

standing up for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



dignity  of the House. The Prime Minister  left  the

Chamber  soon  after  this,  but  the  Minister  for

Finance  remained behind and his conduct was grossly

disorderly.  He  made  loud yawning  noises  and  he

muttered  some rude remarks as he left the  Chamber.

As he left his seat to walk to the Bar, he made some

very rude remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What remarks?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The remarks, Sir, are in the

Official Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of order,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. We are all accustomed  to  P.A.P.

manners.  But is this part of the very grave  motion

before the House which has only till midnight?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have always allowed exordiums. I

think the Member for Cairnhill knows that there is a

guillotine  and  I think he will probably  make  due

allowance for that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was

just  trying to point out to the House  and  to  the

public  the  irresponsible manner that Ministers  of

the  Government  have  been  behaving  towards  this

national  issue.  I will not quote  the  Hansard  in

order to cut down time. As the Finance Minister  was

leaving  his  seat,  he muttered  some  rather  rude

remarks.  Quite  rightly, the Deputy Speaker  pulled

him up on a point of order. And he left the Chamber.

Sir, I would have stood up under Standing Order 55.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There, I think, I must stop

the Member for Cairnhill because the application  of

Standing  Order No. 55 would be within the  purview,

or  jurisdiction, of the Deputy Speaker who was then

pursue  this point because it could be construed  as

being a reflection on the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I quite understand that, Sir,

but let it be. I should have stood up under Standing

Order 55, but at that time I was thinking of Article

30



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



(2)(b) - the P.A.P. might take action against  its

Member and we might Jose the services of a very good

and efficient Deputy Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> I would like to

make a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> The Member for Cairnhill has imputed

that  I,  being a Member of the Party in power,  was

afraid of losing my seat because of section -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Cairnhill ever imputed that. If he did impute  that,

then  I  am  afraid  he might be called  before  the

Committee  of Privileges. I do not think that  is  a

fair  construction of what the Member for  Cairnhill

is trying to drive at. I would suggest to the Member

for Cairnhill that he has made his point.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you. Sir. In fact, I have

very  great respect for the Deputy Speaker, Sir.  He

has  done  a marvelous piece of work under sometimes

trying conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had hoped that we would be guided by the

wisdom of the Minister for Finance in regard to  the

loan  agreement  and the Common  Market.  The  Prime

Minister in his opening speech gave the Opposition a

clear  indication that his colleague,  the  Minister

for  Finance,  who bore the brunt of detailed  work,

would   speak  on  this  aspect  of  the  Agreement.

Unfortunately the Minister for Finance was too  busy

during   the  few  times  he  was  in  the   Chamber

interjecting  and  displaying  disorderly   conduct.

Therefore,  we lost the opportunity of being  guided

by him in our consideration of the agreement reached

in  regard  to  the loan agreement  and  the  Common

Market. I hope his silence so far is not due to  the

fact  that  he  has  been  having  some  disquieting

moments that make him fight shy of discharging  this

very  important duty imposed on him by  his  master,

the Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the important point that has

been  raised by my colleague, the Member for  Farrer

Park. The motion before the House, or shall we  say,

the  documents that are for adoption, can be divided

into four parts: (1)  the implementation of the White

Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961, (2)  the loan agreement,  (3)

the   Common  Market,  and  (4)   the  constitutional

matters affecting Singapore. On (1) , the White Paper

Cmd. 33, the Alliance has given its full support and

we  are with the Government on this. There can be no

charge whatsoever that we are not standing up to the

stand  that  we took on Paper Cmd. 33. We  gave  the

Government  the  mandate. They went  to  London  and

discharged  it.  The  Member  for  Farrer  Park  has

already  expressed  suitable  appreciation  of   the

discharge of that mandate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to (2) , the loan agreement, and (3) the

Common  Market, these are matters that had not  been

discussed in this Assembly at all. These are matters

on  which the Government has received no mandate. If

the  Government is really conscious of its  strength

in  the  Assembly,  it  should  have  consulted  the

Legislative Assembly on these two important  aspects

of  the  Malaysia Agreement, and received a mandate.

But  the Government, being a dictatorial Government,

just could not care less. They thought they had  all

the brains with them and could go ahead. Be that  as

it  may,  we  are for Malaysia. We are  prepared  to

support  the  loan agreement and the Common  Market.

But we would have been in a much better position  to

speak on these two aspects of the Malaysia Agreement

had the Minister for Finance deigned or condescended

to  let us have the wisdom of his knowledge of  such

economic matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important objection which we have,

and still have, despite the explanation given by the

Leader  of the House and the Minister for  Law,  are

the  three  main points which are the subject  of  a

proposed amendment by the Member for Farrer Park  on

behalf of the Alliance. The first point, Sir, is  in

relation to Article 69 of the Malaysia Act, which is

found at page 47 of Paper Cmd.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



22.  We  objected  to this on the  ground  that  any

amendment  to  the Constitution should  receive  the

concurrence  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  in  the

proportion  as  is enshrined in Article  90  of  the

Singapore  Constitution  (at  page  161).   In   the

Singapore  Constitution, it is  laid  down  that  no

amendment  shall  be  made  "unless  it   has   been

supported on Second and Third Readings by the  votes

of  not less than two-thirds of the total number  of

members thereof". The Deputy Prime Minister and  the

Minister  for  Law  stood up  and  explained,  "That

particular clause is in the Malaysia Act, and  under

the  Federation  Constitution it will  require  that

same number of votes before it can become law." That

we understand, but we in Singapore maintain that the

Constitution  of  Singapore,  in  so  far  as   such

important  measures  as citizenship  are  concerned,

shall  not  be  left to just the Central  Parliament

with  only the concurrence of the Governor, that  is

to  say, the government of the day. A matter of such

grave  character should quite rightly so come  under

the  same requirement as Article 90 of the Singapore

Constitution. Then the Minister for Law  said,  "Oh,

look  at  sections  69 and 66. They  are  the  same.

Section  66  is for Borneo and Sarawak.  It  is  the

same.  Why  all the argument?" Section 66 refers  to

Borneo  and  Sarawak,  and  they  are  coming   into

Malaysia  on  different  terms  - on  more  or   less

"complete"  merger  than Singapore.  Therefore,  the

constitutional arrangements with Borneo and  Sarawak

should  not be applied to Singapore because we  have

autonomy in a number of important subjects.  Perhaps

the  Government  will reconsider this  position.  An

amendment  to the constitution affecting  rights  of

citizenship, Article 69, should not come into  force

despite   its   having  gone  through  the   Central

Parliament on a two-thirds majority vote without the

concurrence of the Singapore Legislature on the same

number of votes, i.e., a two-thirds majority. I hope

the Government will reconsider that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We who have been described by the Government as

taking  orders - it was distorted to the extent  that

we take orders - say that that is the kind of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



order  the Government of Singapore cannot  take.  It

must  be the Legislative Assembly of Singapore after

having duly debated whether or not any amendment  to

the  Constitution in regard to citizenship shall  or

shall not be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second Article, i.e. 30 (2) (b) - before

I  come  to  that, Sir, let me say this. The  Deputy

Prime Minister said. "Oh, this is the Malaysia  Act.

Section  69  is for the Malaysia Central Parliament.

It  is not for us to decide." Perhaps he has not got

the  advantage  of  advice from his  colleague,  the

Minister for Law. No doubt this is the Malaysia Act,

but  the Federal Government would not have dared  to

put  that  in  for the consideration  of  Parliament

without consent Of agreement of the Singapore  team.

"This is quite all right. The Federal Government can

go  ahead  with this amendment." The P.A.P. accepted

it,  otherwise it could not have been in. Therefore,

we  are  trying  to tell the P.A.P. Government  that

what  they  have done on this is not  good  for  the

people  of Singapore. We, who know that we  will  be

the  next Government of Singapore - and this will  be

exercised by us - yet say that it is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to (2), Sir, this is the real nigger in the

woodpile.  Article  30  (2)   (b)   that  is  in   the

Singapore  Constitution, that is in  page  144.  The

Deputy  Prime Minister stood up and tried to explain

it  away. The Member for Farrer Park said, "Ah,  ha,

there is some jiggery-pokery going on." Yes, why  is

this? That this Article 30 does not read in the same

manner  as  the  Article 30 in the  Blue  Book?  The

Deputy  Prime  Minister again, not  having  had  the

advice of the Minister for Law, jumped up and  said.

"Oh  this  Blue Book is nothing. This is  the  thing

that  counts. And if we approve it, the  Queen  will

just  sign it as an Order in Council." Sir,  if  one

will  take the trouble to examine the Blue Book  and

the  White Book - white because it is P.A.P., so they

say  it  must be white - you will see that  word  for

word  and even the numbering, everything is the same

except  where  there has been the jiggery-pokery  of

the P.A.P.; something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



is  put in there that is not here. Surely the Deputy

Prime  Minister is not going to suggest  that  there

was  no  full discussion in London as to the wording

of  each  and  every Article; even  the  punctuation

sometimes  was  discussed. So there  had  been  that

discussion  in  London, that acceptance  in  London.

Perhaps  the  Government, represented by  the  Prime Minister and his very able servant, the Minister for Finance, did bring this up in London, and because it is  not in the London copy, then it could be that it must  have  been  rejected by the London  Ministers, rejected no doubt on the ground that this is unheard

of.   It   is  contrary  to  parliamentary  practice

throughout  the world. To suggest that this  is  the

thing  that  counts and not the Blue  Book  is  just

again  trying  to mislead Members of the  Opposition

who   may   not  have  that  much  knowledge   about

negotiations on constitutional matters. Oh, yes, the

Deputy  Prime Minister says that he has  got  a  new

book and that this is an old one.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I said a Blue one.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Would he be good enough to lend

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes. That is the white one.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Therefore I say this, that this

Article  30 (2)  (b)  - the most heinous paragraph  (b)

has been put in in spite of its having been rejected

in  London. I do not say the Prime Minister  had  no

right  to  try  and put this in. But the  manner  in

which he tried to put it in is not worthy of a Prime

Minister.  In  his  speech,  he  could  have   drawn

attention  to the fact that this was put in  not  in

the  Blue  book,  but  in the White  book  and  gave

reasons why he wanted to put it in. He just left  it

at  that, hoping that by giving us this document  as

late  as the afternoon of Sunday and wanting  us  to

debate  it  on Tuesday, they could just bulldoze  it

through. Article 30 (2)  (b)  is most reprehensible to

this extent, that it has never been the practice  in

a   Parliament   where  there  is  no   proportional

representation. It will be all right in  France,  as

pointed out by the Minister for Law, where they have

proportional  representation, where  the  number  of

votes cast for each political Party will decide  the

number  of seats that political Party shall have  in

the Legislature. That would have been all right. But

ours  is not a proportional representation Assembly,

Sir. Ours is direct election, a candidate stands for

election, he gets elected. It is not necessary  that

he  belongs  to  a  Party. It  may  be  on  his  own

qualifications, and it could be that because of  his

qualifications  and  of  his  association   with   a

political Party that he gets returned. But he is not

returned  just because he is a member of a political

Party. This Article 30 (2)  (b) -  what is the intention

behind it? The Government know 25-25, Sembawang,  no

by-election. They will not dare to go there. No  by-election.  They  know that they  are  holding  their

Members  in check because of Malaysia. "Malaysia  is

coming,  behave, boys. If you damage  Malaysia,  you

watch  out.  You might be like the Barisan  Sosialis

after  3lst August; they might not be sitting here."

They  want  this particular clause to protect  their

own  party  interests in this House. They know  that

after  this Malaysia debate there may be one or  two

or  even  more Members walking across to  the  other

side in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



disgust.  They want this clause just to be  able  to

keep them in check. So, I submit, Sir, that what the

P.A.P. is  trying to do is not to bring  in  a  new

constitution  for Singapore, but a new  constitution

for the P.A.P., in the same way as they had tried to

make  the  national anthem a P.A.P. anthem;  in  the

same way as they had tried to make the national flag

a P.A.P. flag; and in the same way as they had tried

to  make the Yang di-Pertuan Negara a P.A.P. Negara.

Even  in  this  they are trying to  make  everything

P.A.P.  There  is also evidence only  recently.  The

Yang di-Pertuan Negara -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I refer the hon. Member to

Standing Order 46, paragraph (8):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The conduct of the Sovereign, Members of the

Royal  Family, or the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  shall

not be referred to in any circumstances.'



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes. I was just trying to

explain  the  attempts of the P.A.P. to make  things

all their way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Article 30 (2) (h) , if adopted, is going

to  make  this  sacred  Constitution  for  Singapore

nothing  but a P.A.P. constitution for the  People's

Action Party to keep their Members in check, to make

their  Members behave, to make their Members  listen

obediently to His Master's Voice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the attempt to include this clause into

the   Constitution  and  we  would   urge   on   the

Government,  if they really believe in parliamentary

democracy   and   want  to  practise   parliamentary

democracy,  to drop this one. And we  will,  as  the

Member for Farrer Park has said, vote with them.  We

will  vote  with them on the Malaysia motion  as  we

have  been  with  them  all along  on  the  Malaysia

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the third point, and that is

Article  33.  This  refers  to  a  by-election.  The

filling of a casual vacancy. Here again, the  Member

for Farrer Park has found out another jiggery-pokery

of the P.A.P. Article 33 of this Blue Book says that

the vacancy has to be filled within three months and

this  Blue Book certainly contains agreement reached

between the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



Government,  the Federation Government and  the  U.K

Government. Otherwise the U.K. Government would  not

have  dared to publish this and to make this in  due

course  the  Singapore Order in  Council.  A  change

- three months here becomes indefinitely. And why  we

object  to this is clear, Sir. Experience has  shown

us   that  the  Government  can  just  hold  up  the

Sembawang  by-election for one year and sit  pretty.

And when they are charged that they are afraid to go

to   the  by-election  despite  the  fact  that  the

Sembawang  seat is a very important seat  to  either

the  Government or to the Opposition, they  say  the

law  says  so. The Jaw says the law does not  demand

that  we  should have elections tomorrow or the  day

after  or  even six months later. Then  why  is  the

explanation  given by the Deputy Prime Minister  and

the  Minister for Law? He says, "Oh, this is there.

It  has  been  there for a long, long time.  So  why

should  it not be there?" We resist it now  because

experience has shown us that with a P.A.P. type  of

government,  this could be used to the advantage  of

the  party in power. Surely in London they must have

agreed  to these three months, otherwise this  could

not  have  been  in the Blue Book.  They  agreed  in

London three months. They come back and try to  make

it  indefinite. But we would not have minded if they

had  tried  to  make it indefinite  and  brought  it

openly  to this Assembly and said, "Members  of  the

Opposition,  we  made a mistake. Now  we  think  you

should  help  us,  you know. We  have  been  playing

Sembawang for one year: let us have this. So we  can

play for two years." If they had played it straight,

it  would  have been all right. But let us take  the

opening  remarks of the Prime Minister - "I  shall  be

audible.   I   shall   be   simple,   I   shall   be

straightforward." This is not straightforward,  this

is  the most crooked manner of bringing in things  - jiggery-pokery  and nothing else. Audible?  Yes,  he

was  audible.  Simple?  That man  is  never  simple.

Straightforward?   Definitely   no.   He   is    not

straightforward. So, would it hurt the Government if

we  say that they should put in a three-month  limit

to see that a vacant seat is filled?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



If  they accept the deletion 01 Article 30 (2)   (b),

if  they accept our suggestion that any amendment of

the   constitution  should  receive   a   two-thirds

majority  votes  all  these things  we  ask  in  the

interests   of   Singapore,  in  the  interests   of

democracy and fair play. We are not asking for  this

in  the  interests of the Alliance. What the  P.A.P.

want  to  achieve  by this is just  to  protect  the

interests of the P.A.P. If they will agree to  these

amendments, these points that we have brought up, we

will   vote  with  them  with  great  pleasure   and

acclamation that Malaysia is 29 days now from today,

and  it will be a legal fact. Sure I will leave  it.

There  are  Ministers  of the  Government  who  will

answer to this. But if they do not accept it, may  I

suggest if it can be done - I do not think it can - that

voting  on  the motion should be in parts,  so  that

where it refers to Malaysia we are 100 per cent with

them. But where it refers to jiggery-pokery, we  are

against them. But if the motion is to be voted as  a

whole,  it  would  just force the  Alliance  against

their  will,  against their desire, to abstain  from

voting.  And  if  we  do  that,  the  P.A.P. master

distortionists will go out telling the people again,

"There  you  are. The Alliance is against Malaysia."

Perhaps the great minds of the Government could help

us  out.  We  are  sincere. We are  with  them  with

Malaysia up to the hilt. Make it easy for us to vote

on  that.  If they insist on puting in this jiggery-pokery, we are going to make it clear to the country

that  we  will  not  tolerate  nor  be  a  party  to

undemocratic practices intended to prolong the  life

and protect the interests of any political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one thing about this loan. The Prime

Minister made great play of this loan. He said,  "We

lend  the money to the Borneo territories. No  doubt

we  do not want interest for the first five years on

$100  million, but in return for that  Singapore  is

assured   of  50  per  cent  workmen  and  Singapore

contractors going there." So at the Airport, at Hong

Lim and even on television, he said. "There you are.

I am looking after your interest. All of you workers

of  Singapore will have a chance to go to Borneo and

Sarawak  and earn a livelihood." He very bodly  said

that was the agreement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



Then  the  Chief Minister-designate of Borneo  said,

"There has been no such agreement." And straightaway

the  Prime  Minister jumped in, "The Chief Minister-designate  of  Borneo is wrong. I am right.  I  have

documents  to  prove it." And what did  he  produce?

Writing on the back of an envelope. This is in Misc.

5  of  1963.  Writing on the back of an envelope,  a

photostat copy of which, it now appears,  is  not  a

photostat of the complete writing on the back of the

envelope. The Federation Government, it would  seem,

as  pointed out by the previous speakers, has denied

that there has been such an agreement. In the speech

of  the  Prime  Minister, in moving  his  motion,  I

waited patiently for him to state his stand on  this

50  per  cent workmen. He said nothing. Perhaps  his

conscience was pricking him and he was trying not to

bluff  the  Opposition as he has tried to bluff  the

public on the radio and on television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us try and understand the Prime Minister. What

was  the big fight that he staged? "We want  to  see

common  market terms written into the Constitution."

That  is  good. We are with him when  he  says  that

Singapore workmen should be given an opportunity  of

employment  in the Borneo territories. We  are  with

him.  That is the right thing. We support  him.  But

with  his  sharp  mind,  with his  great  intellect,

surely  in  the  same manner as he had  insisted  on

protection   of   common   market   terms   in   the

Constitution,  he  could  have  insisted  that  this

should  be written into the Constitution.  If  there

had  really been such an agreement, surely the great

Prime  Minister would not have wanted  to  negotiate

matters  of a constitutional nature just on a  sheet

of  toilet  paper. On the exchange of  letters,  the

little  that I know of, the exchange of  letters  on

constitutional matters is for one party to write the

various terms of agreement reached, send it  to  the

other  party and the other party to write a  similar

letter - in fact, word for word - return to the  other

party,  and that is what is known as an exchange  of

letters. Even the Prime Minister knows it.  That  is

why  in the very first letter, on this Misc.  5,  he

said in the last sentence of the first paragraph:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When you confirm them this exchange of letters

will  form  a  statement of our agreement  on  these

matters.'



<br><br>There has been no confirmation in the manner that is

constitutionally  understood,  and  yet  the   Prime

Minister says, this is an exchange of letters. I  do

not  know.  An exchange of letters that  is  not  an

exchange  of  letters! A White  Paper  that  is  not

really white and pure!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Government should and could if

done  in the right manner. With Malaysia we are  all

brothers.  The Government could still  take  up  the

matter  of Singapore workmen for employment  in  the

Borneo territories. They could take up the matter in

the  proper spirit of friendship, understanding  and

co-operation.  I am sure the Borneo Government  will

want  to  co-operate  with  Singapore  to  ease  the

unemployment  problem  facing  Singapore.  But   the

Government  should not try to be  arrogant  and  say

that  agreement has been reached, producing  just  a

sheet of toilet paper to confirm that agreement  has

been  reached and demand that they should  stand  on

that  agreement  reached. It will bring  the  P.A.P.

Government nowhere. It is still not too late for the

Government  to bring up the matter in a  responsible

and gentlemanly manner with the Borneo Government. I

feel sure that if that approach is even taken now at

this stage, there will be a desire to co-operate and

help Singapore out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opening remarks just now, I have said

that the Prime Minister saw fit to level a number of

vicious  remarks about me and that  I  would  answer

some  of  them  later  on in my  speech.  The  Prime

Minister  brought this in about me - there  was  this

man  trying  to  sell aeroplanes to  the  Tunku.  $8

million at 5 per cent. There was this man trying  to

get the Airport. $50 million. Sir, before I come  to

that  matter, may I draw the attention of this House

to  the very important law, the Legislative Assembly

(Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Ordinance. Under

this  law, in section 30, which deals with offences,

paragraph (h)  says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`publish wilfully any false or perverted report or

any   writing  containing  a  gross  or   scandalous

misrepresentation  of any debate of  proceedings  of

the  Assembly, or of any speech of a member  in  the

Assembly;'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



and  in section 35, we have the penalty for such  an

offence. I bring this in now -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what the purpose

of  quoting  the section is. But if the hon.  Member

feels that there has been a breach of privilege,  he

knows his remedy. He has to give notice of a motion.

I  do not think we can pursue the matter further  in

this vein.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I seek your indulgence, Sir. Why

I  bring this up is this. It is just to help  people

who may be ignorant of this law so that they may not

fall  foul  of  the law. The Prime Minister,  on  my

adjournment speech on the port workers,  brought  in

all  these  things  and brought them  again  in  his

speech  on  this Malaysia motion. The P.A.P. radio,

P.A.P. television, P.A.P. newspapers all did  their

best. They had the right to do it, to play the  full

focus  on  character assassination. I  do  not  mind

that.  But  what I seek is this. Let them know  that

once  they  have  done  that  in  a  debate  in  the

Assembly, on the report of a debate in the Assembly,

they  have,  under this, to give me the  same  equal

right to what I say. Otherwise I might have to  seek

your  protection on this. It is just fair  coverage.

What  they do to us, be fair to the others. That  is

why  I have brought it up, Sir,It is not a question

of privilege at all. It would seem, according to the

P.A.P.  Government, that it is wrong for anybody  to

try  to earn a living. And if you earn a living,  it

is  wrong. You should be brought up to ridicule  and

have your political character assassinated. What  is

wrong  with  my trying to earn a living?  Trying  to

sell  aeroplanes to the Tunku? Is he suggesting that

the Tunku and I have got a plot to try and make some

money on the side? He brought in the question  of  5

per  cent.  I do not know where they got the  5  per

cent. I do not think I could even get half per cent.

If  I  could, I would be very lucky. I would be very

happy  if they could help me to get 5 per cent.  And

when everything is successful. I might give them  4½

per  cent.  Airport  contract? Is  it  wrong  for  a

registered firm of contractors to send



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



in  a  tender?  The tender was not even  successful.

Gammons  got it because their tender was lower.  But

to  put  it that way and to suggest. "Ah, that  man,

Lim  Yew  Hock,  5  per cent of  $8  million."  Just

imagine how much it is. "Ah, $50 million. 5 per cent

of  $50  million."  How much it  is?  That  kind  of

character  assassination is really beneath contempt.

What  is wrong with trying to earn an honest living,

unless  the Prime Minister is going to suggest  that

there  had  been some underhand work, with  jiggery-pokery with the Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya  in  trying to make money? If he means  that,

say  so. If not, do not do it by innuendoes and evil

suggestions,   making  use  of  the  P.A.P. radio,

everything pumping over the air: $8 million;  5  per

cent:  $50  million; 5 per cent. What  is  all  this

about? But, of course, I know their intention,  Sir.

It  is character assassination. And they want it  to

take  effect.  And I must say it has  taken  effect.

Strange,  Sir,  when that matter  came  out  in  the

papers  yesterday, I received a number of  telephone

calls.  The effect was working. They said,  "I  say,

Tun Lim. Do you know that Lee and Lee is making tons

of  money'?  They  are  the legal  advisers  to  the

Indonesian  Government, to the Bank Negara.  Do  you

know  that  Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime  Minister's

wife -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Cairnhill  has made his point. Let us not labour  on

that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So without going into detailed

speeches, on the one side a man is trying to earn  a

living but because he is in the Opposition he should

have  his  character assassinated by the other  side

just  because they are the Government and all  that.

Never  mind. Go and make as much money as you  want.

There  is  the protection. The Government is  there.

Let us be clean and honest in politics. Kick as much

as  one  wants against one's own political opponent.

But let us not sink to the level of -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I do not know. I cannot even

call them men.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Beast.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I think I could use the word

"beast",  Sir. Let us not sink down to the level  of

the beast. It is strange. Sir, all this talk. When I

was  talking  yesterday,  a Parliamentary  Secretary

said,  "Aeroplane, ha, ha, aeroplane." What  is  all

this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in his opening remarks, gave a historical account of the steps towards merger. But there had been errors of truth, or some untruthful statements or claims were brought in. The Prime Minister said, it would seem, that it was because he was on so friendly terms with the Tunku since 1959 that he kept on going there to play golf, have

lunch,  dinner,  and  suddenly  he  wore  down   the

opposition  of the Tunku. That is not a  true  fact.

The  true  fact  is,  and  this  is  borne  out   by

statements of both Prime Ministers, that as soon  as

the  P.A.P. came  to power it did  make  an  honest

effort  to  bring about merger. Everytime the  Prime

Minister stood up to say, "We want merger,"  on  the

next  day the Prime Minister of the Federation said,

"Shut  up.  We  do not want merger." It  works  like

this.  There had been no desire on the part  of  the

Federation  to  want merger with Singapore,  because

the  Federation  Government  knew  that  the  P.A.P.

Government  had  been sleeping with the  Communists,

since  it  described the Barisan Sosialis  who  have

left  them as Communists. But in 1961 a change  took

place because the P.A.P. (or the non-Communists) and

the  Communists - if you like it that way - fell  out.

Since  they fell out, there was some change of  mind

towards  the P.A.P. Government. Perhaps  since  they

have  now  got  rid  of  their  Communist  comrades,

something could be done. So when the Tunku came down

to  Singapore in May 1961, in an address to  foreign

correspondents at a luncheon, he threw out  thoughts

of  a  closer  association  with  Singapore  and   a

federation with the Borneo territories. That  speech

of  his on 27th May, 1961, was definitely not  as  a

result of the Prime Minister's golf playing with the

Tunku, lunches and dinners with the Tunku. In  fact,

before  then there had been no golf playing  between

the two Prime Ministers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



at  all.  There had been no lunches and no  dinners.

They  were just as far apart as opposing forces - one

working with the Communists, the other strongly anti-Communist. So do not try to bring that all out.  And

even  in The Battle for Merger. "This merger problem

is  really hard and arduous." It even made the Prime

Minister work hard and arduous to write a book,  The

Battle  for  Merger.  In this book,  did  the  Prime

Minister not say that when the Plen came to see him,

he told the Plen straightaway, "No, no prospects for

merger."? Then the Tunku came down and on  27th  May

said that he was quite happy to have Singapore.  "We

want   to   be  friends.  Let  us  have   a   closer

association."  The Plen came back  and  said,  "Kuan

Yew,  did  you tell me a lie?" All this  is  in  The

Battle for Merger. He did not know that such a thing

was coming. Yet since it has come, in his speech  he

is  trying to claim credit - that he fought so  hard,

he  played golf, he had lunches, he had dinners, and

he  achieved it. Come, come. If it is the  intention

of  the Prime Minister to write history on this hard

and  arduous  task, let us at least be  factual.  He

talked  about poker playing - that he is not  a  good

bluffer.  It may be that he is not good at poker  - I

caught  him  twice  bluffing and  I  got  his  money

because he bluffed. But what was worse to us is that

the  bluff is on the public. To bluff the public  on

the 50 per cent labour! That kind of bluff we cannot

countenance.  Bluff at poker, if caught,  means  the

personal  loss  of  the  bluffer.  But  bluffing  on

constitutional matters is to sacrifice the interests

of  the people of the country to suit the whims  and

fancies of a dictator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end my speech on this theme.

Every  Member on the Government side, from the Prime

Minister down to even the Minister for Law, keeps on

playing  this  record - the Alliance works  with  the

Barisan  Sosialis, who are the Communists,  to  deny

the  Federal Elections and force on us this  51-seat

State   elections.  The  Member  for   Farrer   Park

explained  in  this  House  yesterday  that  it  was

unfortunate that at that particular time  the  Prime

Minister  and  the  Minister for  Finance  were  not

present,  and  it was really pathetic  that  without

these two big men in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



Government or in the Party, the Government got  into

a  mess.  The  reason  why we  opposed  the  Federal

Elections Bill is clear. This was repeated. Yet  the

P.A.P. Press would not even give the reasons why  we

opposed the Federal Elections Bill. No, it is not in

the  Press.  Why play that P.A.P. line of distortion

- that  the  Alliance is afraid of Federal elections:

that the Alliance is now working with the Communists

- all  that  kind of distortion? We were against  the

Federal  elections  and  we gave  our  reasons.  The

Member  for Farrer Park gave his reasons. I  do  not

want  to take up the time of this House by repeating

those reasons. But it may be worth it. We oppose  it

because  we say that the Second Reading should  have

taken place after this debate. By then we would have

the  Malaysia  documents to know  what  we  are  all

debating  about.  The Government could  easily  have

said, "All right, let us postpone the Second Reading

till  after this debate." No. An arrogant Government

says, "Let us fix the Opposition," and they laughed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other very serious objection which we raised

was  that  we  do  not  want a Government-controlled

delineation   of  the  divisions.  We   want   equal

representation   with   an   independent   Chairman,

preferably a representative of the Federal Elections

Commission,   to   delineate   Singapore   into   15

divisions. We say we do not trust the P.A.P. How can

we  trust  them  when they have had Article  30  (2)

sneaked  in,  Article 33 sneaked in,  everything  is

sneaked  in?  We have evidence of their attempts  at

sneaking in things. Give these two points. And  what

is  left now is this: have an independent committee,

free  from Government control, to delineate  the  15

divisions. The Member for Farrer Park says the  ball

is  now  at the feet of the Government. But all  the

Ministers, the Leader of the House (the Deputy Prime

Minister), the Minister for Law, stood up and got up

playing the same refrain - distorting and distorting.

Instead of saying to us, "If that is what you  want,

all  right. We promise you that we will behave, that

we  will reintroduce the Second Reading of the Bill.

We cross our hearts that we will not cheat any more.

We have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



caught."  That  would have been all right.  But  no.

They keep on distorting the same thing over and over

again.  Do  not  say that we are afraid  of  Federal

elections. We want Federal elections as much as  the

PAP.  But we want it fought in a manner that is  not

loaded  in  favour of the Party in power. The  Prime

Minister  was absent, but when he heard about  this,

what  was  his  first remark? "Ha, this  unthinking

action  of Lim Yew Hock. I do not know why he should

be  with the Communists and all this, that, and  the

other.   He  is  denying  the  people  of  Singapore

representation  in  the  Federal  Parliament."   Who

denies?   It   is   the  P.A.P. who   denies   this

representation. But what did the Prime Minister say,

Sir,  in  his  speech? "Perhaps  we  have  to  give

thought  to it; perhaps I may nominate two or  three

Ministers to sit in the Federal Parliament  for  the

interim period." He wants to do that. But under  the

agreement,  which we are debating  now,  it  plainly

says  the  manner  of  representation  shall  be  as

decided  by  the Legislative Assembly.  And  yet  he

wants  to do it dictatorially. "I will send  two  or

three Ministers, never mind." Stop-gap. He cannot do

that  even  if he wants it. He says we  are  against

Malaysia.  He says that he wants us to vote  against

this Malaysia motion. "Oh, if the Alliance dare vote

against  this." This is like a little child who  has

been spanked by his mother for misbehaving and got a

very  bad  spanking as the P.A.P. got  a  very  bad

spanking over that Federal Elections Bill.  He  came

out  crying  and said, "Mama, if you want,  you  can

choke me and make me die." We are not like that.  We

are  for  Malaysia 100 per cent. We are for Malaysia

with more clean thoughts, more clean intentions than

the  P.A.P. can ever dare to claim. The Member  for

Farrer  Park, in his closing remarks in very  simple

language, simple and unambiguous language, laid down

the  stand of the Alliance. And I would like to  end

my speech to quote this very important pronouncement

of  the  Alliance. I quote from the Official  Report

(Unrevised),  page 39 [col. 478]; and  this  is  our

stand:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, all I wish to say is this. We are for

Malaysia.  I  ask  the Government  not  to  make  it

difficult for us to vote with them on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



motion. While we are for Malaysia, we are even  more

so for Singapore. It is because we love Singapore so

much  that we go into Malaysia. Now, if in going  to

Malaysia, some jiggery-pokery is going to be done to

Singapore, to preserve some party interests, we  are

not  going to be a party to that. We cannot  and  we

must not. The Alliance makes this offer that if they

support  this amendment we will whole-heartedly  and

with  great  pleasure vote with them on the  motion,

but  if  they  deny us this and defeat  us  on  this

amendment, it is with the utmost regret that we will

have to refrain from voting on a matter on which  we

are  so vitally concerned and connected. I hope  the

Government will not force us into that position.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government wants to force us into that

position, I would ask it to do it in a way  that  is

more honest and clean. Arrange it in such a way that

the voting can be in parts, if it can be done. If it

cannot be done, then it cannot be done. If it can be

done  in  parts - Malaysia? Aye. Common Market?  Aye.

Loan Agreement? Aye. P.A.P. cheat? No, no, no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee) and Mr Marshall</b> rose -





<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated that perhaps it is

best,  since  there is going to be a  guillotine  on

this  motion,  that  we  hear  all  views  from  the

Opposition  side  first.  I  propose  to  call   Mr

Marshall and immediately after that I will call  the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the Government motion

asks us to welcome their success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the very first sitting of this Assembly after the return of the mission from England, they have had their welcome. They were thrice defeated in two days. On Thursday, on the motion for validation, on Friday, on the Bill for representation to the Federation Parliament, and again on a motion to increase their borrowing power.

They  have had their welcome. They know how we feel.

It is true when it comes to the voting on the motion

itself,   certain   political  considerations   will

supercede   the  real  feeling  of  the  people   of

Singapore  about the outcome of this agreement.  But

let us recognise that if we for a moment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



thought that they were heroes or even that they were

successful,  they  would  not  have  received   that

reception so soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have Cmd. 22 of 1963. To us in Singapore it is primarily a funeral service for the port and the people of Singapore. It contains, however, Mr Speaker, certain lunatic aspects which it might be interesting to touch upon before we come to the main issue. I ask you to look at the first page of this document whose counterpart was tabled

in  England  at the United Kingdom Parliament  about

the middle of this month, but which we received only

on Sunday afternoon. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Agreement concluded between the United Kingdom of

Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Federation

of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if you look at Article I, Sir, page 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

Ireland, the Federation of Malaya, North Borneo.

Sarawak and Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desiring to conclude an agreement relating to

Malaysia;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree as follows:-



<div align="center">Article I</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak and the

State  of  Singapore  shall be  federated  with  the

existing   States   ... in  accordance   with   the

constitutional   instruments   annexed    to    this

Agreement...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at Article III:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of the United Kingdom will submit

to  Her Britannic Majesty before Malaysia Day Orders

in  Council for the purpose of giving the  force  of

law to the Constitutions of Sabah, Sarawak and Singa

pore  as  States of Malaysia which are  set  out  in

Annexes B, C and D.'.



<br><br>Ours is "C", Mr Speaker. And finally. Mr Speaker,

if I might refer to Article IV -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. To put the record straight,

when the hon. Member said "ours" I take it he meant

the Singapore Constitution. That appears to be "D".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker. Thank you

for  the  correction. According  to  this  document,

therefore,  Annex  D - by the way, before  we  finish

that,  if  you will look, Mr Speaker, at  the  last

sentence  at page 3: "Done at London this Ninth  day

of July, 1963 ...". Signed by the Prime Minister and

the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



for  Finance. So according to this document,  it  is

alleged that Annex D is the Annex which was attached

to the Agreement executed on the 9th of July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there was in England tabled in Parliament a White Paper known as Cmd. 2094. I understand you have a copy. I table an additional one, Mr Speaker. It is impossible to obtain this in any bookshop in Singapore, and I succeeded in obtaining some airmail copies. It contains the identical instruments with the addition of an index.

Mr   Speaker,  there  are  variations  between  the

Singapore White Paper and the White Paper tabled  by

Her  Britannic Majesty's Government to  the  British

Parliament. And I say to you. Mr Speaker, it  is  a

question  of  whether we are to believe the  British

Government's White Paper tabled in Parliament or the

Prime  Minister's White Paper. Anybody who hesitates

should be in Woodbridge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has drawn your

attention  to two major falsehoods in this  forgery.

This  Article  30 (2)  (b)  is an interpolation  which

does  not  appear at page 146 of the  British  White

Paper.  He has also drawn your attention to  Article

33   wherein  in  our  White  Paper  we  delete  the

provision requiring that by-elections should be held

within three months. Now we can understand fully the

dishonesty  of the constant procrastination  of  the

Government of the Sembawang by-election.  I  do  not

know  if  you remember, Mr Speaker, that  the  last

time  I  asked that question in April, they promised

the  election would be held within two months.  That

was April. It was always the excuse of the electoral

roll.  They  proceed  on  the  basis,  Mr  Speaker,

particularly the Minister for Culture, that it  does

not  matter  what falsehood you utter. It  does  not

matter! The power lies in the barrel of the gun  and

as  their  leader, the Prime Minister, has said,  "I

agree with Humpty Dumpty, a word means what I say it

means."  And  so  long as they are in  power,  their

falsehoods which they can impose upon the Press  and

the radio, and organs of mass dissemination of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



news,  it  does  not  matter  what  falsehoods  they

propagate.  It does not matter that everybody  knows

that  they are dishonest. They consider that a sense

of shame is an absurd adjunct to a political adult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I would like, apart from those

matters which were drawn to your attention, to  draw

your attention to other falsehoods in this document,

this  false document which you are asked  to  adopt.

Page  142, section 24 (4)  (c) . The second last  line

of   that  section.  "paragraph  (e) "  should   read

"paragraph (d) ". It is intentional, Mr Speaker.  It

is  not our Printer's error. Page 142 of Singapore's

White Paper and page 144 of the British White Paper.

If I might go on to the next one. Article 32 (b) , at

page  154, of our White Paper, and page 147  of  the

British White Paper, the last line of that paragraph

reading:  `or paragraph (e) ' should read  `paragraph

(d) '. Again a falsehood.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> What page is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Forgive me. Page 145

of  our White Paper. Article 32 (b). `... by virtue of

paragraph (a)  or paragraph [it should read]  (d)   of

clause (2) ...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, who is a lawyer and who next month will be a lawyer again, if he tries to do this in a court of law, knows he will get straight into gaol. Imagine him putting in a statement of claim with alleged amendments. "I am not trying to defraud the court." But he can do it to us. Power is in the barrel of the gun. Mr

Speaker,  we  purport to follow  the  traditions  of

democracy, evolved by another great nation,  and  it

is   a   pity   that  none  of  `is  have   adequate

understanding  that  the  barrel  of  the   gun   is

inappropriate for democratic traditions. And perhaps

none  on  the  Front bench have an understanding  of

that  doggerel  which has recently  gained  so  much

publicity. "To lie in the House is obscene."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw your attention to another lunatic aspect of

this  motion and the documents tabled. I  draw  your

attention to Misc. 5 of 1963 which states that it is

an  exchange of letters. It seems to be more a  one-way  traffic than an exchange. It starts off with  a

letter of 8th July



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



written  by  the Prime Minister after the  purported

interview  with  the envelope.  I  draw  again  your

attention to that paragraph to which the Member  for

Cairnhill  drew attention, but he did  not  conclude

the lesson. "When you confirm them this exchange  of

letters  will  form a statement of our agreement  on

these  matters." So if you do not confirm them,  Mr

Speaker, there is no agreement. I repeat the  words.

The Prime Minister's words to Tun Abdul Razak. "When

you  confirm them this exchange of letters will form

a  statement of our agreement ...'. Mr Speaker,  let

us look at the second paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Firstly, it is agreed that any law enacted by

Parliament  under  Article  9  (3)   of  the  Federal

Constitution which imposes restrictions  in  respect

of  movement and residence as between the States  of

Malaya and Singapore will have reciprocal effect  so

that  any restrictions imposed on Singapore citizens

as  regards movement or residence in the  States  of

Malaya  will equally apply to citizens of  Malaysia,

who are Singapore citizens, ...'.



<br><br>What  does it mean? So that any provisions apply  to

Singapore  citizens shall mean that  they  apply  to

Singapore citizens? Somebody slipped? Because if  we

look  at the only confirmation we have, which is  an

undated  letter of July signed by the  Deputy  Prime

Minister on the next page, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the event of the Federation Government

introducing legislation under Article 9 (3)   of  the

Constitution  of  Malaysia imposing restrictions  as

between  Singapore and the States of Malaya  on  the

right conferred by Article 9 (2), I agree that  such

restrictions should be reciprocal.'



<br><br>And  I  take  it, it would mean also in  respect  of

those who are not Singapore citizens - the word "not"

having  been  left out - not being able  to  come  to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look at "secondly" which was never ever

confirmed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Secondly, it is agreed that there will be no

discrimination in the application of the fundamental

rights   provisions  in  Part  II  of  the   Federal

Constitution against Singapore citizens  other  than

those  which  have been agreed and included  in  the

Malaysia Bill ...'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  is it not important to have  that  at

least in the Constitution, let alone an exchange  of

letters?  There is not even a confirmation of  that.

It goes on to read:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... and that any possible modifications in the

future  of these fundamental rights provisions  will

apply equally to all citizens of Malaysia, including

Singapore citizens and that no modifications will be

made against Singapore citizens only.'



<br><br>Where  is  the confirmation of "secondly"

- a  vital matter  which  he  now goes to the  point  of  being

satisfied  if it is in a letter from not  the  Prime

Minister  but  the  Deputy Prime  Minister?  One  is

reminded,  Mr  Speaker, of a snotty urchin  playing

marbles in a back alley!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thirdly, in accordance with section 98, there

will  be  a  Bill.  If you will look  at  this,  Mr

Speaker,  it is curious the number of mistakes  that

one finds in the conduct of these Gentlemen who must

have  found  themselves foreigners in the  political

stratosphere  wherein they had to  negotiate.  There

are  nine points, not eight in this letter,  because

he  refers  to  it  later as an eight-point  letter.

There is a "lastly":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Lastly, it is agreed that the Governments of the

Federation   and   of  Singapore  will   take   such

legislative,  executive or other action  as  may  be

required  to  implement the assurances, undertakings

and   recommendations   of  the   Inter-Governmental

Committee on Merger and its Sub-Committees in so far

as  these  have  not  been subsequently  amended  or

implemented   by   express   provisions    of    the

Constitution ...'.



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  he  was  trying  to  do   what   the

Governments   of  North  Borneo  and   Sarawak   had

obtained. Might I for a moment ask you to look  back

to  Article VIII of the Agreement, page 2,  in  Cmd.

Paper 22 of 1963? You will see there:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Governments of the Federation of Malaya,

North  Borneo  and Sarawak [but not Singapore,  Sir]

will  take  such  legislative,  executive  or  other

action   as   may  be  required  to  implement   the

assurances,    undertakings   and    recommendations

contained in Chapter 3 of, and Annexes A and  B  to,

the   Report  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee

signed on 27th February, 1963, in so far as they are

not   implemented  by  express  provision   of   the

Constitution of Malaysia.'



<br><br>Now  that is a solemn document, Mr Speaker,  signed

by  the  three Governments on 9th July. He is merely

trying  to get an exchange of letters which he  does

not get. He says, can I have your assurance that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it is agreed that the Governments of the

Federation and Singapore will take such legislative,

executive or other action



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



as  may  be  required to implement  the  assurances,

undertakings  and  recommendations  of  the   Inter-Governmental Committee on Merger...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now this nine-point letter to which

he  gets one agreement - and only one - leaving  eight

points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see next a letter of the 10th of July

- that is, two days after this purported agreement on

the  back of an envelope! That is how he deals  with

the fate of our people:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My dear Prime Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to our discussion on the evening of 8th

July  at  the  Ritz Hotel as a result  of  which  we

agreed:' -



<br><br>So  you  see, Sir, it was the evening of the 8th  of

July, because if you will look at the next document,

it  starts off by saying that it was the 8th of June

and  it was changed to the 8th of July. That  is  in

the  handwriting of our Prime Minister, whereas  the

Prime Minister of the Federation says it was the 7th

of July. Do you see that, Mr Speaker? Now let us go

back:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to our discussion on the evening of 8th

July  at  the  Ritz Hotel as a result  of  which  we

agreed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in respect of the loan for the development of

the  Borneo States, no labourers will be engaged

from   outside  Malaysia  for  the   development

projects  and that 50 per cent of such labourers

shall be supplied from Singapore;'-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I remind the Member that

his speech is being interpreted?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir,I do

apologise to the translators. I will read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(ii) that the Federation will not object to the

amendment of the Singapore Constitution so that

where  a  member  of  the Legislative  Assembly

resigns or is expelled ...'.



<br><br>So  you see, Sir, even on the 10th of July, you have

proof  that  Article  30 (2)   (b)   was  not  in  the

original  agreement and it is not the British  White

Paper  that lies; it is our Government's White Paper

that lies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I say lies!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I say rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Further:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(iii) that where the Federation enacts any law

restricting  movement  or residence  such  order

shall be reciprocal.



<div align="center"><h4>* * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attach a photostat cops of the notes of the

agreement which you signed.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, you will notice one thing. Ho has  now forgotten about our fundamental rights to  which  he referred in the third paragraph of his letter of the 8th  that  hereafter there will be no discrimination or  legislation  against  the  people  of  Singapore specifically a thing about which we have been deeply worried  throughout the merger debate. This has  now

been forgotten. Does he get a reply, Mr Speaker? He

attaches  this  back  of an  envelope  and  he  gets

treated  with  the  contempt that he  deserves  - the

letter   of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   of   the

Federation  of Malaya dated 18th! It  is  with  pain

that  I  see our Government - whatever we  may  think

about it - being treated in this way from outside:



<br><br>`Dear Prime Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[the last sentence] I am, therefore, returning

them [the letters] to you.'



<br><br>Let me read the whole letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You will remember that shortly before the signing

of  the  formal  agreement for the establishment  of

Malaysia  in London on 8th July, 1963, you forwarded

a  number  of  claims  on behalf  of  the  Singapore

Government  in the form of letters. As a  result  of

the  discussions between Tunku and yourself and  the

understanding reached between you it was agreed that

there was no need to reply further to these letters.

I am, therefore, returning them to you herewith.'.



<br><br>He  gets his little envelope and he gets his letters

and  he  gets  no  confirmation of  the  fundamental

rights   of   the   people  of   Singapore   of   no

discrimination, or 50 per cent labour - nothing. That

is   the   way   our   Prime  Minister   negotiates.

[Interruption] What did he say? We cannot blame them

for  smarting.  He  took a long time  to  reply.  He

finally did on 22nd July:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have your letter of 18th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can ignore the letter containing

the eight points ...'.



<br><br>Which  letter  containing  the  eight  points,   Mr

Speaker? If he means the letter of the 8th of  July,

it contains nine points.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



He  said "eighthly" and then the last paragraph says

"lastly".  Lastly does not mean that  it  is  not  a

point at all. I will continue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I do not think we can ignore the letter

containing  the eight points because the note  which

the  Tunku  signed said that the last part  of  this

letter about the Inter-Governmental Committee was to

be  cancelled.  This will make no sense  unless  the

letter  is  in  fact published.  As  for  the  other

points, you have agreed to them, although they  will

not be enshrined in the Constitution. I am happy  to

leave it at that.'



<br><br>He  is.  What about the rest of us? He is  happy  to

leave  it  at what? At the fact that he has  written

it,  that  there is no confirmation even by  letter,

that  it  is  not in the Constitution, and  that  it

cannot be enforced in any court of law or otherwise!

He  is  happy to deal with the fate of Singapore  in

this  fashion.  "I am happy to leave  it  at  that."

- playing  marbles in a backlane! Sir,  this  is  the

other aberration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, let us come to the main motion -

this  tragedy  which  they have transformed  into  a

farce. They ask the people of Singapore to adopt the

constitutional  provisions and amendments  contained

in   Paper  Cmd.  22  of  1963  and  the  amendments

contained  in Cmd. 24. As the Deputy Prime  Minister

said  a  few  moments ago. "It is in  our  power  to

revise the British White Paper and we have the power

to  adopt  or reject." Mr Speaker, let us  took  at

what we are supposed to adopt. First of all, we  are

supposed  to  adopt  the  agreement  signed  by  Her

Majesty's  Government,  the  Federation  of  Malaya,

North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore. I say it is the

height of impertinence for us to adopt any of  these

four   instruments  indicated  in  this   particular

Document!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the Malaysia Bill. Of course, we

are  interested in it, Mr Speaker.  It  is  curious

that we should be asked to adopt it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just after the Malaysia Bill, we come to the

Constitution of the State of Sabah. It  is  we,  the

Members  of the Legislative Assembly, who adopt  the

Constitution of the State of Sabah!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the next Document that we adopt, Mr Speaker

- let us not forget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is  our  duty and our  responsibility - the

Constitution of the State of Sarawak! Then  we  come

to the Constitution of the State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have to adopt the Immigration Bill for

Malaysia!  We  have  to  adopt  the  application  to

Service lands in Singapore of the defence agreement!

They  have  not even had the courtesy to  table  the

Defence Agreement. We are blind chickens. What  does

it  matter - you pass the motion; you say that 8 p.m.

on Thursday there is a closure: we have our numbers;

there  are blind sheep all over the place; everybody

has  to vote; we know we are 25 to 25; we know  that

the  Alliance has to vote with us? So what  does  it

matter? All this is nonsense; all this is talk. Sir,

I have a respect for this House. I table the Defence

Agreement  so  that Members who are  interested  may

know what it is about - the Defence Agreement of 12th

October,   1957,  between  Her  Britannic  Majesty's

Government and the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of Defence Agreement handed in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Order that we have to adopt, Sir, is the

form of Compensation Order in Council - North Borneo

and  Sarawak!  Do not forget that we have  to  adopt

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we have to adopt is the Form of

Public  Officers Agreements in respect of Sabah  and

Sarawak. Well done, we have to adopt that!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is a curious position and a very

curious  change from the days only three months  ago

when the Prime Minister said he refused to table  in

this  House  the Constitution of the  Federation  of

Malaysia when the draft was received. He said,  "Why

should  I table documents referring to North  Borneo

when  it is not my responsibility?" I see you  in  a

questioning  mood, Mr Speaker. In that  case  would

you  care to look at Hansard, Vol. 20, No.  2,  col. 43. Mr Speaker. I asked:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, perhaps it was an oversight that the Prime

Minister   has  omitted  to  indicate  whether   the

Government will give this Assembly an opportunity to

debate  the whole Draft Constitution, including  the

Constitution of Singapore in the context



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



[not that we should adopt] of the Constitution for the Borneo territories...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: Indeed my reply, Sir,I  have

already on one famous occasion...',



<br><br>and  he  goes  on  and on. But let us  come  to  the

material part - the last six lines:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That is not my problem. I am not charged with

these  responsibilities and I see no  reason  why  I

should  move their State amendments in this Assembly

or allow it as a subject for debate, in which case I

shall  have  to  defend or condemn it.  But  I  will

certainly  allow the fullest of debate on the  whole

of  the  Malaysian Constitution and on the Singapore

State   Constitution,  but  not  the   Constitutions

concerning Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei.'.



<br><br>Now  we  are asked to adopt. Sir, can we adopt?  Mr

Speaker, does it make any difference if we adopt, as

the  P.A.P. says? If we reject, as the  Member  for

Queens-town  says. If we amend, as  the  Member  for

Farrer Park says. Has it got any validity? I say  to

you, Mr Speaker, the whole thing is a farce. Let us

start  with  the document which the  House  has  not

seen. I have in my hand - I shall table it and it  is

the  only copy I have, Mr Speaker - the Malaysia Bill

of  the  United  Kingdom which I  believe  has  been

passed  without  amendment. It starts  off  with  an

Explanatory Memorandum:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Bill provides for the relinquishment of Her

Majesty's sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of

North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore (referred to  in

the  Bill  as "the new States") for the  purpose  of

enabling  them to federate with the existing  States

of the Federation of Malaya in accordance [I ask you

to  remember this, Sir] with the Malaysia  Agreement

Cmd. 2094).'.



<br><br>Let us look at clause I (now section 1) of this Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) For the purpose of enabling North Borneo,

Sarawak  and Singapore (in this Act referred  to  as

"the  new  States")  to federate with  the  existing

States  of  the Federation of Malaya  (in  this  Act

referred  to  as  "the Federation"), the  Federation

thereafter  being called Malaysia,  on  the  day  on

which the new States are federated as aforesaid  (in

this  Act  referred to as "the appointed  day")  Her

Majesty's sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of

the  new States shall be relinquished so as to  vest

in the manner agreed [operative words: in the manner

agreed]  between the United Kingdom of Great Britain

and  Northern Ireland, the Federation  and  the  new

States.'.



<br><br>What  is  the  manner agreed? You see, Sir,  it  has

already been passed by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



House  of Commons and the House of Lords - I  repeat,

it  has  already been passed and become an Act  - and

the  manner  agreed is the manner that  has  already

been  agreed and it is already referred  to  in  the

Explanatory Memorandum. I know that in this House it

does  not matter two hoots. We see it every  day  at

least  two  dozen times, if not more, the Government

doing  a  "Profumo" on the House. But I should  very

much  like to see - they really believe it - Mr Duncan

Sandys  trying  to do a "Profumo" on  the  House  by

trying  to  introduce an Order in Council  different

from  that which has already been agreed put in  the

Malaysia White Paper Cmd. 2094 and approved by  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case there are hasty lawyers in this

House,  there is a clause, now section 4 (3),  which

looks  as  though Her Majesty can vary an  Order  in

Council  that has been approved already  under  this

Bill. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any Order in Council under subsection (1) of this

section  shall be subject to annulment in  pursuance

of  a resolution of either House of Parliament,  and

may  be  varied or revoked by a subsequent Order  in

Council.'



<br><br>Which is subsection (1)  of this section?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Her Majesty may by Order in Council make such

adaptations  in any Act of Parliament passed  before

the  appointed  day as appear to  Her  necessary  or

expedient in consequence of the new States  becoming

included in the Federation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us take it step by step. Section 1 which

vests   the  sovereignty  in  accordance  with   the

agreements  in  the manner agreed. Section  4  which

deals  with adaptations of Acts of Parliament  which

can  be  varied by Order in Council. But the vesting

of  the sovereignty cannot be varied by an iota.  If

it is so varied, Mr Speaker, it is null and void. I

should be more than surprised. Singapore lawyers can

do  what  they  please. They produce or  the  P.A.P.

Government produces a White Paper that is a  forgery

and  if  they  think  that  they  can  persuade  Her

Britannic Majesty's Government to play the  game  of

politics  the way they do, they will find  they  are

mistaken.  And we are here arguing about amendments,

adoptions, rejections. This is law, Mr Speaker. You

cannot say to the Judge, "I reject your sentence  of

death. I adopt your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



sentence."  What absurdity. The sentence is  passed.

There  is  the  Bill and there is the memorandum  of

agreement. And it is the height of absurdity to deal

with  responsible  people and the  Assembly  of  the

people  in such disgraceful fashion. After all,  Mr

Speaker,  I have read to you the Bill. Now  look  at

the clauses of the agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill says in the manner agreed. This was

tabled before they read it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article I:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak and the

State  of  Singapore  shall be  federated  with  the

existing States of the Federation of Malaya  as  the

States of Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore in accordance

with  the constitutional instruments annexed to this

Agreement ...'.



<br><br>So  they  shall be federated in accordance with  the

constitutional instruments now annexed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article III:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of the United Kingdom will submit

to  Her Britannic Majesty before Malaysia Day Orders

in  Council for the purpose of giving the  force  of

law  to  the  Constitutions of  Sabah,  Sarawak  and

Singapore as States of Malaysia which are set out in

Annexes B, C and D to this Agreement.'.



<br><br>They are set out already in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article IV:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... as from Malaysia Day, of Her Britannic

Majesty's sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of

North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore so that the said

sovereignty   and   jurisdiction   shall   on   such

relinquishment   vest   in  accordance   with   this

Agreement and the constitutional instruments annexed

to this Agreement.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely. Mr Speaker, is the Assembly of

Singapore  purporting to amend an Act of the  United

Kingdom  Parliament,  or  is  it  our  intention  to

embarrass  the Secretary of State for  the  Colonies

and  say,  "Here,  we  have  got  the  vote  of  the

Singapore Assembly. Now you give it to us.  If  not,

the  urchins  in the back alley can be a nuisance."?

But  do they really think that nuisance though  they

may  be,  embarrassing though they  may  be  to  the

British Government, the British Government would  be

constitutionally  in a position, either  morally  or

legally, to accord this bankrupt Government that  is

now on the verge of resignation this? Mr Speaker, I

might add - no, let us leave it at that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject, Mr Speaker, much play has

been made by this Government about the fact that  it

does not resign now and if we want it to resign now,

let  us  all vote against this motion. Mr  Speaker,

you  are  aware  that  there is  a  section  in  our

Constitution which says that any government  elected

under  the  1958 Order in Council can  only  survive

until  five  years  after the commencement  of  that

Order in Council in 1958, which means April 1964. So

if  there  are  elections this month,  the  Assembly

elected can only survive for seven months, that  is,

until  March next year. Quite obviously, no  serious

Party  wants  to insist on their resigning  now  and

holding   elections  now,  and  that  is   why   the

Opposition is being patient until 1st September,  so

that  from 1st September and in September they  have

to resign. From the 1st September any elections held

will  be  held  under the new Constitution  and  the

Government  that comes to power will be a government

for  five  years.  So  this empty  bluff  about  "We

challenge you."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister knows well that this is a farce and he knew it well a long time ago. In fact, Mr Speaker, he promised us, solemnly promised us, that before he signed the agreement in England, we would be allowed to debate it and he would only sign it if it was approved by us. I do not ask you to take my word for it, Mr Speaker.

Again  I ask you to look at Volume 20, No. 2 of  our

Official  Report, cols. 34, 35 and 42. May I  remind

the  House  of  this promise? Col. 34, Mr  Speaker,

about ten lines from the bottom:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The present time-table is that all these

constitutional  amendments should be  ready  by  May

[this  was only the 5th of April; three and  a  half

months  ago]  or, at the latest, by  early  June  in

order that they can be tabled before and approved by

this  Assembly and then incorporated in a treaty  to

be signed in London in June...'.



<br><br>You  see, Mr Speaker, "the time-table... before and

approved by this Assembly and then incorporated in a

treaty...". Col. 35, in the middle column:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members will realise the urgent necessity of our

finding   a  just  formula  for  working   out   our

contribution. If this is not done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



before the end of May, then the London treaty may be

delayed to the end of June or even the beginning  of

July, since after agreement some time will be needed

by  the  draftsmen to frame these amendments to  the

Federal  Constitution and some further time will  be

taken by this Assembly to ... adopt them.'



<br><br>That is the second promise. Third promise is in col.

42; in answer to my question, the last five lines of

his answer:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We hope that this vital question of finance can

be  resolved  soon in time for us to table  all  the

constitutional amendments for adoption by  May  [for

adoption  by  May] in order that the treaty  can  be

signed in June.'



<br><br>For adoption by us in May. One more falsehood nailed

to  the  coffin. Only it gives me no  pleasure,  Mr

Speaker.  He talks of integrity to this  House,  who

has  shown himself to be the most amoral person that

I  have  ever met, and I doubt whether anybody  else

has ever met one quite so amoral as he is, with such

complete contempt for truth, for word of honour, for

his  contractual  obligations, for his  undertaking,

let  alone for any respect for this House. Now,  Mr

Speaker,  I  come  to those parts where  even  anger

pales.  I shall not deal with all aspects. When  you

are  being crucified, Mr Speaker, you do not  worry

whether  somebody  is picking your  pocket  of  $150

million  or $50 million. I shall not deal  with  the

$150   million  or  $50  million  or  the  financial

contributions. These matters pale before two primary

issues;  one,  that  the people  of  Singapore  will

forever and all future generations be a people apart

from other citizens of Malaysia and that they can be

easily  discriminated against as and when it is  the

will of the Central Government; and the second part,

Mr  Speaker, is that our rice bowl which  has  been

filled  by a pattern of economy extending  over  140

years from the time of Raffles till today on a  free

port  basis  is  going to be broken - not  in  twelve

years;  as  I see it in five with slow strangulation

thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall first deal with citizenship. But

I  think I would like at this stage  to  remind this House how

bitterly I fought, I struggled and I





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



agonised   for   a  common  citizenship   with   the

Federation, because I say, and I am convinced it  is

still    true,   that   unless   we   have    common

responsibilities,  common  privileges,   we   cannot

survive  for bug in this unequal harmony. I  do  not

want any privileges in education; I do not want  any

privileges in labour. We are twice as wealthy as the

Federation.  I  do  not want to  keep  any  of  that

wealth. I say let us make the great experiment, this

unique   pioneer  experiment  in  mass  human   race

relations -as equal partners and mutual respect  and

as  for  the free port of Singapore it is  for  your

good, nobody has ever doubted it for a moment.  That

is  all that we sought, the same as Penang. And then

we  went to New York at our expense - at least myself

at  mine, a large part - and thereafter there was  an

exchange  of  letters,  and  everything  looked  all

right.  Everybody  would have a common  citizenship.

There  will  be  common  disability  affecting   all

States,  and  there would be no discrimination.  And

there  were  even  P.A.P. radio forums  at  which  I

agreed  to go and I agreed to be part of the  P.A.P.

propaganda, because it seemed good to me and what is

good  for  the people, it does not matter  where  it

comes from. I went there and I asked questions and I

received  thoroughly  dishonest  replies  that   we

received  from  the  Prime Minister.  And  in  those

circumstances, I supported Command 33  of  1961  and

broke with my Party to do so. They said, "Wait  till

you  see  the  final constitutional papers.  Do  not

trust  them." And I say, constitutionally you cannot

proceed  on  the basis that your own  Government  is

lying.  You  have got to proceed on the  basis  that

they  are  telling you the truth and only when  they

lie  and  they have been proved to lie  when  events

have  proved the falsehood, only then should we turn

against  them.  I  am in duty bound  to  accept  the

assurances  given  by the Prime Minister.  Yes,  the

Member  for Hong Lim was rather gentle with  me.  He

used   the  word  "bluff";  others  might  use  even

stronger  words. And now, Mr Speaker, we  have  the

full  round, back again to where we were,  where  we

started.  Article 23. I am looking  at  the  English

one. I suspect so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



much  our  local  one. Page 141. I am  afraid  I  am

dealing with the mistake that I found there. I  have

got the notes not in respect of the citizenship.  If

you will be patient, Mr Speaker, I will be with you

in  a minute. That is quite true, Sir,It is Article

23  in the Federation Constitution at page 21 of the

English  one - Citizenship by operation of Law.  Now,

you  see,  Mr  Speaker,  they  give  us  what  they

promised  to  give  us. Every citizen  of  Singapore

becomes  a  citizen of Malaysia - that is fine.  Then

you  go  to  the next page, 24 (4) : `Any certificate

issued under Clause (1)  may state that the person to

whom  it  relates  is or is not a Singapore  citizen

...'.  This  is  the  first reference  you  have  to

citizen  of  Malaysia chopped Singapore  citizen  or

citizen  of  Singapore - you know, the yellow  badge.

Next  Article  28 (1)  - if the citizen  of  Singapore

wants  to  remove the yellow badge, Mr Speaker,  of

being a citizen of Singapore and just wants to be  a

Federation   citizen,  he  has  to  qualify   as   a

foreigner. Next, Article 31. There, Mr Speaker,  we

anticipated that we cannot stand for election in the

Federation - that was clearly understood - or vote  in

the Federation and the Federation cannot vote or any

of the Brunei States cannot vote in Singapore and we

cannot  stand or vote for elections in  any  of  the

Brunei  States  or in the Federation. We  understood

that,  but  we understood also something  else,  Mr

Speaker,  as  I shall prove to you in a  moment.  We

understood that that disability would be  common  to

all  States. A Sarawak citizen would not be able  to

vote  in  North  Borneo or in Singapore  or  in  the

Federation,  and a Federation citizen would  not  be

able  to  vote in Sarawak or in North Borneo  and  a

North  Borneo citizen would not be able to  vote  in

Sarawak or in the Federation. But let us look at the

Constitution of Sabah. Section 16, page 86 - this  is

identical  with  section 16 of the  Constitution  of

Sarawak:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every citizen [not, Sir, every citizen of North

Borneo or Sabah, but every Malaysian citizen] of  or

over  the age of 21 who is resident in the State  is

qualified to be elected as an elected member...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



The  disqualification and the only  disqualification

is  Article  31  of the Malaysia Constitution  which

disqualifies us from standing or voting for election

in  any  State  outside  Singapore  or  any  citizen

outside  Singapore coming to vote in Singapore.  But

according  to  the  Sabah Constitution  and  Sarawak

Constitution, it means that the Senator who seems to

displease  the P.A.P. so much and any other  Federal

citizen  can  go  to  North  Borneo  and  stand  for

election  or  he  can go to Sarawak  and  stand  for

election  and  the Gentlemen from North  Borneo  can

stand for election in the Federation or vote in  the

Federation  as  normal citizens  do  with  just  the

normal  residence  qualification of  six  months  or

whatever  it  is. Singapore and only Singapore,  her

people and her descendants, are for ever isolated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, is there any serious prejudice

arising  out  of  the  fact of a  Malaysian  citizen

(Singapore status)? What are the disadvantages?  Let

us  look  at Article 60 - apart from the one  I  have

already   read.   Article   60   of   the   Malaysia

Constitution   - this  in  the  hand   of   our   own

Government, page 41:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Article 9 of the Constitution, `in Clause (2)

(which  guarantees  to citizens the  right  to  free movement  throughout the Federation), for the  words

"Subject  to  any restrictions imposed  by  any  law

relating  to  the security of the Federation"  there

shall  be  substituted the words "Subject to  Clause

(3)   and to any law relating to the security of  the

Federation or any part thereof.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Clause (3). That is a new clause, Mr

Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So long as under this Constitution any other

State is in a special position as compared with  the

States  of  Malaya.  Parliament may  by  law  impose

restrictions,  as  between  that  State  and   other

States,  on  the rights conferred by Clause  (2)   in

respect of movement and residence:'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall show you in this very House on 6th

December, 1961, the Prime Minister solemnly assuring

me across the Floor of this House that we would have

guarantees  of  freedom of movement,  guarantees  of

association,  guarantees of  trade  union  movement,

being able to have friendly and close relations with

all other territories and branches. I shall show  it

to you. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



the documents and the letters. And then it adds:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided no restriction on the right of movement

between  the  State of Singapore and the  States  of

Malaya  shall  be imposed by virtue of  this  Clause

except by law relating to labour or education or  to

any  matter  in  respect of which,  because  of  the

special   position  of  Singapore,  it  appears   to

Parliament to be desirable to prevent the  enjoyment

of  rights both in the State of Singapore and in the

States of Malaya.'



<br><br>Nice,  wide;  catch-all phrase.  In  the  Manual  of

Military  Law,  you  have  "conduct  unbecoming   an

officer" if you cannot catch him for anything else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what are the disadvantages of having the

yellow  badge  of Singapore, the chop  of  Singapore

status? First, the voting. Right, we will leave that

for  the  moment. Next, restriction of movement  and

residence  in respect of all connected  with  labour

and  education; the right to introduce  any  further

discrimination  by  Parliament where  it  thinks  it

appropriate. That is what it means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last, Mr Speaker, the sting in the tail,

right at the very bottom - the afterthought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Restrictions on the right to form associations

conferred by paragraph (c)  of Clause (1)  may also be

imposed by any law relating to labour or education.'



<br><br>So,  they  have  a  right to restrict  movement  and

residence between us and the Federation; they have a

right  to  introduce new laws of discrimination  and

they  have  the  right  to introduce  laws  limiting

freedom of association. Do you want any more?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister promised us

in  this  House  and the people what they  voted  on

allegedly  in the referendum. I ask you to  look  at

Volume  15  of our Official Report of 6th  December,

1961, column 1396. This was a debate on merger,  Mr

Speaker - myself  intervening   on   a   point   of

elucidation which he was courteous enough to allow:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If it please you, Sir, this has been most helpful

and   I   appreciate  your  consent.   The   Federal

Constitution gives constitutional protection,  right

of  residence,  right of work, right of  freedom  of

association and freedom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



of   speech  in  the  Federation  - only  to  Federal

citizens.  What does the Prime Minister really  mean

when he says - I do not know whether he means what he

says - that a Singapore citizen who becomes a Federal

national will have all the constitutional rights  in

the Federation? It makes a lot of difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: Sir, that is so. If  the  hon.

Member had been following the Prime Minister of  the

Federation,  he would, have noticed that  the  Prime

Minister of the Federation made the point that there

would   be  no  barrier  between  the  mingling   of

Singapore  citizens  and  the  Federation  and  vice

versa.'



<br><br>If   you  like  only  by  implication,  freedom   of

movement,   freedom  of  association,   freedom   of

residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, the same debate, at column

1399, midway:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Prime Minister: ... Sir, as to the second part of

the  amendment, E have already referred to paragraph

14  of  Command  Paper  33  which  is  a  clear  and

categorical  statement  agreed  to  by   the   Prime

Minister of the Federation of Malaya. It says that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nationals of the larger Federation, whether

Singapore  citizens  or the  Federation  citizens,

will  as  nationals have equal rights,  carry  the

same  passport, enjoy the same protection  and  he

subject   to  equal  duties  and  responsibilities

under the Constitution of the larger Federation.'



<br><br>And  every  single word therein has  been  carefully

weighed  by  the  Attorney-General  and  the   State

Advocate-General on this side. The only point  where

Singapore  citizens  are different  from  Federation

citizens is that Singapore citizens will continue to

enjoy  their State rights and privileges - education,

labour,  social  welfare  benefits.  They   are   of

different rates, Sir."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at column 1406. You see. I had been

pestering  him  if  you notice  earlier  and  so  he

replies in the second paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, in precise and clear terms, the White Paper

explains  that  no Singapore citizen will  lose  his

citizenship rights. In addition, he will acquire new

rights as a national of the new Federation. I repeat

this again, because I think it bears repetition  for

the  purposes of the record. Among those rights will

be  the right to elect representatives direct to the

Federation Parliament; the right to carry  the  same

passport  and  enjoy the same rights and  privileges

under  the  Constitution;  and  to  be  subject,  of

course, to the same duties and responsibilities  for

instance,  conscription,  taxes  and  so  on.  These

rights  and  duties are set out in many sections  of

the  Federation Constitution, beginning with Article  8, ...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



I congratulate him there, Sir. Then he goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I do not want to labour the point, but I think

hon. Members who are interested can look through the

documents    entitled,    "Malayan    Constitutional

Documents".  They  can see there  spelt  out,  equal

rights, equal liabilities of all citizens which will

later   on   be  of  all  nationals   of   the   new

Federation.'.



<br><br>That is the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, despite  my

age  I  tend  to  be  excited by  things  that  seem

worthwhile,  and I was so deeply impressed  by  this

clarification.  I  wrote  a  letter  to  the   Prime

Minister  and  I  received  for  a  change  a   most

courteous   reply.  It  is  not  confidential,   Mr

Speaker.  It  was  intended for publication,  as  he

said,  and it was in fact published at the  material

time,  and  I  table  it. I am  sorry,  Sir,  but  I

promised to table one other document. What was it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will have to look up the

Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker. I

will  table it as soon as I have finished with  this

one.

                        *  *  *



 I  confirm  that Article 8 on equality  before  the

rights   without  discrimination  to   all   Federal

nationals, be they Singapore citizens or citizens of

the  present  Federation. Article  12  on  education

would  appear to need no amendment. Please refer  to

<br><br>Perhaps, Sir, I might read this little bit.  No,  it

is about money: we leave that alone. I table this - I

remember  now. Did I hand to you, Sir,  the  English

Bill,  the  Malaysia Bill? I am so  sorry;  here  is

another one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is the document I have promised

to  table - the Malaysia Bill. Mr Speaker, I  shall

refer to the series of radio talks. The first one - I

have the official Press statement of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Government  issued  by  the  Ministry  of

Culture - MC. AU. 25/62/TTS: "TEXT OF BROADCAST  BY

THE PRIME MINISTER, MR LEE KUAN YEW, AT 1910 HRS.,

ON  AUGUST  14, 1962.". This was not  a  forum,  Mr

Speaker, but just a speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Let me remind you, however, that paragraph 14

[that  is, of the White Paper] has one condition  on

Singapore  citizens,  who  as  a  result   of   this

agreement will now automatically become citizens  of

Malaysia. That condition is that Singapore  citizens

will vote and stand for elections only in Singapore.

Similarly  citizens of Malaysia in Malaya or  Borneo

will only vote and stand for elections in Malaya  or

Borneo.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will please note, Sir, the 14th of August,

1962.  "Similarly citizens of Malaysia in Malaya  or

Borneo  will  only vote and stand for  elections  in

Malaya or Borneo." Next,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There will be complete equality and parity

between  all citizens, whether they are  in  Malaya,

Singapore or the Borneo territories. The only  thing

is that the right to vote and the right to stand for

election,  outside  the State  where  a  citizen  is

registered   as   a  voter,  is  not   automatically

transferable.



<div align="center"><h4>* * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for decision has now come. We therefore

intend to hold a referendum on' Saturday...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are some of the falsehoods on which the

referendum was based. I table.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document was tabled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next document, Mr Speaker, is a Radio

Singapore  Press release issued by the  Ministry  of

Culture  and  states  it  is  "a  transcript  of   a

recording in which the Prime Minister, Mr Lee  Kuan

Yew,  answered  questions on citizenship  and  other

related  matters which were put to him by Mr  David

Marshall of the Workers' Party to be broadcast  over

Radio Singapore at 7.10 p.m. on Sunday; l9ih August,

1962."  I am sorry. I have only one copy of this.  I

did  not  think that I would obtain any courtesy  by

seeking additional copies from the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Before I ask my next question, am I correct in

asking   the   Prime  Minister,  am  I  correct   in

understanding,  that the common disability  about  a

person from one territory not being able to stand or

vote  for election in another territory is not  only

applicable to Singapore and the Federation,  but  it

is also applicable to the Borneo territories and no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



one Member of the four territories can stand or vote

for election in the other three?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer: Yes. If you would look at the Cobbold

Report,  paragraph 190 (g), you will  find  it  says

there  conversely we can consider the  citizens  who

are  normally  resident  in  either  of  the  Borneo

territories should likewise be prevented from voting

and  standing for election in any Federal  or  State

elections outside their respective territories.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I did not have the Cobbold Report.

I have  since tried to trace that paragraph.  Maybe

I have  been fobbed off with a false one. But I cannot

find paragraph 190 (g). Next:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Prime Minister, since you speak of the

advantages   of  Singapore  citizenship,   can   you

indicate, apart from the common disability which  is

applicable   to  all  territories,  is   there   any

disadvantage either potential or real,  attached  to

Singapore citizenship? - No. None that has  not  been

made  known.  I mean the citizenship  terms  are  as

spelt  out  in  paragraph 14 of the White  Paper  as

amended  by  this agreement. If I may refer  to  the

letter  of the Tunku in reply to mine, placing  this

agreement on the record. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I confirm that the arrangement for citizenship of

the  inhabitants of Singapore will be  in  the  form

agreed between the Governments of the Federation  of

Malaya and Singapore as set out in paragraph  14  of

Singapore  White Paper, Cmd. 33 of 1961, as  amended

in regard to the nomenclature and franchise in terms

of the statement referred to.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sets out comprehensively what they are.

Myself:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to ask in this context, is there any

material aspect affecting Citizenship either of  the

Federation  or  of  Singapore which  is  being  kept

secret?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still suspicious, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>Answer:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`None whatsoever. I would be in an extremely

dangerous position to keep such an important subject

secret. I mean if there is anything that affects the

lives  of  the people of Singapore and their  future

status  and  we  keep it secret,  I  think  we  will

certainly have a lot to answer for.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they have. But the deed is done. Mr Speaker.

The deed is done -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is time to suspend. I will

thing, there are three Members - now five - out of  25

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think a comment of

that nature is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, when we adjourned at

tea  time.  I  was on the subject of the  assurances

given  by  the  Prime  Minister  to  the  people  of

Singapore  through radio broadcasts,  which  is  his

favourite  forum  on the subject of citizenship  and

how  they  are  now completely false - a  very  grave

aspect.  I  was  dealing  with  that  broadcast   of

questions  and answers wherein I asked the questions

and  he  gave the answers for the broadcast  on  the

19th of August. I go on. Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question: Can you tell me, will there be any legal

right on the part of the Federation to raise general

immigration barriers against Singapore citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer: No, because the open causeway policy will

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall: Article 9 of the Constitution - [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Prime Minister: Yes, Article 9 of the

Constitution   also  says,  however,  that   certain

individuals  or  persons  can  be  kept  to  certain

specified parts of the Federation which will include

Singapore and, as you know, there are certain people

who are -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall: I am not talking of gangsters and

subversives.  That is why I used the words  "general

barriers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister: No, no, no! Gangsters and

subversives  is important because some  people  will

come under either one of the two categories and they

may  be  asked, you know, to either stay on  in  the

Federation side in a particular state or village, or

stay  on  the Singapore side in a particular village

or kampong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself: Will the Singapore citizens have the same

rights  as  those from Sarawak and North  Borneo  to

work  and  have  their  business  in  Malaya  to  be

employed in the Malayan civil service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister: Malayan civil service - there will

be no Malayan civil service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself: Thank you - my mistake. Malaysian civil

service.  And in view of what the Prime Minister  of

the  Federation has said to become Cabinet Ministers

of the Central Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister: Can I take them one by one?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself: Please.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister: First, everybody can go to the

Federation  and  work  there,  have  their  business

there, own houses or whatever they like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everybody can go to the Federation and work...".

So,  Mr Speaker, in this short radio broadcast,  he

first  assured us solemnly as he did  in  his  first

broadcast  of  the 14th of August  that  the  common

disability - the disability of not voting or standing

for election in the Federation - would be applied also

to Borneans who cannot stand or vote in Singapore or

in  the Federation, to Sarawakians who cannot  stand

or  vote in Borneo, Singapore or the Federation  - he

assured  us of that. He assured us that there  would

be  freedom of association; he assured us that there

would be freedom of movement of labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the importance? Perhaps I might pause here

and say this, Mr Speaker. As I see it, if there are

disadvantages to be borne, the people  of  Singapore

should  share  the same disadvantages  as  everybody

else.  And  if  because of our special position,  we

have  got to carry a special disadvantage,  such  as

having the British military bases here and being the

flash-point  in time of war, to the  danger  of  the

entirety  of our people - then we have to carry  that

burden if it is for the good of Malaysia as a whole.

This  is  our  nation and if the general population,

through   their  representatives,  think  that   the

British  bases  are necessary for their  protection,

then  I say we must have it even if it endangers  us

specifically.  But there should  be  no  racial,  no

citizenship  discrimination and  distinction,  which

would  then not make us one people, but make us  two

distinct peoples as in fact is provided for in  this

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not sought to weary you, Mr Speaker. I am

conscious,   first  of  all,   that   there   is   a

"guillotine". I do not intend to hog the whole  time

and  I  know that these technicalities can sometimes

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



boring.  But  throughout the Malaysian  Constitution

they speak of citizens in two ways - citizens outside

Singapore  citizens in Singapore  State;  there  are

Singapore  citizens and citizens outside  Singapore.

So  there  are  two types of citizens  that  go  all

along. For example, residence inside Singapore  does

not  count  as  residence  for  citizenship  of  the

Federation except Federation (Singapore State) - that

is,  citizenship inside Singapore, residence  inside

Malaysia, outside Singapore. You have got  this  all

along  and this is the one thing I have been  urging

should  not happen. We should not seek to  push  the

people  of  Singapore into a corner where they  find

themselves   discriminated,  separately  identified,

"alien".  It is dangerous for the Malaysian  concept

- not merely for us, Mr Speaker. It is dangerous for

the stability of Malaysia as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now. Mr Speaker, the next one I would like to

refer  again  to Volume 20 of our Official'  Report,

No. 2 of the 5th of April, 1963, where for the first

time, Mr Speaker, we get a curious note. Column  28

-   this  is  the  Prime  Minister  speaking  in   a

Ministerial Statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt in some detail on

this  question  of citizenship as I  am  quite  sure

Members of this House and the people outside will be

happy  to know that all their rights as citizens  of

Singapore and later as citizens of Malaysia will  be

duly protected in the Constitution.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our rights will be protected. He did not say a

word  about  limitation of the right of association,

about  the right of Parliament to pass any  laws  to

discriminate  against us. But he did  mention  in  a

curious  P.A.P. indirect  fashion  something  about

Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at column 31, Mr Speaker, the second

paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Article 9 (1) , [of the Federation Constitution]

which  prohibits  banishment of any  citizen,  shall

apply  in Singapore. The same applies to freedom  of

movement  under  Article  9  (2) ;  but  subject,  in

respect  of  Singapore,  to  the  proviso  that  the

Central  Government  may,  if  it  so  desires,   by

legislation  in  respect of labour or  education  or

other  matters  in  which Singapore  citizens  enjoy

autonomy,  prevent  the  double  enjoyment  of  both

rights of State autonomy in Singapore and again full

enjoyment of equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



rights  with other Malaysian citizens in respect  of

labour and education, again the other States.'



<br><br>Now  that  is not what the Constitution  says  about

having double rights. Let us look, in fact, at  what

he  says  in answer to my question, Sir, if I  might

read  my  question, because I was very disturbed  by

this  remark about limitation in respect  of  labour

and education. Col. 36:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, the first question I would like

to  ask is to seek clarification of the remark  that

"Singapore citizens are not to have double enjoyment

of education and labour conditions in other States."

Does  it  by any means infer that Singapore citizens

resident  in  other territories would be  unable  to

find  educational facilities for their  children  in

schools  of  those States? Is there  any  suggestion

that  Singapore  citizens would be  unable  to  find

employment  in  other  States?  It  is  a   somewhat

ambiguous    phrase    and   I   would    appreciate

clarification.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer - if I might read right to the end of that

paragraph  of the Prime Minister's. Mr  Speaker.  I

will  be happy to read the whole if you think it  is

fairer.



<br><br>Column 37:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... if, as a result of a massive inflow from the

Federation, it may not be possible for us to pay for

not  only  education hut lots of  other  items  like

housing  and other social benefits; then, of course,

the Federation Government would also consider itself

not  obliged  to  extend  these  facilities  to  our

citizens  as  of  grace  and they  will  perhaps  be

charged for their school fees there, as we may  well

charge Federal citizens for their school fees here.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are talking about movement of

labour and movement of education, and here he  says, oh  well,

if  we limit the question of free  school fees, then they can limit theirs.

It looks as though all is for our bonny blue eyes!





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am a little persistent, as

Unfortunately you may have found -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr David Marshall: Mr Speaker, it is very important.

What  about the question of workers - no question  of

grace  - apart from Government employment?  Will  the

citizens  of Singapore be able as heretofore  to  go

into  the  Federation freely? Will they be  able  to

obtain  private  employment without  limitation  and

vice versa in so far as the Federation is concerned?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: That is so, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

There  is  no  intention whatsoever to prohibit  the

flow of labour one way or the other. But the proviso

is included because we want to make provision for  a

situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



in  which  we  may well have to refuse  to  shoulder

responsibilities  which may be more  than  what  our

State finances can hear should the flow turn into  a

flood.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what the Constitution has, Mr Speaker?

- there will be freedom of movement of labour?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this and I trust you will forgive me if for

a  few moments I draw attention to the future. There

is a Chinese proverb. It says if you push a tiger to

the wall, he must turn. It is not wise, Mr Speaker,

to  push  the  people of Singapore  into  isolation.

These matters are now part of the Constitution and I

am  here  before you not to indulge in the farce  of

adopting or rejecting, but of pleading that  in  the

years to come, this antagonism of the Federation  to

Singapore  -  no doubt largely sparked  off  by  the

distaste  for the P.A.P. personalities - will  soften

and  they  will  recognise the  importance  of  real

integration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, never in the history of humanity has there been an opportunity like this one, where vast masses of radically different races - and I say radically different ethnic groups because it is not merely a question of a Belgian and a German who are basically the same ethnic group, but it is the question of the Mongolian race, the proto-Malays,

the  Dravidians massively divided ethnic groups - for

the  first  time  in the history of humanity  coming

together for the purposes of integrated co-operation

in  building up common loyalties, a common  destiny,

which  can  only  be done in the reality  of  inter-racial  respect and harmony. It is a  phrase  and  a

principle, which is recognised by  millions,  which

has been propagated from a thousand pulpits, but  it

has  never  really been put into effect, never,  Mr

Speaker, in such a massive form as we will  have  to

try and put it. For our own sake and for the sake of

humanity,   I   say  this,  Mr   Speaker,   in   no

chauvinistic  spirit: that this is a pioneer  effort

in  the  service of humanity, that we should succeed

in  making it workable for radically distinct ethnic

groups  to integrate. We have reached the  stage  in

human  development that if such an  experiment  does

not  succeed,  there  is very little  hope  for  the

survival of humanity as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that when calm reigns again and the

irritant of the presence of the evil spirit  of  the

P.A.P. no longer dominates the scene, and I mean  in

the  near future, Mr Speaker, there should be  very

serious  review of these provisions. The  people  of

Singapore   are   a   decent,   peaceable,   and   a

tremendously valuable people. It would be a  tragedy

to us, primarily to the Federation and to the world,

if  we  should be driven into a position  which  can

engender  only bitterness, frustration and the  itch

to  retaliation, for it is on those sentiments  that

Communism  thrives, and it is measures of  isolation

of our people that would encourage Communist growth.

When  you  have no hope left, Mr Speaker, and  your

back  is to the wall. You cannot blame human  beings

for   grabbing  foolishly  at  passing   expedients,

because  they  have  not the  time  to  wait  for  a

generation   or  two  generations   to   see   these

inequalities dissolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I turn to another aspect. First,

our  citizenship cheapened, and now  our  rice  bowl

destroyed. I want to speak about the Customs  Union,

Mr Speaker, a subject on which there seems to be  a

certain  shyness to tell the truth. The  Member  for

Farrer  Park says, "I am not in a position  to  talk

about  a Customs Union and the free port status."  I

am  a  little disappointed because I would say  with

respect,  that with the facts before him and  if  he

had  read  the Rueff Report he, as well  as  others,

should be in a position to express views which could

be of assistance to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before I start, I want to read two curious documents. The first is by the Prime Minister of Singapore, not last century, not four years ago, not last year, but last month. I quote from a copy of our Official Report which you have not even had the time to print being Vol. 20, No. 6. The date is 10th of June, last month. It seems ages

ago. Last month - a solemn promise that they will not

seek  a Customs Union, and today a Customs Union  it

is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker. I asked a question on a

Ministerial Statement at page 8 [col. 621]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, I would inquire from the Prime

Minister   whether  he  does  not  think   it   more

appropriate that we should have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



White  Paper? Would he consider publishing  a  White

Paper  together  with the memoranda referred  to  by

him,  and  particularly, Sir, in view  of  the  very

grave connotations to that statement of his, that  a

common  market  has been agreed upon,  which  rather

suggests  not  a common market, Sir, but  a  Customs

Union  [it  is curious that I should have  had  that

suspicion  in my bones]; and whether he  would  also

publish  the  Rueff Report for which  we  have  been

anxiously  awaiting,  so that  we  should  be  in  a

position with some responsibility and seriousness to

consider  a matter gravely affecting our future.  It

should  not be taken so hurriedly, Sir.  This  is  a

matter for study and I would urge the Prime Minister

to  indicate  whether he would consider  the  urgent

publication of a White Paper with the memoranda  and

the  details  he has given, and other  details  that

might help us, together with the Rueff Report.'



<br><br>Page 9 [col. 622] - Mr Speaker, I would like you  to

follow  me in case I stopped for a moment  and  left

it. One-third of the way down:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I say the House can have my assurance that we

will not move, and in fact we have no right to move,

from  the  terms of the White Paper which  had  been

voted upon by the people [of Singapore] unless there

is  definitely  a  quid pro quo.  ...  The  detailed

recommendations of the Common Market  are  contained

in the Rueff Report. It will have to be gone through

by  the  officials. But I can assure the Member  for

Anson  that  nothing  would give  me  more  pleasure

eventually  when negotiations have been successfully

concluded than to publish them in toto and  I  think

he, and even more so the merchants who have built  a

valuable and lucrative trade over the years  on  the

basis  of  our free port, will have a great interest

in seeing that all this does not disappear...'.



<br><br>Please notice this, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... and even more so the merchants who have built a

valuable and lucrative trade over the years  on  the

basis  of  our free port, will have a great interest

in  seeing that all this does not disappear  in  the

chase  of a will-o'-the-wisp for a common market.  I

think  he can take the assurance of my Minister  for

Finance, who has met these merchants, that there  is

no such sudden disappearance of our free port at all

under contemplation.'.



<br><br>So we will not chase the will-o'-the-wisp. We do not

intend to have a Customs Union. This is genuinely  a

free port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, one other curious document because the

Singapore Chamber of Commerce, which is not the Singapore  Chamber

of  Commerce  but  the  European Chamber  of Commerce, has come out

with a  statement supporting  the P.A.P. and saying what  a  wonderful idea this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



Customs  Union  is.  Have you  to  hand,  Sir,  this

Legislative Assembly Paper No. 9 of 1962? If I might

refer  to pages C3 and C4. This Legislative Assembly

Paper  No.  9  of  1962 is a Report  of  the  Select

Committee  on  the  Tariff Advisory  Commission  and

Customs  (Amendment) Bills. Representation was  made

to this Committee by the Joint Standing Committee of

the   Chambers   of  Commerce  of   Singapore.   The

representation is dated the 5th June, 1962, one year

ago. Mr Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chambers of Commerce of Singapore have been

on record on a number of occasions expressing a very

strong  view that protective duties of any kind  are

in  general undesirable and they would be  reluctant

to  readily  accept the new Ordinance which  goes  a

long  way  to make permanent the existing  machinery

hitherto  established for the purpose of considering

and  promulgating duties on imported goods  when  in

the  first  place  they had been unhappy  about  the

original law on the subject.'.



<br><br>That  is  the second paragraph of the representation

of  the Joint Chambers of Commerce of Singapore. The

third paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chambers of Commerce have always been deeply

concerned  with  any  proposals  which  may  have  a

damaging effect on the free port status of Singapore

and  the entrepot trade on which the State is  to  a

great extent dependent. The need to industrialise is

clearly  understood by the Chambers, but  they  have

always  held  the view that any question  of  duties

should be considered as and when the need arises...'.



<br><br>That  is  from  the  Singapore  Joint  Chambers   of

Commerce  in June 1962. And, Sir, the Memorandum  of

Heads  of Agreement in respect of which we  had  the

merger referendum. Article 17 has been read to  you,

Mr  Speaker. I want you to reiterate  that  it  was

there  enshrined that this Constitution was  subject

to  the  maintenance  of the  free  port  status  of

Singapore  and that the Constitution  would  not  be

changed  except  with the concurrence  of  both  the

Singapore and Federal Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at Cmd. 22 of 1963.



<br><br>Article IX:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The provisions of Annex J to this Agreement

relating to Common Market and financial arrangements

shall constitute an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



Agreement  between the Government of the  Federation

of Malaya and the Government of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not written on the back of an envelope. It is

formally  embodied as part of the Constitution.  And

what  is  this document, Annex J? Our copy does  not

even have an index but you will find it at page 226.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, there are two kinds of duties

envisaged  in Annex J. One is called the  protective

duty,  that  is  to say, a duty on industrial  goods

intended  for the purpose of encouraging  industries

in  Malaysia and not for revenue. If you are  aware,

Mr  Speaker,  we have in Singapore  two  protective

duties,   soap   and   paints.  Because   they   are

manufactured  in  Singapore and so to  protect  them

against  competition by countries which have  better

manufacturing  abilities  and  wider   markets   and

therefore  able to produce more cheaply,  we  put  a

duty  on soap and paints coming in, in order to help

our industries to grow and stabilise themselves. But

I  would  like you to notice, Mr Speaker,  that  in

Annex  J,  and  when you read the Rueff  Report  the

emphasis  is  on  the  greater  prosperity  to   the

Federation   of  Malaya,  not  Malaysia,   but   the

Federation   Government,   by   the   extension   of

protective duties because they would have a  50  per

cent increased market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are wealthier than the Federation in per capita

income,  and  consequently our purchasing  power  is

greater.  So the provisions are not merely  for  the

protection  of  Singapore industries,  but  for  the

protection  also of Federation industries.  That  is

fair  enough, Sir, if it works out equitably because

the  prosperity  of the Federation is  naturally  to

some  extent,  I hope, ours. The question  is:  what

assurances  have  we that, in fact,  our  industries

will be enabled to establish themselves? There is  a

provision to which your attention has been drawn  in

Article  1  (3), that the Federation  can  introduce

duties  in  respect  of Singapore produced  products

because Singapore at the present moment and for five

years to come will not be subject to revenue duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second thing I want to point out, Mr

Speaker, is that for these five



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



years Singapore shall not resist the introduction of

revenue  duties  except if it is necessary  for  the

protection  of  her entrepot trade.  If  it  is  not

necessary for her entrepot trade, then we  shall  be

subjected  to  the same customs duties  for  revenue

purposes as the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing I want you to notice, Mr Speaker,

is  that for the first five years, if any duty  that

the  Federation introduces we consider is not merely

for  our  benefit, but would endanger  our  entrepot

trade,  then we may ask for 12 months' grace and  no

more. It is fair enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we come to Article 4 (4) of Annex J.

There,   contrary   to  the  specific   and   urgent

recommendation  of  the  Rueff  Report,  the  Tariff

Advisory  Board  is given authority to  review,  not

protective duties, but revenue duties. I shall  show

you  in  the Rueff Report that they urged  that  the

Tariff Advisory Board should have nothing to do with

revenue duties. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Before 31st December, 1968, the Tariff Advisory

Board  shall review the revenue duties in  force  at

that  time  in  Singapore and in  the  remainder  of

Malaysia  and  shall make recommendations  regarding

the  amendment  of such duties or the imposition  of

additional  duties. As from 1st January,  1969,  the

Singapore  Government shall be entitled to  withhold

its  consent to the imposition of revenue  ... duty

[only if we pay ransom money]'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under the White Paper we pay already $135

million,  40 per cent of which, we are told  in  the

correspondence  and published documents,  is  really

far in excess of what the Government is entitled  to

under  the  White  Paper Command  33  of  1961.  But

certainly  nowhere  in  the  White  Paper   is   the

Federation   Government   entitled   to   additional

revenue,  because  we  think  the  introduction   of

revenue duties would destroy our entrepot trade. And

after 1968, five years from hence, if the Federation

Government says, as it says, Sir, in Article 4 (1) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In formulating its policy relating to the

harmonisation   of  revenue  duties,   the   Federal

Government   shall   pay   due   regard    to    any

representations made...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if after 1968, they, say, want to impose a

duty  on  sugar because there is a duty on sugar  in

the Federation and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



we  have  a very large export market in sugar,  then

assuming   that  the  duty  on  sugar  consumed   in

Singapore  would yield $50 million, we have  to  pay

the  Federation 40 per cent of the revenue we do not

earn in order to buy off the imposition of that duty

every  year. This we have to do, Mr Speaker,  in  a

consistently  running-down economy,  loans  of  $150

million  already  made  from  our  exchequer:   $135

million or more annually made to the Federation; our

cost  of  living  going  up  as  a  result  of   the

imposition of duties; our harbour facilities running

down  because our free port status is being  eroded.

We have to pay these additional sums of money by way

of ransom to maintain our survival. But this is only

for a period of seven years. There is no grace after

1975. After 1975 there will be one common tariff for

both protective duties and revenue duties throughout

Malaysia.  The greatest port in Asia - Singapore  - 70

million  tons of shipping, 2 million tons  of  cargo

annually,   the   second  greatest   port   in   the

Commonwealth, the fifth greatest port in  the  whole

world,  for 140 years of development of this concept

of  free  trade,  free port, we have  grown  and  we

support  our population. The Government has reminded

us  often enough when jeering at the Barisan that we

have no assets under the earth, no tin, no gold,  we

have  no agriculture to speak of, we have no fishery

to  speak of. Our basic source of employment is  our

port.  Mr  Speaker, until the Member for  Hong  Lim

spoke.  I  was not aware that there is  anywhere  in

history any legend or incident to indicate that  the

leading  citizen of any State sold the pass  to  his

own State and destroyed his own people. And this  is

the  work,  Mr  Speaker, of two  people,  hence  my

motion  -  the  Prime Minister and the Minister  for

Finance  -  because I shall prove to you that  until

they left for London on the 25th of June, there  was

not  a  word,  there was nothing  about  the  common

market. They had not even got the Rueff Report. They

had  not  even time to consult their own Party;  so,

for  a change. I cannot blame the P.A.P. except  the

Prime  Minister and the Minister for  Finance.  Now,

Mr Speaker, are they ignorant? Did they do this -

Report  was not published until after we left London

but  we had the preliminary report which, except for

drafting  errors,  was  identical  with  the   final

report? As I see the Rueff Report, it was sent  from

Washington to the Prime Minister on the 2nd of  July

according to published documents and that  was  some

10  days  after  he  left Singapore.  When  did  his

Cabinet  have time to consider it? But I was saying,

Sir,  is  it  through ignorance that this Government

has  by this deed destroyed the free port status?  I

well  remember, Mr Speaker, only last  Friday,  the

Deputy Prime Minister rose in anger and, pointing at

the   Member   for   Cairnhill,  said,   through   a

misunderstanding. "You cannot have a  nomination  of

15  people from this Assembly. You have not got  the

mandate of the people for such a thing." Mandate  of

the  people!  If there is anything that  requires  a

mandate  of the people, it is so basic a  change  in

the  pattern of our economy. What mandate have  they

got?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister has made

his point. Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I talk of the destruction of our

free port status, and he talks of a Common Market. I

talk of a Customs Union, and he says I mean a Common

Market. He already said. Mr Speaker, and I read  to

you  the  speech of the Prime Minister. "We have  no

intention  of  chasing  the  will-o'-the-wisp,   and

destroying our present position of a free  port."  I

am  not  talking of a Common Market. We are  all  in

agreement with the concept of a Common Market, which

means, in the context of Singapore as a free port, a

certain erosion of the principles of a free port for

the  purpose of protective duties, which is  clearly

enunciated.  They understand what  I  mean.  Revenue

duties  have nothing to do with a Common  Market  as

conceived for Singapore and never had, and since  he

refers  to his Five-Year Plan, let me refer to  some

of his own utterances. I have already shown you that

despite  their  Five-Year Plan where they  say  they

want  to destroy -the free port, they did in Article

17  of Command 33 of 1961 say, "The free port status

of Singapore will be enshrined in the Constitution."

Now  let us look at the speech of His Excellency the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the 31st of October, 1961,

at  Volume 15. Column 10. That is a speech,  as  you

will   appreciate.  Mr  Speaker,  written  by   the

Government,  and those aspects dealing with  finance

written  by  the Finance Minister. This  is  talking

about the merger:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merchants want a merger under conditions under

which  our free port status and our free trade  with

all  countries  will continue, and under  which  our

trading  links with the whole world will  remain  as

they have been free and easy.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



That  is  31st October, 1961 - "under which our  free

port  status  and our free trade with all  countries

will  continue". You will appreciate therefore  that

on the merger debate, nobody was disturbed about the

free  port  status of Singapore. We had it enshrined

in Article 17 of the White Paper. We had it from the

mouth of His Excellency in the inaugural speech, and

I  was the only one who made passing reference to it

at  column 571 of Volume 15, No. 7 of 23rd November,

1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fifth reason given by the Government in His

Excellency's policy speech is that the merchants  of

Singapore want a continuance of our free port status

and  maintenance of our trade with the whole  world.

Sir,  it is almost unbelievable. I refuse to believe

that this Government is not aware that there is such

a  State as the State of Penang. I refuse to believe

that  this Government is not aware that Penang is  a

free  port  by  virtue  of  a  small  part  of   the

Federation  Customs Ordinance. I refuse  to  believe

that  this Government is not conscious of  the  fact

that  the  free  port status of Singapore  could  be

fully protected under complete merger. So how is  it

that   they  have  the  audacity  to  say,  in   His

Excellency's  speech,  that  the  interests  of  the

merchants  who want a continuance of our  free  port

status and maintenance of our trade relations cannot

be protected under a complete merger?'



<br><br>That  was  the only reference, Mr Speaker,  in  all

those  agonising speeches on His Excellency's speech

and on the merger, about free port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we leave merger and we come to the Annual

Budget  Statement. The Annual Budget Statement  made

by  the  Minister for Finance to this House  on  the

20th  November, 1961, at Volume 15,  No.  10,  dated

28th November, 1961, column 815, paragraph 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We in Singapore live in a tight economic

situation.  We  are a small island  State  which  is

prosperous   because  of  our  central  geographical

position. This allows us to render services of value

to  our  neighbours. Through the port  of  Singapore

passes  much  of  the produce of the  Federation  of

Malaya, Indonesia and Borneo. In addition, we  serve

as  a supply base for the consumer goods which these

territories  need. This is the main  source  of  our

livelihood. We will continue to earn this livelihood

so long as we provide these services efficiently and

so long as we are on good terms with our neighbours.

But  when neither of these things obtains, then this

principal source of our livelihood may shrivel.  And

this will bring in its train poverty and destitution

for us.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



So  if our entrepot trade shrivels, it brings in its

train  poverty  and  destitution.  And  I  say,  Mr

Speaker, that that is what is provided by Annex J in

the  provision of the destruction of our  free  port

status.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whatever our differences in political outlook may

be  we must refrain from such action that would lead

to  the ruin of our country through hostility of our

neighbours  or  the  running down  of  our  business

organisations.'



<br><br>Who is providing for the running down of our port?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Then in Vol. 16, No. 1, dated, 15th

January,  1962, column 33, we have the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Ministry of Finance - not  that  ne

pretends to be an authority, in fairness to him - but

this  was  the speech that he had prepared and  this

was   in  dealing  with  the  Customs  (Dumping  and

Subsidies) Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I can assure the House that the powers given

under   this  Bill  will  be  used  with  care   and

discrimination. In an entrepot economy such as ours,

import duties should be introduced only when  it  is

established beyond doubt that the gain to the  State

in terms of employment, national income and economic

growth  outweighs any possible loss to the  entrepot

trade.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was disturbed even by this Bill,

and if you will look at the next column, I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore has a century-old tradition of being a

free  port.  Again  and again, we have  often  heard

legitimate requests for the imposition of duties  to

protect  the  establishment or even the survival  of

existing industries, and we have repeatedly resisted

these  requests until very recently, because we  are

conscious  that once you introduce the thin  end  of

the wedge and start imposing duties on imports, that

tradition  which is of such value to us will  slowly

evaporate and Singapore will lose much of its  trade

and goodwill.'



<br><br>Now  let  us look at the Finance Minister  again  in

reply at column 36, in the final paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Everyone, of course, is aware of the importance

of  the free port status of Singapore and no one  in

his   senses  would  want  that  free  port   status

destroyed.'

Were the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance

in  their senses when they signed that agreement  of

9th July, 1963?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have

received  discourtesy once in return. I will  repeat

it, Mr Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Everyone, of course, is aware of the importance

of  the free port status of Singapore and no one  in

his   senses  would  want  that  free  port   status

destroyed.'



<br><br>Is  that  free  port destroyed or not  destroyed  by

Annex J of Command 22 of 1963!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. Not destroyed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have reached

the  stage - and I say this with respect - that  what

is  said  in this House moves nobody in this  House;

that  as  his  Leader once said, "I am  with  Humpty

Dumpty. A word means what I say it means." The Japan

ese  did it to us when we were their prisoners. They

used words like "justice" and "fair play". They  had

not  a  clue what they meant. So he can say, "It  is

not  destroyed." It is there for all to  read,  that

within  five years we shall have all the  protective

duties, and at the end of five years all the revenue

duties.  And  if  we  want to buy  off  the  revenue

duties,  we  have  got  to  pay  ransom - ransom   not

provided for in the White Paper - and at the  end  of

12  years there is not any ransom. Finished - that  is

the end of your free port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talk, Sir, of Blakang Mati. I understand it

is a very salubrious area for a cemetery; maybe that

is  where  they intend to have the cemetery  of  our

free trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At column 38, if I might tax your indulgence, Mr

Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At the same time, we must take into account the

demands of the free port, [this is still the Finance

Minister  of the free port] and where any particular

instance   of   a   request  for  the   levying   of

countervailing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



duties  arises, the Government will be in a position

to  make  the necessary calculations of  profit  and

loss  to  strike a proper balance sheet, and,  after

all  relevant factors have been taken into  account,

to  make the proper decision in the interests of the

people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at col. 735, No. 8 of Volume 17. Now, we

are  discussing the Tariff Advisory Commission  Bill

and  the  date  is  17th April  of  last  year.  The

Minister for Finance is still the Minister of a free

port:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, our entrepot trade has brought prosperity to

Singapore and will continue to do so -'.



<br><br>Will continue to do so! Column 736:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, our brief experience in protective

tariff  has shown that the effects could be  reduced

to  a minimum or even be eliminated if tariff duties

are  imposed  with due care on selected  commodities -'.



<br><br>The  Government has two imported articles, Sir.  One

of them was soap, another was paint. One of them was

introduced only a month before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at col. 749, he admits, Sir, that this Tariff

Advisory Commission is a radical departure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this is a basic

departure  from  the  laissez-faire  policy  of  the

State.'



<br><br>Has  he  got  the right to indulge  in  so  basic  a

departure without a mandate from the people, even if

it  is  for our benefit which he knows is not  true?

Mr  Speaker,  it is appropriate at  this  juncture,

because  this  is  on the Tariff Advisory  Bill,  to

remind  you that the Select Committee on the  Tariff

Advisory Commission Bill in its Report of L.A. 9  of

1962 put in that memorandum, to which I referred, in

which  the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore  placed

on  record a number of occasions expressing  a  very

strong  view that protective duties of any kind  are

in  general  undesirable  and  that  they  would  be

reluctant to accept. That was only a year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us come back to modern times. After

all,  it  is  a P.A.P. promise of a year  ago  - they

break  their  promises of today  - is  it  unfair  to

expect  them to keep a promise of last year? Let  us

look at the 5th April, 1963, Volume 20, No. 2. It is

a rich volume,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



Sir.  This  is  only three and a  half  months  ago,

column  44; this is the Prime Minister in answer  to

me:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr David Marshall asked the Prime Minister

whether,   in   the  context  of   the   terms   for

incorporation of the Borneo territories in Malaysia,

the  Singapore Government has made or will  consider

making  representations for any  alteration  in  the

conditions   for  the  incorporation  of   Singapore

contained in Paper Command 33 of 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Singapore Government

consider it unwise and against the interests of  the

people  of Singapore in any way to depart  from  the

published  terms and conditions for merger contained

in  the White Paper and amplified or amended by  the

formal   exchange  of  letters  between  the   Prime

Minister of the Federation and myself.'



<br><br>In this Constitution is Annex J not a departure from

the published terms and conditions? Let me add, Sir,

what  the  Prime Minister said, and  these  are  his

words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any departure from these terms will make it

necessary to have the whole matter redebated and re-endorsed.'



<br><br>At  column  47,  because I was being persistent,  he

says, at column 47:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are insisting - not only asking - on fair play.

I  think the city of Singapore that has thrived  for

over  100  years  under solemnity of  contract  will

appreciate  the  point that a contract  having  been

made  has  to  be honoured. In this  case,  for  the

reasons  I  have enumerated, we feel - regardless  of

what the Member for Anson feels - that the people  of

Singapore  are  with us on this,  that  it  is  mere

important  we control our finances and  retain  more

than  three-quarters  of our  revenue  and  pay  our

contribution  to  the centre and have  15  seats  as

agreed  than  to reopen any of those items,  running

the   risk   thereby  of  reopening  the   financial

arrangements which have already been agreed.'



<br><br>A solemnity of contract; unwise to make any changes.

Let  us come to even more recent times, Mr Speaker,

and  this time we come to the realm of the Unrevised

transcript, Volume 20, page 5. The date is not  last

century.  It is last month - 7th June, 1963.  Can  so

much happen in so little a time? We are told that no

man  is  in his senses wants to see the end  of  the

free  port trade. Now, we are told that it does  not

really matter, it is the end of the free port, it is

a  common market. Mr Speaker, at page 49, and  this

is the Annual Budget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



Speech of the Finance Minister [col. 554]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Another peculiarity of Singapore is the complete

absence  of  natural resources, but this  factor  is

more  than  balanced  by  our  central  geographical

position,  our  excellent natural  harbour  and  our

talented and energetic population.'



<br><br>How well argued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Because of this, the most important pursuit in

Singapore is trade and its related occupations, such

as banking, shipping and transportation. Singapore's

pre-eminence as a trading centre of South-East  Asia

is known to all of us and is not a matter upon which

I need elaborate.'



<br><br>Yes,  then,  Sir, at the bottom of that  page  [col.

556]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First, we should maintain and develop the

traditional   strongpoints  of  the   economy,   our

trading,   banking,   shipping  and   communications

services which have sustained our entrepot trade.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, may I remind you that this is under the heading "State Development Plan" and this was  given on the 7th of June, last month:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would be an error to take measures -'



<br><br>No, let me read it again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First, we should maintain and develop the

traditional   strongpoints  of  the   economy,   our

trading,   banking,   shipping  and   communications

services which have sustained our entrepot trade.'



<br><br>And  now,  I will go slowly, I hope the Interpreters

have it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would be an error to take measures harmful to

our  established economic functions in the quest  of

something new and uncertain.'



<br><br>That  is  the  Finance Minister, this  same  Finance

Minister, one and a half months ago, six weeks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would be an error to take measures harmful to

our  established economic functions in the quest  of

something new and uncertain.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Will you continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well, I will please him since he is

polite, Mr Speaker, Sir, certainly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Not only should we maintain and improve our

efficiency  as  a  trading centre,  but  also  other

established   lines,  particularly  our  agriculture

which consists mainly of market gardening and animal

husbandry, should also be improved.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



Now,  Sir,  I will read on from the same  speech  at

page  50 and this is under "Industrialisation".  Mr

Speaker, on this point I want to say something which

was    twice   repeated   in   the   Rueff   Report.

Industrialisation  as  a  balanced  aspect  of   the

economy of a State is valuable. Industrialisation as

the sum total of a State activity is pernicious.  It

has  tremendous social evils. Now, let me read [col.

557]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First what can Singapore hope to do by way of

industrialisation?  A  large  nation  with   a   big

population  and  an extensive land  area  with  many

natural resources can afford to experiment with high

cost  industries  set  up  under  a  prohibition  of

imports  or  a high tariff wall. Such a country  can

allow these high cost industries to survive even  if

the  industries  are  not  efficient  in  the  first

instance,  by passing on the increased cost  to  the

consumer.  Industrialisation on these lines  can  be

rapid and spectacular if it is pressed forward  with

sufficient energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, however, lacks the pre-requisites for

such  an  endeavour,  namely,  a  large  population,

varied  natural resources and extensive  land  area.

This   being   the  case,  our  plan  of  industrial

expansion  must  be more circumspect and  judicious.

Particularly as our economy still rests so  much  on

trade, enforced industrialisation at the expense  of

trade  can be an uncertain gamble with such a  small

domestic market as we have.'



<br><br>Are  we  going  to be told, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that

enforced  industrialisation at the expense of  trade

is  now  a  certain gamble because we have increased

our   domestic  market?  Not  by  five   times   the

population.  That  is not what is  relevant  but  by

twice the purchasing power of the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Four times.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is what we are going to be

told. Now, Sir, I go on to column 562, last sentence

on Common Market:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As I have stated before this House on previous

occasions,  there would be no difficulty  whatsoever

in  getting  agreement on a common market  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya if we were prepared  to  join

them  in a full-scale customs union. This means that

we  shall  have to introduce in Singapore  the  same

tariff  scales as in the Federation of  Malaya.  The

trouble  about this proposal is that, while it  will

give a decided impetus to industrial growth, it will

also  dislocate  the entrepot trade to  a  dangerous

extent.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the same Finance Minister who said that.

This was the 7th of June. We can have  a common market if we agree

to a customs union  but  a customs union, though it will give an impetus

to our common market, will dislocate our trade.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I might in fairness finish it,

Mr  Speaker, a complete customs union is  therefore

not  a  feasible  proposition for Singapore  at  the

present juncture.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Exactly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> How would the common market affect

trade and industry in Singapore? The first point  to

be  noted  is  that protective tariffs in  Singapore

will  apply only to manufactures and not to tropical

raw  materials which form the greater  part  of  our

entrepot  trade.  So  that the traditional  entrepot

trade  in rubber, copra, coffee, tea, spices, jungle

produce  and  other goods will not  in  any  way  be

affected by a common market, and that is the  common

market we support. Mr Speaker. Let us use our terms

even if he thinks he can confuse those in the coffee-shop.  Let us here use our terms with precision  and

know  what we are talking about. A common market  is

intended  for purely protective duties  as  defined,

protective  duties to protect our industrial  growth

in  order  to  increase employment and  not  revenue

duties.  This, Mr Speaker, was on the 7th  of  June

last month and I love that phrase, I could not have

put it better:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- that, while a common customs will give a decided

impetus to industrial growth, it will also dislocate

the  entrepot  trade to a dangerous  extent  and  it

would be a dangerous gamble.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will forgive me, if I refer to it only

briefly again. Our Prime Minister on the 10th  June,

when I said to him that his statement about a common

market sounded very much like a customs union  - this

is not on the record



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



- but  the Minister for Finance shook his head in  so

vigorous  a fashion that even if the Prime  Minister

had  not  replied, I would have been  satisfied.  He

shook his head decidedly and endorsed what the Prime

Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... I can assure the Member for Anson that

nothing would give me more pleasure eventually  when

negotiations  have been successfully concluded  than

to  publish  them in row, and I think he,  and  even

more so the merchants who have built a valuable  and

lucrative trade over the years on the basis  of  our

free port, will have a great interest in seeing that

all  this does not disappear in the chase of a will-o'-the-wisp for a common market.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, they will tell you, "But, oh

yes,  this is a thing of the past." I have read  the

Prime Minister's speech, "We had eight good men  and

true  come  to  Malaya and they  have  produced  the

report."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Speaker, I want to remind you that,

according  to the report, Mr Rueff had  exactly  16

days in Malaya, a large part of which was engaged in

social functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing about this Rueff Report - I do not

know  whether  it  makes it a unique  document,  but

certainly a very curious document, Mr Speaker.  You

will  remember that we repeatedly asked for a common

market,  and  finally the Minister for Finance  said

that  it  was  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation who was using his influence to get a very

important  official  from the  World  Bank.  Why  we

ourselves  could not do it, I do not know.  So  this

was  the choice of the Deputy Prime Minister of  the

Federation  and  he came for 16 days,  although  the

rest  of them spent some more time in travelling  to

Borneo and other territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I want to draw your attention to is

this.  According to the first page, this report  was

not    sent   to   the   International   Bank    for

Reconstruction until the 25th of June. How was it in

the hands of our Government before that - in draft or

otherwise? It was on the 2nd July, Mr Speaker, that

the   International  Bank  for  Reconstruction   and

Development sent it from Washington.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when a report is made under the aegis of the World Bank, the World Bank usually indicates its approval or disapproval of the recommendations, and a very curious feature of this report is contained in paragraph 3 of the letter of the President of this World Bank under date of 2nd July. I will read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This report has not been given to the Executive

Directors of the International Bank arid it has  not

been  reviewed in detail by the Management. For this

reason,  the  Report as transmitted  represents  the

views  of  the  Mission  rather  than  the  positive

recommendations of the Bank.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very delightful, courteous and diplomatic way of

saying,  "Well, look, we don't know about  this.  We

don't think we agree with it, but here it is in your

lap."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This is the custom of the World

Bank in all their reports.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is very interesting, Mr Speaker,

that  they  should  find it necessary  to  say  that

specifically,  "For  this  reason,  the  report   as

transmitted  represents the  views  of  the  Mission

rather than positive recommendations of the Bank."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come to the views of the Mission - not

approved by the International Bank. I would like  to

start  off with paragraph 4, Sir, and before  I  do,

permit  me  just one word. 150 years  of  trial  and

error  have  built  up  an  economy  that  has  made

Singapore  the greatest port in all Asia - the  fifth

largest  in  the  world  - on  which  our  population

subsists.  And I say to you, Mr Speaker. Sir,  that

even  if  Rueff  was the Archangel Gabriel  and  his

eight  other members came from the same  domain,  we

should view with some zealous scrutiny and care  any

recommendations  which suggest a  radical  departure

from  our  pattern of economy. But when  we  realise

that  they are human beings, albeit experts in their

fashion  who can err, how much more care  should  we

give  in  considering  their  recommendations,   and

particularly,   not  merely  in  considering   their

recommendations, but in seeking, Mr Speaker, to  go

even  beyond their recommendations, radically beyond

their recommendations, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



respect of this departure from our free port status?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Trade, transport and other services account for

nearly 70 per cent of employment in Singapore, about

30 per cent in Malaya...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 22 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Trying to skip that?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In paragraph 31, Mr Speaker, if you

will  read it through, you will find that the entire

concept of a Common Market is based on what he calls

in  the  last two lines, "the increased mobility  of

manpower  which,  despite some  limitations,  should

characterize the new Federation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there increased mobility of manpower in view of

the  documents  before us? And this is  one  of  the

bases of their recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 34 - I am grateful to Members who are

patient enough to listen -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Moreover, in the case of Malaysia, it is

essential  that tariff policies not  be  used  in  a

manner  which would unduly raise the cost of primary

production  or disrupt the entrepot trade.  For  the

economy  will  continue to depend  very  heavily  on

these sources of income and employment.'



<br><br>That  is  not  only us. These are  words  which  the

Federation  may well listen to. Do not  disrupt  the

entrepot  trade  of Singapore. Your  own  prosperity

depends upon it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you will look at paragraph 36 and that

part just towards the bottom:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the most important case being that of Singapore,

where preservation of the entrepot trade requires  a

great deal of precaution.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is their God, Mr Rueff:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`39 (b) In the States which will form Malaysia,

the   main  sources  of  income  consist  today   of

agriculture  and  forestry, mining and  trade.  This

includes the entrepot trade of States like Singapore

and Penang. In the interest of Malaysia, as well  as

of  the  industries  which  may  wish  to  establish

themselves  within its market, it is essential  that

these   existing   activities  be   encouraged   and

safeguarded.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You notice, Mr Speaker, "in the interest of

Malaysia," not only for Singapore. "in the  interest

of Malaysia, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



well  as  of  the  industries  which  may  wish   to

establish  themselves  within  its  market,  it   is

essential   that   these  existing   activities   be

encouraged  and  safeguarded.  Disregard  of   their

requirements  would  only  destroy  the   favourable

effects  which new industry may have on  employment,

and impair the market or its products."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr Speaker, at paragraph 57 where the

P.A.P. out-Rueffs Rueff. Perhaps I should read  the

preceding paragraph 56:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As to new tariffs - whether protective or non-protective - a complication arises from the need to

protect  the  entrepot  trade.  Awareness  of   this

problem led to a statement in the Heads of Agreement

that the free port status of Singapore would not  be

changed   without  the  concurrence  of   both   the

Governments of the Federation and of that State. For

protective tariffs we suggest,' - I want you to notice

this,  please, Mr Speaker - `For protective  tariffs

only.' And this is their suggestion - `For protective

tariffs',   not  revenue  tariffs,  `For  protective

tariffs  we  suggest  , that,  subject  to  certain

safeguards, Singapore concur in advance  to  changes

in  its  free  port status which may  be  introduced

through  the  application of  such  tariffs',  - only

protective tariffs - `by the Federal Government after

receiving advice from the Tariff Board.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even poor Mr Rueff, on whose shoulders all

this  blame  is  being put, says,  "only  protective

tariffs."  I would recommend a change in  the  White

Paper provisions - not revenue duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then come to 57, the next paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We consider the uncertainties of the impact on

the   entrepot  trade  of  extending  non-protective

tariffs are too great to decide safely on any  fixed

schedule for harmonization now.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister with that arrogance

which  characterises the P.A.P., even in their  swan

song,  even in their death agonies, said, "We  would

be fools to think that we cannot in 12 years be able

to meet the whole impact of a customs union."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Mr Rueff says, and he is an economist, not just a blabberer, "We consider that the uncertainties of the impact on the entrepot trade of extending non-protective tariffs are too great to decide safely on any fixed schedule for harmonization now."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a fixed schedule for harmonization now,

Mr  Speaker? Pity the Minister for Finance  is  not

here. He will say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



"Rubbish!" But you have five years - 1968,  1975,  is

the   ultimate  swan  song,  the  death   agony   of

Singapore's free port, and it is in an exchange.  Is

that  what Rueff recommends? And the Prime  Minister

tells us that he will not chase the will-o'-the-wisp

for  the  common market, and we should be so  happy,

including  the Member for Anson. Now, Sir,  what  is

the  value  of manufacturing trade to Singapore?  In

paragraph  81, ii is stated that in 1961  the  total

income  of  Singapore from manufacturing  industries

was  14  per cent only, 14 per cent in Singapore,  6

per  cent in Malaya. Mr Speaker, Sir, let  us  face

it.  The  whole of Annex J is intended to  bring  an

impetus to Federation industries and I will be  only

too glad that they should have an impetus, because I

dread  the  thought  that Singapore  should  be  the

industrial   area   of  the  Federation   with   its

concomitant social evils. I myself do not believe in

industry, and only industry, as a salvation  of  our

economic  position.  I  certainly  believe  that  we

should  have  our  fair share of  industry.  So  in

respect  of  this 14 per cent, we are  to  take  the

gamble,  Mr Speaker. By the way, just a side-light,

would  you look at paragraph 83, because the  P.A.P.

has  been  saying  that since they  came  to  office

industries  have increased by leaps and bounds.  Mr

Rueff said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Singapore recent growth in manufacturing has

been  less  spectacular after buoyant  progress  has

been experienced in the 1950-57 period.'



<br><br>I hear nothing from the Front bench.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Anson

excites  a  reply or asks for a reply,  I  think  he

ought  to give way. If he does not ask for a  reply,

then,  of  course, he is entitled, if he so chooses,

not to give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not aware of having attempted

to excite a reply, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



But  I  thought  the opposite Front Bench  would  be

delighted  to  hear that phrase. That  manufacturing

had  a buoyant experience between the years 1950 and

1957.  But  we  will pass it. I do not know  whether

they are listening. Now we will go to paragraph 117.

You see at the top of page 41, Mr Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By creating a Malaysian Common Market the

Federation thus would retain the valuable  Singapore

market and, moreover, for all protected goods, would

increase the size of its protected market by over 50

per  cent. [Good luck to the Federation.] This would

allow  the  establishment in  the  Federation  of  a

number  of  industries for which  the  size  of  the

domestic market was hitherto inadequate for economic

production.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now paragraph 118:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The same is true in Singapore. In recent years

industrialisation has not made rapid  progress,  and

there  is  no  doubt  that the gradual  adoption  of

protective tariffs by the Federation has contributed

to  this slowdown. The existence of a tariff barrier

has  been an important factor in persuading a number

of  firms  to  establish plants  in  the  Federation

rather than in Singapore, and tariffs such as  those

on  paints,  soap  and  wire  mesh  have  restricted

Singapore access to the Federation market.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At paragraph 123:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, both Malaya and Singapore depend too

much on trade to be certain that the gains from  the

protection of infant industries will not  be  offset

by  a  possible reduction in the income derived from

export or entrepot trades.'



<br><br>Even in respect of protective tariffs he is worried,

and he says that you depend too much on trade to  be

certain  that  what  you gain from  employment  from

infant  industries  will not  be  offset  by  income

derived from export or entrepot trades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any significant increases in the cost of

production,  brought  about  by  protection,   could

weaken the competitive position of Malaysia's export

commodities.  In  the same way, the introduction  of

protective  tariffs could affect the  costs  of  the

services  rendered  by  traders  in  Singapore   and

Penang,  and  could conceivably create  difficulties

for  the entrepot trades. It is in fact the low cost

of  these  services  which  has  discouraged  direct

shipment   from  the  producing  to  the   consuming

countries,  and  which  has  enabled  Singapore  and

Penang to play the role of intermediaries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 126:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Expanded agricultural output on a commercial

basis  for  domestic consumption offers one  of  the

main  possibilities  for further diversification  of

the Malaysian economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



The  products  which  appear to have  a  significant

potential  include  fruits,  vegetables,  sugarcane,

maize,  livestock products and fish.  Common  market

arrangements  for  these products could  undoubtedly

serve   as   an  important  stimulus  to   Malaysian

production,  especially given the improved  long-run

prospects  for  marketing in Singapore, which  will

have  to import an increasing proportion of its food

requirements.'



<br><br>So  if you are told that our cost of living will not

go  up  very  much, remember, Mr Speaker,  that  in

future,  in order to protect Federation agriculture,

we  will  have  duty  on fruits, on  vegetables,  on

sugarcane, on maize, on livestocks and on fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, you remember I said to you that

the  Rueff Report recommended that the Tariff  Board

should  have nothing to do with revenue. It makes  a

special  paragraph for that. You  will  find  it  at

paragraph 150. But in Annex J that Tariff Board  has

the  power  to  apply  all  revenue  duties  of  the

Federation to us. Paragraph 150:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As was indicated above, the Tariff Board would be

called   upon  to  give  advice  with   respect   to

protective  tariffs, hut its jurisdiction  will  not

extend to non-protective tariffs.'.



<br><br>And   in   paragraph   156  he   pleads   that   his

recommendations  be considered as  a  whole  because

they  are  closely interrelated, and he particularly

emphasised   that  the  question  of  non-protective

duties  and  measures to safeguard the operation  of

the   entrepot  trade,  non-protective   duties   as

distinct from revenue duties, should not apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, in paragraph 158, just in

case there are some academicians who say that we  do

not have a free port on the other side, you will see

in  line  4: "Although Singapore enjoys a free  port

status." It is true, Mr Speaker, there has  been  a

very  mild  inroad over 140 years. We  have  tax  on

petrol,  on  alcohol  and  on  tobacco.  Those   are

revenue.  That is all. And in respect of  protective

duties we have soaps and paints. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At paragraph 160, you will find that he says what

in  fact  we heard the Minister for Finance  say  in

respect  of the speeches he made in the Budget.  Let

us have it for the record:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The existence of the free port, however,

encouraged  the  development of specialised  transit

and  entrepot operations which have become the  main

source of employment in both Singapore and Penang.'



<br><br>I  am hammering this - that the entrepot trade is the

main  source of employment and income, and  this  is

what they intend to banish to Blakang Mati.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, paragraph 161 is a long paragraph and I will not weary you. But would you agree that that sentence in the middle in fact epitomises it? They say that there are too many difficulties for a time- table and the words are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A final judgment will have to wait until more

experience has been gained in practice.'



<br><br>But  to the P.A.P., what does it matter if you  sell

out  Singapore? I do not know, Sir. Apart  from  the

example  put forward by the Member for Hong  Lim.  I

cannot understand how a human being can sell out his

own people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 167, again, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

third  time he hammers home: Do not have a  definite

time-table.  Let experience teach you. Let  me  read

it. It is not very long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Mission is of the opinion that the

application  of uniform tariff policies in  Malaysia

should proceed as rapidly as is consistent with  the

need  to preserve entrepot trade, which is and  will

continue  to  be an important source of  income  and

employment  for Malaysia. On the basis of  the  date

available, it is fairly obvious that five  years  at

least  will  be  required to put into operation  the

safeguards   and  procedures  which  are  considered

essential;'.



<br><br>That   is   for  the  protective  tariffs   we   are

discussing, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... on the other hand, it is not yet possible on

the  basis of such information, to determine whether

such  a  period  would be sufficient to  enable  the

traders  to  adjust themselves to new  circumstances

and to enable workers who may become redundant as  a

result  of  such adjustments to be absorbed  in  new

activities.  This  process  of  adjustment  will  be

governed  by  the  rate  at which  industrialization

progresses    and   the   common   market    becomes

established, and it is probable that, at the end  of

the  five-year period, the outstanding  difficulties

will  not  be  intractable.'



<br><br>That is in  respect  of

protective tariffs, not revenue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Uniform tariff policy, man!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Paragraph 168:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`These considerations have led the Mission to the

conclusion  that it would be wiser not to  take  any

decision at the present time, but to provide  for  a

review  which will be conducted at the  end  of  the

transitional period.'



<br><br>Now,  Mr  Speaker, if Annex J  had  ended  at  the

point  where it provides for a review, then it would

at  least have been in accordance with the spirit of

this paper. But Annex J goes on to fix a guillotine,

the  moment  for guillotine, and that is  the  fixed

time-table for the end of Singapore's 140 years' old

tradition of a free port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 183. I am nearing the end, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank God!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister for

little interjections will not make for order in this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am at paragraph 183:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For many years entrepot trade, as defined above,

was  one  of  the  main economic activities  of  the

original  Straits Settlements, and today it  remains

the  largest single source of income and  employment

in Singapore and in Penang.'



<br><br>That  is  what  these  snotty  urchins  are  playing

marbles  with  in  a  dirty  back  alley.  The  most

important   source  of  income  and  employment   in

Singapore and Penang:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although important year-to-year fluctuations have

taken  place, entrepot trade has grown in importance

since  the  early  1950's. It is  difficult  at  the

present time to determine what are the prospects  of

that type of trade in the near future.'



<br><br>I  want to stop there, Mr Speaker, because there is

no  doubt that the Minister for Finance, now that he

is  on the side of a customs union, is going to  say

that,  of  course, our entrepot trade  is  going  to

deteriorate  and  is  going  to  wither  away.   Mr

Speaker,  we are a department store at  the  cross-road  of an area which was a slump area; deep frozen

in  economic misery because the imperialists change;

they are, for the first time, beginning to thaw out,

to  be  conscious of their value of  their  own  raw

materials, to benefit by their raw materials, and to

be  conscious of their need for products  that  make

human  life  pleasant; and this  is  the  department

store  where  they  come  and  purchase.  As  those

countries grow in wealth,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



so  that department store must grow in wealth.  Left

alone,  Mr Speaker, in that policy of a free  port,

Singapore  must necessarily find itself  as  at  the

beginning of a golden era of trade, but at least Mr

Rueff recognises that since 1950 the entrepot trade,

far  from withering as is claimed by the P.A.P., has

improved and grown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have never claimed it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, paragraph 184:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the case of Singapore, the entrepot trade and

tourism together contribute about 20-25 per cent  of

the  national  product  and  it  is  estimated  that

entrepot trade employs directly about 70,000 persons

or  14  per  cent  of the labour  force;  [that  is,

directly]  but  indirect effects on  employment  and

national   income  are,  of  course,  much   higher.

Although  it  is  very difficult  to  ascertain  the

number of people employed in the entrepot trade,  as

distinct  from other forms of trading, there  is  no

doubt  that,  unless the necessary  precautions  are

taken, a change in the conditions in which trade  is

conducted  at  present may lead to  serious  adverse

effects on employment, if not on national income.'



<br><br>And  perhaps,  Mr Speaker, I should read  paragraph

204,  which it is my hope the Federation of Malaysia

Government  will become conscious  of  and  seek  to

implement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For Malaysia considered as a whole, the entrepot

trade of Singapore and Penang will continue to be  a

major  source  of  employment  and  income;  it   is

therefore  of  great importance, not  only  for  the

economy of Singapore or Penang, but also for that of

Malaysia,   that  the  volume  of  that   trade   be

maintained at its highest possible level,  and  that

the  adjustments which may be required  in  view  of

increased industrialization should be made  as  easy

and inexpensive as possible.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Mr Speaker, trespassed on the indulgence

of  this House for some considerable time in reading

passages from this report which we have received all

too   recently.  You  will  be  conscious  that  the

Government  places the whole force of its volte-face

in  respect  of  the free port of Singapore  on  the

shoulders of Mr Rueff and his colleagues.  It  was,

therefore,  imperative to disclose their  falsehoods

and  to  point  out  that Rueff and  his  colleagues

repeatedly  pleaded that there should  be  no  fixed

time-table, that we should learn by experience, and,

above all, that though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



we  should  introduce protective duties in Singapore

in  so far as it did not endanger our entrepot trade

and therefore the prosperity of Malaysia as a whole,

the  question  of revenue duty was something  apart.

They  talk of a Common Market just as they  talk  of

merger,   Mr   Speaker,  because  merger   was   on

everybody's   platform;  it   is   something   good,

something  I  believe  we  all  want  with  complete

sincerity. And, of course, a Common Market with  the

Federation  whereby certain inroads  into  our  free

port status are made not only for the benefit of our

industries   but  for  the  benefit  of   Malaysia's

industries  as  a whole, is a legitimate  aspiration

which  we  should all support. If this  Paper  dealt

only with protective duty, though there seems to  be

a  somewhat  rapid - a frantically rapid - attempt  at

the  introduction of protective tariffs, I would not

have   opposed  it  except  to  indicate  a  certain

anxiety.  That there should be inroads in  order  to

encourage the local industries for local workers  is

a matter which I supported early on when that Tariff

Commission Bill was read a Second time. But  as  the

Rueff  Report says, when you are tinkering  with  an

economic  tradition  of more  than  a  century,  you

should go only as far as experience indicates it  is

safe  to  go.  It  has sounded  a  note  of  warning

repeatedly  against speed. It has urged  that  there

should  be  no  timetable. You  will  remember,  Mr

Speaker,  if  and  when  the Finance  Minister  will

suggest otherwise, that they recommended that  White

Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961, Article 17, should  only  be

amended in order to enable the Federation to  impose

protective tariff, not revenue tariff. Whatever  the

virtues,  Mr Speaker, even if I be wrong, and  this

fixed  schedule of destruction of our free  port  is

believed  to be right by the Finance Minister - I  say

Finance  Minister  because, Mr  Speaker,  you  will

remember  that the Prime Minister in his address  to

you disclaimed all knowledge of finance and said, "I

leave it to my Finance Minister who guides me,"  and

so   he   is   the  person  responsible  for   these

untold millions of today and tomorrow even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



if  he  were convinced despite his protestations  of

old that these provisions are for our benefit - I say

the  provisions of so radical a character  affecting

our  very livelihood should not have been agreed  to

without   reference  to  the  people  of  Singapore,

without   reference   to  this   Assembly,   without

reference  even  to their own political  Party,  but

agreed on the back of an envelope in the Ritz  Hotel

in  London after they left for London on the 25th of

June.  It  is  a most treacherous act  of  a  proved

shabby Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, I want to come to a personal

matter in respect of this particular debate. It  has

been  my  intention, Mr Speaker, in  view  of  this

farce  asking us to adopt something which  makes  no

difference  whether we adopt it or not,  whether  we

reject  it or not, because it is totally irrelevant;

the  judgment  is  passed, the act  of  the  British

Parliament has taken effect, and the machinery is in

motion.  The date of judgment is the 31st of  August

and there is no Court of Appeal. This is not a Court

of  Appeal from the British Parliament. So I thought

I  would not continue with this farce other than  to

expose  certain  aspects of it  for  those  who  are

interested and to depart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I read in the transcript of Tuesday of the speech of the Prime Minister what I consider to be a personal threat to me and an act of intimidation. He has been so successful intimidating others; he thinks he can do it to me in this very House. It is at page 16, 30th of July. Perhaps I

should  start  at  page 15 since  the  Minister  for

Culture interrupted. At the bottom of page 15  [Vol.

21, No. 5, cols. 311-2]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, in return for this we have a Common Market.

I  expected this to be received at least  by  right-minded  men  who  arc not Communists with  rapturous

applause and praise for the Tunku, if not for me, at

least  for  the  generosity of  the  Tunku  and  his

Deputy. But the Member for Anson, I think, has again

gone off the beam, I read in the newspapers that  he

has  denounced  it as a sell-out: that  we  in  four

years have done more damage that the British did  in

over a hundred years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajaratnam: Than the Japanese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: Than the Japanese,  I  do  not

know whether he knows [that is me, Mr Speaker] that

this  is the end of an era. I think it will  not  be

unfair to put it in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



way: that as things get tougher - and things will get

tougher because, as I have said, we are not showered

by  congratulations as we come into being (very  far

from  it)  - we have to be on the lookout  for  enemy

agents.'.



<br><br>So  they  are not showered by congratulations.  They

have to look out for enemy agents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I mean "enemy" in the proper sense of the word,

in war. And those who aid and abet the enemy will go

down  with  him,  and  we will suffer  none  in  our

midst.'.



<br><br>Well, I accept that threat. I shall vote against the

motion.  If he thinks he can intimidate me  in  this

Assembly,  Mr Speaker, with the threat of  treating

me as an enemy, I know the propaganda that will take

place.  "Oh, he voted with the Barisan, He aids  the

Barisan.  Therefore,  he is a  pro-Communist."  Now,

Sir,  I  have  milk for breakfast. The Barisan  have

milk  for  breakfast. The Communists have  milk  for

breakfast. Therefore, because the Barisan have  milk

for  breakfast like the Communists, and I have  milk

for breakfast like the Barisan, I am a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What do you have for breakfast?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Barisan, the Communists, do not

like  eating  the flesh of their mothers,  like  the

P.A.P. They vote against the Bill to legalise eating

the  flesh of their mothers. I vote against the Bill

to  eat  the  flesh of mothers. Therefore,  I  am  a

Communist. I accept that challenge, Mr Speaker.  It

is  a despicable challenge, despicable conduct of  a

despicable Government.



<br><br>7.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I was alarmed at the last

30 seconds of this debate. I was not sure whether or

not  the Minister for Health would have to call  for

an  ambulance with the necessary equipment  to  take

people  to  a padded cell. What is this  talk  about

eating  the flesh of mothers? Would any sane man  go

into  these  gruesome details? Sir, we  must  assume

that  the  hon.  Member for  Anson  is  a  sane  and

rational  man  in spite of evidence to the  contrary

which  he  himself produced in the last few minutes.

Therefore, I propose to work on the assumption  that

he has brought his mind to bear on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



subject of the Common Market, that he has studiously

studied,  as he pretends to have studied, the  Rueff

Report. Annex J, and all the other documents  before

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me dispose of a few - I will go no more

than  to  call them - minor inaccuracies. The  Member

for  Anson condemns the Rueff Mission. The  man  has

been  here for 16 days and therefore has not studied

the  subject, and is unqualified to speak; proof  of

which  he  said appeared in the documents themselves

when  the  World  Bank wrote to the  Prime  Minister

saying  that they do not endorse the view,  contrary

to what he said is the normal World Bank practice. I

do  not  know how many World Bank reports the Member

for  Anson  has read. They are available. The  World

Bank  has  sent  missions to  every  under-developed

country in the world. In each of their reports  they

say  the views are those of the mission and not  the

views  of the World Bank. I am astounded that a  man

of  his standing would make so easily mendacious and

inaccurate statements of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will deal with some of the less important

remarks first in regard to the Rueff Report and  the

Common Market. The Member for Anson has been reading

selected  extracts from the Rueff Report to  bolster

his  case. Sometimes. Mr Speaker, he does not  even

stop  at  the completed sentence. He stops right  in

the  middle  of the sentence. First,  he  read  from

paragraph 83, and he read out the first sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Singapore recent growth in manufacturing has

been  less  spectacular after buoyant  progress  had

been experienced in the 1950-57 period.'.



<br><br>The  next  sentence, Mr Speaker, Sir,  he  did  not

read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although comprehensive industrial statistics are

lacking,  it  appears that the  increase  in  output

stagnated  after  1957 until 1960, whereupon  growth

resumed  during  1961 and 1962. During  this  latter

period  the  Economic Development Board participated

actively in the establishment of a number of  plants

and  there  was an increase in the number  of  small

manufacturing firms. Retained imports  of  machinery

also   rose  sharply,  indicating  an  increase   in

investment  over the depressed levels  of  1958  and

1959.'.



<br><br>I  think  in  fairness, Sir, to the efforts  of  the

Government, he should have said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



that.  But  no,  he  just  stopped  short  of   that

particular section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next quotation came from paragraph 87; and

here,  Sir, he wants to make a point that it is  the

Federation who gained from the Common Market and not

so  much  Singapore. So you will note that  he  read

only  half  the sentence, not the full sentence.  So

for  the  record, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I  read  the

whole sentence?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Using G.N.P. [that is gross national product or

the   national  income]  as  a  rough  estimate   of

purchasing  power,  the  total  demand  within   the

Malaysian  market  [this  is  the  Common  Malaysian

Market]  will be about 52 per cent higher  than  now

existing in the Federation of Malaya...'.



<br><br>In other words, the Federation of Malaya expands its

market  by  52  per cent if there is a Pan-Malaysian

Common Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and about four times that of the present

Singapore market...'.



<br><br>In  other words, we gain 400 per cent as against  52

per cent of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson contends that the Rueff

Commission is concerned only with protective  import

duties.  He  claims  it makes no recommendations  on

revenue import duties and, in fact, urged upon  both

governments not to have any review of revenue import

duties  which, according to his interpretation,  has

no  part in the Common Market. Sir, it is very clear

in  Chapter VII, entitled "Harmonization  of  Tariff

Policies". It is Part II, Chapter VII, page 61.  May

I  read or rather re-read paragraph 167? Because  in

respect  of  that paragraph, he maintains  that  the

reference is only to protective tariffs and  not  to

revenue tariffs. The report goes as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Mission is of the opinion that the

application  of uniform tariff policies in  Malaysia

should proceed as rapidly as is consistent with  the

need to preserve entrepot trade...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniform tariff policies, Mr Speaker, mean all

tariffs. And to make the meaning quite clear, may  I

draw your attention to paragraph 170? This refers to

the  review at the end of five years. The Member for

Anson  said,  in  respect of  the  review  which  is

provided for in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



Annex  J,  that the World Bank recommended  that  it

should only cover protective tariffs and not revenue

tariffs. Now, what does paragraph 170 say?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The main object of the review would be to

determine  whether the complete ... [I  repeat]  the

complete  harmonization of  tariffs  in  Malaysia -...'.

...'.



<br><br>And  the  World  Bank goes on to  say  to  make  its

meaning clear beyond all doubt:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or more specifically, the extension to Singapore

of  the  entire  Malayan tariff - could  be  effected

without  significant adverse effects on the entrepot

trade or on employment.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the review is to review the whole

range of Malayan tariffs. So the Member is obviously

wrong. Either he has not properly addressed his mind

to  this  report or he is incapable of understanding

simple straightforward English or he prefers to omit

the  evidence in this report that is against his own

pet ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I continue - paragraph 170?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Board [that is the Review Board provided for

in Annex J] may find that this could be done without

further delay...'.



<br><br>That   is   at  the  end  of  five  years,  complete

harmonization  of  all  tariffs  including   revenue

tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or that a further period of grace should be

granted,  or  that the adjustment should  be  spread

over  a  period  of  years,  in  accordance  with  a

specific time schedule. If the Board feels that,  to

overcome practical difficulties, it is necessary  to

revise  or supplement the procedures recommended  by

the Mission, it would make appropriate suggestions.'



<br><br>So  the ground is cut completely under his feet, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. He has been arguing on  a  completely

false  premise,  and  once the basic  assumption  is

proved  false, then the whole argument falls to  the

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has quoted ad nauseam

from various speeches I have made. Of course, I feel

flattered  that he does pay regard to  what  I  have

said in various Budget statements. But what does  it

all  prove? Does it prove any inconsistency  between

what  I  have  said  about  the  importance  of  the

entrepot  trade - the volume of income and employment

generated and the agreement that we reached in Annex

A, does it prove any inconsistency between that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



Not at all. He has not given one bit of evidence nor

advance   any  argument  to  show  that,  with   the

establishment of the Common Market, there will be  a

complete destruction of our entrepot trade. That  is

the nexus which he must establish if he were to make

this  point with the Common Market, with the  import

duties and eventually revenue duties, the free  port

status of Singapore will be so modified that it will

be  impossible  to conduct the entrepot  trade.  The

entrepot trade will shrivel, as he says; it will  be

buried  in  Blakang  Mati with consequent  ruin  and

perdition to the rest of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose - mind you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

at  present speaking off the cuff to the many points

which he has raised. It will happen that I will  not

develop  the  counter arguments in the most  elegant

manner possible. But obviously, the Member for Anson

has  not  the  slightest idea of what  the  entrepot

trade of Singapore consists of. He says Singapore is

a  departmental  store. We supply  goods  from  this

departmental store to our neighbours or they come to

Singapore and do their shopping. That is his concept

of Singapore's entrepot trade - a departmental store.

You buy perfume, tennis rackets, clothes, golf clubs

- cameras may be. This is an absolutely inaccurate and

false picture of Singapore's entrepot trade. Between

two-thirds  and  three-quarters  of  the  value   of

entrepot  trade consists of tropical  products  like

rubber,  raw  sago, coffee, rattan,  pepper,  jungle

produce  of  various sorts, like jelutong;  dragon's

blood is an important item. It is the sap of a juice

which  is  collected in the jungles of  Sumatra  and

North Borneo -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Not the flesh of mothers, is it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is the life-blood of

Singapore. That is the entrepot trade. You do not go

to  Robinsons  or  Whiteaways  to  buy  a  sheet  of

unmilled crepe rubber - smelly stuff - or raw sago. So

obviously  his  notion of what  the  entrepot  trade

consists  of is the notion of a complete  dilettante

whose economic experience in entrepot trade has  not

extended beyond Raffles Square, possibly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



Change Alley. Sir, that is the stuff of the entrepot

trade.  The  rubber we get from Sumatra, Sarawak,  a

little  bit from North Borneo; copra, pepper, coffee

and other things from certain areas. With regard  to

that,  it  has been spelt out in Annex J  that  such

tropical  produce will not come within the ambit  of

the Common Market arrangements, either now or within

12  years or, for that matter, after 12 years. There

will  be no import duties on that. Annex J is  quite

explicit  on this matter, and to make it quite  sure

that  we  do  not have export duty on these  matters

- because  if  you  have  an export  duty  on  rubber

imposed  in  Singapore, then it makes your  entrepot

trade  extremely  difficult,  because  you  have  to

identify  which  parcels  of  rubber  are  from  the

Federation  on  which  you have  to  collect  import

duties  and which lots of rubber are from  Indonesia

on  which  you do not have export duty. So  we  have

from   the   Federation's   Finance   Minister   the

undertaking in Document 2 of Misc. 5 of 1963,  which

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government undertakes not to impose

export  duties  in Singapore in respect  of  primary

products, other than minerals including oil produced

in Singapore.'



<br><br>You  will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, "including oil."

If  we  strike  oil in Singapore, then  the  Federal

Government will have the right to impose  an  export

duty  and  have  a  share  in  it,  Of  course,  the

geological structure of Singapore, which  is  mainly

granite,  is  such that there is not  the  slightest

chance, so the geologists tell me, that we will ever

strike  oil. Mind you, if they are wrong and  we  do

strike  oil,  I  do not think we should  grudge  the

Federation a share of the revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the life-blood of our entrepot trade, the

free  port status is guaranteed, or else it  is  not

affected by the Common Market arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what about the other one-quarter or one-third? This consists of emporium products

- departmental  store stuff - clothing,  shoes,  toys,

cameras and a hundred and one things. Entrepot trade

in  these commodities means precisely this.  We  buy

from  Britain, America, Switzerland, Belgium, Japan,

any  source,  the best quality goods at  the  lowest

price. Because this is so, we can re-export these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



goods  cheaply to surrounding countries.  Which  are

the surrounding countries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borneo territories, Indonesia, the Federation

of  Malaya  - the  greater bulk of our  re-export  of

manufactures   go  to  the  Federation   of   Malaya

- something  like 60 per cent. And we  have  business

with  extraordinary places, quite apart from  South-East  Asia, Thailand, Burma, Mauritius, East Africa,

sometimes in the Congo. We have got orders and  only

last week a man has gone to Ethiopia to do some  re-export business. That is the thing, but the bulk  of

the  present entrepot trade is among the territories

of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us see what happens under the Common

Market. Some of these goods we can produce; some  we

cannot. For the goods that we can produce, we should

cover eventually most of the consumer goods that  we

import from abroad. There is no reason why we cannot

either  make  or assemble refrigerators, motor-cars;

textiles, of course, is too easy - anybody  can  make

textiles - and I have no doubt that the growth of the

textile  industry under the Common Market in  Malaya

will be a rapid and spectacular one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson says if there is a protective

duty,  then  it does not matter - it is fair  enough.

That is an over-simplification of the position. Even

if  it  goes  into the Common Market as a protective

duty,  there may be problems connected with the  re-export  trade. Take textiles as a good  example.  Of

all  the manufactured products entering into our re-export trade or the bazaar trade or the departmental

store trade, textiles and ready-made garments are by

far  the most important. The problem Singapore faces

is  grave. It is an excruciatingly difficult one  at

the moment. Entrepot trade in these goods is a large

one,  mostly  to  the Federation of  Malaya,  but  a

substantial amount to other parts outside  Malaysia.

We  know  that the Federation of Malaya is intending

to  set  up a textile industry in the Federation  of

Malaya,  and that when the Tariff Advisory Board  is

set up this will be one of the early proposals which

will have to be considered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what does Singapore do? The Member for Anson

would say, well, there is a protective duty, just go

ahead.  It is not so easy, Mr Speaker, Sir,If  you

go  ahead  and  put  textiles  as  a  Common  Market

commodity  and Singapore accepts a common protective

import  duty on textiles, what happens? There  is  a

substantial   re-export   trade   of   textiles   to

territories  outside Malaysia - of the  order  of,  I

think, $150 million to $200 million. It varies  from

year to year. It is a substantial amount of textiles

and  if  we  want to make sure that the  dealers  of

textiles   dealing  with  these  outside  countries,

mostly  Indonesia, do not suffer, we  have  to  make

special  provisions, not merely the ordinary  bonded

warehouse which is inadequate, because you  have  to

allow  space and facilities for breaking  bulk,  for

display  of  samples, for re-sorting and re-packing.

And  that will take time. Special bonded warehouses,

special free zones will have to be set up, and if it

is  not  done  in  an  adequate and  a  sufficiently

expeditious manner, the entrepot trade and  the  re-export trade will suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we say, because of the

importance  of the entrepot trade, we  exercise  our

option  of  remaining out of the  Common  Market  in

respect of textiles for one year, then what will the

result  be?  The  result will be  that  the  textile

manufacturers will go to the Federation, which  will

have an early start; and when the supply of textiles

has  flooded the Malayan market, you may  find  that

Singapore  does not have an adequate  share  of  the

textile industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the typical problems and considerations

which  we  have to bear in mind when we  come  to  a

decision  - not,  Mr  Speaker,  about  burying   the

entrepot  trade in the cemetery at Blakang  Mati  or

eating  the flesh of your mothers, not that sort  of

rubbish!  We  make concrete cost calculations,  work

out  possible engineering programmes to  make  these

bonded   warehouses   and   free   zone   facilities

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other problems connected with this. The

question of a protective duty, which he dismisses as

of   very   little   complexity,   raises   enormous

complications, in fact. Take motor spare parts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large entrepot trade in motor spare

parts.  Supposing we go for assembly of  motor-cars,

and   there   are  several  proposals   before   the

Government to establish motor-car assembly plants in

Singapore.  It  is  a useful industry;  it  provides

employment, generates subsidiary industries for  the

manufacture of simpler components, upholstery in the

process of assembling - that sort of thing - tyres, of

course,  and batteries. Right, what happens  to  the

entrepot  trade  in spare parts?  Once  there  is  a

protective  duty - and this is the point  the  Member

for  Anson does not understand, he has not the  mind

to grasp this businessman's angle - once there is an

import duty on these goods, then if you go to a shop

and  buy,  say,  spare parts - like a carburettor  or

whatever  you  will  - then the  price  is  high.  It

includes duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you want to take out a piece of component

- say  a  carburettor - and wish to  re-export  it  to

Indonesia.  You  cannot go to the Customs  and  say,

"Look, there is a tax on this; give me back the  tax

you  have collected, because [want to sell it  at  a

cheap  price." That is not possible. The  free  port

status has been an aid to our entrepot trade because

it  does not create problems of this nature - customs

duties  being imposed and then customs duties having

to   be   refunded.   And  generally   the   Customs

administration will never agree to a refund  of  tax

collected once the case is broken, once the bulk  is

broken, once the separate identity of goods has been

lost,  because  it opens avenues for  all  kinds  of

abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even when that does not happen in Singapore,

Members  may be interested to hear of a  case  where

one  of  the cigarette manufacturers tried to  cheat

the  Customs.  There is a duty on  imported  tobacco

leaf. Then when you export the leaves, you get  what

is called the "draw-back". You paid duty on it; when

you  re-export because it is not used in  Singapore,

no  duty is paid. One bright businessman decided  to

make a claim from the Customs Department of the duty

which  had been paid on the tobacco leaves. When  we

examined the case, we found stones in it!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even in this matter where the procedure is

fairly  straightforward, people try to cheat customs

duty.  Therefore,  the  solution  whereby  you   can

protect  the  re-export trade - it is  the  re-export

trade  that is the core, that is the consumer  goods

entrepot trade - is to have bonded warehouses  and  a

free zone where goods designed for re-export outside

Malaysia are stored, duty free, First, the price  is

not  increased. You can still compete in your export

market  with  Indonesia or Burma  or  Thailand,  and

customs facilities are reduced to a minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Anson does not understand

this  simple  proposition. He equates import  duties

with  the  death  of the entrepot trade.  He  quoted

Singapore as the fifth largest port. May I give  him

the  example of the world's largest port - the  first

largest  port,  Rotterdam? We handle  eight  to  ten

million  tons  of  cargo a year;  Rotterdam  handles

ninety  million tons of cargo a year. And  Rotterdam

works  in the regime of a full Customs Union. It  is

not  a  free  port  and, with the  starting  of  the

European  Common  Market, customs duties  have  been

increased in many of the goods that went through the

port of Rotterdam. Has it brought Rotterdam down  to

a shambles? Do we have to bury the port of Rotterdam

in Blakang Mati?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if he had taken the trouble to go through

various  reports which are available, he would  have

found that after the European Common Market the port

of  Rotterdam has increased in prosperity  and  that

its   entrepot  trade,  far  from  diminishing,  has

increased in volume and value. Why? Because  of  the

general  prosperity of the whole  European  Economic

Community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member may not be able to follow the

relationship  between  import  duties,  free  zones,

bonded  warehouses, customs drawbacks and all  these

other  technicalities. Let him understand  this  one

concrete  example  - of  the  world's  largest   port

operating within the regime of a full Customs Union,

going  from  strength  to  strength.  And  there  is

absolutely no reason why we in Singapore  under  the

Common Market



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



arrangements  should  not be as  successful  as  the

traders of Rotterdam. I think few people will  claim

that  our  traders  are  less  resourceful  or  less

industrious than the traders of Rotterdam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was waiting, Mr Speaker, for a coherent,

logical,  step-by-step argument, with  illustrations

by  way  of products and businesses, as to how  this

Common Market Agreement as enshrined in Annex  J  of

the  Constitutional Document must  bring  about  the

downfall  of  Singapore. I see no argument.  I  have

heard  endless quotations of what I said,  what  the

Prime Minister said, what the Rueff Mission said  on

the  importance of the entrepot trade, why it should

not  be  allowed  to  run down. We  agree  with  the

sentiments,  but  we  do not agree  with  the  basic

assumption  that if you have a Common  Market,  then

that  is  the death of the entrepot trade. The  case

has not been proved. As it is, I would have said  no

defence  would  be  called for  if  Members  of  the

Assembly had special training in these matters,  but

since   these   are  somewhat  unfamiliar   matters,

particularly Common Market and the Customs regime, I

feel obliged to explain in some detail that what the

Member  for Anson has been saying for the  last  two

hours on the common market is absolute drivel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just a word about revenue duties. The Member

for  Anson understood the meaning of revenue duties,

that is, duties on the import of goods which are not

made anywhere in Malaysia. Those are revenue duties.

He said it is not in the Rueff Report. I pointed out

that  it is in the Rueff Report. And he said, "Well,

why  should  it  not be part of the Common  Market?"

This  becomes the Customs Union. He misquoted me  in

one  of  my Budget statements, the last one I think,

in  which I said that agreement on the Common Market

would  be  easy  if  we were prepared  to  accept  a

Customs Union. True enough. There was nothing  wrong

with   that.   By   that   I  meant   an   immediate

establishment  of  a  full-scale  Customs  Union.  A

further  two  sentences from that, I made  it  quite

clear there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



that  the introduction of a full-scale Customs Union

is  not appropriate in Singapore now, but phasing it

over  twelve years is a completely different matter.

First,  for  five years we have all  the  safeguards

against  revenue duties; at the end  of  five  years

there  is  the Review Board which should  take  into

account these matters and review the whole range  of

Malayan  tariffs, not merely Singapore tariffs,  but

the  whole  range of Malayan tariffs.  I  have  very

little doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that at that review,

which  should be an important event in our  economic

history, there will be a fundamental change  in  the

tariff system of Malaya and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain this point? The Malayan tariff

system  is  a colonial system. That was  the  system

which  Malaya inherited from the colonial  days  and

they have not done very much basically to change the

character  of  import tariffs.  There  was  no  time

perhaps,  and possibly no reason to do  so.  In  all

industrial  countries  and  in  all  well  developed

societies, an import duty fulfils one function, that

is, the protection of domestic industries. It is not

to  get money because there are other more equitable

forms  of raising revenue such as income tax, estate

duties,  sales  tax, this, that and the  other.  The

function  of  an  import duty  is  to  protect  your

domestic industries. But in the British colonies  - I

believe  the  French  have a different  system  - the

import duty had been the major source of revenue  to

the Government. It is an iniquitous form of taxation

in  so  far  as  it levies taxes on food  and  other

necessities resulting in the poor having  to  pay  a

disproportionate  burden  of  tax  collected  b  the

Government.  And largely in all British territories,

the  same  structure of import duty exists,  and  in

most  of  them  the same structure of import  tariff

continues  after independence has been  achieved.  I

venture  to  suggest that at the first  review  made

five years from the date of the establishment of the

Common Market, we can expect radical changes in  the

tariff system of Malaysia, which will mean that many

of  the more depressing items of import duties  will

disappear if they are not manufactured here, and in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



its  place  possibly  the retention  of  tariffs  or

import  duties  on  perhaps luxury  and  semi-luxury

goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after five years, and within 12 years from now,

the  fact that at the end of 12 years we have to  go

into  a  full-scale Customs regime with the rest  of

Malaysia  does  not  bother me very  much,  for  two

reasons. Firstly, as I have said, they are likely to

see  fundamental changes in the tariff structure for

Malaysia. Secondly, if within 12 years we  have  not

made   a  success  of  the  Common  Market  or   our

industrialisation plans have gone  haywire,  then  I

say, items like revenue duties and such matters woud

be  trivialities compared to the major problems that

will  be  facing  us then. I have a note  here.  Mr

Speaker. I said just now that at the end of 12 years

we  would enter into a full-scale Customs Union with

the   rest  of  Malaysia.  In  fact,  that   is   an

inaccuracy,  and I am glad that one of  my  officers

here  has  pointed  out that this  will  not  be  so

because  of  the exclusion of primary products  from

the Common Market and the import and export duty  on

primary  products is a substantial  element  of  the

present  tariff system. Sir, that is for the  moment

about  as  much  as I want to say in  reply  to  the

Member for Anson in respect of the Common Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to deal with some other points raised

by  other  Members  on  the  financial  arrangements

negotiated in London. The constitutional  and  other

aspects  of the Malaysia Agreement, I will leave  to

my   colleagues.  Sir,  my  task  to  reply  to  the

criticisms of the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. is

at  one and the same time both easy and arduous.  It

is  easy  because  to  refute  their  arguments  and

destroy  the  so-called evidence that  they  put  up

presents no difficulty whatsoever. The logic used by

the Member for Queenstown is, as usual, as distorted

and  as twisted as his own mind. The evidence  which

he uses in support of his arguments is largely based

on taking words and sentences from the documents and

from speeches of Ministers completely out o context.

You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that yesterday

you had to pull him up on that point; that he just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



read the last sentence of one document claiming that

it  supported his point of view, and then you  asked

him  to  read  the  whole  document  which  gave   a

completely  different picture. As I  have  said,  to

pursue  every misrepresentation and every  falsehood

which  abounds in his 6¬ hour address  is  a  simple

matter, hut, at the same time, it is going to be  an

arduous one because there are so many o them, and  I

do  not wish to tax the patience and forbearance  of

this  House, already strained to the limit by  long-winded,  illogical  and  interminable  speeches   by

certain Members of the Opposition. So I will confine

myself  only  to the major issues.  If  I  may  pass

judgment  on  the  performance  of  the  Member  for

Queenstown   yesterday   and   the   night   before,

regardless   of  the  performance   of   the   human

intellect, grappling with momentous intricate issues

before  the country, I get the impression  that  his

mind  is woefully inadequate to the task. I get  the

idea  of  a computer, a small feeble one,  that  has

gone  wrong,  gone  mad,  fed  by  the  wrong  data,

producing the wrong answers. Sir, his performance is

similar  to that of a child who has been  trying  to

master   the  multiplication  tables,  and,   having

achieved  indifferent success in this, then  decided

to  take  a  leap  and try his hand at  differential

calculus. It is not unexpected that errors of  logic

were  perpetrated at each and every stage.  The  odd

thing is that his colleagues in the Barisan Sosialis

appear to be genuinely impressed by his performance.

So  I  conclude that not only are they  ignorant  of

simple  multiplications there  is  also  some  doubt

whether  they  understand how  to  add  and  how  to

subtract. At one stage I had some doubts whether the

main  performer  himself, the hero  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  the Member for Queenstown, knows  how  to

add  and how to subtract. Late on the night of  30th

July,  I entered the Chamber and listened with  some

astonishment  to  the Member for  Queenstown  saying

that the total contribution Singapore has to make to

the  Federal Government is $163 million. May I quote

from page 79 of Hansard of 30th July (col. 412)?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As I say, Sir, if we add this figure of $3

million   and  $36  million  to  the  $124   million

calculated from the 40 per cent Federal revenue,  we

see  that  the Singapore Government has to  pay  the

Federation  every year $124 million plus $3  million

plus $36 million, and that gives us a figure of $163

million.'.



<br><br>Sir, there are two things wrong with his arithmetic.

First,  the  $36  million  which  he  says  is   the

recurrent  expenditure  for  Broadcasting,  Airport,

Defence,   etc.,  is  in  fact  not  the   recurrent

expenditure for Broadcasting, Airport, and  Defence.

That  statement is made at the top of  page  79  and

also at the top of page 78, third line. Broadcasting

remains   a   State  Department  and  we   make   no

contribution  to  the  Federation  for  it.  Defence

expenditure is not included in the $36 million.  The

$36 million, so far as I can discover, refers to the

Federation  Government's estimate  of  the  cost  of

Singapore's  departments  other  than  Defence   and

Internal Security, and this will include departments

such  as  Immigration, Prisons, Civil Aviation,  the

Law   Courts   and  Judiciary,  and  other   Federal

Departments operating in Singapore. This  amount  of

$36  million has already been included in  the  $124

million covered by the 40 per cent contribution. You

cannot, therefore, add the same amount twice as  the

Member  for  Queenstown was doing.  As  for  the  $3

million    development   expenditure   on    Federal

departments  in Singapore, this is only the  ceiling

figure  proposed  at  one stage,  and  there  is  no

agreement that we will pay this amount regardless of

what  is  spent. We pay only for what  is  spent  in

Singapore on Federal departments like Post  Offices,

Civil  Aviation, Telecommunications  and  such  like

matters.  It is obvious that we want these  services

to be maintained at the highest level of efficiency.

We  are an important business centre. Our efficiency

depends   on   a   good   and   fast   postal    and

telecommunications service and an efficient  airport

And  in  order  to  avoid the possibility  that  the

Singapore  departments  may ha  starved  of  capital

funds  for  their development, we have  agreed  that

this pavement should be made, and I think this is  a

wise and prudent movement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now go to the more important

allegations  which he has made.  On  the  amount  of

contribution   which   we  make   to   the   Federal

Government, his one point of criticism is that while

early  in 1962 our own private estimate was that  we

should be contributing something like $78 million  a

year now, the figure agreed to is considerably more.

Sir,  the full explanation for this appears  in  the

Documents before the House. It is in Misc. 4 of 1963

which  gives the full details and how this  increase

has  taken  place. The reasons are clearly available

if  only  he  will take pains to read the  documents

there.  Early  in  1962, there was no  confrontation

policy,  and further the estimates we made in  early

1962  did  not  take  into  account  the  additional

Federal expenditure that would be necessary with the

entry  of  the Borneo territories into Malaysia.  At

that  time,  this was still an open issue,  and  the

terms and conditions and so on had not been settled.

In  fact,  if my recollection serves me right,  that

was the time when North Borneo certainly became very

apprehensive  about  the  possibility   of   joining

Malaysia - an attitude which they changed, of  course,

quite  rapidly  once they knew what  Malaysia  stood

for.  Well,  that  was  one element  explaining  the

increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greatest single element is the tremendous

increase in the defence expenditure and the internal

security expenditure which the Federation Government

has  planned  to  embark upon. In effect,  it  meant

doubling  or  more than doubling their military  and

police strength. This obviously is a matter on which

the Federal Government is the competent authority to

make  a judgment. But so far as we are concerned,  I

would  have  thought that it would be a self-evident

proposition, that an independent country  must  have

the means to defend its territorial integrity. It is

known even to the meanest intellect that the cost of

modern  armament  is high. These  are  some  evident

propositions.  And  here  the  Barisan's   line   of

argument   is  self-contradictory.  In   the   first

instance,  they  grumble  about  the  high  rate  of

contribution which results from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



increased  defence  costs. At the  same  time,  they

object  to  the  defence treaty  which  the  Federal

Government has with the British Government and which

we  have  extended to cover the whole  of  Malaysia.

Sir,  they can take one stand or the other, but they

cannot embrace both positions. If they say the  rate

of  contribution is high because defence expenditure

is  high, then they should have welcomed the defence

pact  because  that  prevents the  expenditure  from

going even higher still. We live in a turbulent  age

and in a particularly troublesome and turbulent part

of  the  world - South-East Asia. Malaysia  will,  by

world  standards,  be a small country  in  terms  of

population  and wealth. Even in the case  of  larger

and  more powerful countries, we see that they found

it  to their advantage to have alliances and defence

treaties  among themselves. What is  so  wrong  with

Malaysia  observing this widely practised  principle

and entering into similar arrangements? if, however,

the  Barisan maintains that it is wrong for Malaysia

to  enter  into a defence pact with another country,

then, instead of objecting to the large increase  in

defence  expenditure which the Federation Government

is  to  undertake, they should ask for an even  more

substantial increase. If we were to have  a  defence

force  for Malaysia capable of taking on all corners

- nations with populations ten times larger than ours

- we  should  have to spend probably more  than  four

times the amount that is being planned for the  next

five  years.  And even this tremendous expansion  in

defence  expenditure may not be adequate  to  ensure

protection. Of course, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis are

not   interested  in  maintaining  the   territorial

integrity  f  our  new  nation, Malaysia.  Everybody

knows  that  they are in full sympathy  with  forces

outside   the  country,  foreign  powers   who   are

determined to disrupt Malaysia. The Barisan are  the

truly  anti-national elements among us. They see  as

their  major  task the subversion of  Malaysia  from

within   to   supplement   pressure   and   possible

aggression from outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 31st August, it is not for us in Singapore

to say what is the proper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



treatment  that should be meted out to  such  people

who  are bent on destroying the nation. As the House

knows,  these are matters for the Federal Government

which  would  be  in  charge  of  defence,  external

affairs and internal security. I only want to stress

to  the  Barisan the criminal folly of  their  ways.

They now have only 29 days left during which time if

they behave themselves and refrain from wrecking the

peace   of  the  country,  they  have  a  reasonable

assurance  of  their personal safety. But  when  the

curtain  drops after 31st August - they may  find  it

less  amusing, Mr Speaker, Sir, with the  entry  of

new dramatis personoe -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The iron curtain of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - then a new situation will

arise  in which they will find it less amusing  than

now.  However, Sir, it is not a pleasant subject  to

dwell  upon,  and I think I shall move on  to  other

things.   But   this   could  be   the   moment   of

interruption.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, at the moment of

interruption   we  were  contemplating   with   some

distaste and considerable apprehension the  fate  of

the Barisan Members after 31st August, and we turned

quickly from the scene of horror to go back  to  the

financial arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown made some

observations  on the 30th of July on  the  Singapore

surpluses.   First,   I  shall   deal   with   those

observations  appearing in pages 62 and  63  of  the

Hansard (Unrevised transcript). Sir, he claims  that

the surplus of the Singapore Government, running  at

the  rate of $100 million or so a year, is  not  the

result  of  prudent  expenditure and  efficient  tax

collection.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



If  I  may quote him, first paragraph, page 62 [col.

384], he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Until 25th May, 1963, the Prime Minister had been

deceiving  the people with talks of surpluses  which

he  claimed  are  the result of a prudent  and  good

government. We say, Sir, it is nothing of that sort.

The early surpluses in Singapore were the result  of

downright inefficient and incompetent government.'



<br><br>And  he goes on to say our Government "did not  have

the time to use the money of the people of Singapore

and  voted  for  in  this  Legislative  Assembly  on

constructive   projects  to  help  the   people   of

Singapore."  I  think he really  meant  construction

projects, Mr Speaker, Sir. Now, be that as it  may.

And   he   said  surplus  means  in  effect   under-expenditure  and  under-use  in  relation  to  these

construction projects. The Member for Queenstown has

made this observation so often that I think the time

has  now come to nail the lie. He has been a  Member

of  this Assembly for more than four years now,  and

he  has been through the Budget sessions from  1959,

1960,  1961  and 1962 - four Budget Sessions  in  all

- and  obviously  he still does not  understand  that

each year we have two Budgets, two sets of Estimates

- one  for recurrent expenditure and one for  capital

expenditure,   the   Ordinary  Estimates   and   the

Development  Estimates. In  fact,  I  wonder  if  he

understood  the  meaning  of  the  words  "recurrent

expenditure" and "capital expenditure". I asked  him

this  question two nights ago and failed  to  get  a

satisfactory reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the annual surpluses appear in the Estimates

of  recurrent expenditure, that is, they  appear  in

the Ordinary Estimates. Recurrent expenditure of the

Government  means the normal running expenditure  of

Government departments, salaries of civil  servants,

purchases  of  goods  and  services,  petroleum  for

lorries,  cars,  paper,  electricity,  - items   like

these.  As against this normal recurrent expenditure

we get certain items of revenue - from taxes, licence

fees,  and  so  on. And the surpluses arise  in  the

Ordinary  Estimates - if your revenue  is  more  than

your expenditure then there is a surplus.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



Now,  on  the  other hand, construction  expenditure

appears in the Development Estimates and not in  the

Ordinary Estimates. Therefore, whether there is  any

spending,   under-spending   or   over-spending   on

construction projects in the Development  Estimates,

such  matters  have  no hearing  whatsoever  on  the

surpluses  earned  on  current account.  This  again

proves the complete lack of grasp of the Member  for

Queenstown, who at the present moment is not  paying

attention to my -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Minister

should worry about that. He is addressing the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Well, my only concern, Mr

Speaker, Sir, is that matters of public interest  - I

am trying, Mr Speaker, Sir, to do a public service,

by  educating  the  leader of  an  important  Party.

However,  if  he prefers to wallow  in  a  state  of

ignorance, so be it. But may I advise him - or rather

repeat my advice - that before he embarks on problems

of  differential  calculus, he  should  first  learn

simple  arithmetic: how to add and how to  subtract?

So  what  the Member for Queenstown says,  that  our

surpluses  are due to under-expenditure  on  capital

development is complete nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then goes further to allege that the

Prime  Minister  was  deliberately  misleading   the

country when the Prime Minister said that during the

negotiations  between  the  Federal  and   Singapore

Governments in Kuala Lumpur, the Federal  Government

wants to take the whole of Singapore's surpluses, in

the  first instance, and at a later stage,  relented

and stated that they were satisfied with half of our

surpluses.  Now  he  said  that  the  position   was

completely untrue. Sir, the documents which we  have

presented,  Misc. 4 of 1963, give all  the  evidence

and  all the details. In fact, if you will refer  to

pages   48  and  49  and  50,  you  will   see   the

calculations   in   the  paper  submitted   by   the

Federation  Government. Page 49,  the  last  portion

"Apportionment Percentages" with surplus,  how  much

they  take,  how much we take; without surplus,  how

much they take, how much we take. A similar exercise

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



in  page  50. You will note various percentages  are

set out, depending on whether there is a sharing  of

surplus,  of  half surplus, or no surplus.  I  would

have  thought the position is quite clear.  Yet  the

Member for Queenstown has the effrontery to make the

claim  that  until  the 25th May,  1963,  the  Prime

Minister was trying to mislead the people, but after

the 25th May, he said that the Prime Minister was no

longer  misleading the people. What is the evidence,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, on which he claims  to  base  his

conclusions?  To prove that the Prime  Minister  had

been  deceiving the people, he referred to a  letter

in  the Straits Times of the 25th May written by  an

official  of the Federal Treasury. May I  read  what

the Member said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In a letter to the Straits Times Mr Abdullah

Ayub, Deputy Controller of Supply in the Federation,

revealed that the negotiations were in fact  on  the

percentage of payment of Singapore Federal taxes  to

the  Federation.  He said that once  the  percentage

payment  had  been fixed, each Government  would  be

responsible for its own Budget, and the question  of

deficit or surplus does not arise. Sir, this  was  a

great  blow to the P.A.P. The letter, in fact,  says

that  the  Prime Minister has not been  telling  the

people  the  truth, because all the time  it  should

have  been  a percentage, and now he is talking  and

telling the people it was a matter of surpluses.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Member for Queenstown accepts that the

letter  of  the Federation official to  the  Straits

Times  sets  out  the  genuine  position.  Sir,  how

foolish  can a man be? If the Member for  Queenstown

had  been  in  my place, he would have accepted  the

position  as  set out by the Federation Treasury.  I

shudder  what  would have happened  to  the  country

then.  He would have surrendered our surpluses,  and

more, to the Federal Government without even knowing

it.   He  would  have  been  completely  bamboozled,

outwitted  and  outmanoeauvred  by  the  Federation.

Surely,  Sir,  he  does not believe  that  once  the

percentage  is  fixed, the question  of  surplus  or

deficit  does not arise. By way of illustration,  in

order that I can make the position so clear that  it

will  penetrate his skull: now let us  suppose  that

the percentage of contribution had been fixed at  90

per  cent,  that is to say, 90 per cent  of  Federal

taxes  in  Singapore goes to the Central Government.

Does he not think that Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



will  then be faced with a fearsome deficit when  it

has  to  meet  the expenditure of Singapore's  State

Departments?  If  he  still cannot  understand  this

proposition  - and  I see no light  of  comprehension

dawning  on  his  face - then I can  only  repeat  my

advice,  and  perhaps  persuade  the  Minister   for

Education  to admit the Member for Queenstown  to  a

Primary  School where he can re-learn the arithmetic

which he has forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member objects to loans. Why, he asks,

should we give loans to the Borneo territories  when

we  need it ourselves? Every under-developed country

in  this world, almost by definition, needs capital.

But in Malaysia, Sir, Singapore will be a member  of

a family of States, one of the wealthiest members of

the  Federation  of  Malaysia.  The  Borneo  States,

though   they   have  the  potential  for   economic

development, are more short of money than we are. It

is a matter of elementary fair play and justice that

the  more well-to-do should assist the less well-to-do if it is within his means to do so. It applies to

relationships  between persons and it  applies  with

equal   force   to  relationships  between   States,

particularly  between States in  the  Federation.  I

made  this  clear in my Budget statement  last  June

- that  it  would be wrong for Singapore to  adopt  a

selfish  policy.  If  we try to hog  everything  for

ourselves, then this will create envy and resentment

towards us among the less developed States. And with

Malaysia  in the long run, this will be against  our

own  self-interest.  And on grounds  of  enlightened

self-interest alone, I would have thought it obvious

that  financial assistance to the more needy  States

of   Malaysia  is  a  sound  proposition,  both   on

political grounds and on economic considerations.  I

consider  the terms of the loan eminently  fair  and

just  and  reasonable. I do not agree that there  is

any  case for us to make an out-right grant  to  the

Borneo territories, for we are not all that wealthy.

And besides, giving money away free is bad, bad both

for  the donor as well as for the recipient. For the

recipient,  free  money means  an  invitation  to  a

spending spree, but when assistance is made  in  the

form of loans which will have to be repaid, then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



Borneo  territories will have to take care to  spend

it  wisely  on projects that will yield a return  to

enable  them to refund the loan. From our  point  of

view, we will get our capital back at the end of the

period of the loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we have attached a condition to this

loan,  and  that  is that half the  labour  used  in

construction  projects - and they  will  be  used  in

construction  projects in developing the  States  in

Borneo - must come from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown then refers to a

newspaper  item in the Nanyang Siang Pau  yesterday.

He  says  that that amounted to a complete rejection

by  the  Federation Government of this condition.  I

have seen this particular newspaper item. May I  say

that, in the first instance, it is not issued as  an

official Press release of the Federation Government?

It  only says that it comes from Government sources,

unspecified.  It is a leakage of some  sort,  and  I

have  a  shrewd  guess how it  came  about.  We  are

accustomed to this kind of exchange with  a  certain

Party in Singapore and ourselves, and I think we  in

the  P.A.P. have  not done too badly  out  of  this

encounter. No, Sir, the terms will be observed. Mind

you,  Mr Speaker, I am not saying that we  want  to

force  this loan on the Borneo territories. If  they

do not like our labourers and our money, we will not

compel them to borrow from us. Now that condition is

obviously  not an unreasonable condition. In  inter-Government loans, it is the normal practice that the

money  must be spent in some way whereby the lending

country  derives  some benefits.  Now,  the  Members

opposite  claim that we have agreed to an  interest-free  loan  for ten years. The Member for Queenstown

said  it and it was re-echoed by the Member for Hong

Lim which, in itself, means that whenever the Member

for  Hong Lim re-echoes some statements, surely  the

first  reaction of any reasonable man is to suspect,

because  he  is  a  great  rumour-monger,  a   great

purveyor  of untruths. "Ten-year interest free,"  is

what  he  said.  I do not see this anywhere  in  the

Agreement. The Agreement says



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



interest   free  for  five  years  and  if  economic

expansion and prosperity in Singapore justifies  it,

then  a  further five years. If there should be  any

dispute as to whether justification exists for  this

extension,  then the matter will be referred  to  an

independent  assessor appointed by the  World  Bank.

Fair  enough. If we prosper as a result of  Malaysia

to  such  an  extent as to justify an  extension  of

another  five years, why should we worry  about  it?

And  further  this  provides an  inducement  to  the

Federal  Government not only to abstain from  taking

measures  harmful to our prosperity but to also  act

as  a positive inducement for them to take steps  to

increase our prosperity. And again, this is  not  an

unreasonable condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown asks a particularly

foolish  question. He wants to know why  we  do  not

impose  World  Bank terms on the Borneo territories.

The answer is quite simple, Mr Speaker, Sir. We are

not the World Bank and our relations with the Borneo

States  and the Federal Government are not the  same

as  the  relations between the World  Bank  and  the

borrowing  countries.  But in this  connection,  the

Member  for  Queenstown repeats the falsehood  which

has  been refuted in the past, namely, the falsehood

that  the  World Bank terms on the loan to Singapore

are  humiliating. He knows that this is  untrue;  he

knows  that we have already pointed out to him  that

these terms are the standard terms applicable to all

World  Bank loans and are observed by each and every

country borrowing money from the World Bank,  be  it

an    under-developed   country   or   an   advanced

industrialised  nation. Does  he  think  that  these

terms  are  humiliating then? Does he maintain  that

the World Bank is bent on humiliating each and every

country in the world which qualifies to borrow  from

the World Bank?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on another aspect of the loan, namely, the

cost  of  the loan. The fact that we give  the  loan

interest free for five years - how much does it  cost

to  the State of Singapore? He says it will cost  us

$110  million. He assumes it is $55 million, 5½  per

cent  interest on $100 million for ten years  equals

$55 million. Then he says that we have to borrow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



another  $100 million and pay interest on it,  which

will cost us another $55 million, and that therefore

if  you  add the two sums together, it will cost  us

$110  million. Sir, this kind of Barisan  arithmetic

passes my comprehension. I cannot understand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> You can ask an

accountant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I cannot understand. We have

another Barisan mathematician, Mr Speaker, Sir. Can

I  reduce  this  to  simple plain  terms  which  are

comprehensible   even  to  the   meanest   intellect

opposite? Let us speak in easy terms. If I  were  to

lend  you  a  shirt, let us say  for  five  days - of

course,  not for five years - and then I am short  of

one shirt and so I go to High Street and buy another

shirt  to  replace  it.  Now, according  to  Barisan

calculations,  I  would have lost  two  shirts  - the

shirt  which  I  lent to you and the shirt  which  I

bought. It is this kind of curious logic repeated by

my    former   Parliamentary   Secretary   obviously

believing his Chairman - the man noted for a complete

absence  of reason and logic. Now, Sir,  I  come  to

the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am getting a bit anxious

about the time. We have another two hours to go, and

wishes to speak. Could I be -

allocate the time as fairly as I can now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> rose -

has  already  had  90 minutes. The  Opposition  have

120 minutes. In other words, the Opposition are only

asking for 40 minutes.

minutes.  That  is  40 minutes out  of  another  120

minutes.  I think that is fair. The Government  will

have 80 minutes now to divide amongst themselves.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I will do my best within

the allotted time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the collection of taxes, a great deal

of  time  was spent in negotiations between the  two

Governments  as  to  who is  going  to  control  the

Revenue  Department in Singapore,  principally,  the

Inland    Revenue   Department   and   the   Customs

Department. The Federal Government says that  Income

Tax  and  Customs are Federal revenues,  that  these

departments should be under their direct control and

that  the  whole  staff should be employees  of  the

Federal Government. Our contention is that the terms

of the White Paper are quite explicit and that these

departments  will  remain under  the  administrative

control of the Singapore Government. And so  it  was

in  the  London Agreement that these two departments

remain   under   the   control  of   the   Singapore

Government.  I  would have thought that  this  would

have  satisfied  the Members of the Opposition,  but

needless  to say the Member for Queenstown  was  not

satisfied.  His principal contention is  this,  that

although authority has been delegated under  Article

84   of   the  Federal  Constitution,  the   Federal

Government can revoke this authority any  time  they

like. I quote him from page 69 of Hansard [unrevised

transcript]  Vol. 21, No. 5, dated 30th  July,  1963

(col. 396). He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore can collect the revenue only at the

pleasure  of the Federation Government.  If  at  any

time the Federation Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



feels  so  inclined, it can take over the collection

of   all   Federal  revenue  itself.  The  Singapore

Government collects only if the Federation allows it

to collect.'



<br><br>Sir,  this is a complete travesty of the truth.  The

Federal  Government can revoke this  authority  only

under  two  circumstances: first, if  the  Singapore

Government agrees to such revocation and,  secondly,

if  the Singapore Government fails to collect  taxes

in a proper and efficient manner, and this fact must

he  established in a court of law if  the  Singapore

Government disputes that it has failed in  its  duty

of  efficient  tax collection. Surely, Members  will

agree  that  if  sonic  future Singapore  Government

bungles its tax collection either through corruption

or   ineptitude,   and  if  this  failure   can   be

established in the High Court, then it is only right

and  proper  that the Federal Government takes  over

this  department. There is nothing wrong or sinister

in this provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dwelt at some length in replying to

the Member for Anson on the misrepresentations which

he  has made on the subject of the Common Market and

much  of  what I have said will apply to the remarks

of the Members for Queenstown and Hong Lim when they

put  forward their criticisms of the Common  Market.

They  complain  that  the Common  Market  means  the

abandonment of the free port status of Singapore.  I

have explained how, under the Common Market, special

techniques  are  possible and  special  arrangements

will be made to make possible the re-export trade of

Singapore   in  manufactured  goods.  I  have   also

explained that in respect of tropical produce, which

forms the bulk of our entrepot trade, nothing in the

Common Market arrangements will affect this entrepot

trade  in  the slightest degree. So the unfavourable

repercussion  of the Common Market on  the  entrepot

trade   is   largely  a  matter  of   their   biased

imagination.  But  I  will say this,  that  if  some

incompetent   or  corrupt  Government   takes   over

Singapore in the near future and has not the ability

to  phase  the Common Market arrangements in  a  way

that  will  properly  balance  industrial  interests

against  the interests of the trade, then  it  could

happen  that  not  only trade will suffer  but  also

industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



will  suffer. But given an intelligent and effective

implementation  of the Common Market proposals,  the

immediate  effect in Singapore must be to accelerate

the  growth  of  industries  and  the  expansion  of

employment  opportunities.  In  fact,  in  Singapore

today,  in anticipation of the Common Market,  there

has  been  a spurt of industrial propositions  here,

and   very  shortly  I  shall  be  awarding  Pioneer

Certificates  to 30 firms. These are  all  proposals

developed  in  recent months to set up factories  in

Singapore in anticipation of the common market,  and

the  number of Pioneer Certificates involved in this

exercise  - some 30 - is nearly as large as the  total

number of Pioneer Certificates which we have awarded

in   the   first   3½  years  in  our   efforts   to

industrialise. In the first 3½ years, the number  of

pioneer  firms  receiving certificates  amounted  to

only  42, and only in the last four or five  months,

30  new  firms came with solid proposals on feasible

industrial  ventures which will  be  established  in

Singapore before very long. Unquestionably after the

establishment of Malaysia and the Common Market,  we

shall  see  an  even faster rate of growth.  Do  the

Barisan Sosialis and other Opposition Members object

to the growth of new industries to provide more jobs

and  more  income, or are they in favour of mounting

unemployment and endemic misery and hopelessness?  I

have no doubt that the Communist mentors behind  the

Barisan Sosialis do not want to see economic  growth

and   prosperity  for  our  State,  for  with   more

prosperity,   more  jobs  and  more  income,   their

capacity  to instigate trouble diminishes.  But,  of

course,  we  can hardly be expected  to  oblige  the

Communists in this respect and the gnashing of teeth

and  the shedding of crocodile tears over the Common

Market by the Barisan Sosialis reflect no more  than

the chagrin which their masters must be feeling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to deal with some observations made by

the  Member for Hong Lim in regard to loans. He  has

proved  to  be even more mendacious than the  Member

for Queenstown. He claims



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



that  Singapore  will  hardly get  any  benefits  by

supplying labour to the Borneo States. At page 54 of

yesterday's Hansard [Unrevised transcript] Vol.  21,

No. 6 (col. 503), he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the $150 million loan is used in the Borneo

States  and  even if they recruit some  labour  from

Singapore,  it  will  only  engage  [and  these  are

important words, Sir] 30, 50 or, let us say, 500  of

Singapore's  labourers; take away 500 of Singapore's

unemployed labourers at a cost of $50 million.'



<br><br>We  do not accept this figure of 50 nor do we accept

the  figure of even 500. What are the facts? I  have

made  inquiries from the Drainage and Road Engineers

of  the P.W.D. and from the Architects and Engineers

of  the Housing Board and the estimate they gave  me

is  this,  that for every million dollars  worth  of

expenditure,  the following number of jobs  will  be

created  for  one year. A million dollars  worth  of

roads will require 500 workers for a year; a million

dollars  worth of drainage, 350 workers;  a  million

dollars  worth of housing, 270 workers.  We  do  not

know  how the Borneo territories will spend on their

development  schemes as between these three  classes

of  expenditure or whether there will be other types

of   expenditure.  But  let  us  suppose  that  they

distribute the expenditure equally over these  three

categories. This will mean that for every $3 million

spent each year, they will require a labour force of

1,120 of whom half must come from Singapore and this

$3  million gives us 560 men working for  one  year.

Therefore,  if they spend $30 million a year,  which

is  the $150 million loan for five years, this  will

give  total  employment to some 11,200  workers,  of

whom half or 5,600 workers will come from Singapore.

I  say that this will make substantial inroads  into

our unemployment figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 55 (col. 504), the Member for Hong Lim

entered   into  some  truly  absurd  and   fantastic

calculations the details of which he has  not  given

to  the Assembly. He states that while Singapore  is

contributing  large sums to the Central  Government,

the Borneo States will get some $200 million a year.

Sir,  I  have had the Borneo Constitutional  reports

and documents studied by my officials



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



to check on the accuracy of this assertion, and they

can  find  nothing in any document to say  that  the

Federal  Government will be giving  each  year  $200

million to the Borneo States. On the other hand,  my

information  from  the  calculations  made   by   my

officers  is  that the Borneo territories  of  North

Borneo and Sarawak have an annual tax yield of  $150

million  a  year,  and of this  amount  the  Federal

Government will take over two-thirds of $92  million

in return for which they will pay $20 million by way

of  capitation and road grants. Sarawak will qualify

for some grants depending among other factors on how

large  the deficit is, hut the total amount  is  not

stated.  Certainly to say the Borneo States will  be

getting $200 million a year while we will be paying

the  Federation $100 million a year  is  a  complete

prevarication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small point about the production tax was raised

by  the  Member for Queenstown. He says that  if  it

costs us $1 to make a pair of shoes in Singapore and

$1.50  in  the Federation, then the Singapore  firms

will be taxed 50 cents a pair to equalise the costs.

Similarly,  there will be a production tax  on  eggs

because we produce eggs cheaper than the Federation.

Sir,  this is Litter and unqualified drivel.  May  I

refer  to Annex J, Article 1 (3)  (a)  which describes

the  production tax as a tax on produce  in  a  low-tariff  State  which will offset  the  costs  - since

there  is  a  typing error in my text, I had  better

refer  to  Annex I, Article I (3)  (a)  on  production

tax:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... tax on producers in a low-tariff State which

would offset the cost inequalities arising from  the

differential import duties.'



<br><br>In  other words, it is only where the import  duties

are different then there will be a production tax to

equalise  this  difference in the costs.  Where  the

difference  in  costs is due to other reasons,  like

the  differences in types of machines  used,  better

management,  cheaper labour or what have  you,  then

the production tax will not apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point I want to underline in

regard to these financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



arrangements. The money we are paying to the Federal

Government,  now agreed at 40 per cent  of  national

taxes  collected in Singapore, is not a  gift  or  a

grant.  Some political Parties are deliberately  and

dishonestly trying to misrepresent this contribution

as  a  free  gift. It is abundantly clear  from  the

document  in  Misc. 4 of 1963 that the  calculations

have  regard  to  the  cost  of  running  Federation

departments in Singapore and the cost of certain Pan-Malaysian   services  such  as   Defence,   External

Affairs,  Parliament  and other  matters  for  which

Singapore  should reasonably make a contribution.  I

understand  that the Member for Anson has  suggested

that  the people have been crucified and that  their

pockets are then picked - this is his description  of

the  contribution. I think this is one of  the  most

fatuous statements made by the Member for Anson, who

has made many of them in this House. But all Members

of   the  Opposition  have  conveniently  overlooked

paragraph  8  of  Annex J. This  provides  that  the

financial arrangements shall be reviewed at the  end

of   1964  and  every  two  years  thereafter.   The

agreement should be first by negotiation between the

two  Governments,  and if they  cannot  come  to  an

agreement,  then an independent assessor recommended

by  the  World Bank shall consider the position  and

make  recommendations which will be binding on  both

Governments.  Surely, the Member for  Anson  is  not

suggesting  that the World Bank will participate  as

an accessory in the act of pick-pocketing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said a moment ago, our contribution is

not  a  free gift. In fact, about three-quarters  of

the  money we will be paying to the Federation after

Malaysia  is  already being spent  in  Singapore  on

services provided by the Singapore Government.  This

represents payments which we are actually making now

to  Singapore  departments such as the  Police,  the

Singapore   Infantry  Regiment,  the  Prisons,   the

Judiciary,  the  Immigration Department,  the  Civil

Aviation  Department,  the Audit  Office  and  other

departments which will be transferred to the Federal

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



after  31st August this year. The remaining  quarter

represents  mainly the increased  costs  of  Defence

expenditure   consequent   on   confrontation    and

Malaysia. There should be no difficulty in  arriving

at  the  proper costs of running Federal departments

in  Singapore, and in the review made at the end  of

1964,  we shall know whether or not the Armed Forces

and   the   Police  maintained  by   the   Malaysian

Government  in  all territories will  have  achieved

their  planned rate of growth. If they do not,  then

there  will  be  changes  in future  percentages  of

contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will end up on some observations about our

rate of industrial growth both at the present moment

and  our  prospective rates after the Common Market.

The  Member  for Anson has scoffed at our  prospects

and  present  position of industrial expansion.  But

may I quote briefly from a document published by the

Economic Intelligence Unit. This organisation  makes

regular studies and economic reviews of every region

in  the  world and publishes for private circulation

quarterly reports available to subscribers.  I  wish

to  quote from page 42 of No. 42 of the Review dated

June 1963. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In recent months Singapore has received greater

international attention. Apart from the advantage of

constituting  the  business centre  for  the  coming

Federation  and the incentive provided by  its  free

port status even when modified, Singapore's industry

draws  further investment through its concentration.

The  instability of the Island's political situation

and  its  poor  industrial relation have  failed  to

offset the very real advantages which Singapore  can

offer.  The Economic Development Board is  extremely

efficient.  Singapore spends ten times  as  much  on

promotion as does the Federation. Overheads are  low

in  Singapore; discharging costs are more  expensive

at  Port  Swettenham. It is significant that whereas

present  estimate  construction  of  1,800  feet  of

berthing space in Port Swettenham costs $14 million,

5,000  feet at what will be one of the largest  bulk

handling  harbours in Asia - Jurong - will  cost  only

$14 million.'



<br><br>This is the point:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore has in fact reached a stage where it is

likely to attract new industries more regularly than

Hongkong,  let  alone Selangor and  Perak.  Although

wage  levels  for unskilled labour are substantially

higher  than Hongkong, the differential  is  not  so

great in wage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



for  skilled labour. Moreover, Singapore  can  offer

industrial  land at one-tenth the cost of  Hongkong.

Abundant  water  supply, port facilities  which  are

unlikely  to  be affected by silting and  land  free

from speculators and squatters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these conditions and particularly in view of

its  credit  worthy status, that is,  credit  worthy

status  established by the World Bank, the prospects

for Singapore's industry looks bright.'.



<br><br>Now,  Sir, this was written before the agreement  on

the  Common Market, and I am certain that  with  the

additional  impetus provided by the  Common  Market,

Singapore will be an even more attractive centre  of

industrial  investment. I am hopeful that  we  shall

see  an  unprecedented rate of industrial growth  in

the  next five years. But this is conditional on one

factor,  that is, the future government of Singapore

will  maintain  the high standards of integrity  and

continue  the effective economic policies which  the

P.A.P. Government has initiated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when we

took office in 1959 there was no lack of prophets of

doom.  The  Member  for Tanglin,  who  is  curiously

silent  in  this debate, was all the time  bemoaning

the   flight   of   capital  from   Singapore,   the

contraction   of  business  and  the  imminence   of

economic  collapse. Today nobody thinks along  these

terms other than the irresponsible Opposition of the

pro-Communist Left, whose contact with  reality  has

always  been tenuous, whose capacity for reason  and

logic  is  infantile, and whose regard for truth  is

non-existent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will press on regardless of the futile

and  now pathetic efforts of the anti-national  Left

to  pull  the country down. After Malaysia  and  the

Common  Market, I see a bright future for our people

and  our  country - a future in which each and  every

one  of  us will have a fair opportunity to  develop

our talents to the full and to make our contribution

for the prosperity of all.



<br><br>10.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, in debating the motion in the name  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister  on  the  subject  of  the  Malaysia

Agreement  and financial arrangements,  I  will  not

take long because I merely wish to clarify the stand

of  the  Alliance Members in this Assembly. Although

the   Member  for  Farrer  Park  has  submitted   an

amendment to this motion, the newspapers,  I  regret

to  say,  have twisted all the facts that have  been

stated  in  this Chamber. Except for the Member  for

Joo  Chiat,  the  stand of the Alliance  Members  on

Malaysia  is  clear and has been  explained  by  the

Member  for Farrer Park. Since this problem was  put

forward in the Assembly, we have supported it  right

from the beginning until the referendum was held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twists and turns of the P.A.P. in their

attempt  to  divide  U.M.N.O.  Members  and   S.P.A.

Members  is typical of the P.A.P., although we  have

announced clearly that there are no U.M.N.O. Members

nor  S.P.A. for that matter. We are representing the

Alliance in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the amendment brought up by the Member

for  Farrer Park, which has been brought up  not  in

the  interests of party politics hut with foresight,

and  which will determine the destiny of the  people

of  Singapore, as different from the tactics adopted

by  the  Government on the question of the  Malaysia

Agreement   in  which  is  contained  the  Singapore

Constitution. The Singapore Constitution belongs  to

all  the people of Singapore, and is not merely  the

property of the P.A.P. Government. Because it is the

property of the people of Singapore, we are  of  the

opinion  - and I personally, Mr Speaker, although  I

am  new to parliamentary practice, I must say it  is

clear  to  me  I  see the dangers arising  from  the

amendments which have been inserted and as contained

in  the  Blue Book issued in England. In the  United

Kingdom   edition,  the  first   amendment   is   in

connection  with the tenure of office of Assemblymen

and  it  does  not  state that if a  Member  of  the

Assembly resigns or is expelled from the Party, then

his  seat automatically becomes vacant. We  ask  the

Government to explain in which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



constitution    in    countries    which    practise

parliamentary democracy are party matters  inserted.

We have only heard a reply from the Minister for Law

that  this  state of affairs exists in  France,  and

although it is true, the method of election is  that

of  the continental system on a party basis. I think

that  explanation is reasonable. On the other  hand,

we have witnessed the Cabinet changes in France. The

Prime Minister of the Cabinet holds office for  even

less  than  one  month.  This  is  proof  that   the

amendment is justified. This, the Government claims,

is an effort to find a stable and strong government.

If  this amendment is carried and enshrined  in  the

future  Singapore Constitution, I can  foresee  evil

consequences.  We  have seen  Members  crossing  the

Floor,  as has been done by the Member for Aljunied.

Now  we are faced with the practice of parliamentary

democracy.  If  we  like  to  follow  the  model  in

England, we know that the Government Back benches do

criticise  their  own Government, because  the  Back

benches are given an opportunity to criticise  their

own  Government  if it is considered  that  national

matters  are  more  important  than  party  matters.

Similarly,  we  of  the Alliance. On  this  problem,

although  it  has  been  said  that  the  Federation

Government has given its consent, we have moved this

amendment with a full sense of responsibility to the

State  of  Singapore. We object to the insertion  of

this  particular  clause in  the  Assembly.  If  the

Government is unable to accept our amendment, and in

view of the fact that it is an important matter  and

we   desire  to  uphold  democratic  principles   in

Singapore, we are prepared to face the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, secondly, the question of the Singapore Constitution which can be amended conveniently. Only the Government can amend the Constitution. The Constitution is very loose; it has no value at all. We know that to uphold democratic

principles, an amendment to the constitution must be

given  careful  consideration. If we can  amend  the

constitution easily, the consequences will  be  very

bad  indeed. Therefore, we demand that every article

in the Constitution to be amended must receive a two-thirds majority vote. This is normal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



parliamentary practice. I cannot understand why  the

Government  wishes to make the clause  so  loose.  I

think it has its own reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the question of filling of vacancies

in  the  Assembly.  It should be  enshrined  in  the

Constitution.  If  it  is  not  emphasised  in   the

Constitution  - we have seen examples  in  Singapore,

because of the absence of a particular clause  which

binds the Government; although we may try to put the

blame   on  the  previous  Government,  it  is   our

responsibility   today,   when   we   discover   the

weaknesses,  to  rectify  the  errors.  Should   any

vacancy occur in future, we do not wish to leave  it

to  the  whims  and fancies of the Party  in  power.

Therefore, if the Government is unwilling to  accept

the amendment moved by the Alliance of Singapore, we

will  be  forced to be a party to the  mistakes  and

errors  perpetrated by the Government, to  sign  the

agreement  which they claim has been  agreed  to  by

three  parties  on  the  subject  of  the  Singapore

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider this matter affects the destiny of the

people  of  Singapore. I think I have clarified  our

stand  on this matter which, as I have said earlier,

has been twisted and turned by the newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in connection with the Singapore

Government  reaching an agreement with  the  British

Government  to  recover  War  Department  lands   in

Singapore.  I welcome the action taken  because  the

point has, in fact, been raised that we are short of

land  in Singapore. In connection with Blakang Mati,

which  will be the main concentration of development

in  Singapore in future, as the Malay proverb  goes:

"We  do  not  wish  to  have the  incident  repeated

twice."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given my co-operation to the Government

regardless  of  party  politics  or  otherwise.  The

island   of  Samulun  has  been  acquired   by   the

Government  for development by Economic  Development

Board  for  the purposes of putting up factories.  I

have given my fullest co-operation and has, in fact,

written  to the Economic Development Board  so  that

the islanders affected will be given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



suitable   alternative  accommodation.  After   much

persuasion  the  islanders have  agreed  to  be  re-settled  in a nearby island. But what has  happened?

Although  the  Chairman of the E.D.B. has  given  an

assurance  that I will be notified of  developments,

today  - I  wrote the letter on 27th September,  1962

- suddenly  without  my knowledge  summonses  by  the

court  have  been issued to the islanders  demanding

that they quit because they are considered to be  in

illegal occupation of State land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given my co-operation to the Government,

but in return I cannot agree with, in fact, I object

to the action taken by the Government. I do not wish

this  to happen to the residents at Blakang Mati.  I

know the Government is giving full consideration  to

the  development of Blakang Mati, and I hope it will

give serious consideration in the future. These  are

the two points I wish to raise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me give a reply

to  the Minister for Finance. He talked about yearly

contributions. He said that the Barisan Sosialis, in

calculating  the contribution made by  Singapore  to

the  Federal  Parliament,  is  wrong  in  two  ways.

Firstly,  the $124 million is 40 per cent  plus  $36

million. He made the first mistake that it should be

capital   expenditure,  whereas  we  treat   it   as

recurrent expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in fact, in regard to this question, we have not made any mistake at all.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member detach his ear-piece

from  the  microphone? It affects  the  loudspeaker.

[Interruption] Mr Chan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the Nanyang

Siang  Pan of the 13th of July, there was  a  report

about  a  Press  conference given by the  Federation

Minister of Finance. That was when Mr Tan Siew  Sin

had  returned from London. He said in Singapore that

of  the Federal taxes collected in Singapore, 40 per

cent would be given to the Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



Government.  In  addition to this,  Singapore  would

also  have to shoulder its Inland Revenue,  Customs,

Excise,  Broadcasting  and Administrative  expenses.

This  expenditure is a recurrent one. In  regard  to

internal   security,   defence   and   other   major

expenditure. Singapore would also be responsible for

their contributions. He also said further that  this

burden  did not include the 40 per cent taxes  which

Singapore   would  have  to  give  to  the   Central

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that the figures were not recurrent

but  capital expenditure. Have we been wrong in this

calculation?  No,  we have not been  wrong,  because

Misc. Paper 4 of 1963 - Document No. V UI, the fourth

paragraph. This is a letter written by the Tunku  to

the Prime Minister. It says (Mr Chan Sun Wing spoke

in English) -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member now suddenly switches

on  to  English.  If  he wishes to  quote  from  the

document  in  English,  he  must  paraphrase  it  in

Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was quoting

Document  No. VIII. The fourth paragraph  says  that

the  Singapore  Government will pay to  the  Federal

Government  the  cost  of  capital  development   of

Federal  projects in Singapore other  than  projects

for Defence and Internal Security. In this paragraph

the  Tunku does not say that this is included in the

40  per cent taxes. Therefore, it is clear. But  the

Minister for Finance says that we have included this

amount  of expenditure into the 40 per cent. Who  is

wrong  after  all? I think the Minister for  Finance

himself is wrong. Here we should also like to  point

out  that  the  amount Singapore  will  have  to  be

responsible for is not only this: there is more than

this,   because  according  to  Misc.  4  of   1963,

paragraph 51 at page 19, we know that the difference

in  the amount Singapore will have to contribute  to

the  Borneo  territories - in this  respect  Singapore

will have to lose $4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question of the profits of the Currency

Board,  on  page  49, apportionment. Singapore  will

also have to lose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



another  $10 million. Therefore, under this sort  of

merger  arrangement, the losses  of  the  people  of

Singapore far exceed 40 per cent. In other words, in

addition to the 40 per cent contribution, we have to

incur various kinds of losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the loans and the 50 per cent of

labour mentioned by the Minister for Finance. If  we

were  to  go  according to the  calculation  of  the

Minister, then every year in North Borneo $3 million

investment could provide jobs for 1,120 workers.  If

we were to go according to a $30 million investment,

to  make  the calculation, then in the future  three

years,   the  same  amount  of  money  invested   in

Singapore  would  bring  out  11,200  jobs.  Can  it

resolve our unemployment situation here? Is  it  not

important  to  resolve Singapore's own  unemployment

problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Minister for Finance

is  this. He said that the Barisan Sosialis, on  the

question  of military expenditure, has been adopting

contradictory views. He said, on the  one  hand,  we

criticise  the increase of military expenditure.  On

the other hand, we oppose the Mutual Defence Treaty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question, the Barisan Sosialis stand is

not  contradictory at all - our views  on  these  two

items   are   not  contradictory.  If  the   Malayan

Government or the Malaysia Government adopts a  good

neighbourly policy in foreign affairs, then it  will

not  have  to  incur  this  great  sum  of  military

expenditure.  This  expenditure has  been  necessary

because  of the foreign policy of the Federation  of

Malaya, which involves the Federation in a cold war.

At the same time, we cannot forget that Indonesia is

still suspicious of Malaysia. This is because Malaya

has  been used by Britain and America as a base  for

subversive  activities against  Indonesia,  and  the

present  Malayan Government is still closely  allied

with Britain and the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Government of Malaya adopts a neutral

stand  and a non-alignment policy and take the  side

of  the Afro-Asian countries, the expenditure in the

military field will be increasing - not to talk about

the fact that a country like Malaya is unable to  be

an instrument in a Western cold war.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth point, the Minister for Finance

criticised  us.  He said that the  Barisan  Sosialis

does   not  want  industrialisation.  This  is  also

contrary  to  facts. According to what the  Minister

for  Finance  has said a little while ago,  the  so-called   Common  Market  and  industrialisation   in

Singapore  mean only the establishment  of  assembly

plants,  enabling foreign capitalists to send  their

half-finished products to be assembled in Singapore.

This  will  be  detrimental to the establishment  of

industries  in  a half-developed country,  and  will

only  be contributing to a new method to enable  the

capitalists and colonialist countries to continue to

exploit  Singapore. There will be no change  in  the

economic situation at all here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what the Prime Minister has said, that

Britain  has persuaded the Federation Government  to

include  the  terms of the Common  Market  into  the

Constitution, we can see that the Common Market  and

the  industrialisation plan will not  alter  British

benefits here. If so, they would not have agreed  to

such terms being included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will briefly reply to what the Minister for Culture said yesterday. Yesterday evening between 8.15 and 8.30 p.m. the Minister for Culture mentioned 59 times the word "Communist". According to today's Nanyang Siang Pau, in which is printed his speech, in about 30 paragraphs he used

107  times  the word "Communist". From this  we  can

judge that if we were to cancel the word "Communist"

from  the  dictionary of the Minister  for  Culture,

then  he  will  not be in a position  to  write  any

article at all. I would not like to spend more  time

on  this  kind of Minister who is suffering  from  a

Communist phobia. But I would like to reply in a few

words  to  what he said when he brought  out  a  few

photographs in this Assembly yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that he said that the Singapore National Construction Workers Union deliberately wanted to disturb the Prime Minister. Whether or not the Prime Minister had been there on a visit, this Union had its own loudspeakers, because they had been going according to the directions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Registrar of Societies in  convening  their

annual  members' conference at their  premises.  The

Minister  also  commented on  the  lighting  of  the

premises of this Union suddenly going off.  But,  in

actual  fact,  the  lighting normally  goes  off  at

exactly  the time mentioned by the Minister, because

they normally go home to sleep at roughly that time.

Yet  our Prime Minister described it as his victory.

This sort of victory can be described as Ah Q's type

of victory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Prime Minister has returned, let me

reply  briefly to what he has said. In  moving  this

motion,  he  seems  to  be  deliberately  describing

himself as a great personage, as though without  him

there  will be no Malaysia. According to the Nanyang

Siang  Pau  of 31st July - there is a report  on  his

speech  - he said, "I spent about two years  to  make

the British Government believe that if Singapore and

the  Federation of Malaya were not brought together,

the  British would lose the two territories. In  the

end  the  British  were made to  believe  that  this

analysis  was  correct."  The  Prime  Minister   has

exaggerated: he has been bragging too  much.  If  we

refer  to  the report, the first sentence says  that

the   concept   of  the  coming  together   of   the

territories of Singapore, Borneo, Sarawak and Malaya

has  been discussed for many years. Could it be  the

Prime  Minister,  or could it be  the  Minister  for

Culture  who  has  brought about Malaysia,  who  has

convinced  the  British? Or  is  it,  as  the  Prime

Minister has described, the electronic computer that

has  brought about Malaysia? When the Prime Minister

moved  his  motion, his speech was filled  with  all

sorts  of  threats levelled at the Opposition.  This

- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Prime Minister does not

know  that  the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon   has

undertaken to complete his speech in 30 minutes.  So

if there is any interjection, time will be lost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The reactionary

elements  and  the P.A.P. want to adopt  suppressive

measures and all sorts of tactics to prevent us from

getting    our    victory   through    parliamentary

constitutional means. But we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



believe  that  the labouring classes  can  seek  and

secure  all  sorts of means from among ourselves  to

counter  these tactics. We want to remind those  who

claim  to  be  champions of parliamentary  democracy

that  unless  they are prepared to  take  off  their

cloak  of  parliamentary democracy, they should  not

adopt   all   sorts  of  tactics  to   prevent   the

representatives  of  the  labouring   classes   from

entering   Parliament  to  take  up  their  rightful

places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I will say a few words on our stand in

regard to what the Member for Farrer Park has  said.

His   amending  motion,  in  principle,  is  a  good

amendment.  But  we cannot support  it  because  the

whole  Constitution  is no  good.  It  is  bad.  For

instance,  a  person has sores on his  toes.  It  is

useless to cut off his toes. It will not be  of  any

help.  And  we  have also decided that  we  want  to

abstain from voting on this amendment. Otherwise the

P.A.P. will  construe our action as supporting  the

Prime Minister's motion, because the basic character

of   this  amending  motion  does  not  change   the

substance of the original motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the question whether the P.A.P. is

confident of itself, everybody is clear. I hope they

will  look after themselves, because more  and  more

people  will  begin to know after 31st  August  that

there are at least three Back-benchers of the P.A.P.

who  will either have to leave the P.A.P. themselves

or  be expelled by the P.A.P. 31st August will come.

It  is  just  around  the  corner  -  [Interruption]

Whether  you describe what I have said as a divisive

action  it does not matter, but we can see that  the

P.A.P.,  as  a  political force  in  this  area,  is

already finished.



<br><br>11.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped,

although somewhat forlornly, that before the end  of

this Assembly, the House would rise to the occasion.

We  are  debating today not the future of the P.A.P.

or  the  future  of  the Barisan  Sosialis,  or  the

Singapore  Grand Alliance. We are taking a  decision

of momentous proportions, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



because it is of momentous proportions, I have  been

somewhat  circumspect in the way in which my  motion

has  been  phrased.  I  wish  to  repeat  that  this

adoption is a conditional adoption, subject  to  all

the  terms  which have been agreed in the  documents

set  out in Misc. 5 of 1963, which. I think, in view

of the way the debate has gone, I shall have to take

the House through in some detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had expected, whatever happens, the

Communists, like the Member for Upper Serangoon,  to

take   the  same  consistent  anti-national,   anti-Malaysia  line. They cannot change, it is  too  late

for them. I had expected the Member for Hong Lim who

is a specialist well versed in the arts of The Three

Kingdoms  to  take exactly a parallel line  but  not

quite.  As I have explained earlier in the  opening,

there  are  cohorts going into battle. They  believe

they  have  25  per cent; I think it  is  less  now.

Somebody  has to inherit this 25 per cent.  And  the

Member for Hong Lim is hoping that the banner of the

Barisan Sosialis will fall from their grasp  as  the

battle is joined after the 31st of August: and  then

seeing  a similar banner with a similar slogan,  the

cohorts  will go with him. I had even half  expected

the Member for Anson, true to his real nature, to do

another acrobatic act. The miracle that he performed

in  July/August  last year, he has unperformed  this

year: back again - second-class citizenship, Singapore

is being sold out. Sir, what he said and what I said

is   on  the  record  and  on  the  tapes  of  Radio

Singapore. We could play them back. I could take him

through every single clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I did not expect the stupidity of the Grand

Alliance. Sir, I do not know if they knew what  they

were doing. Perhaps the 15 seats rattled them whilst

I  was  away  in Cameron Highlands at  the  Security

Council  meeting, and they suddenly took a  position

of   being   against  the  Government  and   against

everything.  But I would have thought that  even  if

one   plays   poker,   one   should   consider   the

possibilities of winning. Taking this  line,  lining

up  with the Barisan Sosialis to the point where the

Member  for Upper Serangoon for the first  time  has

found words to praise the Member for Farrer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



Park,  I do not think, Mr Speaker, Sir, with  great

respect, is an intelligent line. It is not the  sort

of thing which sensible coherent leaders do, if they

calculate. And I make no bones about the  fact  that

we spend all our time calculating the possibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will first dispose of the Grand Alliance

because they are the less troublesome. By doing this

somersault,  what little following they  have,  they

have  thrown into complete disarray. I do  not  know

whether  they know the incalculable consequences  of

leaders  suddenly doing a volte face. I  would  have

thought  that they were more right than I was;  they

were  more determined to have merger at any cost.  I

was  determined on merger on fair and just terms  or

to  let the British take the consequences, and  even

now  that  is my position. I know there are  members

from  the U.K. Commission who are listening and  who

will be reading this with great interest, and I  say

this  categorically, that what we say  categorically

we  never withdraw from. If the terms set out in the

exchanges of letters, including the documents signed

by  the  Tunku,  the envelope - the piece  of  toilet

paper,  according to the Member for  Cairnhill  - are

not  fulfilled, then I am not prepared to defend the

Constitution:  I  do not have to.  These  are  terms

agreed.   They  are  conditions  precedent   to   my

signature at Marlborough House on the night  of  8th

July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for the S.P.A. I was not here, because I

had many other matters of a constitutional nature to

attend to. I thought the saddest thing was that  the

Member for Cairnhill was no longer in a position  to

lead his Party in this debate. He had to leave it to

the Member for Farrer Park. Sir, I have always had a

lot  of time for the Member for Farrer Park. He  was

in  his  own  way trying to do what he  thought  was

right.  He  did  not  want to see  this  country  go

Communist; he did not want to see the country go  to

ruin  and  he  was  determined to  have  merger  and

Malaysia.  I read his speech in today's papers  with

some  sorrow,  because this was not an  occasion  to

play  party  politics. He could have  risen  to  the

occasion. He could really have led



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



and  retrieved  the position for the Grand  Alliance

- grand only in name, Mr Speaker. What did he do? He

took out legalistic points about the changes in  the

Constitution  and he has got three of  them  on  the

amendments.  What happens to Members of this  House?

Are  they automatically out of this Assembly because

they  have changed sides? What happens to the Member

for  Aljunied? Is the Member for Farrer Park  really

that  ignorant  of  the law?  This  law  is  not  of

retrospective  effect.  It  applies  to   the   next

Assembly,  the next elections. Is he that  ignorant,

or  was he trying to score a few points? He said  he

would  have preferred to give a $25 million straight

grant,  it would have been much cheaper and that  it

would have saved Singapore more money. Sir, I do not

want to go into this, but he has asked for this. Has

he  stopped to consider what he was saying? That his

own  principals  in Kuala Lumpur - and  I  call  them

principals and the Gentlemen in front of me  agents,

the  local  branch, the local agents; whatever  they

say they are no more than that -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Clarify, by all means.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish

to  clarify  that we have received no  directive  or

instruction   from  the  Federation.  We   carefully

weighed the matter before we made our decision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A tactical position, Mr

Speaker, Sir. Nobody really believes the Member  for

Cairnhill,  or  for that matter the Member  for  the

Southern Islands, is going to stand up and say. "Boo

to  the  Tunku"?  Can they say boo  to  the  Tunku's

signature  on these documents? Are they saying  that

they would have done better if they had been in  our

place  giving $25 million away? $1½ million interest

in perpetuity plus $25 million which will never come

back.  Let us go into the calculations, $1½  million

in  perpetuity; 5½ per cent interest at  World  Bank

rate. We are lending $100 million; half labour; five

years,  no  interest; after five years,  if  we  are

prosperous: World Bank review, by all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



means. But they must make Singapore prosperous: they

must  not  stymie Singapore. Furthermore, the  money

will  have  to be paid back. After the  fifth  year,

interest will be paid: fifteenth year, paid back and

the  Central Government guarantees the repayment.  I

say that is a business-like arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Farrer Park has raised three

amendments. I reject them utterly and absolutely  as

a  face-saving device to find a way out for  himself

and  his Party. He is no ignoramus. He knows the law

and I assume he has read his documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first point is "Terms of office of Members." I

stated  in  this House before I went to London  that

that  was what we were going to do, that in the next

Assembly any Member who is elected on a Party ticket

whose  Party's symbol appears against his name,  and

if  he  is expelled or resigns or crosses the Floor,

he  automatically  vacates this House.  We  are  the

Government,  Sir, and we do this. If  they  win  the

elections - make this an election issue - they have the

right under section 19 of the State Constitution  to

change  it back and play musical chairs. Go back  to

the  people. I am prepared to do that, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.  That is my stand. Vote against this and I will

go  back  to  the  country  and  fight  on  this  by

ourselves and we will prove that they are wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is "Safeguards for constitutional

position   of  Singapore".  They  want   even   more

constitutional safeguards. The Government is not  to

be  trusted; you must have a two-thirds majority  of

the  Assembly. I say by all means. If they could get

it,  if they are men of such great influence in  the

Grand Alliance, let them go to Kuala Lumpur and  get

the  Tunku  and  his colleagues  to  agree.  I  will

welcome it rapturously and give them full marks  for

it.  Do something which is quite different from  all

the  other  States. By all means. My worry  is,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, and I think the worry of the people of

Singapore  is  not that the Singapore Government,  a

non-Alliance   Government,   will   agree   to   the

Federation Government in giving a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



concession not to our interest but that an  Alliance

Government would not be in a position to resist.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> The more reason why

you should not agree.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, exactly. If the Member

for  Farrer  Park could only go to the Residency  in

Kuala Lumpur and get it for us, we would welcome it.

I  will  reconvene  an  emergency  sitting  of  this

Assembly and amend Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963. Why not? I

will  write  to the Tunku and mention this  and  say

that this is at the special behest of the Member for

Farrer  Park and his colleagues who are afraid  that

because  they  would  not  be  able  to  resist  the

Federation,   therefore,  they   should   have   the

safeguards. Is that what he says? That is what he is

reduced to - playing party politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third point is "Filling of vacancies". What is

undemocratic about that? That is the constitution we

have  got.  That  is the position in  Britain.  Hugh

Gaitskell,  a Labour Leader, died in September  last

year  shortly after the Prime Ministers' conference.

His  by-election did not take place till  last  June

this year. What is undemocratic about it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The House of Commons issues the writ.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Exactly. The House of Commons

and  the Government - Their majority is that - I mean

really   must  we  be  reduced  to  this   niggardly

argument?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is not niggardly. It is fundamental.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Fundamental - good.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Farrer Park

wishes  for elucidation, I am sure if he  stands  up

the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely. I never refuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> remained seated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Make it another election

issue. If they win, change the Constitution. This is

a  State  Constitution. It can  be  changed  at  the

behest of the State Assembly. Even if we drafted  it

the  way  the  Member for Farrer Park wanted,  there

would be nothing to prevent us from amending it  the

way  we  want, if and when we win the next election.

They  can  do  it if and when they win. But  perhaps

they  consider the possibility of winning is such  a

remote  eventuality that they have no confidence  in

themselves and that they are thinking of conscribing

a P.A.P. Government. The next contest is between the

Communists and us. I said that over four years  ago,

at  the  last general election. It must be, and  the

last  Governor was wise enough. Had the  Member  for

Cairnhill  had his way, we would have been  scrubbed

out  from the contest and he would have had to  meet

the Communists and he would have been mashed up into

mince-meat. We are here in one piece and  we  intend

to  be  here  to  fight for what is  right  for  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Member for Cairnhill. Sir, I was not here,

but  I  was told he said, "Well, what is wrong about

trying  to  make  a  little  bit  of  money  selling

aeroplanes  and  airports?"  Nothing  at  all,   Mr

Speaker,  Sir. There is nothing wrong with that.  If

he  can make 5 per cent on $50 million, good luck to

him.  That  is  $2½ million. Why not? All  over  the

world  there  are  contact men. If  you  are  not  a

contractor, you can be the chap who knows how to get

a  contract, or how to sell aeroplanes, even  though

you know nothing about aircraft. Why not? But what I

am  saying is that is incompatible with his position

as a leader of the people of Singapore. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am sure you will never dream of doing it, for

I  would feel somewhat ashamed. On the one hand, you

say, "I will fight for the rights of Singapore," and

stand  up to K.L. and say, "Boo" and "No", which  we

have  to  do  from time to time, even after  merger,

after  Malaysia: and, on the other  hand,  you  say,

"Would  you please buy this?" You know, you probably

will  not get all the 5 per cent. You have  to  give

cuts all along the line. Two per cent here, half per

cent there, and maybe you wind up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



with 2½ per cent. But still it is a lot of money.  I

say  that is what is wrong. It is incompatible  with

standing  up  for  the  rights  of  the  people   of

Singapore.  And  instead of  choosing  to  meet  the

argument  - what I say here, Mr Speaker, Sir,I  am

prepared to say outside; no privilege - but  what  he

said  here about Lee & Lee making money out  of  the

Indonesians, implying that I and my wife are  making

money  because of my position, I say, let  him  step

out  of this Chamber, say that, and I give him  full

justification  to  prove it.  I  will  go  into  the

witness box. The plaintiff in a suit for libel  goes

into  the witness box. He is cross-examined  and  is

put  under close scrutiny. I am not afraid. My hands

are clean and so are those of my colleagues. That is

why  we are alive. His colleagues - what has happened

to  them? Iron mining, factories - all lucrative, Mr

Speaker, Sir. None of them that I know of are  dying

of  starvation or malnutrition. But let me tell  him

this.  "Arrogant", he calls us. No - we are proud  to

belong to a group of men who will stand up for  what

it  is right regardless of their personal interests.

And  let me say this, that in the last three  months

we stood the risk that if Malaysia failed because we

stood  for our rights, the risk of having really  to

face  big trouble. It was a calculated risk. We also

stand the risk of being dealt with, now that we have

got  the Finance Minister in the Federation somewhat

unhappy, because the police will be handed  over.  I

did  not mention Chief Enahoru in jest, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  He was a Chief in his own right before Nigeria

got independence, just as I am a little chief in  my

own  right  here today. And I will not be after  the

31st of August. But I say, regardless of that, we do

our  duty. By the time we have decided to fight  the

principals behind the Member for Cairnhill,  we  are

not  going  to be bought by petty men,  or  thwarted

either by spite or malice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sympathise with the U.M.N.O. Members

because  they are in real trouble. They  know  their

ground  situation. I visited the Member for  Geylang

Serai in his constituency on Sunday. I am sorry if I

had disturbed him till 2.00 a.m. in the morning. But

he knows what the ground situation is like. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



only  one quarrel, Mr Speaker, Sir. That is on what

I  said  about khalwat. Now. I would like to clarify

this.  This is a serious matter for them and for  my

Government.  I  made  the  statement  on   religious

freedom with due circumspection. I think it  is  the

only way out for Singapore. I have been attacked  by

the religious head of U.M.N.O. as interfering in the

affairs of the rights of the Muslims. I desire to do

no  such  thing. The Muslims decide Muslim  law  for

themselves,  and  there  is  the  Administration  of

Muslim  Law Bill. There is a section there  - section

131  (1)   and  131 (2)  - which talks of  cohabitation

outside  marriage,  not khalwat.  Khalwat.  Sir,  is

this.  I  am  sorry we have to go into these  little

details.  But it means a male and a female found  in

close proximity who are not unlawfully married. What

close proximity means is a matter -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not lawfully married.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not lawfully married - yes. If

you  are lawfully married, I think it is all  right.

However, there will be a lot of trouble. I am  quite

sure  it  is  not the intention of any  religion  to

prevent the continuance of mankind. Well, I say that

I  leave  the  Muslims  to decide  Muslim  laws  for

themselves.  What I am saying is that no non-Muslims

in  Singapore will be covered by Muslim law. I think

that is fair. I cannot go beyond that. All I can say

is  that I will not interfere with the Muslims. They

have their wishes. They do as they wish. I have,  at

the  same  time, to speak up for a lot of Buddhists,

Christians and others. And if all Christians  wanted

to  apply canonic law on all Muslims and vice versa,

and  Buddhists,  we would wind up by  slitting  each

other's throat. Once religion becomes a major factor

in  a  multi-racial community, as it did in  Ceylon,

then we are in trouble. I am quite sure that is  not

the  intention  of  Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff.  "Syed"

means a descendant of the Prophet, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  am  quite  sure it is not his intention  to  have

bloodshed  in this country. We have got  on  and  we

have always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



been  grateful  to  the Tunku  for  his  leadership,

because he has allowed everybody to have his  little

bit of liberty, and that is the way we wish to keep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now the points raised - these are points of

substance -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have got another 25 minutes.

I  have got to run through this. I am quite happy to

answer any other points if the Member would write to

me.  I  will give a considered reply. But I want  to

get this on the record.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister is not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Anson talks

about  the  Blue Book and the White Book,  the  Blue

Book  being  the  one in London and the  White  Book

being the one we have tabled here. They are not  the

same.  I  told the House that there were  amendments

and that I was introducing more amendments. They are

not in accordance with the exchange of letters. As I

understood  it  from my colleagues, the  Member  for

Anson considers the Blue Book to be the Master copy.

That  is not so, Mr Speaker, Sir. As far as we  are

concerned,   the   master   copy   is   ours.    The

Constitutional  documents  plus  the  exchanges   of

letters,  and  if the conditions are not  fulfilled,

then I say the British can hand over Singapore. I am

nor  defending  this.  They  can  go  to  Television

Singapura, Radio Singapore, the Press, mass meetings

and  explain.  If  I  am  to explain,  then  I  want

something  which is right, fair, just and honourable

settlement and we stick to the bargain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is fair that I should mention this

letter  which  I  have received. The United  Kingdom

High  Commissioner has written me  a  letter,  dated

today,  saying  that  he would like  all  amendments

which  have been made on the Blue Book to be  agreed

in  precise  terms with the Tunku. He says  "by  the

Tunku",  but I say, "with the Tunku", and  that  the

High  Commissioner should be Informed of it so  that

he  could make the necessary amendments in the Order

in Council which will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



be  made.  My position is quite simple, Mr Speaker,

Sir,If  the  amendments are not  made,  I  am  not

defending this Constitution. I have agreed to what I

have  agreed.  They  are written words,  simple  and

clear,  and must be incorporated, not least  of  all

the  provision on gangsters. I make no secret of the

fact that I view with the greatest apprehension  the

possibility, if this power is removed, of  gangsters

being  involved in elections as they  are  in  other

parts  of  the country. I have got one head gangster

who   was  the  former  driver  of  the  Member  for

Cairnhill under detention in St. John's Island,  and

he  will  remain there. If the Member for  Cairnhill

can  win  the elections without him, he can  release

him  and his own gang. But as long as I am here,  he

will remain, and no gangster will participate in the

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the exchange of letters. The Member for Anson

has  made great play of this, and I think it is only

fair  that I should go through it. He said that  the

first  letter has nine points, not answered. I think

he is being wilfully obtuse, Mr Speaker, Sir. There

are nine points in the letter dated the 8th of July.

Tun  Razak  wrote me a letter on the  18th  of  July

returning me the letters, including this one. I  saw

him personally, and I wrote him back. May I read  my

letter? That was the 22nd July, the day I went up to

Kuala Lumpur:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have your letter of 18th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can ignore the letter containing

the  eight  points [because the last point  was  Cut

out.  Mr  Speaker. Sir] because the note which  the

Tunku  signed said that the last part of this letter

about  the  Inter-Governmental Committee was  to  be

cancelled. This will make no sense unless the letter

is  in Fact published. As for the other points,  you

have  agreed  to  them, although they  will  not  be

enshrined in the Constitution. I am happy  to  leave

it at that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two letters have been superseded by this

signed note and can be ignored.'.



<br><br>The  signed  note is in the photostat  copy  of  the

letter  enclosing. There is a simple interpretation,

Mr   Speaker,  Sir  - the  rule  of  interpretation:

expressio  unius  excusio alterii. "Last  part  out"

- you  will see that - "Ritz Hotel, 8-7-63".  I  heard

that the Member for Anson made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



fun  of  the  Tunku's statement - the letter  of  7th

July.  I  think he was a bit anxious that we  should

not  run  out of the 8th into the 9th and so perhaps

in  the  anxiety  of  the  moment  he  misdated  his

signature.  But I dated it the 8th. "Last  part  out

- Inter. Govt. Committee" -  that refers to point No. 9

in  the  letter of 8th July. The others are in,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point about loans does not have to be

enshrined  in  the  Constitution.  It  is   in   the

Agreement. We are giving a loan of $30 million  each

year  for five years, $20 million interest-free  and

$10  million with interest. If the condition is  not

fulfilled,  the loan is cancelled. I make  no  bones

about   that   either.  This  is   a   business-like

arrangement  in the mutual interests of  the  Borneo

territories  and  Singapore.  The  Federation   have

committed themselves to development to the  tune  of

$500 million. They want to find the money. They have

asked  us  to help with $150 million. All right.  We

are partial bankers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others - "S'pore L. Assemblymen: - resignation

or  expulsion  - vacate seat". That has been  agreed,

and even in a telegram from Kuala Lumpur to my State

Advocate-General,   the  Attorney-General   in   the

Federation  has  agreed to that.  So  what  are  the

Member for Cairnhill and the Member for Farrer  Park

complaining about? If they do not like it,  win  the

next elections and cancel it. Tell the Tunku that he

is  wrong.  "Immigration restriction Order movement.

reciprocal".  We  are  now  talking  in   terms   of

gangsters and other political undesirables.  I  have

stated  that  if  they have the right  to  keep  our

undesirables out, we want Mr James Puthucheary, Mr

Woodhull, and Mr Fong Swee Suan, including Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong (when we prove ultimately that he comes

from   Pontian)  out  of  this  place  and  so  make

Singapore  a healthier, more peaceful and a  happier

place  to  live  in.  Then the Gangsters  Ordinance,

delegation. Sir, I want to make my position clear on

this.  My  State  Advocate-General  has  received  a

communication to say that they were delegated by way

of an executive administrative act, using one of the

Articles of the present Constitution. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



am  not satisfied with that because this must be  in

the  Constitution and not by an administrative  act.

By  an  administrative act, something may happen  in

six  months'  time.  The Member  for  Cairnhill  is

always  buzzing  around in Kuala Lumpur.  I  do  not

blame  him.  He  tries for his  friend.  His  former

chauffeur  who  is  now  in St.  John's  writes  him

plaintive letters. He dare not reply to them because

he  can do nothing about it. The chances are that he

will  remain in a position where he can  do  nothing

about it. And I would like to keep things happy that

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other matter which is of sonic

importance, viz, my letter of 8th July regarding the

$10  million.  All  these are  conditions  before  I

signed  the Agreement. I say that if we do  not  get

the  $10  million, there again it is not  worth  the

British  Government's  while  either.  I  paid   the

British what I thought to be a tribute well deserved

- that  they  are like an electronic computer,  maybe

not  the  representative himself but he has a  team,

the expertise, the experience of a whole machine. If

the  Members think it is worth their while quibbling

about  a few million dollars, it is for them  to  go

and explain to the people of Singapore instead of me

- I  nearly lost my voice. Mr Speaker, Sir.  But  we

are  going  to keep on going at this until  we  nail

every  falsehood down. I came back for that purpose.

When  I  have nailed every falsehood down,  then  we

will go to Africa and make friends because, if Chief

Enchoro  had more friends, there would have  been  a

better  chance. I make no bones about this. We  know

exactly  what we are doing. We calculate the  pieces

on  the chessboard ten moves ahead. That is the  way

it must be done. The enemy does that. They say brave

things in this Chamber, but they know that they  are

gone. Their thinkers and planners behind admit  that

they  have lost the battle against Malaysia - sending

plaintive telegrams to Manila. That is not going  to

help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I dispose of the Member for Anson,

I  think  my  colleague, the Finance  Minister,  has

dealt with the matter at some length. All I want  to

say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



is  this. Sir, on the World Bank team, three of them

were  members  of  a very talented race.  They  were

Jews; very hard-headed businessmen. Three members on

our  Economic Development Board - the Director who was

sent by way of secondment to the United Nations, the

Economic   Adviser  (Prof.  Cahen),  the   Technical

Consultant, and the Chemical Engineer are also Jews;

men  of  considerable talent. So is the  Member  for

Anson.  But  I prefer to put my money on  the  genes

these gentlemen inherited as against the Member  for

Anson.  You  cannot have every member in the  family

talented  with strong muscles and nerves and  compos

mentis. [Interruption] Sometimes [Interruption] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Time is getting on interjections from

the Government Bench should stop.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But it speaks volumes for the

practical and businesslike manner in which they have

set  out their Report. I think we have got our point

across  to the World Bank, as against the Federation

point of view. Let me make no bones about this.  All

this  is  part of history. The Federation  wanted  a

complete economic Customs Union immediately  formed.

Then  we  would have been killed. One-third  of  the

entrepot  trade  would  have  died.  Two-thirds   of

primary  produce  would  not be  affected,  whatever

happens. The other one-third: I am reported  in  the

Press  as saying that it would go, but that  is  not

what  I said. What I said is: over 12 years, we will

have to make other arrangements, as they get covered

by  customs duties', only one-third gets covered  by

customs duties. We have the World Bank on our  side,

partly  because  we have four bright  men  from  the

chosen race speaking to truly bright men - three out

of  the eight - on the other side, also of the chosen

race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a matter of more substance - citizenship. I

expected  this: second-class, and a  whole  host  of

lies  and  falsehoods. But what  is  interesting  is

this.  The  Member  for Anson, who  must  have  some

regard for his own personal professional reputation,

has not taken the line of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis. My colleague,  the  Minister  for

Home  Affairs,  had no time to give a point-by-point

reply.  He will do so through the Press.  A  lot  of

falsehoods  have  been uttered  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown,  either  through  ignorance  or   wilful

malice.  The  Member  for  Anson  took  an  entirely

different  line.  His line was: it is  second-class,

because   there   is  no  freedom  of   association,

education  and  labour. We cannot have  it  on  both

sides.  You  cannot spread butter on both  sides  of

your  bread.  Either  you  have  State  autonomy  in

education and labour, in which case you say you have

the  right  to exclude others from the enjoyment  of

these  privileges, or you go in. If the  Member  for

Anson together with the Member for Cairnhill can win

the  next  elections, and agree to surrender  labour

and  education,  then  so be it.  There  will  be  a

similar   education   policy,  interchangeable   for

students.  We  will all pay taxes  and  the  Central

Government  will  look after everything.  I  put  my

position quite clear in April, and I have done  what

I  have stated. I am prepared to go out publicly  to

explain and defend it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson quoted a Chinese proverb.

My  Political  Secretary - that is  the  advantage  of

having  a  Political Secretary who  is  educated  in

Chinese - said there is no such Chinese proverb. What

he  said  was Li fu t'iau chiang - "A tiger  cornered

has  to  jump over the wall." He said he  has  never

heard  of it because tigers are never found  in  the

city  area where there are walls. I went back during

the  adjournment  and looked up my book  of  Chinese

proverbs. I could not find the proverb. But I  could

find  another  proverb - Kouchi  t'iau  chiang  - "A

cornered  dog  jumps over the wall." That  is  where

they  are - cornered dogs. They asked for this.  They

growled, they barked, they snapped for two years. We

told  them, "For God's sake, be reasonable  domestic

animals." You know, we are feeding them with $500  a

month. We are giving them a reasonable living.  They

went  running around as if they had the rabies.  And

now,  as  the proverb goes, they have t'iau  chiang.

Whether the wall is -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Too

high!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Whether they can really make

the  wall, that is their business. As far  as  I  am

concerned,  my  sympathies are not with  them.  They

asked for this, and they have got it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the real core - "Defence, Article VI,"

says  the  Member for Queenstown. That  is  the  key

reason  for  Malaysia. That is why we are  going  to

spend  a  lot  of  money  on defence;  waste  money.

"Tunku's  foreign policy is wrong," says the  Member

for  Upper  Serangoon. "That is why we have  got  to

spend money."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is not here, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  He wrote me a letter and he wrote you a letter

about this defence agreement which was published  in

1957.  Now  it  is  going to  apply  throughout  the

territories  of  Malaysia. I  say,  "Thank  God  for

that." Let us be realists. Do they really want to go

out  and expect the Federation Army of 8,000 men and

the  Singapore  Army, now Second  Battalion,  2,000;

8,000  +  2,000  equals 10,000 men to fight  against

armies  of  half  a million men? In South-East  Asia

there  are armies of half a million men. I am  here,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, because there is peace, there  is

security; otherwise I think our Serjeant at Arms may

be  absent, if there are riots, commotion: the army,

the  navy, troops capture the city. We cannot expect

chaps  to  turn  up  and behave as  if  nothing  has

happened. This is not a laughing matter I would like

to  point  out to the Member for Anson  - I  hope  he

reads  this.  He  has  condemned  this  document  by

inference,  and throwing it. He says he  is  tabling

it.  Let  me  read him what he agreed to  which  the

British  rejected in 1956. He was giving the British

- I  am  quoting now from Sessional Paper Cmd. 31  of

1956. He is always doing what the former Member  for

Tiong  Bahru  used  to  say,  "Licking  up  his  own

spittle."  This is what he did. He gave the  British

bases in perpetuity. Here we are giving them a lease

- 30  years. After 30 years the lease expires. If  by

30  years  we  have  not stabilised  ourselves  then

really  we  are in trouble. But 30 years is  a  long

time in the life of South-East Asia and we will  see

a  lot  of  changes. We shall grow in  strength  and

stature and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



region  will  grow in stability. Meanwhile,  let  us

have  no  power vacuum. Does he really  want  us  to

close  down  the bases? He will be out of  practice,

Mr Speaker, Sir. There will be no lawyers to defend

all  these  petty cases of seduction and  kidnapping

and  so  on.  When the country is being  looted  and

plundered  and raped, do you think people have  time

to  prosecute  each  other  for  kidnapping,  taking

obscene  pictures and so on? No, Sir. All that  goes

by  the way-side while you try to survive. I do  not

read  that sort of story elsewhere. It only  happens

in  stable, secure societies. Then you get  Profumo,

Christine Keeler, Ward - lewd pictures of eminent men

who  may  or  may not have frolicked in  a  swimming

pool.  Well,  that is a stable society. An  unstable

one  was in Japanese-occupied Singapore. Every other

day  there was a rape case. Nobody took any  notice.

The  Member  for Anson ought to count his  blessings

that because of us he is still making a good living.

But  I  would  like to remind him of this.  That  he

agreed to give in perpetuity - and, what is more, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I do not understand the  Member  for

Anson.  I have tabled documents which I will  defend

and which I intend to defend. "My dear Secretary for

State". He writes to me: "My dear Prime Minister". I

write to Tun Razak - these are formal letters. I  may

be  Tun Razak's old classmate and friend, but we are

writing  to each other in our formal capacities:  My

dear  Deputy  Prime  Minister".  We  never  get  our

personal  and  official capacities mixed  up.  As  a

representative of Singapore, I write  formally.  Not

so the Member for Anson. They make gruesome reading,

you  know. I refer to Misc. No. 2 of 1956. This  was

to  the  old  Secretary  of State:  "My  dear  Alan"

- signed  "David".  Reply: "My  dear  David"  - signed

"Alan".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, things got a hit chilly and the Minister

for  State - No. 2 in the Colonial Office then - said,

"Dear  David",  the "My" has been dropped  out.  But

poor David still wrote: "My dear John". That was Mr

John  Hare.  That is where I said to the Member  for

Cairnhill, he and his former Chief Minister get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



their personal and official capacities mixed up.  Ah

Hong  Construction is Ah Hong Construction. But  the

Singapore  Government  is the Singapore  Government.

They are two different things. I am not saying it is

wrong  to be a contact man to make money. All  I  am

saying is, I think it is an invidious position to be

in,  to  say  that you stand up and  fight  for  the

rights  of  Singapore when, in fact, you are  asking

for  favours.  To  build the  University  of  Malaya

buildings,  Ah Hong Construction got a big  contract

there.  Singapore,  they get their  fingers  chopped

off.  And  I say this goes for even after  Malaysia.

Tenders put in properly, no contact man required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the time for reckoning has now come

[Interruption].  I  am glad to see  the  Member  for

Anson turn up because -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have always made it a point

to  tell Members not to comment on Members coming in

or going out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon. But,

anyway,  everybody is here to be reckoned - to  stand

up and speak up and be counted. The battle lines are

being drawn. The battle lines outside may or may not

he  drawn  and  I  hope things will  be  settled  in

Manila. But the battle lines within the country  are

being  drawn. We had better decide what  jerseys  we

are  wearing. Either you arc for Malaysia or you are

against Malaysia. Do not run with the hare and  hunt

with the hounds. It is an unprofitable business. The

British  may be a little bit squeamish about  having

to do in somebody they had made use of, even a Chief

Minister or a former Prime Minister. But let me say,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that nationalist governments  all

over the world, when they assume power and they face

opposition  which is irresponsible,  deal  summarily

with  it.  And having had to deal with irresponsible

opposition, although very fortunately in  our  case,

we did not have to deal

summarily with them, I nevertheless sympathise  with

those  leaders  - Abu  Bakar of Nigeria,  bong  Chief

Enohoru, extradited, recalled, in gaol: Ghana  chaps

fled to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



neighbouring territories. In Algiers, and  it  is  a

tough place, and they fought a tough war, a Minister

was  shot - assassinated. He was the youngest  Member

of  the  Cabinet. One day after I left, I read  that

one  former  Minister of the Provisional  Government

was  walking along Algiers, a car drew up,  he  went

in, and he has not been heard of since.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sympathies are for law and order. If I tried to

undermine the Tunku's Government, then I expect  him

to  lock me up. I think he would be a fool if he did

not.  It  is  his  duty.  My  business  as  a  loyal

Opposition is to see that Malaysia survives. This is

the time when we all speak up. We are prepared to go

to the country by ourselves and defend this, without

the Grand Alliance. If they want to abstain, they do

so  at  their  own  peril. They  are  playing  party

politics. Why not rise above this pettiness? This is

something  bigger than ourselves. This is  going  to

ensure  our  survival. I am quoting the  Member  for

Farrer Park now. He said that it so happened that  I

was  the  Prime Minister at a time, in  a  situation

where  things came about. The cataclysm took  place,

crystallization,  Malaysia and  merger.  Not  he.  I

played  a  part, yes. Why go against the will  of  a

people to be born, to be free, to survive in a world

full  of  strife  and turmoil? And more  strife  and

turmoil  coming. Let us not misjudge the  situation.

Two thousand chaps are under training in Sarawak;  a

long  border;  arms  are being  supplied.  He  is  a

foolish  man who expects a Central Government  faced

with  that situation to sit back and let the country

go  to  pieces. I for one, Sir, and  I  am  sure  my

colleagues are with me here, will stand up and fight

for Malaysia.
