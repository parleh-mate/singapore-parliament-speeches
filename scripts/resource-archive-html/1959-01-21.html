<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether

he  will make a statement to clarify the stand  of  the

Government with regard to the recent statement  by  the

Consul-General of Indonesia that Indonesia intended  to

change its basic policy towards Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Sir, I am not aware of nor have I

received  official information of any  such  change  of

basic  policy. The Singapore Government now, as always,

desires   to  maintain  friendly  relations  with   the

Republic  of  Indonesia,  to promote  trade  with  that

country  and  to refrain from any interference  in  her

internal affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> It seems that the Chief

Secretary   does  not  have  any  official  information

regarding  the statement made by the Consul-General  of

Indonesia.  Will  the Chief Secretary enlighten  us  on

whether the activities carried out by Indonesian rebels

in  the Colony could have contributed to the Indonesian

Government thinking that it was time for them to change

its basic policy?

each grade, and which brand had the biggest release in

1958 in each grade;

any particular grade exceeded the total releases of all

the other brands in the same grade, and the names of

such brands;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the c.i.f. value-brackets within which each grade

the  middle of November 1958 per 1,000 sticks  of

each  of  the  ten  brands that had  the  biggest

releases  last  year and what was  the  duty  per

information in the Official Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information on release by brands for the whole of

the  release  of any one brand in any particular  grade

exceeded the total releases of all the other brands  in

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether   he  will  make  a  statement  regarding   the

educational  facility  for  those  school-children  who

failed in the secondary school entrance examination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Tiong  Bahru knows as well as any other Member in  this

Assembly  that  the Government's education  policy  has

been  to  provide free primary education for all  those

who  want it in the proper age group. Those born on 1st

January,  1956,  or after are within  this  proper  age

group and even if they failed the entrance examination,

they  will  be allowed to remain in school for  another

year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress that the Government cannot afford to

provide  secondary education for everyone  who  demands

it.  However, Government is doing all it can within the

limits of possibility to find places for all those  who

were  born  between 1st January, 1945 and 1st  January.

1946,  in other institutions such as the Trade  School,

Government evening schools, private schools, commercial

schools  and  now afternoon schools. I have  evolved  a

plan  to  absorb  all  these children  and  I  hope  to

finalise  all  the arrangements by 1st February,  1959.

This in effect fulfils Government's declared policy  of

providing a six-year free primary education as well  as

keeping off the streets all those children who  are  14

or under and all those who failed the recent Government

entrance examination in 1958.

whether  he is aware of the hardships of those  parents

whose  children  have to attend schools  several  miles

alleviate their hardships.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not only

aware  of  the  hardships  of  some  parents  but  also

sympathise  with those whose children  have  to  attend

school several miles away from their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort has been made to put children in schools

nearest their homes but the Member for Tiong Bahru must

understand that there are always more children  in  one

area,  particularly within the City limits, than  there

are places in the schools within that area. Inevitably,

some  children must be posted to schools  further  away

from  their  homes and every citizen of  Singapore  who

understands the rapid growth of the population in  this

island must accept this.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Sir, is the Minister

<div align="center"><b>TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AND INDONESIA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry whether he will make a statement  on  the

present   trade   relations   between   Singapore   and

Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our trade

relations with Indonesia are satisfactory and are  best

reflected in the fact that, despite an eight-cent  drop

in   the  average  price  of  rubber,  our  trade  with

Indonesia  last  year,  when  the  final  figures   are

published,  is  expected  to total  $1,300  million  in

value - only  one  per cent less than in  1957.  To  have

maintained  trade at this level in the  face  of  three

successive years of lower average rubber prices, namely

from  144.16  cents in 1955 down to 96.76 cents,  88.75

and  80.18  cents in 1956, 1957 and 1958  respectively,

is, to say the least, remarkably gratifying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the available January/November trade

figures  as  a basis for an estimate, we find  that  in

1958 imports from Indonesia should total approximately

$968  million - a shortfall of 12 per cent compared with

1957.  However,  the actual volume of  rubber  imported

rose to 311,000 tons from 287,000 tons in 1957. Imports

of other important produce items such as copra, coffee,

tea  and pepper tended to fluctuate and may, when final

figures   are  available,  be  found  to  have  reached

slightly lower levels than in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the export side, I am glad to say that final

statistics are likely to show that exports to Indonesia

last  year rose to over $360 million-an increase of  47

per cent over the 1957 figure. Largely responsible were

increased exports of rice (up approximately 61,000 tons

to  163,000 tons), cotton textiles (up $7.5 million  to

$20.3  million) and art silk piecegoods (up $44 million

to  $54.9 million). A number of other export items made

smaller but significant gains.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the comparatively depressed commodity

position,  this  picture  is  highly  satisfactory  and

reflects the factual state of our trade relations  with

Indonesia. I may perhaps be pardoned, Sir,  if  I  take

this  opportunity to state that the level of trade with

Indonesia  might not have been so satisfactory  had  it

not  been for the constant vigilance and assistance  of

my  Ministry, of which the general public is not aware,

because  we cannot publicise each and every  matter  we

take up or each and every assistance we render.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need dwell on the domestic

difficulties  in  Indonesia.  Suffice  it  to  say,  my

Ministry continues to enjoy friendly official relations

and a high degree of consultation with the officials of

the Indonesian Consulate-General here, and although  we

respect Indonesia's logical desire to expand her direct

trade  connections, we believe that Singapore,  as  the

trade  figures tend to bear out, will remain  a  useful

entrepot for Indonesian produce and requirements, and a

vital  and  advantageous link  in  her  external  trade

economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  has  given us a satisfactory picture  of  the

trade between Singapore and Indonesia. I just quote one

item - rubber.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> According to the statement made by

the Minister for Commerce and Industry, the quantity of

rubber  imported from Indonesia has increased. If  that

is  so,  why is it that so many rubber mills have  shut

down in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Perhaps, Sir, the answer lies in

the  fact  that the comparison I have drawn is  between

1957  and  1958. It is possible that a  drop  might  be

shown  if comparisons were drawn between, say, 1954  or

1955 and 1958.

<div align="center"><b>RICE STOCKPILE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government Policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and

Industry whether he will make a statement on the latest

Government policy regarding the rice stockpile.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry whether he will make a statement  on  the

discussions he has had with the rice merchants and  the

Singapore Chamber of Commerce about the stockpiling  of

rice,  and  whether  he will revise the  present  rice-stockpiling policy of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, with your permission, I will

take  Questions 6 and 7 together because both refer  to

the   same   subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of four rice

Associations  together  with  representatives  of   the

Chinese Chamber of Commerce saw me on 7th January  with

a request for unconditional abolition of the stockpile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained to them that the Government had no desire

to  carry  the  burden  of the stockpile,  but  it  was

necessary in the interest of the general public to have

guaranteed supplies in case of any emergency.  I  asked

them for suggestions as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



to  any  practical alternate machinery  that  could  be

devised to meet this difficulty. They saw the necessity

for  some  practical alternate arrangement to  meet  an

emergency but were unable to suggest a solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then put a suggestion to them that since they

claimed that every rice merchant did maintain a certain

amount  of  stock at all times and that since  most  of

their  stocks  were  held in bank  go-downs,  it  could

perhaps  be a solution if they requested their  bankers

individually  to  guarantee to Government  to  hold  on

their  behalf a minimum specified amount of whole grain

rice  stocks  at all times which will be  available  to

Government on demand at any time. I suggested that such

bank  guarantees  should total to a tonnage  of  25,000

tons. This method would not place any additional burden

on  any of the merchants nor on the public while at the

same time ensuring that stocks will be available in  an

emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some discussion, though all were agreed that the

suggestion   had   possibilities  in   principle,   the

representatives  of  the rice Associations  desired  to

discuss further in their own Associations the practical

aspects of implementing the suggestion and promised  to

let  me know the results. So far I have not heard  from

them and therefore I am not able to give any indication

at  this  stage  of Government's future policy  on  the

stockpile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will of course appreciate that even if my

above  suggestion is agreed to by the trade,  agreement

will  have to be sought from the Federation Government,

as the rice stockpile was set up by joint agreement.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Will the Minister inform the House

the total tonnage of the stockpile?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, because the total tonnage is

a   matter  for  defence  requirement  in  case  of  an

emergency,  I  am  not in a position  to  divulge  that

information to the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, the Minister just informed the

House that he insisted on a guarantee of a stockpile of

25,000  tons of rice by the rice merchants. Why can  he

not reveal the figure?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That is so, Sir, but 25,000 tons

need not be the full quantity that Government considers

necessary to maintain in Singapore for an emergency.

the  aggregate capital expenditure is  $10,000  or

above but less than $20,000, the tax concession is

11  per cent. Therefore, the first item, in  fact,

only applies to the exact figure of $10,000, which

the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 13th of August I made a statement in this

House  on  Government's acceptance of the  policy  for

protection to needy industries - protection  on  a  very

selective  basis. I quote, Sir, part of  my  statement

from  the  Hansard  of  the meeting  on  13th  August,

col.566:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Government will therefore commence taking

immediately all such steps as are necessary  for  this

policy to be implemented."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to a question asked by the hon. Member for

Tanglin  after I made this statement, I answered  that

there   are  two  forms  of  protection;  one  is   by

quantitative restrictions and the other is by tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 3½ months had elapsed before I was able to

introduce  a Bill to implement the policy as announced

by  me  on  the 13th August. Trade circles  knew  full

well,   and  so  did  industrial  circles,  that   the

Government's  policy had been declared  for  selective

protection  to needy industries and that the  Minister

had  in  this House committed the Government to taking

such actions as were necessary to implement the policy

of  the  Government. The implementation of such policy

would  entail getting the necessary powers  to  impose

protective  duties,  because I had  indicated,  in  my

reply  to the hon. Member for Tanglin, that protection

was   a   two-fold  measure,  either  by  quantitative

restrictions or by tariffs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



And  yet, Sir, over the three and a half months  that

elapsed between my announcement on 13th August and 3rd

December,   when  I  introduced  the  Bill   and   its

subsequent publication, there was no hue and cry  from

the  Chambers of Commerce. Neither were tears shed  in

this  House. Neither was a motion moved in this  House

against   the   Government's   policy   of   selective

protection. Nor even did any hon. Member in this House

care  to  raise  the  matter on  the  adjournment.  In

December, when I moved the First Reading of  the  Bill

to acquire the necessary powers, and when the Bill was

published,  suddenly we found protests and  agitation.

These  protests and agitation were based on two  types

of  opposition. The first type of opposition was  from

those   who  agreed  on  the  principle  of  selective

protection  for needy industries, but who were  afraid

of  the  manner  in which the Bill was drafted,  which

gave   the  Government  (not  the  Minister   as   was

suggested)   absolute   powers,   unconditional    and

unfettered.  The  second type of  objection  was  from

those who were against the principle of protection  as

such,  because they feared that the free port  statues

would be killed and that Singapore would lose its free

trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will deal with the first objection. I

sympathise  with their viewpoint that  the  Government

should  not,  under  a democratic  system,  be  always

allowed  to  have  unfettered  powers.  I  am  not   a

dictator, Sir, neither have I a desire to be one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Nor the Opposition!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, if the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar had the opportunity - I am sure he  is  a

budding  dictator - he would set himself up to  be  one.

However, I am only interested in achieving my objects,

as announced by me on the 13th August, for the benefit

of  Singapore, and my objects are (I am quoting  again

from the Hansard of 13th August):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government recognises that entrepot trade will always

continue  to play a major part in our economy  and  is

therefore  determined that the operation of protection

should be carried out with the minimum possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



damage  to,  or dislocation of, the entrepot  trade.  I

wish to make it very clear therefore that the operation

of  protection  is  envisaged on a  strictly  selective

basis:  that  is,  only where the benefit  accruing  to

Singapore through the industry concerned outweighs  any

possible   harm  to  the  entrepot  trade.   Under   no

circumstances  will  the  operation  of  protection  be

allowed to interfere in any way with the entrepot trade

in  produce,  processed produce  and  textiles  or  raw

materials."



<br><br>Now, Sir, when these objections were raised, I saw that

if  it could be possible to give these exact safeguards

as  were announced in my policy statement, perhaps  the

objectors who were objecting to the undefined powers of

the  Government  might  then  reconsider  their  stand.

Therefore,  I announced in the newspapers  that  I  was

going to move such amendments and those amendments  are

before  the  House  today, and I  shall  move  them  in

Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of objections, Sir, are from those who

are  afraid that the free port status of Singapore will

cease and that we will lose free trade. Sir, free  port

status  is  not  a "paper" status. It is  not  a  legal

status  defined under any law of the Colony.  It  is  a

factual  status, a status obtained through the flow  of

trade,  through  Government administrative  actions  of

minimising  restrictions, and so on. But  there  is  no

legal "paper" free port status as such. There might  be

people  who might say that the Customs Ordinance  is  a

revenue  Ordinance, and therefore that  safeguards  the

free  port status. I would say that is wrong,  Sir, If

you  really  have a free port, you have the  unfettered

right  to  trade  in  any  item without  duty,  without

quantitative restrictions on the import or  the  export

of   any   goods,  without  restriction   on   currency

remittance  and so on. Now, what have we got?  We  have

the  Customs  Ordinance which provides  for  duties  on

three  items - tobacco, liquor and petroleum.  Therefore,

there  is  no  unfettered law in the Customs  Ordinance

which  says  that  no  duty shall  be  imposed  because

Singapore is a free port. It does not recognise that as

a free port. Once you have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



impinged upon the free port status by imposing duty  on

any  one  type of goods, then your free port status  is

gone, the "paper" status of the free port is gone. Then

beyond   that,   we   have  the   import   and   export

restrictions.  The Control of Imports and  Exports  law

allows prohibitions or restrictions to be placed on the

import  or  export  of  any goods.  That  again  is  an

impingement on the supposedly legal "paper" status of a

free  port.  Further,  we  have  the  Foreign  Exchange

Regulations.  Sir, I think the real fear they  have  is

that  free  trade may be killed. I admit  that  if  any

government  tries to play about with any of such  laws,

as  I  stated,  it  could kill the  entrepot  trade  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Sir, given an assurance in my statement on

13th  August  that  it was not the  intention  of  this

Government to tamper with the entrepot trade  and  that

protection  would  be  given on  a  strictly  selective

basis. I have shouted this from my room in the Ministry

to  the  Press,  and in this House to the  Chambers  of

Commerce  many a time. If there are those  who  do  not

wish to accept it, I cannot help it. But I do warn that

a  future  government could, by administrative  action,

kill the entrepot trade, if it wished. Therefore, it is

up to the people to choose their government rightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point of free trade, Sir, even now we do

not have free trade, really free trade. I have here

lists running into 19 pages-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Spare us a copy!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> -(these are published, and any

Member  can buy them at any time he likes) of  hundreds

of  items which are prohibited or restricted for export

to  the Soviet bloc, China, North Korea, North Vietnam,

Tibet,  and  so  on.  That  is  the  reason  why  these

restrictions are imposed by the Cocom - one of the groups

that  got  together in Paris to safeguard the trade  of

the  free  countries. Sir, this list is operative  even

today  and  is a relaxation of the previous list  which

was more formidable. Where is the free trade?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have dollar controls. There are hundreds of

items  today  which we cannot import  from  the  dollar

area,  the  Philippines, the United States and  Canada.

And now these restrictions are imposed, not with a view

to  what is beneficial to Singapore, as what they  said

when  they  agitated for the lifting of the embargo  on

export of rubber to China - export of rubber to China was

prohibited until 1956; that was not for the benefit  of

this  country  - but for the benefit of  groups  outside

this  country. And that was accepted by the  people  of

Singapore  without a murmur when impositions were  made

on  them  for  restriction of  trade  in  hundreds  and

hundreds of items. But when I stand up and say, "I want

to  impose duties for half a dozen factories  that  are

dying  here  for  the  benefit of  this  country",  the

Chambers of Commerce go up in arms against me and  say,

"I am trying to kill the free port trade of Singapore."

Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Certainly, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Will the Minister say why nobody

raised objections to the embargo on export of rubber to

China? Is the Minister aware that the Special Branch is

keeping  a  close  watch  on  anyone  who  raises  such

objections and that he will be suspected as a Communist

supporter?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir if that is so, then I am a

Communist supporter today, because I have announced the

lifting  of  the  embargo on import  of  textiles  from

Communist  China;  and so would  many  Members  of  the

British  Parliament,  who  today  advocate  trade  with

China,  be  Communist supporters. It is absurd  to  say

that  anybody  who  advocates trade  with  China  is  a

Communist or should be labelled as a Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides all these formidable restrictions which are in

existence  today, we had the following.  From  1945  to

1954,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



watches  from Switzerland were under quotas. Foodstuffs

from   various   countries  were   under   quotas   and

restriction from 1950 to 1953. Textiles and cement from

Japan   were  under  restriction  from  1950  to  1955.

Construction  steel,  building  machinery  and  various

foodstuffs also from Japan were under restriction  from

1950   to   1951.   Clocks,  watches,   radios,   toys,

refrigerators  and  so  on from non-sterling  and  non-dollar countries were also under restriction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these restrictions are for the benefit of

Singapore or for the benefit of other countries.  Today

we  have  the  position  where  Commonwealth  cars  are

accorded  a preferential rate of registration fee.  The

small man who wants to buy a small non-Commonwealth car

has to pay a 25 per cent registration fee. The rich man

who  wants to buy a Rolls Royce pays only 10 per  cent.

That  is in accordance with our understanding with  the

United Kingdom as part of the Commonwealth to accord  a

preferential rate of duty to Commonwealth countries. We

cannot  remove it unless we get out of the Commonwealth

and get out of G.A.T.T. and various other international

obligations  to which we are committed. I  do  not  say

that it is beneficial for us to get out. Perhaps it  is

beneficial  for us to remain, because,  in  return,  we

might get some benefit. But what I-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir, Is

the  Minister advocating that we should get out or that

we  should stay? We are all getting confused!  We  know

that  he  wants  to  build up  a  formidable  case  for

something.  But  we are wondering what that  formidable

case is about.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> If the hon. Member will exercise a

bit  of patience, he will discover what that formidable

case  which is being built up is all about. However,  I

am  not  advocating whether we should get  out  of  our

international  obligations or not. I am  just  stating

factually  what  the present situation  and  conditions

are, and for whose benefit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the entrepot trade can suffer, I admit, if the

items  that  enter the entrepot trade stream  in  major

quantities  were  tampered with, but  so  long  as  the

protection  is  selective and  carefully  balanced  and

judged,  I  do  not see why the entrepot  trade  should

suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are today not in a position to work by rule of

thumb and say that there should be no duties levied. We

are  in  such an economic plight today that we have  to

consider each and every case on its merits. If  we  can

assist  one  factory  to employ ten  more  persons,  we

should do our very best to do so, provided the benefit,

as  I  have said, accruing to Singapore is greater than

the  loss.  Sir, I have already quoted my statement  on

13th  August  in  which I said  that  it  was  not  the

intention of the Government to tamper with the entrepot

trade as far as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another fear expressed - that the duties

could   be  imposed  on  the  people,  especially   the

merchants, without  previous  warning,  and  that  the

Government  can  impose these duties  as  and  when  it

pleases.  Sir, perhaps  the  persons  who  make   this

criticism are not aware of my Press statement  on  27th

August.  1958.  I do not control the Press,  Sir,  and,

therefore,  I  cannot guarantee whether this  statement

was  published  in  1010 factually or  whether  it  was

published   in  part,  and  therefore  gave   a   wrong

impression. But here it is for what it is worth - this is

public   property.  I  quote,  Sir,  from  a  Singapore

Government Press statement, INFS. AU. 98/58  CKL  dated

27th August:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At a Press conference this afternoon, Mr Jumabhoy

said  two  persons  would be drawn from  the  Panel  to

consider  each  application for protection.  They  will

form that Committee for that particular case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jumabhoy said that as soon as an application has been received, a Committee will be set up. The gist of

the   application  would  then  be  gazetted  so   that

interested  parties  could make representations  either

for or against, to the Committee."



<br><br>A  perfectly democratic procedure. Therefore those  who

fear  that duties may be suddenly imposed on them  need

have no such fear, because it is not my intention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



arbitrarily to decide on duties. As I have made it very

clear,  I  have set up a Protection Advisory  Committee

and  every application for protection will go  to  that

Committee  and  will  be gazetted, and  representations

will  be  called by that Committee, written  and  oral.

People  who  are  interested  will  be  heard  by   the

Committee.   The   Committee  will  then   make   their

recommendation  to me and I will then take  it  to  the

Cabinet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is no Cabinet yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, I mean the Council of

Ministers. I hope to take it to the Cabinet  after  the

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the fears that inefficient industries

will be encouraged and that the cost of living will  go

up  because  of  protection.  Again,  Sir,  I  wish  to

reiterate  what  I have said in my statement.  I  shall

read it out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under no circumstances will the operation of

protection be allowed to interfere in any way with  the

entrepot  trade  in  produce,  processed  produce   and

textiles or raw materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will also have to be satisfied that any

protection  granted  will not be abused  and  that  the

undertaking  concerned is operating or is  expected  to

operate  in  an  efficient manner and  that  protection

would not result in the continued marketing of goods of

inferior quality at excessive prices by comparison with

the standards and prices of similar imported goods."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is not clear, I do not know how clearer

it  could  be  made.  I  am no master  of  the  English

language,  as the Member for Tanjong Pagar is  when  he

says  that  if only you will use Malay as the  national

language then the Malays will feel closer to you. He is

a master in the English language. I hope the Englishman

feels closer to him because he knows English well!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we come to the basic question why protection is

necessary.  I  have often said that the entrepot  trade

cannot  expand  to  the extent where it  could  provide

employment  for  a fast increasing population.  Colonel

Lyle,  the expert we have from Canada under the Colombo

Plan, has something to say about this in his Report.  I

shall quote the relevant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



portions of the Report which is tabled in this Assembly

and which has already been published in the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need for industrialisation, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Industrialization is necessary for two major reasons:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to meet the present and future unemployment

problem;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to increase or endeavour to hold the present

standard of living by manufacturing instead of

importing."



<br><br>Then he goes on to say-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those in public life who ignore it or who emphasize

lesser issues", -



<br><br>that is the growing population issue-



<br><br>"represent a real danger to this community, in my

opinion."



<br><br>And then he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To those who declare that Singapore's economic future

can,  as  in  the  past, rest safely  in  the  entrepot

activities  of its free port, I ask, 'What  would  have

happened in Hong Kong if its people had been content to

rely  solely on that philosophy when the refugees  were

pouring in by hundreds of thousands?'"



<br><br>At page 25 of the Report, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A brief comment on the impact of the Government's new

Protection  Policy on the Entrepot Trade  of  Singapore

appears to be called for. The general alarm which seems

to generate is not warranted, in my opinion."



<br><br>Then at page 31 he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The unrestricted Free Port Era appears to be ended.

If, however, the natural economic pattern of Malaya can

be  restored  and Singapore can retain its well  earned

place  as  its  cultural,  commercial,  industrial  and

financial  centre, there is no reason  why  the  second

chapter in its history cannot be even brighter than the

first."



<br><br>Then,  Sir,  he  says  at  page  5  on  the  increasing

population:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This complete disruption of the evolutionary pattern

will have drastic consequences on Singapore with 50 per

cent of its population under 21 years of age and with a

4  per cent annual population increase. All these young

people  must  be assimilated in some way (approximately

100 per day.)"



<br><br>And on the need for industrialisation to overcome this

problem he says at page 14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the tables, in themselves,"-



<br><br>The population table-



<br><br>"clearly point out the necessity of industrialisation.

They point out that out of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



472,000   employed  in  Singapore  only   185,000   are

productive workers; that the remaining 287,000 are non-productive workers."



<br><br>The  field  for  agricultural productive employment  is

limited by the small amount of land available.  I  have

said   this   very   often   here.   Industrialisation,

therefore,  appears to be the only hope  for  the  vast

majority of these young people. And at page 15 he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The experience of all Western countries in the past

twenty-five  years has proven that the modern  'Welfare

State' can be maintained in no other way than through a

high standard of productivity in its people."

and so on. That report is enlightening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote certain up-to-date trade figures

which  show  the  other danger as regards  the  trading

deficits.  The  visible  trading deficit - the  invisible

factor would presumably be constant every year,  so  we

need  not  worry about that - for 1955 was $83.6 million;

1956, $365.4 million; 1957, $504.3 million; 1958 up  to

November, $559.7 million. The gap is increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the pundits who advocate a free port and free

trade  will  not see the light. I have nothing  against

free trade. I support it. I will fight if anybody tries

to damage the entrepot trade. It is not my intention to

do that. But whilst safeguarding the entrepot trade,  I

want  to  open up a second base for our economy through

industries.  There was a suggestion in  this  morning's

Straits  Times editorial that it is possible  we  might

wrap up the industry in cotton wool. Those are not  the

exact  words.  But it forgets what I have said  already

that   efficiency  will  be  looked   for,   and   that

inefficiency  will not be tolerated in  the  protection

policy. I do not know what the next government will do,

but if I were returned again in the next government,  I

certainly would not operate this law haphazardly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain section of the trading population

which  advocates that a Commission should be set up  to

investigate Singapore's economy and to report  on  what

is  to be done and so on and so forth. They go back  to

the International Bank Report which says that Singapore

must retain its free port status.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singapore is not a completely free port. I

have  made  that  clear. Anyhow,  these  are  delaying

tactics. A Commission composed of outsiders would  not

know as much as the people here would know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even the International Bank Mission Report

was  based on one basic foundation, and that is Malaya

as  one  economic  unit. If you take  that  foundation

away,  the  whole structure of the recommendations  of

that Report collapses, because the presumption is that

Malaya  will remain as one economic unit. If  that  is

so,  we  need  not  have  any protection  because  the

surplus  population  here can be  sent  to  Malaya  to

settle  down on the land, and that is the end  of  our

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to give a guaranteed market to a

budding  industry even if the market is small, because

if  the investor knows that he can depend on a certain

amount  of  the market for his products, then  he  can

build  on  that  foundation and cater  for  an  export

market.  But  if he has no basic market, even  however

small it is, he dare not invest any money here. It  is

now  a  well-known fact that there is quite a  lot  of

local  capital available and that foreign  capital  is

not  going  to be easy to attract what with  the  past

history  of  political  and labour  unrest  which,  of

course, the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar will  disown

and  will  hate  to see a recurrence of.  It  is  also

because  of  the  other  attractions  that  are  being

offered   in   other   capital  importing   countries.

Therefore,  we  have  to  build  first  on  our  local

capital,  and  local capital is predominantly  trading

capital.  The  local  people are not  well  versed  in

industry, and therefore, unless they can get something

upon  which to base their industry, they will not dare

to venture into new fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that was raised this morning in the

papers   by  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Liberal-Socialist Party was that we have no mandate. Sir, when

I  was  returned  on  the  Labour  Front  ticket,  our

programme to the people was this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Labour Front will encourage the local people to

enter  into such secondary industries and small trades

by giving them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



state protection. The Labour Front will emphasize  the

development  of  these industries and trades  for  the

export market."



<br><br>This was presented to the people before the elections,

and  it  is  quite  clear that  state  protection  was

mentioned  and  that  the Labour Front  would  provide

protection. That is the mandate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There was no mandate to change your

name.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am not competent to enter

into  a political argument with the Member for Tanjong

Pagar,  because he is very clever in the  use  of  the

English  language and also in shifting from one  point

to  another,  shifting his ground as frequently  as  a

chameleon changes its colour. However, coming back  to

the  point  in  hand. Recently in the  Straits  Times,

there  appeared a cartoon in which I was  depicted  as

standing  on  a  pedestal which Sir  Stamford  Raffles

occupies in front of the Town Hall controlled  by  the

present  City  Council. Sir, I cannot aspire  to  that

honour,  nor  do  I have any desire to  stand  on  the

pedestal  of a master builder of the British  colonial

empire,  as  Sir Stamford Raffles was. But one  cannot

deny  that  Sir Stamford Raffles was a man of  vision,

even  though the Member for Tanjong Pagar may like  to

deny  it. He saw in this, tiny swampy island a central

place  to  serve  a  vast  hinterland,  not  only  the

hinterland  of the Federation of Malaya but  also  the

hinterland  of the rich spice islands of what  is  now

known   as   Indonesia  and  of  silks  in  the   vast

subcontinent  of  China and of the  other  surrounding

countries.  He  also saw, in those days when  shipping

was  not  developed to the extent as it is now, that

the flow of commerce could be expedited and smoothened

if there was a City port which could act as the outlet

for the rich spices and silks of these rich countries.

These  could  then enrich the chests of  the  European

merchants.  Therefore,  as a result  of  this  vision.

Singapore was developed into a vast port which  served

a  vast  hinterland. But I submit that no race and  no

era  has  a monopoly of men of vision. Even today,  we

have  the  hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar  who  has  a

vision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



building  up  a P.A.P. empire in this tiny  island  to

replace the British Colonial Empire!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what all this

anticipation, as to what the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

is going to do, has anything to do with this Bill. Let

us try and be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, when he starts winking at me

a little, I feel like responding - on a friendly basis!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one must admit, Sir, that however far-sighted a man is, his vision is perforce limited by

the  horizon. Therefore, anything that goes beyond the

horizon  is mere conjecture. Now. Raffles saw in  this

tiny  swampy  island  a central  place  to  serve  the

hinterland  of Indonesia, China, Malaya,  and  so  on.

When  he  thought that merchants from all  over  these

areas  could  converge and engage  in  commerce,  that

vision  built  up  a very big port here.  But  Raffles

could  not  visualise  that  the  alien  people,  from

Indonesia,  India,  China and  even  as  far  away  as

Arabia, would one day settle down here and then demand

the  right  to govern themselves, while his  own  race

remained  alien to the island. Just as  he  could  not

visualise that happening, he could not visualise  that

this  vast  hinterland, for which this port served  as

the  outlet  would  one day dwindle  away,  and  would

become   independent   countries,   with   independent

economic  policies, and therefore the  port  would  be

left  without a hinterland. Any child - you need not  be

an  expert in economic affairs - can understand that  a

hinterland  is  necessary  for  a  port.   Without   a

hinterland, a port is useless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we cannot blame these surrounding countries for

drifting  away  from us, because  it  is  inherent  in

independence.  I  do not blame the Federation.  It  is

inherent in political sovereignty to look after  one's

own  interests first, and not the interests of others;

and  if  the  Federation, by exercising that  inherent

right,  looks after its own interest, we cannot  blame

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is we who are finding ourselves in an unfortunate

position, that though in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



the past we have been of service, our services are not

required  to  the same extent today and  will  not  be

required  to the same extent in future. Neither  could

Sir  Stamford Raffles visualise that this  island  and

this  port,  which was built to serve commerce,  would

one  day become the habitat of a vast population  that

could  grow  to  the  extent that commerce  could  not

provide for them. Neither could he visualise that this

island,  which  was to serve commerce, could  one  day

become  a  political entity and that  commerce  should

serve  the  island  and  not  just  the  island  serve

commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the people of Singapore would realise the

danger they are facing. I do not know whether I  could

divulge them, Sir, but various actions are proposed by

the  surrounding governments to cut Singapore away bit

by  bit.  Today  they impose duty  on  one  thing  and

tomorrow  duty on another - all for their own interests.

We cannot blame them for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, all these are supposed to be secrets.

I do not really see why they should be secrets. We have

inherited the British administrative system  which  we

are carrying on at this moment, and which we hope will

not  carry  over after the new Constitution comes  in - that  a lot of

things which are treated as secret need

not be secret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I wish the people will take my word for it, that

I  am  aware  of what is happening, and that  is,  the

economic future of Singapore is going to be worse  and

worse if we are not going to do something about it.  I

have  no  love for restrictions of any sort.  I  am  a

merchant.  I  love  free enterprise.  But  when  other

countries  take  actions  which  have  the  effect  of

refusing us their markets but keeping our market  open

to  them, then comes the time when one has got to take

counter acticn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the E.C.A.F.E. conference in Kuala Lumpur early

last  year,  I  put up this proposal and I  reiterated

this   again  in  Seattle,  Washington,  when  I   was

there - spending public funds, as the Member  for  Telok

Ayer will always wish to bring home to me - but doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



useful  work, I contend. I put this suggestion strongly

as  I  had no prepared speech. I was really furious  at

the  way  the  discussion was going on,  with  no  real

effort being made by any of the nations to come to  any

solution  of the issue. They just refused to  recognise

the  issue and laid it aside. I hit out, Sir,  and  the

looked and nodded at me. I do not know whether he liked

me  to  hit out or not. But the general impression  was

that this puny man from a tiny island which is not even

an   independent  country,  has  dared  to  tell   them

something.  But  afterwards,  I  received  a   lot   of

congratulations. I am going to read a part  of  what  I

said,  and  I think it will be interesting,  though  it

will  not  probably  be so to the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar.

Pagar  might  tell us what his stand  is  on  selective

protection  rather  than  on  sidetracking  the  issue.

However,  I wish to proceed with the reading.  This  is

pertinent to the question we are discussing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tendency now is to increase national production in

every   industrial  field  and  to  export   to   other

countries, but to keep out the industrial production of

other  countries,  a  policy  which  is  good  for  the

particular nation perhaps which adopted it,  but  which

is  bad  when  considered on a regional basis  and  the

repercussions that could follow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the E.C.A.F.E. meeting which was mentioned by

the  distinguished representative of New  Zealand,  Mr

Walter Nash, in Kuala Lumpur early this year. I put  up

a  strong plea for some sort of machinery to be set  up

by the E.C.A.F.E. Committee to consider the possibility

of learning the lessons of the European Free Trade area

and  trying to do something along those lines  for  the

South and South-East Asian regions. I am sorry that  my

plea  fell down and. Singapore not being a full member,

I  was  not able to put up a motion. I was hoping  that

some  other  nation would do so but that hope  did  not

materialise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened is that the countries are driven to

come to this co-operation when they find conditions are

getting  worse  and worse. But there  is  no  voluntary

effort  to do something about it before conditions  get

bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Sir, do put up a plea that we should realise that

the world has become too small a place for a nation  to

stand  by  itself politically or economically.  I  feel

that if we could realise that well enough, we might  be

able  to avert disasters which might follow because  of

economic  disbalance and disparities between countries.

After  all, wars have been fought in many cases because

of economic disparities. I may be pardoned for speaking

out my mind frankly on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>



subject,  but  I feel rather strongly on this.  I  feel

there is no use shadow boxing on this subject. We  have

got  to  recognise  this  and  come  to  some  sort  of

understanding about it. Consultations do not cut across

political sovereignty and E.C.A.F.E. might be  able  to

develop  some  machinery for regional consultations  in

the  economic development field without infringing upon

political sovereignty. Just consultations and voluntary

acceptance or non-acceptance of the result. It might be

a  good  way  out. And yet there will be  something  to

assist."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after making this impassionate plea - which was

not recorded on paper until after I had made the speech

- what  happened? No country was prepared to talk  about

any  consultation in the economic field. All they  were

after was, "I will do what suits me best", and that was

their  decision. In the Assembly last month,  I  stated

this  is a cold hard competitive world and we have  got

to  fight to survive. It is no use the hon. Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar and his Party's economic pundits writing

various   articles  in  their  magazine  and   in   the

newspapers, crying loud to convince the public, because

they feel they can get power next year, and saying, "We

shall   have  no  political  disturbances,  no   labour

disturbances. Foreign capitalism is not  so  bad  after

all." Two years ago the Member for Tanjong Pagar turned

round to Mr Sutherland and said: "You wait!" They were

the  ones  who  were against the capitalists.  "Foreign

capital is not so bad after all. We must try to  induce

foreign  capital  to come." I have got  the  quotations

here.  They dare to challenge me! I shall give a  reply

to  all  these  quotations - that we must encourage  and

induce foreign capital to come in and, in fact, we must

go  down on our knees to foreign capital. In fact, that

is what Petir says. He might like-

wish  to  prolong the debate. I think I have stated  my

case sufficiently clear and in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.34 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Commerce and Industry strikes me as a man who is crying

out  for  recognition of the great talent that he  has,

which  unfortunately  the  community  has  as  yet  not

recognised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge that he is, in his way, an extremely

clever  and intelligent man, who thinks out  some  very

clever schemes. But what is important in a Minister  is

not  being clever and intelligent, but being  wise  and

sound and practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said no one bothered to oppose his policy

statement  which he made in August last year,  when  he

announced  his  policy of protection. Probably  it  was

because  nobody  took the Minister seriously,  because,

having  seen  his past performance, they  doubted  very

much,  first,  whether he would ever get  on  with  it,

secondly, whether he ever had the time to get  on  with

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have passed two major Bills this morning and

this  is  the third major one. There is hardly time  or

opportunity  for  the Minister and  his  Government  to

bring  into fruition any of the plans which these three

Bills  have sought to embody. The curious feature about

this   Government  is  that,  unlike  other   socialist

governments  which come out with a spate of legislation

after their first year of office, they come out with  a

spate of legislation in their last few weeks of office,

knowing  full  well  that they are no  more  than  just

talking points; knowing full well that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



no  businessman, no merchant and no industrialist  will

base  their actions on the basis of pious protestations

and  legislation of a government which is  on  its  way

out.  If he wants to know why nobody pays the slightest

attention  to him, it is because everybody  knows  that

what he says does not count.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the P.A.P. stand on the free port

status?  Briefly it is this: that whilst  we  recognise

the  changing facets of our economy and the economy  of

the  surrounding territories, primarily  Indonesia  and

the  Federation of Malaya, we do not think it is either

wise or prudent to have any sudden switches in economic

policy.  Whilst we do not oppose what the Minister  has

termed   "selective  protection"  of   industries,   we

recognise  quite clearly and bluntly that the Singapore

market  consists  of one and a half million  souls  and

cannot   provide  that  attraction  to  big  industrial

capital.  We  can give protection to 1.5  million.  The

Federation can give protection to 7 million. Therefore,

if our industry is to flourish, it must be on the basis

of  higher  skills,  low costs and intense  competitive

effort.  Whilst it may be necessary to give  protection

in  the  initial stages, ultimately whether or  not  an

industrialised  Singapore will  come  into  being  will

depend  upon the basis of the skills and techniques  of

its workers and its managerial class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister deplored the outcry against him. He

could  have saved himself all this trouble if,  instead

of  having  to  quote Press statements to which  nobody

bothered  to  pay any attention, he had from  the  very

beginning  indicated  his  intention  on  the   subject

matters on which he considered protection feasible.  He

knew  full  well  that,  in the course  of  the  Select

Committee hearings on the Control of Manufacture  Bill,

there  were  very  few industries  indeed  which  could

profit  by such protection. And by introducing  a  Bill

which could have been and was, in fact, construed as an

attempt to give blanket protection for all commodities,

because  of the draftsmanship of the Bill, he was  just

inviting trouble upon himself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one feature which the Minister has not

touched  upon, and that is the rapidity with  which  he

recoils  in  the face of criticism. The trouble,  as  I

understand  it,  is  that too many  clever  things  are

thought  out  in haste, spoken out even before,  as  he

said,  they  are  put  down on  paper,  get  accurately

quoted,  and  properly sloshed up,  and  then  a  quick

retraction  and withdrawal is made. If  from  the  very

beginning  he  had stated quite clearly  that  what  he

wanted  to do was what he now says he is going  to  do,

with  the amendment which he seeks to introduce, a  lot

of  unnecessary debate both in the Press  and  in  this

Assembly would have been saved.



<br><br>11.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

the  Minister  for  Commerce and  Industry  has  quoted

various  sections of Mr Lyle's report, I will make  my

observations  in  quoting  a paragraph  from  the  same

report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before quoting, I should say that this is an

excellent piece of document - very revealing and, at the

same time very frightening. I quote the first page:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Colony and the Federation enter into an

economic partnership in which both would enjoy the same

common  market  and  the same tariff  protection,  that

granting the same inducements to new industry  and  the

same  incentives for the expansion of existing industry

they could, together, achieve an outstanding measure of

industrial development."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I will quote what our Hon. Minister

for Commerce and Industry has just said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Various governments supported various measures to cut

Singapore out of existence."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, "the economic future of Singapore is going to

be worse and worse."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in another place he said: "A port like this must

have a hinterland to depend on."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another place Mr Jumabhoy quoted -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry. The Hon. Minister for

Commerce   and   Industry   said,   "The   Federation's

imposition of restrictions on Singapore goods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>



is  making  things  very difficult for  Singapore.  We

cannot  blame  the Federation Government because  they

are looking after their country."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I make my own observations. The Minister has

brought out this Customs (Amendment No. 3) Bill mainly

in  order  to  counteract the measures  taken  by  the

Federation   Government  to  attract  the  established

industries  of Singapore, which are moving across  the

Causeway, and also to attract new investments  thereat

the expense of Singapore. This is indeed a very tragic

situation. We all realise that in partnership, if  not

in   union,  we  can  achieve  a  greater  measure  of

industrial progress than in separation or in  rivalry.

It  is  therefore  very strange  that  the  Federation

Government,   instead   of  pursuing   a   policy   of

friendship,  could embark on a policy  to  counteract,

and  if  Singapore brings out a measure to  counteract

this policy it will be the complete destruction of the

economic future of both countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the history of the world, we cannot recall

any  case where a country has so adamantly refused  to

join  or  accept another country which is economically

and financially well off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen many countries which went to war - very

expensive wars - for the sake of a few acres of land.  I

do  not understand why the Federation refuse to accept

Singapore.  Sir, we cannot explain this as  a  pacific

attitude  of the Federation, because they  are  really

entering  into very damaging economic warfare  against

Singapore. It could not be that they are frightened of

the  Chinese  population, so that if they joined  with

Singapore, their economic future would be involved and

greatly damaged?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is the case, both countries could keep

their  political identities and form only an  economic

union, whereby Federation can keep its economy and, at

the same time, have a trade agreement with Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only possible explanation, as I can see it, is

that  there are some powers behind this move. Probably

some S.E.A.T.O. power has given directions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>



or  instructions to the Federation Government to  have

nothing to do with Singapore, because they are  afraid

that  is Singapore and the Federation come to a  union

or  a  merger,  it  is possible that  both  will  join

together and have a strong foreign policy. Out of this

foreign  policy  there will possibly  come  industrial

development, and they might ask the S.E.A.T.O. powers

to  take  the  military base from  Singapore  and  the

Federation.  So  it  is  in  the  interests  of  those

S.E.A.T.O. powers to make Singapore and the Federation

weaker and weaker. To do this, they want Singapore and

the Federation to be apart. They must have no union at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not know what secret agreement the

Federation   had   when  they   were   granted   their

independence. It might be that one condition was  that

they  should  object to any merger with  Singapore.  I

cannot  see  any  other reason for Singapore  and  the

Federation   not  joining  together.  The   Federation

Government  also  realise, as does the  Government  of

Singapore,  that  by  separation  and  rivalry,   both

countries'  economy is going to be ruined.  I  do  not

know  why the Federation are so adamant that  a  union

must not be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Hon. Minister for Commerce and Industry

has  said,  Singapore cannot exist  without  depending

upon a hinterland for its trade. But we have seen  the

Federation Government refusing to take us in spite  of

all the pleas and all the discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only alternative for us to exist is to join with

some  other country. I mean Indonesia. Sir,  Indonesia

is our next neighbour with which we have been carrying

on  a substantial volume of trade for many decades. It

is  a  country with a population of 19 million  people

and  has  enormous natural resources. By merging  with

Indonesia  our  trade would expand  very  greatly  and

Singapore  industries would, instead of moving  across

the  Causeway  to  supply a population  of  6  million

people, remain here and enlarge production to supply a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, let us not worry too much over the fact

that  our  existence is entirely at the  mercy  of  the

Federation Government and, consequently, our  salvation

depends  entirely  on  waging a  tariff  war  with  the

Federation.

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister just

now  said  that it was not the intention of the  Labour

Front  Government to damage the free  trade  status  of

Singapore  and he went on to show the hon.  Members  in

this  House a Labour Front election platform to provide

trade  protection. It is very strange that it is  after

nearly  four  years  that the  Government  saw  fit  to

introduce such legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the introduction of these

monopolies  or tariffs will benefit only a few  but  it

will cripple the free port status of this country.  The

Minister  went on to elaborate on the free port  status

of   Singapore  by  informing  us  why  the  Government

formerly introduced quotas and restrictions. It is  his

duty  to  find  ways and means to abolish that  system.

Quotas  can  be  bought locally. Everyone  knows  that.

People  who  do things legitimately never benefit  from

these  quotas.  Sir, Government should  find  ways  and

means to protect the people here. They say, "We want to

protect  a  few  industries."  I  am  not  against  the

protection of industries if they provide employment for

our people, but do not put tariffs on any goods. I want

to  find  out  whether the tariffs will also  apply  to

goods coming from the Federation. I am not against  the

protection of industries. But Government should, in the

first  place, encourage local industries; provide  them

with  machinery  and  technical men,  rather  than  put

tariffs  on  the  goods  they  manufacture.  What  will

happen? If a merchant wants to import goods from  other

countries  and  you have these tariffs, the  Government

will have to provide go-downs to store these goods  for

export to other countries. That will involve money  and

will encourage corruption and smuggling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can bring any of the cigarette vendors in

Singapore today to this House to confirm this - you  have

imposed  a tariff and a duty on cigarettes and yet  you

find  cigarettes with the chop "For Export Only" (which

means  for export and kept in bond) being sold back  to

our  people all over Singapore. I am very unhappy about

this.  Only  after  four years have  the  Labour  Front

Government shown that it will enforce trade protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister went on to say that a small island

like Singapore must have a hinterland. I do not quarrel

with  the  Federation. We must co-operate economically.

Even  the  report of Mr Lyle says that  you  must  co-operate - "joint economic co-operation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Hongkong. We have a big country like China

next  to  Hongkong and yet Hongkong manufacture cheaper

goods than China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongkong today have 3,300 factories. They have no

hinterland. Their goods are exported not only to China,

but  also  to Malaya, Singapore, Borneo and  Indonesia.

Why  cannot the Government do that instead of  imposing

tariffs and talking about quotas? Regarding quotas, may

I  point  out  to  the Minister that I was  formerly  a

Government   servant?  Quotas  were  imposed   on   the

instructions of Whitehall. Even motor-cars, which  have

a  preferential duty, are protected. These instructions

all  come  from  Whitehall, in spite of the  fact  that

Singapore earns more dollars than any other country  in

the Commonwealth. It is up to us to take it up with the

authorities in Whitehall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year we approved a big sum of money to be

provided  for tourism. It is the Government's  duty  to

encourage  tourism.  Tourists  come  to  this   country

because  we have a free port status. They want to  come

and  buy cheap goods rather than dear goods. They  also

want  to buy those goods which they cannot get in other

countries.   Now  by  introducing  tariffs,   you   are

encouraging smuggling and corruption.

too.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. Sir, this is a most

dangerous Bill which changes the whole policy  of  free

trade  which has existed since over a century. Sir,  no

one  in  Singapore will object to giving protection  to

industries  or  some selected industries  in  order  to

provide  employment for our people. But there are  ways

and means to do so, and not all of a sudden bring about

a complete change of economic policy in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said that he had announced this in

August  1958,  but Singapore knows very well  that  the

present  Government is going out and that no  attention

will  be  paid to what they say now. Sir, the  Minister

presented to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>



House  this  morning  a Labour Front  pamphlet  stating

their policy before or after the elections. May I  ask,

Sir,  are  they members of the same Party to  whom  the

voters  gave  their  votes  and  got  them  into   this

Assembly?  Definitely they are not! They have  betrayed

their voters by leaving their Party, and the Party  was

elected  to  power by the voters. In other  words,  the

Liberal-Socialists were right when they said that  this

Government have no mandate from the people.  Sir,  they

have  deserted  their Party or changed their  Party  or

left  their  Party. Now they are out to kill  Singapore

itself - employers and employees - by this Bill. They have

been  in  power  for over 3½ years. Where  were  their

ideas  all this time? Could they not have thought about

this,  say, after one year or two years in office  that

this is needed and that is needed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has developed - I emphasise the word

"developed" - from  a  fishing  village  to  the  present

prosperous  city  because of  its  free  trade  policy.

Singapore's  position is quite unique  and  one  cannot

compare  it with any other country. It is a  city  with

one  and a half million people only. You cannot compare

it  with India, Pakistan or any other country. In  many

respects,  Hongkong  differs from Singapore.  Hong-Kong

sells its manufactured goods to the hinterland and  re-exports  goods  to other places. It gets raw  materials

from  the  hinterland  or  from  elsewhere.  Its  chief

feature   is  cheap  labour.  So  one  cannot   compare

Singapore  with  Hongkong or  with  any  other  places.

Singapore  is  in a unique position by  itself.  It  is

strategically situated. Its geographical  position  has

contributed  to  its importance as an entrepot  trading

centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument was put forward that our population

is increasing. Of course, population is also increasing

in  the surrounding countries. The Minister quoted only

the  1955,  1956  and  1957 trade figures.  What  about

earlier  figures?  The volume of  trade  has  increased

since  1936-1938, but that does not mean that we should

not  encourage our local industries. But there are ways

of going, about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Government have ever studied

the  Singapore  Trade Commission Report,  1932-34.  The

Commission sat for two years almost every day. It  went

through all the aspects of trade concerning the Straits

Settlements.  Singapore  is in  no  different  position

today. Have they given any thought to that Report?  All

of  a  sudden,  they come out with a Bill changing  the

whole policy of free trade in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has not got any hinterland. That is a

fact.  Yet  another  fact is that  it  has  no  natural

resources  or  raw  materials. How are  our  industries

going  to  exist then? We have to import raw materials.

The  only thing we have is labour - at a high cost.  Then

what  are  we  to  do?  We must  create  efficiency  in

industry.  Sir, suppose a tariff is imposed on  pencils

and  they  are  sold  at  ten  cents  each,  and  other

countries are selling the pencils at eight cents  each.

In  other  words, the 1½ million people  of  Singapore

will  have to buy pencils at a higher price. That means

we are increasing the cost of living. Everything should

be  done with a view to the overall economic benefit of

Singapore. That is very important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by imposing tariffs or by restricting these goods

from  entering Singapore, you are penalising the  whole

population  to  buy  goods at a higher  rate.  That  in

itself  is  a drawback. It injures the entrepot  trade.

After all, our industries will be providing for only  1½

million  people.  Can  we  re-export  goods  to   other

countries  at competitive rates? If we can,  we  should

bring  our  industries to that level. Then tariffs  are

not necessary at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in any case, this Bill should not be passed for

the reasons given by me. The life of the Government  is

very  short.  They have only two months to go.  Nothing

can  be  implemented  at present by  them  and  nothing

should be done in haste. The Government have not stated

whether this Bill is to be referred to Select Committee

or a Committee of the whole House. This is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>



important  Bill.  To change a policy existing  for  140

years  in  a  rush will bring nothing but harm  to  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether there is anyone on the

Government side with trade or industrial experience. If

so,  I  will be happy to hear the length of  time,  the

line  of  business and the volume of trade in which  he

deals.   Sir,   the  Chambers  of  Commerce   and   the

Manufacturers' Association have been built by those who

have done hard work to establish trade and industry  in

this  country.  These organisations  have  existed  for

years  and  years  and their experience,  guidance  and

advice should be sought first. Have they been consulted

on  the  proposed  change  in the  economic  policy  of

Singapore?  Even a man with experience  in  trade  will

certainly not go against these bodies as they represent

the  whole  trade of Singapore. I do not  know  whether

this  Bill  is  to  be committed to a Select  Committee

where public opinion can be sought or whether it  is

to  be rushed through. No statement on this has so  far

been  made, but if it is to be rushed through, it  will

be  suicidal for Singapore. That will be a sad state of

affairs.  Of  course, the voters did not  realise  that

they were electing the wrong people to the Assembly who

just  want to throttle trade. Here assurances are given

that  certain commodities will not be interfered  with.

What  guarantee is there that commodities will  not  be

interfered  with  one by one? Are we  to  take  it  for

granted. Sir? That reminds me of my Budget speech.  The

previous  Government handed over $200  million  to  the

present Government and only $83 million is now left. We

had  very  little  taxation then.  Petrol  and  tobacco

prices have now gone up by 40, 50 and 60 per cent.  Who

has  to  foot the bill? The taxpayers! That  is  a  sad

state  of  affairs and I hope the people  of  Singapore

realise that they should have a Government which is  at

least interested in their welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have got Mr Lyle's Report. This has been

quoted in the Assembly. I have a copy here with me. One

may not agree with all the recommendations, but it is a

very  important Report. In summing up, he says on  page

32:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the formation of a Joint Industrial

Development  Council,  guided  and  supported  by   the

Consulting  Services of a world known firm like  Arthur

D.  Little  Inc., could prove to be the rallying  point

around which economic union could be achieved."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very important suggestion. Of course,

Mr  Lyle  has  mentioned throughout  his  Report  that

Singapore  cannot  stand alone  industrially  and  that

there  should  be  a  joint economic  policy  with  the

Federation  of Malaya. All means should be explored  to

ensure  the  possibility of coming to  terms  with  the

Federation of Malaya in the interest of both  Singapore

and  the  Federation  of Malaya. After  all,  Singapore

geographically was and still is part of the  Federation

of  Malaya.  I  have  seldom said  anything  about  the

Federation  in  this  Assembly,  because   it   is   an

independent country. We axe a Colony now and even under

the  new constitution Singapore will still be a Colony.

A lot of people talk about merger. My opinion about the

merger is that it will come about when the British  are

compelled by the surrounding Asian nations to  give  up

Singapore.  Then the Federation of Malaya  will  accept

us. There is no harm if the Federation accepts us as  a

tenth  or twelfth State with a limited number of  seats

possible on the Federal Council. That stage might  come

about  much later because the countries surrounding  us

are  now  too busy with their own affairs. I would  not

say that political merger is possible at present, but I

would say that economic merger is a possibility. So all

means  should be explored to bring about the  formation

of  a Joint Industrial Development Council. If that  is

not possible, then I suggest we can have our own Board.

We can try that out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we fail after doing all these things, then

there is no other alternative but to impose tariffs. If

a few selected industries want protection by tariff, we

can  grant them tax holidays instead. Why can that  not

be  done instead of changing the whole economic  policy

of  Singapore? There are also other means  besides  the

imposition  of  tariffs,  for  example,  reliefs   from

electric power, water, and so on. The Government  might

say that that is not in their hands but in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



City  Council's  hands.  You can  always  bring  in  an

Ordinance to that effect to help the people.  Have  all

these  means  been  explored? You want  to  change  the

policy all of a sudden and you want to do that when the

life of the Government is about to end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of research work is necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning I was

on  the Lyle Report and its recommendation, and I  said

that the first step should be to endeavour to have this

Joint Board on Pan Malayan Industrial Planning, and  if

that  fails, then Singapore goes on its own.  In  other

words, a lot of research is necessary before jumping to

this Bill, thus ruining the established economic policy

which has done so much good to Singapore, that is,  the

free  trade policy. Sir, the Report has also  suggested

that  representatives  of the  Government  and  experts

should  sit on this Board - an expert means not  a  dummy

but one who knows his job - and not political friends  or

people  with  no experience of the particular  type  of

industry or any industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Commerce and Industry suggested this morning that there are Import and Export Control

Regulations,  Foreign  Exchange  Control  Regulations,

duties on cars, and so on. If those regulations exist,

why  should  this Bill not be passed and entrusted  to

the  care  of  the Government? Sir, these  are  flimsy

excuses. Just because these controls exist, this  Bill

should  therefore be passed and the whole trade policy

should   be   changed.  One  should  not  forget   the

Legislative  Councillors in the postwar  period -  some

were  necessities after the war; some were necessities

during  the  Korean  war. The main  thing,  until  the

Rendel  Constitution came in, is that  no  elected  or

nominated  Member  was in charge of a  portfolio,  and

that  also,  as a whole, they were in a minority.  The

business  of  running the government was conducted  by

the  officials. But the Labour Front Government had  a

chance  to  scrap  this if they  thought  this  was  a

colonial  regulation. But they have not done  it,  and

they have not done it because they want something more

on the same lines. It is disgusting!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, something was mentioned about the free countries

and  their policies. As I said before, we are  just  a

Colony. We will still remain a Colony, and there is no

comparison between Singapore and any other country  or

any  other  city in the world. We should  compare  our

peculiar  position  with that of other  countries  and

adjust  it;  but on the other hand - I may just  make  a

passing  remark - where are the free  countries  of  the

world,  and  how  many?  Does  he  mean  non-Communist

countries or otherwise? Most of the countries in South-East  Asia  are controlled or influenced  by  American

dollars,  and  I  do  not  see  that  they  are   free

countries.  We  have been influenced  by  one  or  the

other, but nevertheless we will be free to govern  our

internal affairs under the new Constitution, and  then

the  government  should plan what  is  wanted  by  the

people of Singapore and for their benefit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mention was made about Sir Stamford Raffles and

his  vision.  I  wonder whether it was necessary.  The

free  trade  policy laid down by him has  subsequently

succeeded. Whether he had visualised what would happen

and  how  the  population would  increase  or  not  is

another  matter, but I think the same principle  still

remains   good.  And  if  it  is  good,  whatever   is

established,   let   it   continue   till   the   real

representatives  of  the people  are  elected  in  the

Assembly  and they will then plan what they  think  is

best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru

mentioned  corruption. It has  been  admitted  by  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry at the last  Budget

sitting  that corruption exists in his own  department

on  the  stockpiling  of rice. He also  mentioned  how

cigarettes  were being sold, and four  new  industries

wanting  duties,  bonded warehouses, establishment  of

departments,  and so on. No doubt there will  be  some

corruption.  Why  go  to all this trouble?  What  for?

Unless  you  have  exhausted all your resources,  then

there is no other way. But ways have not been tried at

all.  It  is  a Bill brought before this  House  in  a

hurry,  and the Government want it to be passed  in  a

hurry. Sir, if the Government wanted to help the small

man,  instead  of  wasting  the  taxpayers'  money  in

travelling, they  could have paid more  attention  at

least  to small-scale and cottage industries from  the

very  beginning  because these could give  employment,

but they have neglected their duty throughout.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government have any particular industry

in mind to help - by modern machinery, expert knowledge,

and  other  necessities - and if such means still  fail,

then try other means but not till then. The free trade

policy  should be considered on the economic basis  of

Singapore  and  not  in  the  interests   of   a   few

industries. You will be increasing the cost of  living

of  the whole population instead of lowering it. It is

a vicious circle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I might say that this is a Bill of

great  importance.  The  very existence  of  Singapore

depends on it and it should not be rushed through. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



should be scrapped like the Luxury Tax Bill. There  are

three  reasons, Sir, and they are these.  Firstly,  the

present  Government have no mandate  from  the  people,

because they are not the elected representatives of the

Labour  Front,  especially the  four  or  five  elected

Ministers of the Labour Front Government. They have  no

business  to  bring about this Bill without  a  mandate

from  the  people. Secondly, they cannot  implement  it

even  if they pass it, because in only two months' time

they  will  not  be  there  anymore;  they  should  not

represent  the  interests of the people  of  Singapore.

Thirdly, if at all these novices insist on getting this

Bill  through, it is advisable, Sir, that it should  be

committed  to  a  Select  Committee  where  advice  and

guidance  could be sought from the Chambers of Commerce

which  have  worked  for a hundred years  now  in  this

Colony.  What  they have to say may  help  these  small

industries, which the Minister might have in mind;  but

to rush the Bill through is nothing but madness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to express my support

for  the  principle of this Bill which is,  of  course,

bound  to  come  under  attack  from  some  people   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone outside the Treasury building, Mr

Speaker, on a patch of grass just across the river from

Fullerton Building - a handsome obelisk erected  in  1850

in  commemoration  of the visit of the Governor-General

of India, Lord Dalhousie - and many a keen free trader in

this  Assembly  will,  I  am  sure,  spend  a  luncheon

adjournment in studying the fairly lengthy essay carved

on the sides of that in four languages-the first multi-lingualism a hundred years ago - Chinese, Malay, English

and  Tamil,  I  think.  That  inscription  records  the

profound  conviction of the traders of  Singapore  that

Singapore  lives by free trade. It was erected  in  the

brief  interval  between  the first  and  second  Opium

Wars - the  first  Opium War of 1839-40  and  the  Second

Opium War of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



1855-56 - I  forgot the exact date. That represents  what

you might call the long tradition of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times change, the world changes. Then free trade

was  the  free trade of Western industries seeking  new

markets  throughout  the  world.  Now,  industries  are

developing   world-wide  and,  to  some   extent,   the

countries newly developing have an advantage  over  the

countries  which did their developing earlier  and  are

committed to a lot of out-of-date equipment very often.

That pattern of free trade is not wholly an appropriate

one   today.   I  give  no  support  to  the   economic

nationalism  which  does so much  harm  in  the  world,

almost  as  much  harm as military  nationalism.  These

nationalisms are out-of-date. A man should be loyal  to

his  own country, the place where he lives and has  his

home  and  his work. But he should also recognise  that

all  countries  form part of the world pattern,  and  I

most  fully  support what my colleague and friend,  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry, said at Seattle,  I

think  it  was,  about the need for countries  to  stop

thinking  in terms of their own backyards and to  start

thinking of the world pattern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free trade traditionally means, in effect, that the

trader  wants to be free of unwanted government action.

Traders  do not resent the government doing  what  they

want.  They  run to the government very vigorously  and

loudly  say,  "Why have you not done this?"  when  they

want  something done that suits them; but they  do  not

like having things done which might limit their profits

or interfere with their decisions. That is very natural

and proper. But it is a problem of social organisation.

I  am  no  trader;  I could hardly be  mistaken  for  a

merchant;   but  it  appears  to  me  that   trade   is

essentially the most primitive of the social  functions

today. The functions of production are rationalised and

highly developed. The function of distribution of goods

is still in a very primitive stage. However, I will not

take up the time of the Assembly with that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that this power for

selective  protection forms only a part of the  general

pattern of policy, and I would like to refer, if I may,

to  the same Labour Front booklet of 1954 from which my

colleague quoted, in which we set out not only our Four-Year  Programme  but  also  our  Principles  and  Aims.

Principle No. 11 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front regards the exchange of goods and

services  between nations as the basis of international

peace  and internal prosperity. It recognises the great

importance  of  integrating  Japan  and  the   People's

Republic  of  China in the Asian trade  structure,  and

aims ultimately at a complementary economic system  for

Asia  on  the basis of mutual aid according to  ability

and need."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does that document bind the present

Government, or is the present Government guided by that

document in any way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is a piece of information, Sir, which

I have not included in my notes. I presume it does. The

point  I  am making is that that was one of the guiding

principles  from  which  our  Four-Year  Programme  was

developed,  and  on which point 7 of the  programme - the

one  about State protection to small industry - was made.

We   recognise  also  that  while  there  would  be  an

appropriate  field  for  protection  within  Singapore,

nevertheless,   Singapore's  economic   functions   and

services to the world - the services by which we earn our

living  and survive - are in the complementary  economic

system  by  which goods and services are exchanged  and

which would mean, of course, the use of Singapore as  a

centre  of  exchange, or if you prefer, an entrepot.  I

just  wish  to make these points, Mr Speaker,  because

there appears to me to be some confusion in the use  of

the  phrase  "free trade", which itself is a  confusing

phrase and nobody has yet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



been  able  to  define exactly what they mean  by  free

trade. I do not suppose you can have trade made free in

the  sense  of being free from money costs. You  cannot

deal with this problem in these very simple categories.

You  will  have  to  have a major objective,  and  then

within  that  you  have to construct detailed  policies

which meet the immediate facts and also serve the long-term future.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of

course,  everyone  wants Singapore  to  be  a  hive  of

industry with new factories opening every year,  but  I

feel  that  there must be many who are sorry  that  the

Government has come to the conclusion that these can be

encouraged  to  open  and  expand  only  by  artificial

measures  and by far-reaching controls, the effects  of

which cannot be judged for a long time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has mentioned Hong Kong as an example to Singapore, but I know of no tariffs which have been

introduced  there  to  encourage the  very  substantial

growth  which  has taken place since the war;  and  the

present  measures which are put forward may or may  not

help  us to increase the wealth of Singapore. They  may

indeed  not  be effective. One feels that  there  is  a

policy  of  desperation in the speed with  which  these

measures  are being put forward, and there is no  doubt

that the population growth in Singapore is probably one

of the most frightening problems which must face us. If

increase of industry is the aim, it is my opinion  that

it  should  be  encouraged in  every  way  and  tariffs

avoided in so far as that is possible. And it is not as

if  Singapore is only a trading centre. It has had very

large  and  growing  factories  for  many  years,  and,

indeed,   it   has   a  very  thriving   Manufacturers'

Association. Many industries have been very successful,

though  others  have failed, but it is a moot  question

whether  we  will  really benefit  from  a  process  of

selective  protection or that it will really solve  the

problem  of  our  growing population,  or  indeed  even

alleviate it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that in the year 1945, when we came back

after the Japanese Occupation, there was a policy paper

from  the  British  Military  Administration  which   I

happened  to see. In that paper it was stated that  the

entrepot  trade  of  Singapore was finished,  and  that

Singapore  was a dying place. Those of  us  who  had  a

sight  of  this paper or document criticised  it  very,

very  much  indeed. I think the evidence of  the  years

since 1945, including the figures which were quoted  by

the  Hon. the  Minister this morning, shows  that,  if

anything,  Singapore has grown as a trading centre  and

that  its entrepot trade is vastly greater than it  was

before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepot trade must continue to be encouraged and,

in fact, it is very little use manufacturing unless the

goods   which  it  produces  are  able  to   be   sold.

Manufacturing  can only, in a place like Singapore,  be

complementary  to and party to the entrepot  trade.  It

certainly can in no way be a substitute for  it.  I  am

sure  that  it is not the intention of this Government,

or  any  other Government, to do anything  which  would

restrict  our  trading  ability,  because  without  the

overseas  trade which we have got, there will be  fewer

people  able  to buy the products of the  manufacturers

and  the factories which we hope will come steadily  to

Singapore  over the next few years. But the  contention

of  the  Government  is that, by artificially  guarding

some industries, they will be increasing prosperity for

Singapore. Only time will tell. What in fact, I  think,

we  really need here is a greatly expanding economy but

a greatly reducing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original amendment to the Customs Ordinance meant

an  overwhelming  change in the  general  structure  of

Singapore's  economy.  I  am  not  convinced   by   the

Minister's argument of what constitutes a free  trading

area.  All I can say is that the fewer the restrictions

and  the  restraints, the better,  and  thus  the  less

opportunity  there  should be  for  the  Government  to

create these artificialities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I conclude by saying that I consider tariffs a bad

way to encourage local industries.

<br><br>2.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the

House  will  join with me in welcoming the new  Member,

Sir  Ewen  Fergusson, to this House. I  would  like  to

point out that this House will, in general, regret  the

speech  just  delivered by him. He is,  of  course,  an

experienced businessman, and we must also consider  him

a  loyal  citizen,  as a result of which  he  has  been

nominated a Member of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we come to debate on this important point of

industrialisation.  Sir  Ewen Fergusson,  I  think,  is

mistaken  in  his suggestion that the only solution  to

our  problem is to expand our economy but to reduce the

population.  I  wonder whether Sir Ewen  Fergusson  has

found  time  to  read  through Col.  Lyle's  Report  on

industrial  development. If he had, Sir, he  would  not

have  delivered his speech, especially as, I  am  sure,

with his experience and knowledge he should be able  to

contribute more constructive suggestions to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I too wonder whether the Lyle Report has been

officially  reported as Government policy.  If  it  is,

then there is something in the second last paragraph at

page  25, under the title "Entrepot Trade", which  most

of  our  merchants here - Europeans and Chinese alike - are

very  much worried about. This is a factor which  might

kill our entrepot trade. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government's declared Policy is that Protection

will  not be granted if the Entrepot Trade in the  item

concerned will be seriously affected."



<br><br>And it continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, the people involved in Entrepot Trade in

the  item  concerned should have ample time to  prepare

and  organize  whatever  new procedure  and  facilities

might be required."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if it is clearly the Government's policy

that  we  have  to  pay  special consideration  to  the

entrepot trade, particularly from Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to go a little bit further on the question

of  reducing the population of this island. I think the

only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



way  is  to invite the world powers to drop an  atomic

bomb!  Indeed  this is the fastest and most  effective

way  of reducing the population. We spoke quite enough

in  the debate on the Family Planning Association.  We

must  have confidence in ourselves to face the future,

and  not  be  so  pessimistic as  to  think  that,  by

reducing  the  population,  we  can  solve   all   our

problems.  Sir,  that will not solve our  problems  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now digest the lengthy and learned statement

given  by the Minister for Commerce and Industry  this

morning. We can confine ourselves to a few points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Minister assures us that Singapore is not,

after all, a free port. This is the first time that he

has  made it clear that Singapore is not a free  port,

as  what other people generally think. But I am  quite

certain that in certain Government publications, it is

stated that Singapore is a free port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In last year's Budget debate, the Minister

admitted  that Singapore's entrepot trade  was  dying.

But  today he has said that it is not so, and that  it

is still going strong, or at least it is not dying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Minister for Commerce and Industry has

promised  that he will do all he can to safeguard  our

entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We cannot trace anything at all in connection with

the  Federation of Malaya. I think the main  point  in

Col.  Lyle's Report is that, for the benefit  of  both

territories, Singapore and Malaya, they  must  have  a

Pan-Malayan  economic plan. But  we  cannot  find  any

indication of this in the Minister's statement today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one answer to our difficult

problems - how to solve unemployment, raise the standard

of  living  of the people and strengthen our  economic

potentialities. There is always one answer - wait until

a  merger  with the Federation and then we  can  solve

everything. But why not mention in the Minister's report



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



today the confidence that the Minister  has  for

carrying out a one-sided industrial policy, which is a

vital  change?  Even the P.A.P.'s  great  leader,  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar, has to declare his change of

approach towards our economic problem. He says that if

the  Federation of Malaya's and Indonesia's  economies

remain  the  same  as today, he will not  support  any

vital  changes in our economic policy. What confidence

have  the  Singapore People's Alliance-UMNO  Coalition

Government  in  carrying  out  a  one-sided   economic

policy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has even criticised the P.A.P. for always changing its policy. They can oppose the

P.P.S.O.  (Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance)

and  say,  "When we are in power we will  support  the

P.P.S.O." Now they oppose the capitalists and cry out,

"Down  with  the  capitalists!" But when  you  are  in

power,  you  will  need capital  because  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  needs  capita!  and  Indonesia  needs  foreign

investment.   But  what  confidence  do  the   present

Alliance  Coalition Government have  in  carrying  out

such a policy? Sir, this may save a lot of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, I want to put two questions. Will

the  Government fully accept Col. Lyle's Report  as  a

basic  policy  of  Singapore's industrial  development

programme?  Secondly, have they made any  approach  or

have they had any consultations with the Federation of

Malaya in connection with this Customs (Amendment  No.

3) Bill?



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

three  months ago when the Hon. Minister for  Commerce

and  Industry  brought  up the subject  of  having  to

protect local industries, thereby infringing upon  the

free   port  status  of  Singapore,  I  was  extremely

unhappy,  and  I had very grave doubts as  to  whether

such  measures  should be made. But on  being  assured

that the free port status will be maintained as far as

possible,  particularly where our  entrepot  trade  is

concerned, and that such restrictions would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



be  confined  only to local industries  which  require

help and protection, I have changed my mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And joined the S.P.A.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the growing population and

the increasing unemployment in Singapore must force us

to  change our views and accept measures which  up  to

the present moment have not been acceptable to us.  We

are  now  coming to a stage where we have to take  in

each  other's washings. We cannot afford to live  just

by  trading  alone. Because of the  number  of  people

unemployed, we have to supply ourselves with  some  of

the  basic  and vital goods which we require  for  our

everyday  needs, and that is the very purpose  of  the

protection  which  is asked for today.  We  have  been

asked  why  we do not follow the example  of  Hongkong

where  no  protection is required. But then  Hong-Kong

presents an entirely different picture. There you have

a standard of living among the working people which is

very  much below that which has been attained  by  our

workers  in this country today. I am sure none  of  us

would  want any of our workers to work and live  on  a

bare  wage  of about two or three dollars a day  which

the workman gets in Hongkong now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever we do, Sir, we must look for employment. We

must  find  employment.  I  am  sure  the  safeguards

provided  for under clause 3 of this Bill whereby  if

any of the products which are protected meets with the

disapproval  of  the  people  of  this   country,   a

resolution  in this House will take that  away.  I  am

sure  that safeguard is adequate and, for that reason,

I do support this Bill.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir I

should like to answer some of the points raised by Sir

Ewen  Fergusson in support of his opposition  to  this

Bill.  The first point is this: In 1945, the political

set-up  in  Malaya  was entirely  different  from  the

political  set-up  today. In  1945,  Sir,  Malaya  was

divided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



into  the  Straits  Settlements, the  Federated  Malay

States  and  the  Unfederated Malay States.  And  they

together, Sir, formed one economic unit. There was not

in  existence  at that time the Federation  of  Malaya

which  has  now imposed tariffs on soap imported  into

the Federation from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, he mentioned Hongkong. He

asked why Hongkong could prosper without tariffs.  The

answer is obvious. In Hongkong, labour is so cheap, as

the  Member for Paya Lebar has said, that the standard

of living of certain human beings there is so low that

we  in  Singapore would be ashamed to see in  Hongkong

the way they live. Labour is so cheap that Hongkong is

able to produce consumer goods below the price of  any

similar  consumer goods imported into Hongkong.  That,

Sir, is the reason why Hongkong has no tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir Ewen's other point, which seems to have been

shared  by some Members who oppose this Bill, is  that

this  Bill,  if  passed, would  disturb  our  entrepot

trade.  Why  should  that be  so,  Sir?  The  Minister

concerned  has given us his assurance that  no  tariff

will  be  introduced to protect any goods manufactured

in  Singapore if such tariffs will in any way have any

adverse effect on the entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us see the advantage of having tariffs

for certain selective goods manufactured in Singapore.

The  advantage  is, firstly, that this will  encourage

the  expansion  of  existing  industries  and  attract

capital,  not  only from abroad, but also  from  local

people.  In  my  mind. Sir, we have  sufficient  local

capital  for  investment  in Singapore.  This  capital

locally   will  come  to  be  used  and  invested   in

industries, once the Government protect industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer again to the soap industry, Sir. Many of the

soap  industries  in Singapore have  closed  down  and

moved  to  the  Federation of Malaya. What  does  that

mean?  A  flight  of  capital from  Singapore  to  the

Federation of Malaya.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, employment - so many people were thrown

out  of  jobs  because  of the removal  of  these  soap

factories.  Sir,  if  the  trade  unions  in  Singapore

realise  this  fully, I am sure they will  give  strong

support  to  this Bill. For what I have  said,  Sir,  I

strongly support this Bill.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this morning I expected to hear from the leader of  the

People's  Action  Party  big  plans  on  how  to   help

Singapore, greater plans to help give employment to the

people  of Singapore, and also how action can be  taken

to  raise the standard of living of the people. But  in

fact, I heard an absolutely different tale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he said: "Why do you want to bring up the Bill at

this time? The time is too short to implement it. It is

neither  a wise nor a prudent step to make a change  in

economic policy at this time of the day." May I ask, in

such  circumstances, what must we  do?  What  does  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar suggest? Fold our arms and  do

nothing?  Let things drift; let unemployment  increase;

and  let  the  people go hungry? No, Sir, I  think  the

leaders  of Singapore must stop thinking about  how  to

connect  everything  with  political  propaganda.  They

should sit down and consider sanely what would be  best

for the people; whether they should come into office or

whether  they  should  not  even  be  elected  to  this

Assembly.  I  always think, Sir, that  if  there  is  a

problem, there must be a solution. The solution may not

be  as good as we want it to be. But as we go along, we

may improve on it and we may finally solve the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an instance, Sir. Today there is the

problem of children not being able to get into schools.

Did  we  adopt the attitude of the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar that just because of the short period before  the

general elections, we should fold our arms? No, Sir, we

never did that. We sat down and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



thought   about  it  and  we  solved   it -   at   least

partially  - by opening new schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, Sir, we know that the entrepot trade

is not keeping pace with the increase in population and

we  have  to  think  of other ways and  means  to  help

ourselves. Today we know that all our people cannot  be

employed  in  business houses and that we must  protect

our  workers. I say that this Bill is only  part  of  a

scheme  to  help  Singapore to earn a little  bit  more

money  and  to create more employment opportunities.  I

was surprised, Sir, to hear from the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  that things should be left as they are. He  said

that  if  we  want to manufacture, then we  have  three

points  to think about. First, the cost should be  low;

second, we must have more mechanisation; and, third, we

should be very competitive. I agree with all of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My recollection is that I never

enumerated the three points in that order,  nor  did  I

enumerate  the three points at all. What  I  said  this

morning was this: if we protect an industry in order to

give it a start, it may be justifiable, but in the long

run, whether we have an industrialised Singapore or not

depends upon the competition to which your industry can

face  up.  If you want an efficient industry, you  must

have  efficient  workers with the necessary  degree  of

technical  skill  to compete with the cheap  labour  in

Hongkong and China, and sufficient managerial talent to

make sure that your costing is down to bottom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Very well, we will just talk about

low  labour costs. It is really surprising that for the

last  four  years until yesterday, the cry  was  always

against exploitation of labour. Now, we are faced  with

the problem of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



earning   more   money  and  competition   from   other

countries. We know that we cannot sell our goods if  we

compare  the prices and the quality of our  goods  with

those of Hongkong, Japan and China. What then can we do

to help our trade to stand up to competition from these

countries, except to obtain cheap labour? How does that

cry fit in now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, may I clarify that?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, so be it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar  thinks  he has been misunderstood,  he  will  be

given an opportunity after the hon. Member's speech  to

explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I now find it difficult to

reconcile his conception of things now with what he had

said  or  what  he had intended to do or  what  he  had

intended  not  to  do.  People will  go  without  work;

industries will have to fold up; workers will  have  to

go  hungry and will have to tighten their belts because

there will probably be no more strikes in Singapore. If

we come to that stage, Sir, it will be a very sorrowful

day for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stranger still, Sir, was the suggestion that the

Minister for Commerce and Industry was a weak man.  "He

recoiled  at  the  attack by the  various  Chambers  of

Commerce and he has watered down his Bill. So today  we

have  it  in a modified form." But I say, Sir,  we  are

indeed very glad to have Ministers who still listen  to

the  voices  of the people of Singapore. We still  have

Ministers who will take into consideration the view  of

the  citizens.  If  one  day the Government  says  that

certain  things  should be done and the  people  resent

that,  but the Government just goes ahead with what  is

to  be done, then I say, "That is the day democracy has

lost its battle and it will be a form of dictatorship."

I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



the  day  will  never  come and Singapore  will  always

remain under democratic rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I help to explain to a

schoolmaster why, in the first place, our workers enjoy

a standard of living far higher than that of Hong Kong,

and in the second place-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would draw the attention of hon.

Members to the relevant Standing Order which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Member who has spoken to a question may again be

heard to offer explanation of some material part of his

speech  which has been misunderstood; but he shall  not

introduce new matter."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That was exactly my intention, Sir.

What  I wanted to explain to the schoolmaster was this.

We  can still sustain the higher standard of living  of

our  workers  as against Hong Kong workers,  by  higher

technical  skill and efficiency to justify  the  higher

standard of living. It is as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  I  do not like a person, I naturally do not have  a

good  word for him. Further I shall be blinded  to  all

reasons by my feeling of malevolence against him.  From

the  various  speakers opposite who spoke on  the  Bill

this  morning,  to my mind no one has proved  how  this

Bill  when  it becomes au Ordinance will be a dangerous

thing.  It  is  not  gentlemanly,  Sir,  just   to   be

acrimonious. Whether the Bill is brought in so late  in

the  day, or during the last few weeks of the  life  of

the  Government, or two years ago, is immaterial.  What

matters  is  whether  it  will  act  adversely  on  the

entrepot  trade of Singapore. The various speakers  did

not convince the House of that danger.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

afraid I know very little about politics but when  the

Hon. the Minister for Commerce and Industry tries  to

justify  this Bill by saying that it is in  accordance

with  the Labour Front's platform, I should hope  that

such  matters  as  the  overall  economic  benefit  to

Singapore should be treated as above politics.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that since his statement on 13th August last year - when he mentioned that in order to

protect industry, there were two ways of doing it, one

is   by   quantitative  control  and  the   other   by

tariff - nobody has raised any objection to it.  Perhaps

I  think the Minister had overlooked my speech on  the

Control of Manufacture Bill during its Second Reading.

I  then  pointed  out the dangers of quantitative  and

tariff  controls and how it would affect the  entrepot

trade  of  Singapore. I can safely say that nobody  is

opposing  the  Minister  for introducing  measures  of

protection  for  industry, because we  all  know  that

industry  must somehow be encouraged or  protected  in

order  to  supplement our entrepot trade. We  are  all

agreed  that industry should be encouraged and helped,

but  it  is  the method of protection which  is  being

introduced  that  Members here and  a  lot  of  people

outside   are  not  convinced  of.  Those   who   have

criticised these measures are not necessarily  selfish

people   or  traders.  In  fact,  most  of  them   are

manufacturers   or  are  interested   in   industries.

Although  I  am  a  businessman,  Sir,  I  myself   am

interested  in  the  manufacture  of  products.  I  am

interested in rubber and latex factories.  I  am  also

interested in many other manufactures. But  the  point

is  that when we talk of these things, we have to have

the  overall picture of Singapore before  us  and  not

just  talk  of the benefit to one section of industry.

It  should  not  be  a question of manufacture  versus

trading, or manufacturers versus the merchants, or the

Chambers   of   Commerce  versus  the   Manufacturers'

Association.  This  should not  be  so.  What  we  are

concerned  with  is the method of protection  that  is

being  introduced  and whether that  method  will,  in

fact,   bring  about  the  result  that  the  Minister

envisages in his Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, first of all, Sir, let us examine what

industries  we  can protect. I have  said  that  I  am

interested  in rubber factories and some of  them  are

going  out  of business. If I can get protection  from

the Minister, I will certainly be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



pestering  him, but I realise at once that the  rubber

milling  industry cannot be protected because the  raw

materials  come  from elsewhere; it  is  not  produced

here. If there are more factories in Indonesia than we

have  here,  then naturally they will mill the  rubber

themselves  and they will not send over  their  rubber

for  us  to  mill.  In our coconut oil  industry,  for

instance,  we  get  copra from elsewhere.  We  do  not

produce  copra  here.  And if  they  had  coconut  oil

industries  in  their own lands, they would  certainly

like  to mill the copra themselves and not send  their

copra  to be milled here. I know that not so long  ago

copra  millers were after the Minister for  protection

and  they  were trying to influence him  to  say  that

whatever  copra imported here should be  allocated  to

the  coconut mills, and not be re-exported. I think  I

must  give  credit to the Minister who,  I  think,  is

cleverer  than what these people think. Of course,  he

refused  to  introduce such a policy  because,  if  he

tried to do that, then no copra at all would be coming

into  Singapore. The question is simply this: are  our

industries world competitive or not? If not,  then  we

cannot get even the raw materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is this - whatever industries we hope to

be  able  to  protect would be very small  industries,

industries for home consumption; and protection is  by

tariffs and quantitative controls. As has been pointed

out  by everybody, including the Lyle Report, our home

market  is  very small. If we shut out  all  the  soap

coming  in, thus allowing the local soap factories  to

manufacture  purely  for local consumption,  I  wonder

whether  such  a  protection  could  enable  the  soap

factories  to survive without any outside competition,

if  they are wholly dependent on the home market.  The

important  thing  is  to  weigh  the  advantages   the

industry derives from these measures and the resultant

harm done to the entrepot trade by trying to give this

small advantage to the manufacturer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take cigarettes, for instance. You try to establish

a   cigarette  factory  here  and  shut  out  all  the

cigarettes that come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



in. By doing that - in order to encourage a factory here

to employ a few hundred people - not only would you lose

your  $40  million in revenue, but you would  also  be

penalising  a  lot  of  people  who  are  trading   in

cigarettes - perhaps many thousands - in order to benefit

a  few  hundred.  Should  not  the  interests  of  the

majority be considered? In fact, if you have a picture

of  those people interested in cigarettes - not counting

only  the  wholesalers,  retailers,  hawkers - how  many

would  you deprive of employment if you were  to  shut

out  the import of this item in order to preserve your

local  cigarette factory? And, as I said, there is  no

assurance that people will smoke your cigarettes. From

what  I gather, the dearer type of cigarettes imported

have,  in  fact,  a  larger market  than  the  cheaper

cigarettes.  It  shows that consumers have  got  their

tastes and their preference. No doubt protection  does

some good to the small industry, but is it worthwhile?

That is why we are not convinced that this is the best

way  to do it. We have advocated that these industries

could  be  helped in other ways, instead of  tampering

with the entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, as I see it, is like this. We liken

Singapore  to a big family. This family has  subsisted

on its own business - a big and prosperous business - and

the  whole family has worked in the business. But  now

the  family  grows  with the coming  of  children  and

grandchildren,  and you see that the  family  business

alone  cannot offer sufficient employment to  all  the

children  and  grandchildren. Now, the thing  you  are

trying  to do is to open up another business in  order

to  absorb  these growing-up children. Well and  good.

But  if, by opening up a new business, you say to  the

old  business, "In order to keep me on  my  feet,  you

must  sacrifice a few lines for me. You must  not  buy

this;  you  must not buy that. You must  not  maintain

your own business. You have got to give up a few lines

for  me, so that my new business can thrive, and I can

stand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



on  my  feet." Would that be advisable? If we open  up

another  business, it is with the object of  absorbing

the  up-and-coming  children. That  business  must  be

independent. It must have nothing to do with  the  old

business,  which must be maintained at all costs.  The

old  business  must not be sacrificed in  any  way  in

order  to  put that new business on its own feet.  The

new   business   could  be  made  self-sufficient   by

providing it with capital, but certainly not by asking

the old firm to sacrifice some lines of its business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now an hon. Member said that nobody has

explained  why  a free port is important  and  why  it

could  be hurt if customs duties were levied.  I  will

say  this-much of the value of a free port lies in the

confidence of traders both inside and outside it;  the

confidence  that  they can trade and plan  in  advance

without let or hindrance. And much of this planning is

invisible; it is not everything that catches the  eye.

At one time the Minister said that Singapore is not  a

free  port,  because it still levies taxes on  liquor,

petroleum and cigarettes. A free port is just  like  a

club.  I think small places which encourage activities

will  have some of these vices. For instance,  at  one

time there was a monopoly on opium and there was a tax

on  opium. Such places thrive on the nature  of  their

business.  Monte  Carlo  and Las  Vegas  cannot  scrap

gambling. Without gambling there would be no activity.

They would not attract, because they have nothing else

to  attract.  In our case, I think, petroleum,  liquor

and  cigarettes are in the category where people  have

to  pay tax. One point is that these imports could  be

very  conveniently kept in bonded warehouses and taxed

where  it  is for local consumption. There is  no  room

where  you can delineate as a free port area.  You  do

not  have  enough  godowns, or storage  space.  To  go

beyond these three needs, the goods have to be put  on

show before they could be sold. They could not just be

conveniently kept in the bonded warehouses and all you

say  is,  "I want so many '555' cigarettes,"  and  the

people are supposed to know what they are.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things, Sir, which a free port does - things

which we cannot understand. It is only the man on  the

job  who knows what is going on. I would like to quote

some of the activities here, the significance of which

will  quite mystify hon. Members. Sometime ago  Saigon

bought  a certain amount of pepper from Singapore  and

it  was shipped from Singapore to Saigon. We know that

Saigon  does not consume pepper to that extent and  we

were quite right - because, after it went to Saigon,  it

went  to  Marseilles, France - and that manner of  trade

continued.  And then we got orders from  Hongkong  for

pepper  and Singapore shipped it to Hongkong. Hongkong

then  sent that pepper to Saigon, and Saigon  in  turn

sent that pepper to Marseilles! What is going on?  Why

should  we not be sending pepper to Marseilles direct?

It  is  not  possible because the French had committed

themselves to buying their colonial produce, and there

was  the  duty to be paid for others. Before  the  war

there  was a stock of pepper in Vietnam, so the French

claimed  that  pepper, which was exported  by  us,  as

Vietnam  pepper  and  it went to  France,  duty  free.

Similarly,  there are a lot of American cigarettes  in

which  Singapore  dealers have been  dealing,  and  no

Singaporean  knows  the brands,  because  it  goes  to

Borneo  where  it is bartered for Philippine  produce.

The  trade then was only done by small craft,  but  as

soon  as it became profitable both ways, bigger  craft

were engaged. The trade expanded. Now that the surplus

to  the Philippines is bigger the money does not  just

go back to the Philippines. It goes to Hongkong, or to

Singapore, and thence to Hongkong, and then back again

to  Manila,  because by that process, they  gain  more

Manila  dollars than if they were just to  remit  that

from Borneo to Manila at the official rate. Of course,

there  are  the official and the unofficial  rates  of

exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising to see that there are so many

things happening which we do not know about in a  free

port. A free port gives confidence to the traders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



They  know  they  can  do  anything  without  let   or

hindrance.  This  confidence  encourages  a   lot   of

activity, and these activities are all for the good of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that this protection does not do any

good to industries, but the point is whether that good

will  outweigh this good. In fact, to my mind,  it  is

just  like  trying to remove a mountain to  release  a

mouse! It outweighs the advantage likely to be gained.

The  advantage  is, in fact, very small compared  with

the harm that I can see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, hon. Members have dwelt on Hongkong

manufactures.  Of  course, that is a different  thing.

Hongkong prospers not because of its home market,  but

because  it  is  able to export and compete  with  the

outside  world.  In fact, they have competed  so  well

that  there  have been complaints from Lancashire  and

the  United  States and they are now trying  to  limit

Hongkong exports to their place, because U.K. textiles

cannot compete in their own market with Hong-Kong, and

American textiles cannot compete with Hongkong in  the

United  States  also. It is the outside bigger  market

that  builds a worthwhile industry. Industries  thrive

not  because of their home market. I should  say  that

even  the Hongkong home market would be too small  for

some  of  their  industries, except  perhaps  a  small

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I will say this: since the reading of

Mr  Lyle's report about joint industrial development,

I  say  that  the only sensible thing to do,  if  only

because  it does not make one work against the  other,

is to have the two territories with a population which

can constitute a joint economic unit for something  to

be  done.  The tyre factory, for instance,  which  was

quoted. We should go to the Federation and reason  out

that  this is the sensible policy to follow. In  fact,

even  if  we  are not politically merged,  we  can  be

economically  merged.  Then  we  would  be   in   this

position:  that  after  we have introduced  a  customs

tax - take  an  article  like  soap,  for  instance - soap

coming  from the Federation would then be  taxed  when

passing the Causeway into Singapore, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation is taxing our soap. We have got to tax

their  soap  in  order to protect our  industry.  That

would  make us equal. But still the Federation  market

is  a  bigger  market.  It has a population  of  seven

million against our one and a half million. Industries

that   go   to  the  Federation  are  not  necessarily

attracted  because  of  this or that  protection,  but

because  of their bigger market. So if we go  on  like

this,  we  are  bound  to  get  retaliation  when  the

Federation resent our imposing tax on their soap. They

might say, for instance, "All right, let no pineapples

go  to Singapore to feed the Singapore factories.  All

the  pineapples  must go to the Federation  factories.

They  cannot go to Singapore." Then where do we stand?

It  is  not  just retaliation on one item. When  that

happens,    then    it    breeds   ill-feeling,    and

politically - as  I  read  the  phrase  in  Mr   Lyle's

Report - we  may  come to the point of  no  return.  You

retaliate  and counter retaliate. That is no  good  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, the only sensible thing would be to

reason  out with the Federation Government and have  a

Pan  Malayan economic policy. For instance, there  was

talk of the City and its hinterland. If Singapore  is

in  a  chaotic  condition, it can do no  good  to  the

Federation  at  all. If conditions in  Singapore  were

rotten,  it would automatically affect the Federation.

If Singapore has thriving industries, it could in fact

benefit  the Federation because, on balance, we  still

have  a few thousand people coming down here from  the

Federation   every   year  to  seek   employment.   If

industries  are thriving in the Federation,  it  could

only  do  good,  and there would be no  harm  done  to

Singapore. We should not be competing with each other,

because our people also can go to the Federation, as a

last resort, and find employment there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi has always harped on the

point  of a Pan Malayan economic policy. He has always

tried  to  induce the Hon. Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry to look into that point. I really support him

in that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



direction. If the Federation are still not ready to do

that, the only thing to do is to continue to urge them

to  accept  this view arid let them see the  sense  in

this policy, instead of trying to fight back, in which

case the advantage to be gained will be outweighed  by

the  harm that could be caused. As I have said, I have

tried  my best to see the Minister's viewpoint  and  I

quite  agree  with  him  that  industries  should   be

encouraged and helped as much as possible. But I would

really  counsel him to see whether there are  ways  of

doing  so  other  than  this quantitative  and  tariff

control.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jumabhoy, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir, I have exactly

four minutes before the moment of interruption, and  I

do  not  propose to take a snap vote on  this  without

replying  to all the points, because even  though  the

newspapers  and  the public may not  fully  grasp  the

reply  which I am going to make, it is still important

and  should go down on record, because there are a lot

of  mis-statements made in this House on this  matter,

and the record should show my replies to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, I will refer to the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar. When the mind is confused because  one

is  taken unawares, then the obvious way out is to try

and  belittle  any effort that is being  made  by  the

Government, and that is the line which the hon. Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  has taken  this  morning  in  his

opening  remarks. I am glad to know - and I am sure  the

public will make a note of his remarks - that though the

P.A.P. are interested in capturing power in the  next

elections,  they  are not interested in  changing  the

economic  policy  of  this  country.  They   are   not

interested  in trying to solve the problem of  growing

unemployment  because of increasing  population.  They

are only interested in capturing power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will come back to the hon. Member for Telok

Ayer tomorrow when he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



is in the House, because I do not like to talk when the hon. Member is away. But the important point

raised by -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for Telok

Ayer is in the House as large as life!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Point of explanation, Sir. I might

possibly be absent when he is talking!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> If he is as large as life, I wish

him  continued  life  and  good  health,  for  obvious

reasons!  I  meant  to refer to the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Tan Siak Kew raised a point just at the

end of his speech, and this was referred to earlier by

the  hon.  Member for Changi-that the obvious solution

is  to  approach the Federation to see reason. I  have

mentioned in this House, Sir, not only last month  but

previously,  I  think,  that we  have  approached  the

Federation, and we have entreated them to accept a Pan-Malayan economic unit concept. But so far we have  not

been  able to succeed. Therefore, it is time that  the

Government  open  up other avenues so  that  when  our

economic conditions deteriorate we will not be  caught

napping but we will have something else to fall upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question of retaliation by the

Government, in the imposition of tariffs, against  the

Federation.  In  fact,  tariffs  will  be  imposed  on

commodities  coming  from any country.  It  is  not  a

question  of  retaliating against  the  Federation  as

such. It is possible that sometimes it might hurt some

countries more than others but that is just  a  matter

of  trade.  If we could get this Pan Malayan  economic

unit  concept  accepted by the Federation  of  Malaya,

then all these measures would not be necessary. I have

said  this earlier in my speech when moving this Bill.

These  are measures to counter difficulties that might

arise because of a loss of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



natural hinterland, that is, the Federation of  Malaya

and  the surrounding countries of Indonesia which  are

now increasingly trading direct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently, Sir, Members do not realise the gravity of

the  situation  staring us in the face.  Some  Members

live  in  the  past. They are what  the  British  call

"diehards" who will not progress with the times.  This

is  unfortunate. Some Members, though they realise the

gravity   of  the  situation,  refuse,  for  political

reasons,  to  accept it. That, I think,  is  bad.  The

people  should realise it because politics should  not

go above economics.

<div align="center"><b>RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA</b></div>



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the topic of my

speech  today  is "Singapore's economic  and  cultural

relations with other countries in South-East Asia."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is on the threshold of self-government, but unfortunately, even under this coming

Lennox-Boyd  Constitution, Singapore's foreign  policy

and  defence  will still remain in the  hands  of  the

British,  and Singapore can only have a voice  in  its

cultural  and economic relations with other countries.

Therefore, it is of vital importance that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  should  play  her role  most  carefully  and

intelligently.  Singapore  should  not  only  seek  co-operation  with  the  British  Commonwealth  and  other

countries, but, because of our historical, economic and

cultural  relations with other Asian  countries,  every

step  that  Singapore takes must be taken in  the  full

interests of Asia as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Singapore proudly declare, "We want to follow the

path  which  has been opened for us by our great  Asian

leader,  Pandit  Nehru." That is  to  say, all  Asian

countries   must  be  able  to  gain  their  political,

economic and cultural independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week in Singapore, there was a conference of

British  diplomats  from South-East Asia.  Undoubtedly,

the  object  of  this conference was to  formulate  the

British  policy for this area. Let it be remembered  by

the people who participated in this conference that, in

formulating the British policy for the East, the wishes

and    aspirations   of   the   people   of   Singapore

particularly, and Asian countries as a whole, be  given

more adequate consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the real issues threatening Singapore and other

Asian countries are well known-corruption, poverty  and

industrial and social backwardness. Therefore,  if  the

Western powers are sincere in their pledge to Asia, let

them   start  by  wiping  out  corruption,  alleviating

poverty and raising the standard of living of Singapore

and Asia as a whole. This help will be more appreciated

by  us than the empty shouting and the ineffective  so-called action against Communism in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the pros and cons, we are, however, pleased

with  the  recent  visit of the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation  of Malaya to the Philippines.  During  that

visit,  we were informed that the Tunku had urged  that

there should be established close economic and cultural

ties  between  Asian countries. Almost immediately  our

Chief  Minister,  Tun Lim Yew Hock, echoed  his  hearty

support  for  such  a  suggestion. According  to  Press

reports,  we even offered Singapore as the ideal  place

for  such  a  conference.  Of course,  Singapore  is  a

natural venue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



for such a conference, as it is the connecting link

between East and West. Besides being known as the

Gibraltar of the East, it has always been felt that

Singapore is also an important place, especially in the

economic and cultural field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya,

under the able leadership of Tun Lim Yew Hock and Tunku

Abdul Rahman, fully realise the fact that they do not

want to have any connection with any military

organisations such as SEATO. SEATO has not won nor

could it be able to win the support of the people of

Singapore and Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is still a British Colony with Britain

controlling our foreign affairs and defence, it would

appear that the British Government has committed

Singapore to SEATO automatically. Whatever they do in

this respect, it is against the true wishes of the

people of this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Singaporeans, are proud and happy at Tunku Abdul

Rahman's suggestion for close economic and cultural

ties between South-East Asian countries. At the same

time, we are aware of the fact that the Philippines,

under President Garcia, is a strong supporter of SEATO.

No doubt the Philippines will take to heart the Tunku's

wise suggestion. Eventually, the Philippines will find

closer cultural and economic ties with other countries

answering more to their own need than SEATO are able to

offer. This is the national outcome for the people of

Asia, including Singapore - our peace loving people.

Therefore, any military pact like SEATO will prove to

be far below the value of Tunku Abdul Rahman's wise

suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should grab this golden opportunity to play

her important role in promoting closer relations and

strengthening her economic ties with other Asian

countries. This will not only benefit Singapore most,

but Asia as a whole.
