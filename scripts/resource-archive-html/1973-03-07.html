<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by giving a brief history of the

Singapore   Light  Dues  Board.   The   Board   was

established   on   1st  March,  1957,   under   the

provisions of the Light Dues Ordinance,  1957,  and

is responsible for the provision and maintenance of

marine navigational aids. The Board, which consists

of  a  Chairman  and eight members,  operates  five

lighthouses,  and some Ill beacons and  buoys.  The

operation,    maintenance   and   improvement    of

navigational aids for the safe navigation of  ships

in  Singapore waters is clearly a port function and

should  logically come under the ambit of the  Port

of   Singapore   Authority  (PSA)   which   has   a

Hydrographic  Department dealing  with  surveys  of

Singapore  waters. The Hydrographic Department,  in

conjunction  with the Port Master's  Department  of

the PSA, determines the location and recommends the

type  of  navigational aids to be established.  The

purpose of this Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



therefore  is to transfer these functions  relating

to navigational aids to the PSA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Light Dues (Repeal) Bill comes into

force,  the Board will cease to exist and  all  its

functions,  liabilities, assets and staff  will  be

transferred  o  the  Port  of  Singapore  Authority

(Clause  3). The staff will be transferred  to  the

service of the PSA on terms no less favourable than

those enjoyed by them immediately prior to the date

of  coming  into operation of this Bill (Clauses  4

and 5).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of the Light Dues Board's functions

to  the  PSA  will  enable the Port  to  plan  more

efficiently  its  maritime  activities  within  our

waters  and  maintain the position of the  Port  of

Singapore as one of the largest and safest ports in

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ang Kok Peng].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, permit me to give a brief background

of  this  Bill.  The operational functions  of  the

Marine  Department include the licensing of harbour

craft,   port   clearance,  the  dissemination   of

navigational  information  and  the   recovery   of

wrecks.   These   functions  should   properly   be

exercised by the Port of Singapore Authority  (PSA)

whose  Port  Master is responsible for the  seaward

control of the harbour,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



harbour   safety,   tug  services,   berthing   and

piloting,  as well as the supervision and direction

of ships and shipping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime objective of this Bill is to rationalise

the  distribution of maritime functions between the

Marine  Department and the PSA. The  Bill  proposes

the  transfer  of  the following functions  of  the

Marine Department to the PSA:-



<br><br><i>(i) Licensing of harbour craft (Clause 12(a))</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA to have jurisdiction over the licensing of

harbour  craft  which operate  solely  within  port

limits.  Harbour craft are operated by certificated

steersmen   and  the  examination  and   issue   of

certificates  to  steersmen would then  become  the

PSA's responsibility.



<br><br><i>(ii) Port entry and clearance (Clause 12 (c))</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since control of shipping in port is the PSA's

responsibility,  it  is  only  logical  that   this

function  is also exercised by the PSA.  This  will

also    simplify   the   collection   of   shipping

statistics.



<br><br><i>(iii)  Dissemination  of  navigational  information (Clause 3 (b) paragraph (e))</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Marine Department issues notices to

mariners  while the Port Master issues  notices  to

ships in the harbour. Since the PSA will take  over

the  provision and maintenance of navigational aids

and  is also responsible for hydrographic work, the

dissemination  of  navigational information  should

properly also be a function of the PSA.



<br><br><i>(iv) Recovery of wrecks</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Director of Marine is officially the

receiver  of  wrecks,  actual  wreck  recovery   is

undertaken by the PSA or by private firms since the

Marine  Department has no salvage facilities.  This

function should be the responsibility of the PSA as

it relates to harbour safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA will also take over from the Singapore

Light  Dues Board the responsibility for  provision

and maintenance of navigational aids for the safe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



navigation of ships in Singapore waters  (clause  3

(b) paragraph (d)).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of these functions which deal with

shipping  activities  within  the  port,  from  the

Marine Department to the PSA, is a logical move and

is  indeed necessary as a consequence of the growth

of  shipping in our port. When these functions  are

transferred to the PSA, the Marine Department  will

be   able  to  concentrate  on  specialised  marine

matters so that Singapore's maritime interests  are

effectively advanced. This will enable us  to  take

greater  advantage of our strategic location  as  a

major  shipping  and trade centre.  The  Department

would be able to exert more efforts to enhance  the

attractiveness of the Singapore Registry  of  Ships

by  providing  more efficient service  to  the  800

ships,  totalling some 1.7 million gross registered

tons, at present flying the Singapore flag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken to make other amendments

to  the  Port of Singapore Authority Act, generally

to  tighten  control of activities  and  operations

within  port waters. The Bill will enable the  Port

to  effectively  supervise the users  of  the  seas

around Singapore to ensure that they do not pollute

the  seas  or rivers or cause navigational  hazards

(clause 13). The PSA will also be empowered to levy

rates  for  removal  of  oil  pollution  and  other

services,  and  to  levy  dues,  including  garbage

removal  dues. Existing sections dealing with  dues

and  rates  are  replaced with  more  comprehensive

provisions to enable the PSA to charge proper  dues

and rates (clause 8).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Schedule to the Port of Singapore

Authority  Act  is  also  amended  to  reduce   the

membership of the PSA from 14 to 9 and to make  the

period  of  office  more flexible  (clause  18).  A

compact  Board  will  be  able  to  discharge   its

functions   more   effectively  and  expeditiously.

Present  members will continue to serve until  they

complete their terms of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the PSA will achieve the basic

objective of this reorganisation exercise which  is

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



eliminate wastage of manpower and resources, and to

ensure  greater efficiency and better co-ordination

of personnel dealing with related shipping matters.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  support most of the moves and the  changes

that are taking place in the PSA. But I am a little

perturbed  about one or two matters. Firstly,  over

the  last  two years, the PSA's work has increased.

The  Authority is taking over the function  of  the

Light Dues Board. On one previous occasion I raised

an  objection to the Authority being in  charge  of

pollution when we already have a Department in  the

Government to look into pollution problems. It is a

well  known  fact that the PSA not only deals  with

matters  concerning the port but it has  also  gone

into  business, like building houses for its  staff

and building hawker centres, not in conformity with

the  Government's policy of providing cheap housing

for  our  citizens  and  of building  cheap  hawker

centres  for  the  hawkers. Can something  be  done

about this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to raise is the reduction

of  membership of the PSA. At the moment, the  NTUC

is  represented in the PSA. Will the  reduction  of

membership  affect the NTUC representation  in  the

PSA?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards cheap

housing for the staff of the PSA, we will look into

the  matter  to  see  whether the  present  housing

scheme  is  really not sufficiently economical  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second question, the NTUC will be

represented in the reconstituted PSA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to be made to the Merchant Shipping

Act  (Cap. 172 of the Revised Edition) are a result

of  the transfer of certain functions of the Marine

Department to the Port of Singapore Authority. This

Bill proposes the following main changes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the function of the Director of Marine in

granting   port   clearance  to   vessels   to   be

transferred to the Port Master (clauses 10 and 31);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the examination and issue of certificates of

competency as steersman to be the responsibility of

the PSA (clauses 4 to 8 and 14);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the PSA to have general supervision over all

matters  relating  to  wrecks in  Singapore  waters

(clauses 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24 and 25);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the PSA to have jurisdiction over the

licensing  of  harbour craft which  operate  solely

within port limits (clause 37); and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the Port Master to be empowered to detain or

refuse  port clearance to any ship which has failed

to comply with our maritime laws (clause 33).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following other changes are also proposed:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the licensing of pilgrim brokers by the Deputy

Commissioner  of  Police to be transferred  to  the

Pilgrimage Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs

(clauses 11, 12 and 13);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Director of Marine or the Port Master to

be  empowered to prohibit any vessel from  entering

Singapore  waters  if it is not in  the  Republic's

interest  for the vessel to enter (clause 28).  The

purpose  is to ensure that ships especially tankers

which have suffered casualty may not be allowed  to

come in if there is risk of massive oil pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Department staff, who are required to

be  transferred  to the service of  the  PSA  as  a

result  of  this  exercise, will be transferred  on

terms  as near as may be to those they had  enjoyed

immediately prior to their transfer (clause 45).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that all these changes will enhance

the efficiency of the Port. The streamlining of the

functions of the Marine Department and the PSA will

bring  about better co-ordination which will result

in a better service to our port users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I remember

correctly,  in the Light Dues (Repeal)  Bill  where

provision  is  made  for the staff  of  the  Marine

Department  to  be  transferred  to  the  PSA,  the

Minister  of State said that the transfer  will  be

"on terms no less favourable than those enjoyed  by

them" in the previous department. But in this Bill,

the phraseology is a little different. The Minister

of  State said that the transfer will be "on  terms

as near as may be." I think that is not good enough

because when staff is transferred, it should be  on

terms  no  less favourable than what they enjoy  in

the Marine Department. They are not responsible for

the transfer from the Marine Department to the PSA.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House is based on the existing

Sale  of  Food and Drugs Act which was  enacted  in

1955.  Major changes are, however, made in the  new

Bill  to  meet with changing circumstances  and  to

provide  for more effective control over  the  sale

and preparation of food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Bill provides measures to ensure the

quality  and  purity of food. It seeks to  prohibit

the  sale  or  other  disposition  or  the  use  of

articles dangerous or injurious to health. It  also

seeks to prevent deception and fraud arising out of

the sale of food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complementary Bill, to be known as The Food

Handlers' Regulations, is being drafted.  Its  main

purpose  is  to exercise control over  all  persons

involved in the sale or preparation of food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sale of Food Bill and The Food Handlers'

Regulations  will  between  them  ensure  that  the

required  standards  of  health  and  hygiene   are

maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control over advertisements relating to food and

appliances connected with food has been extended to

include  printed  or  broadcast  advertisements  to

prevent misleading of the public. There was no such

provision  in  the  existing Act, which  controlled

only labelling statements on packaged food.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act also provides control over appliances

connected  with food. There have been instances  in

the  past in which food appliances of an insanitary

or  dangerous nature have been sold or used, but as

control of such appliances was not covered  in  the

existing Act, the prohibition of their use or  sale

could not be enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further inclusion in the new Act provides for

the  definition  of "analysis" of food  to  include

micro-biological  assay.  The  previous  definition

permitted  only chemical analysis. The  time  limit

during which legal proceedings may be instituted in

respect of offences has also been extended from the

original  28  days  to 56 days  from  the  time  of

purchasing  a  sample of the  article  or  food  or

appliance. This is to provide sufficient time for a

detailed  analysis  to  be  carried  out,  as   the

standard of food technology has now advanced  to  a

stage which allows more complex methods of analysis

to be performed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions are, in the main, similar to

those in the existing Act.

whether   the  Ministry  concerned  has   its   own

facilities   to   carry  out  microbiological   and

chemical analyses. If it has, will it then not be a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Creche Establishments Bill was introduced in

Parliament on 16th February, 1973. This  Bill,  now

before   the  House,  seeks  to  provide  for   the

licensing, control and supervision of creches so as

to  ensure  that the education, health, safety  and

welfare  of  young children who are  sent  to  such

creches are adequately taken care of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent enquiries made by the Social Welfare

Department  revealed  that  a  number  of   private

creches are operating in residential areas.  A  few

of   these  creches  offer  day-care  service   for

preschool  children, and in addition some  of  them

offer   residential  care  for  infants  and  young

children.   Some  of  these  private  creches   are

operated by untrained or unqualified staff. Most of

these  creches  charge considerably high  fees  for

their service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for day-care facilities for children is

expected to increase in view of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) greater job opportunities for women, arising

from    rapid   industrialisation   and    economic

expansion, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the shortage of "baby amahs".



With  the trend towards smaller family units living

in  compact high-rise flats where other members  of

their  extended family are not so readily available

to  render  them any assistance, those families  in

which  both  the husband and wife have to  be  away

from  their homes to work elsewhere in the day will

have  to  rely more and more on child-care services

from  outside the home. It is therefore likely that

there will be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



proliferation of private creches being established,

particularly  in private housing estates,  to  meet

the needs and convenience of working couples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are concrete plans to establish

more Government creches, the policy is to encourage

and   help  the  private  sector,  especially   the

industrial  organisations, to  set  up  creches  in

their premises so as to reduce the high turnover in

their  female  labour  force  and  to  induce  more

married  women  to  take  up  employment  in  their

factories. In fact, one leading industrial firm has

already  approached  the Social Welfare  Department

for advice and assistance to set up a creche in its

premises for children of its female employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the expected increase in the number of

private  creches,  there should be  some  means  of

controlling  and  supervising  these  creches.   At

present,   there   is   no   Government   authority

responsible   for   the  licensing,   control   and

supervision  of private creches, nor is  there  any

legislation   on  the  matter.  It   is   therefore

essential    that   appropriate   legislation    be

introduced   as  soon  as  possible,  setting   out

appropriate  standards  for the  establishment  and

operation  of creches, to ensure that the interests

of   the  children  attending  these  creches   are

adequately  safeguarded. It is  also  necessary  to

ensure  that the public is not exploited by  creche

operators  through the inadequacies or  neglect  on

the part of the operators or through the collection

of excessively high fees. On the other hand, laying

down the standards and rules for establishment  and

operation of a creche will facilitate and help  the

private  sector  or  any  individual  to  plan  and

operate any proposed creche establishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these reasons, my Ministry has proposed

the  enactment of this legislation.  The  views  of

concerned  Government  Departments,  including  the

Ministries  of  Health, Education and  Labour,  the

Public  Works  Department and  the  Singapore  Fire

Brigade, have been sought and incorporated  in  the

Bill.  All the authorities concerned have supported

the    proposal    to   introduce    this    Creche

Establishments Bill and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



have  agreed  to  liaise on matters  pertaining  to

their  respective areas of work. Their  suggestions

and    requirements   have   been   given   careful

consideration and, as far as possible, included  in

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the Department of Social

Welfare  be the administrative authority  for  this

legislation and its rules and regulations.  Members

will note that under the Bill a "creche" is defined

as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"any premises where children under the age of six

years  are received, whether for reward or not,  to

be looked after during the whole or part of the day

or  night  but does not include nursing  homes  and

maternity homes as defined in the Nursing Homes and

Maternity  Homes  Registration  Act  and  preschool

institutions  registered  with  the   Ministry   of

Education".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A main provision in the Bill is to make it an

offence  for any person to operate a creche without

a  licence,  thus disallowing any sub-standard  and

improper  creches  to  be  established.  The   Bill

provides,  inter  alia, for the  appointment  of  a

Licensing Officer and Assistant Licensing Officers,

the  manner of the application for the licence, the

duration  of  the  licence and  the  inspection  of

creche  premises.  In  addition,  it  empowers  the

Minister  to  make  regulations to  carry  out  the

purposes and provisions of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increasing number of creches being

established or to he established and to protect the

interests of the young children who will be sent to

such  creches,  there is a pressing need  to  enact

this  legislation in order to license, control  and

supervise establishment of creches on the one hand,

and to provide some guidelines for creche operators

to follow by, on the other.

creches  are  being  planned in  the  immediate  or

foreseeable  future,  especially  in  the   densely

populated  housing  estates,  like  Toa  Payoh   or

Queenstown and even in the rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this Bill is very

timely. Basically, this is another example  of  our

Government's  good  measures in looking  after  our

young citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Social Welfare Department has already

been  running some creches for the care of children

of  working women, most of them are situated in the

city areas. Children of working women living in the

kampungs are therefore not being looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process of rapid industrialisation, we

need  more  and more creches because many factories

need   more  female  workers.  Married  women   are

therefore encouraged to come out of the kitchen  to

join the production team so as to take part in  the

industrialisation  programme.  This   is   not   to

encourage them to rebel against their husbands, but

to  enhance  their  social and  economic  position.

Moreover,  this will help to increase our  national

production  and economic progress. Therefore,  this

is a wise measure on the part of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most housewives are faced with the problem of

caring  for  their children in their  absence,  and

there  is  also  the difficulty  of  getting  "baby

amahs".  Similarly, many women who are occupied  in

other fields of work, including teachers, also need

to  put their children in creches so that they  can

devote  more time to their work. Therefore, on  the

implementation  of  this  Bill,  I  hope  that  the

Minister  will consider setting up more creches  in

more  areas, particularly in industrial and private

residential  areas, including Jurong and  Sembawang

constituencies,  because this will help  housewives

to  join in the industrialisation programme, and to

reduce the dependence on "baby amahs".

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, what the Parliamentary Secretary  had

said  just  now,  relating to the establishment  of

more creches, is very good. I give my whole support

to this Bill. But on the one hand, he has said that

he wants better facilities in these creches, and on

the  other  hand  he has said that the  expenditure

should  not  be too high. We cannot have  both,  of

course.  If  we  can achieve one objective,  it  is

already  good enough. So I hope that when the  Bill

is  put  into  effect,  the  Government  would  not

interfere with those private creches whose fees are

high   but   they   are  able  to  provide   better

facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for

the  establishment of more creches to be run by the

Government  has  arisen because not all  industries

can  afford to run creches of their own. I  welcome

this  Bill because the intention is to set up  more

creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the complaints that are normally raised are

that  the creches close at a time when the  mothers

are  still  at  work.  Sir,  even  the  newspapers'

complaints mention that they close at 5.00 p.m. or 5.30  p.m.

The solution to the problem during  the

course  of  drawing  up the regulations  for  these

creches  is  for the Ministry of Social Affairs  to

consider  the possibility of extending their  hours

or  of  specifying various periods of  service,  so

that  working mothers who leave their  children  in

the creche early may come to collect their children

early.  And those mothers who work in the afternoon

can  similarly  call in the afternoon  and  collect

their  children  late  in  the  evening.  If   such

arrangements can be made, it will certainly help  a

lot  of working mothers. After all, the policy  now

is to encourage our women to work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

question  is one of clarification. Under the  Bill,

the  definition of "creche" is "any premises  where

children  under the age of six years are received."

Question   is  whether  this  definition   includes

kindergartens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



If   it   does,   does  it  therefore   mean   that

kindergartens run by private bodies,  for  example,

the  People's  Association, or  political  parties,

will henceforth need to be legislated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

let  me answer the question asked by the Member for

Kim  Keat regarding the number of creches  that  we

have.  I can say that we have 11 creches now.  This

year we are planning to build two more creches, one

at  Toa  Payoh and the other at Kallang  Basin.  In

other  areas,  for instance, Jurong  Town,  Katong,

Queens-town, Woodlands, if there is a need, we will

of course set up more creches. So if the Member for

Sembawang has any need for more creches, he can put

in his proposal to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned about certain

private  creches charging, expensive fees.  We  can

say  that  we  are not exercising any control  over

these  high  charges, because it  is  a  matter  of

supply and demand. So if parents want to send their

children to such creches, it is their own business.

If  the  charges of these private creches  are  too

high,  while  the Government's creches  charge  too

cheaply, perhaps these private creches will have to

close down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has said that the

opening  hours of the creches are rather short,  so

that  certain mothers find it inconvenient  because

when  they  go  back  to fetch their  children  the

creches  are already closed. Perhaps we can suggest

a 24-hour service in which the staff work in shifts

so  that  working mothers can fetch their  children

from these creches at all times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng asked whether the

definition of "creche" includes kindergartens. This

is  a  matter  of age. The children are  under  six

years  of age, and it is run as a creche and not  a

kindergarten.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, my question is relevant,

because  in kindergartens, the children  are  under

the age of six. The definition in this Bill is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



wide,  and  therefore it seems that a  kindergarten

falls  within  the  definition.  Sir,  my  question

therefore   again  is  whether,   in   fact,   this

definition includes kindergartens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are about 7,000 acres of land

designated  as "Nature Reserves" under  the  Nature

Reserves Act. This Bill proposes to amend  the  Act

so  as to reorganise and to strengthen the Board of

The  amendment provides for the Board of Management

to consist of a trustee as Chairman to be appointed

by  the Minister and not less than six but not more

than  nine  other trustees, two of  whom  shall  be

appointed  by the President and the others  by  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Geneva Convention Bill is to give effect in

Singapore  to the four Conventions adopted  at  the

Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries held  in

Geneva  in  1949.  It  is  the  intention  of   the

Singapore   Government  to  accede  to   the   four

Conventions, the texts of which are set out in  the

Schedules to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, the Conventions have been acceded to by

132  countries.  It  is considered  desirable  that

Singapore  should now formally join in  with  those

countries in upholding the fundamental objective of

the Conventions, which is the observance of certain

principles of human rights in situations  of  armed

conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, the Conventions lay down basic

humanitarian rules, which should be observed by all

contracting  parties, in all cases of declared  war

or  of  any  other armed conflict which  may  arise

between  two  or  more of the contracting  parties,

even  if the state of war is not recognised by  one

of them. They also apply to all cases of partial or

total  occupation of the territory of a contracting

party, even if such occupation meets with no  armed

resistance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Convention deals with the amelioration

of  the  condition of the wounded and sick  of  the

armed  forces  in the field. The second  Convention

deals  with  the amelioration of the  condition  of

wounded,  sick  and shipwrecked  members  of  armed

forces at sea. The third Convention deals with  the

treatment  of prisoners of war. The last Convention

deals  with  the protection of civilian persons  in

time of war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conventions specify that persons taking no

active  part in hostilities and those out of action

due  to  illness, wounds, captivity  or  any  other

cause,  should  be humanely treated  and  protected

against  inhuman  treatment,  and  that  those  who

suffer  should  be  given relief and  care  without

distinction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conventions also lay down certain minimum

standards  which  contracting parties  should  also

observe in the case of an armed conflict not of  an

international character occurring in the  territory

of one contracting party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Conventions should in no way prevent

a  state  from exercising its rights of sovereignty

and  punishing,  on the basis of its  own  national

law,  any person guilty of undermining the security

of the state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the obligations prescribed in

the  Conventions,  this Bill makes  it  an  offence

punishable   with   life  or  up   to   14   years'

imprisonment for any person to commit  any  of  the

grave breaches set out in the Conventions. The Bill

also  contains procedural safeguards for the  trial

and  defence  of  a protected prisoner  of  war,  a

protected  internee or a person  accused  of  grave

breaches set out in the Conventions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the formal accession by Singapore to the four

Conventions and the incorporation of the  Singapore

Red  Cross  Society  by an Act of  Parliament,  the

Singapore  Red Cross Society will now  be  able  to

take its place in the League of Red Cross Societies

at Geneva and participate with other national Red

accord  the Singapore Red Cross Society the  status

of the national Red Cross Society. This will enable

it  to  take its place in the League of  Red  Cross

Societies  and  be  bounded  by  the  International

Committee  of  the Red Cross which administers  the

Geneva Conventions, on which I spoke a little while

earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Cross is dedicated to the prevention and

alleviation of human suffering in peace and in war.

In peacetime it is concerned with disaster relief.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



In  addition  to the Society's local activities  in

this respect it will, after the Bill is passed,  be

the  national  society which  will  participate  in

disaster  relief operations which  may  be  mounted

internationally or regionally by the League of  Red

Cross  Societies. In war-time it will be the agency

for  the protection of the wounded and sick of  the

parties in the conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the periods of stress or national

disasters,  the  Society also  plays  the  role  of

medical  auxiliaries  to  the  public  health   and

welfare  authorities. Amongst the better  known  of

its   services  are  its  ambulance   service   and

assistance at accidents. It is hoped that  its  new

role  of  a National Society will expand  to  other

fields  of activities which supplement the national

medical services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also reserves to the Society the right to

use  the  Red Cross emblem or title and provides  a

penalty  of  $1,000 or six months' imprisonment  or

both,  for  the use of the emblem or title  by  any

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will see from the Long title of the Bill

and the Explanatory Statement that this Bill amends

and  consolidates  the  law  with  respect  to  the

securities  industry  and  repeals  the  Securities

Industry Act, 1970 (No. 61



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



of 1970) which was passed by Parliament on 30th

December, 1970, but for reasons which will be given

later on, was not brought into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Second Reading speech at the time that

that  legislation was before Members,  I  dealt  in

considerable detail with the background to and  the

reasons for bringing in legislation to control  the

securities industry and trading in securities. This

speech appears in the Hansard, Volume 30, cols.  461-7.

I  do not need to repeat at any great  length

what  was said at that time for neither the reasons

for,   nor   the   background  of,   the   proposed

legislation  have changed. The need,  however,  for

such  legislation  being  made  operative  has,  if

anything, become more pressing with the passing  of

time.  We  are  continually being made  aware  from

happenings in the market that investors need to  be

protected,  so  far as is possible  to  do  so,  by

legislative    intervention    from    unscrupulous

manipulation  and  share  rigging  on   the   Stock

Exchange. These are matters which stockbrokers with

the best will in the world as a body are unable  or

not  agreeable to control voluntarily. Needless  to

say, statutory provisions on these matters will not

provide the universal panacea. The Government  will

still  look  to  the  Stock Exchange  for  its  co-operation  in  exposing dishonesty and malpractices

in  share  trading. In this and in  other  ways  we

anticipate that the Stock Exchange will justify the

Government's policy in relying upon self-regulation

on  the  Stock  Exchange rather than  imposing  the

strict  forms  of control implicit in  a  statutory

body  similar to the Securities Exchange Commission

in the United States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my earlier speech to which I have referred, I

reminded Members that Singapore and Malaysia  enjoy

a  common  Stock Exchange which over the years  has

existed  to the undoubted economic benefit of  both

countries. I went on to say that Members  would  be

reassured  to  learn that it was the  intention  of

both  Governments that this common  Stock  Exchange

should continue in existence,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



and to enable this to be done it was essential that

Singapore and Malaysia should have a uniform

approach in legislation dealing with the securities

industry and share trading. To this end,

consultations have taken place between us and the

Malaysian Government, and I am most pleased to

record that these consultations have come to a

happy and fruitful conclusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that Malaysia introduced a

Securities  Industry Bill into their Parliament  on

the 22nd January, 1973. This Bill has been modelled

on our earlier Securities Industry Act, but it also

contains important additional provisions which were

agreed  to  by the two Governments and  which  have

been  incorporated  in  the  present  consolidating

measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I last spoke to Members on this subject, I

am  glad  to  record  that  the  Committee  of  the

Exchange   has  implemented  new  rules  to   limit

excessive speculation. Nevertheless, careful  watch

will  need  to  be  maintained  to  ensure  that  a

resurgence  of  market  euphoria  does  not   carry

speculation    beyond   reasonable    bounds.    If

speculation  becomes excessive,  or  if  for  other

reasons  the market becomes or is likely to  become

disorderly or unhealthy, appropriate corrective and

remedial action will be called for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delay in bringing our earlier Securities

Industry  Act into operation was due to the  desire

to   reach   full  agreement  with  the   Malaysian

Government on this uniform approach. As things have

turned  out, the delay has been fortuitous  for  it

has  given  us  an  opportunity to propose  further

measures  with regard to regulation of  dealers  in

securities and share trading in the context of  the

existing  booming  share market.  These,  like  the

earlier  provisions, are designed  to  protect  the

interest  of investors to the extent that  this  is

practicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Bill corresponds very closely with

the Bill now before Members. We decided to

introduce a consolidating measure on this subject

rather than an amending Bill including the

additional provisions I have mentioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



since  it  was considered important that references

to  Parts  and sections in our legislation  should,

for the convenience of the financial public and the

administrators of the legislation, correspond  with

the  same  Parts  and  sections  in  the  Malaysian

legislation.  The  new proposals  that  distinguish

this Bill from the earlier Act are mainly concerned-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) with the keeping of records by dealers,

investment  advisers and their representatives  and

employees of stockbrokers and financial journalists

to show their interest in securities (Part V);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) with the conduct of securities business (Part VI);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) with the expansion of the provisions dealing

with  unlawful or dishonest forms of share  trading (Part X).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement describes in sufficient

detail  what this Bill seeks to achieve and I  need

not   deal  with  the  provisions  in  any  detail.

However,  I think it would be useful if I  repeated

what  was said on the Second Reading of the earlier

legislation with regard to the objects and scope of

this proposed legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bill covers the whole of the securities

industry  in  Singapore, I would like to  reiterate

that   the   Bill  does  not  attempt  to   prevent

speculation as such. Some speculation attends every

anticipation or expectation of short or  long  term

price trends which induces trading activity on  the

Exchange.   It  is  and  always  must  remain   the

responsibility of the individual investor to decide

as   to   the   advisability  of   any   particular

investment.  What  the Bill  actually  does  is  to

attempt to see that the stock market operates in  a

fair and open way and that people do not manipulate

the  market by illegal means for their own  profit.

The  Bill,  together with the new rules  that  have

recently  been  passed  by  members  of  the  Stock

Exchange, will, it is considered, go a long way  to

achieve these objectives. However, I would like  to

emphasise  again that the Bill does not merely  pay

lip-service to, but acknowledges, the principle  of

self-regulation  of the Exchange by  the  Committee

and is not intended to interfere



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



with  the day-to-day control by the Committee

of  normal share trading on the Exchange, nor  with

the traditional form, of control that the Committee

exercises  over members of the Exchange  except  on

such  matters  as  the  licensing  of  dealers   in

securities,  the  reduction to  statutory  form  of

existing  Stock Exchange Rules with regard  to  the

maintenance  of  brokers'  trust  funds   and   the

fidelity fund, together with the keeping of records

and  the conduct of securities business to which  I

have referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, for the first time in Singapore,

proposes to license dealers in securities and their

representatives and investment advisers  and  their

employees who are engaged in negotiating investment

in  securities.  The  Government  believes  that  a

system  of  control  by  licensing  of  dealers  in

securities  is necessary at this time and  this  is

particularly  so as regards dealers  in  securities

who  are  not  stockbrokers. For while stockbrokers

have  always  been  subject to certain  traditional

forms  of  control  by  the stock  exchange,  other

dealers  have not been subject to any real form  of

control.  The provisions in the Bill should  ensure

that  only persons of good character and reputation

and in a sound financial position will be permitted

to  be licensed as dealers in securities under  the

Act.  Licensed  dealers will be  required  to  keep

trust accounts and have them audited. This will not

prove  too  burdensome to stockbrokers,  for  under

Stock  Exchange  Rules they have been  required  to

maintain  trust  accounts. Again, licensed  dealers

who  are not stockbrokers will be required to enter

into  a fidelity bond. The reason for this is  that

the fidelity fund provisions in the Bill apply only

to  stockbrokers  who  are  members  of  the  Stock

Exchange. With regard to the latter, they will find

little that is unusual about those provisions,  for

under  the existing Stock Exchange Rules a Fidelity

Guarantee  Fund  was created to compensate  persons

who  suffer  loss  by  reason  of  the  default  of

members.  The  provisions  in  the  Bill  therefore

merely give statutory force to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



establishment of such a fund. The amount of capital

in  the  existing fund will form the basis  of  the

fund established under this Bill. The existing fund

will  be merged with the new fund established under

this Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant feature of the Bill is to be

found in Part IX where new offences are created  in

relation  to  market dealings.  The  first  offence

relates  to  false trading and markets; the  second

offence  to  market rigging activities;  the  third

offence  to  inducing  the  sale  or  purchase   of

securities   by   the   dissemination   of    false

information; the fourth offence which is drafted in

the  widest possible terms to deal with inter  alia

insider  trading  by officers of a  company,  their

legal  and financial advisers and even by any other

person  who  may acquire confidential  information.

This  provision  together with  the  more  specific

provision  in  section 132A of  the  Companies  Act

should  provide  an adequate framework  to  proceed

against  insiders.  The latter  offence,  like  the

other  offences,  carries  a  maximum  penalty   of

$30,000 or five years' imprisonment or to both.  It

may  not often be necessary for prosecutions to  be

launched  under these sections, as  in  the  United

States similar provisions have been used with great

effect to inhibit those wrongful practices which do

so much to destroy a true market in securities. The

Government believes, and I must repeat, that it  is

important that Parliament should clearly state  its

abhorrence of such practices, which already  appear

to  have become widespread in the market, and  that

every  effort should be and will be made  to  stamp

them out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of insider trading, I should also

add  that  in a new Companies (Amendment) Bill  the

existing  section  l32A  dealing  with  trading  by

officers of a company in their company shares  will

be considerably expanded and tightened up. Not only

will  power he sought to enable the Stock  Exchange

to  conduct  a full enquiry into these matters  but

also  regulations will be made designed to restrict

the dealings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



of   officers  of  companies,  members   of   their

families,  their legal and financial  advisers,  in

the   shares  of  their  companies  during  certain

periods  of the financial year of the company  when

they  are  or  are  likely to be in  possession  of

confidential   information  likely,  if   generally

known,  to  affect  the prices of  their  company's

shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the recently established Securities

Industry Council will, amongst its other functions,

be  operating as a watchdog in market trading  and,

with  the  active co-operation oc the Committee  of

the  Stock  Exchange, it is anticipated that  steps

will  be taken to punish and publicly expose  those

persons who indulge in insider trading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Government's views on insider

trading  and  other  dishonest  and  unfair   share

trading   practices  coincide  with  the  Singapore

Government's views, and provisions on most, if  not

all,  of  these  matters appear  in  the  Malaysian

Securities Industry Bill in much the same  form  as

in the Bill now before Members. It is expected that

further  meetings  with  representatives   of   the

Malaysian  Government will shortly  take  place  to

discuss matters of common interest relating to  the

whole  field of the securities industry and,  inter

alia,  to  decide what further measures  should  be

taken to ensure that the stock market is maintained

in a fair and healthy state. In this connection,  I

would like to draw the attention of Members to  the

wide  powers conferred upon the Minister, in clause

95 of the Bill, to regulate the stock market. Some,

if  not  all, of these regulatory powers appear  in

the Malaysian Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I make my

observation  on  the Securities  Industry  Bill,  I

would  like  to  make  a  proposal  concerning  the

requirement  of investment advisers and  stock  and

share journalists to declare their interests before

they can comment on the stock and share market. My



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



proposal is that all Members in this House who wish

to  make  a  speech today against this Bill  should

also  declare  their interests, otherwise  it  will

give  rise  to suspicion. In this way we  would  be

fair  to the investment advisers and so on.  In  so

far  as  I am concerned, I speak in support of  the

Bill. So whether or not I have got any shares is  a

matter inapplicable to my proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that whatever legislation is

introduced by the Government, it is always done  in

the best interests of the people. That is the first

consideration. Any proposed legislation that is  at

variance  with  the basic interests of  the  people

will  never  get  the support of the  people.  This

means  that it will be difficult for us to  achieve

our  desired  objective. The introduction  of  this

Securities  Industry Bill will, I believe,  benefit

the  people in general, and the investors in stocks

and shares in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is timely. As we all

know, the present boom in our economy has attracted

increasing  foreign interest in the  local  market.

Coupled  with  the success of industrialisation  in

recent years, this has attracted the massive inflow

of foreign capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic is regarded by foreign industrialists

and investors as an ideal place for investment.  It

is  against this background that our Stock Exchange

has  become  so  active and the market  heated  up.

Current developments, however, have given rise to a

misconception among some people that they can  reap

handsome  profits just by dumping their money  into

the  share market; just like a gold mine. Actually,

an  active and heated share market is not in itself

an  undesirable  phenomenon, but  the  question  is

whether  this sort of frenzy has been the  work  of

speculators and manipulators and not the result  of

normal development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of getting easy money in this way,

instead  of through normal hard work, has attracted

many   people  to  try  their  luck  at  the  Stock

Exchange.  If the situation is allowed to continue,

unchecked, it will not only weaken the will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



and  spirit of our people to work hard but it  will

also  impede our industrial development. Take  Hong

Kong,  for  example.  There, the  share  market  is

probably more active and more heated than  that  in

Singapore.  Professional people, and even  domestic

servants,  have seen fit to abandon  their  regular

jobs  and  take to share speculation. As a  result,

Hong  Kong  industrialists have  expressed  concern

over the industrial future of the colony. This  may

well  be  a good lesson for us. In order to protect

our  people's interests and to encourthem  to  make

bona  fide  investments, the introduction  of  this

Bill is absolutely necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to implement this piece of legislation in

accordance  with its true spirit, the  co-operation

and  assistance of the responsible officials of the

Stock   Exchange  and  the  sharebrokers  will   be

necessary. They will play an important part in this

respect. If these people were to go their own  ways

without  regard for the true spirit  of  the  Bill,

they  will  do  no good to themselves  and  to  the

people  in general. On the other hand, if they  are

willing  and  ready  to co-operate  and  assist  in

ensuring   the   smooth   implementation   of   the

provisions of the Bill, they will do a good service

to  the  national economy and the interests of  the

people, including themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a global city and a prosperous society,

Singapore   cannot  go  without  an  active   Stock

Exchange  in operation. The Stock Exchange provides

the   vital  link  in  a  prosperous  and  economic

society.   An   economically  prosperous   country,

without  a share market in operation, will be  just

like  a  modern  city without electrical  currents.

Therefore, while the activities of the share market

should  be strictly regulated, I believe it can  be

made even more active and booming through sound and

proper  administration, so that the people will  be

able  to  enjoy  a  more  wholesome  atmosphere  of

investment in stock and shares.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Bill  before the House is generally considered

to be an enlightened piece of legislation on a very

complicated subject. The Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



is  to be congratulated for this. However, for  the

Bill to take effect on implementation, it seems  to

me  that  it will be necessary for the Ministry  to

provide a staff with sufficient knowledge of market

operations to assist the Minister and the Registrar

of  Companies  in  fulfilling  their  functions.  I

should  appreciate it if the Minister would  inform

the  House  as  to what administrative arrangements

are being made or will be made in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market trends in recent months have very

clearly shown that there is perhaps too much  money

chasing  too  few stocks. In view  of  this,  I  am

wondering  what steps are being taken to  encourage

more  companies  to  go  public,  and  whether  the

Minister  would  consider  directing  some  of  the

Government-backed or Government-owned companies  to

go  public.  In  this connection  I  have  in  mind

companies  such  as  Singapore Airlines,  Sembawang

Shipyard,  and  Jurong  Shipyard.  All  these   are

capital  intensive  undertakings,  with  tremendous

group  potential. At the present juncture of  their

development,   I  should  have  thought   that   an

injection  of  fresh capital from the  public  will

help in their expansion programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

fact  that there is really nothing but support from

the House, I do not think there is very much for me

to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take the enquiry of the Member for

Jalan  Kayu.  He  asked  whether  there  were   any

arrangements  made for an effective  implementation

of  the  Bill. I hasten to assure him that we  will

make  all the necessary arrangements to ensure that

staff  will  be  adequate to  deal  with  the  very

essential problems of administration. I believe the

Registry  of  Companies will  be  moving  into  new

premises  in the newly erected building behind  the

City  Hall, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore

will  also have in that same building some of their

offices dealing especially with companies. I  think

the combination should be sufficient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



to allay any doubts or anxieties about our

being serious in implementing the present

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of more companies going public,

I believe I have expressed my views on this matter,

in  asking  as  many companies as  possible  to  go

public.  As  far as Government-owned companies  are

concerned,  I  think  a  number  of  them  will  be

examining  the position after the end of the  year.

It is necessary in order to enable the companies to

be  floated to prepare the accounts so that  public

issue prospectuses can be prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Bras Basah requires

any  answer, but I am glad to note that he  is  for

the Bill and it does not matter whether he owns any

shares  or  not.  I agree with him that  an  active

Stock   Exchange   is   very  necessary   for   the

development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase "or constitutes" is inappropriate as at

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the

clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of this amendment is to enable the

Registrar,  in  deciding whether a  dealer  or  his

representative  or  an investment  advisor  or  his

representative is fit and proper person to  hold  a

licence  under  the  Act, to enquire  whether  that

person  has  conducted his business in a  fair  and

proper  way  and  according  to  accepted  business

standards.  In  order to do this, it is  considered

that  the Registrar should have the power  to  look

into any transaction involving the purchase or sale

of  securities  entered into by that person  during

any  period  of 12 months preceding the application

for  a  licence or renewal of a licence. If,  as  a

resultof this enquiry, he finds that a person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



has  in  the course of his business used dishonest,

unfair  or  unethical devices or trading practices,

this  would  be  a point of consideration  for  the

Registrar to bear in mind in deciding whether  that

person  was a fit and proper person to be  licensed

to carry on his business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can, of course, be argued that the inclusion of

such a provision is not really necessary, since the

Registrar  would have an implied power or authority

to do what the proposed provision enables him to do

in  any  event. But the way a person  has  recently

carried   on   his  business  must   be   a   vital

consideration in deciding whether he is a  fit  and

proper person to be allowed to continue to carry on

his   business.  And  naturally,  there  are  other

considerations; for example, if a person has had  a

conviction  for  a criminal offence,  or  has  been

declared a bankrupt, he would not on the face of it

be considered to he a fit and proper person to hold

a  licence under the Act. The provision is inserted

to  facilitate  the  making  of  enquiries  by  the

Registrar in this matter and to avoid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



the  raising  of doubts as to the exercise  of  his

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provision is intended to cover an

application  for a licence, in the first  instance,

and  an  application  for  renewal  of  a  licence.

Licences  will,  under the Bill,  be  valid  for  a

period of 12 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is intended, that this new clause

be inserted immediately after clause 16. Amendments

are,  therefore, required to be made  to  re-number

the  clauses, consequent on the addition of the new

clause. These will be done.
