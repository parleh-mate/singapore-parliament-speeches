<div align="center"><b>(Reduction of period for graduates with specialist qualifications)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for Defence

if  he  will consider reducing the period of national

service  from  two years to six months for  graduates

who have specialist qualifications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Singapore Armed  Forces  aims  at

building  and  sustaining an efficient and  effective

force  of  trained  men  in the  Reserve.  To  be  an

effective Reserve Force, during the period  of  their

full-time  service  the national servicemen  have  to

receive a high standard of training. The Reserve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



service can only maintain the standard that has  been

achieved, it cannot advance that standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of time, the necessary period for basic

training  requires  between four and  twelve  months'

training,  dependent on the vocation of the  national

servicemen,   even   assuming   that   the   national

serviceman has had previous technical training.  This

must   be  followed  by  on-the-job  experience   and

additional  training  to  advanced  levels   in   the

respective vocations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training of an officer takes up to two years

depending  on  the vocation that he is being  trained

for,  and  his previous qualifications. Additionally,

at least one year's experience as an officer is necessary  before an officer can be considered for service

in the Reserve Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important factor to consider is that there

is  not  a sufficient supply of skilled men available

to  enable  rep1acements to be called  up  every  six

months. It is particularly important, therefore, that

in  the case of skilled personnel they serve at least

two years of full-time service.







<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am not satisfied with the reply given

by the Minister. He said that it requires one year to

train  an  officer, but graduates after  passing  out

must have learnt a lot either in the field of science

or  art. They are scholars. So how can they be turned

into soldiers? In my view, it is wrong. Graduates are

specialists  in  their own fields  and  I  feel  they

should contribute their specialities to the needs  of

our  society  instead of wasting their  time  in  the

army. Therefore, I think six months of training  will

suffice  for them. I also feel that many people  will

oppose   the  continuation  of  two  years'  national

service.  Our country is not at war and there  is  no

need  to  turn  scholars into soldiers. Parents  have

spent  a  lot  of  money on the  education  of  their

children ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, do you have a

supplementary question?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in my view, it

is very important that graduates, after passing out,

should contribute their bit to society, particularly

those overseas students who are reluctant to come

back to Singapore because of the statutory

requirement to undergo national service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I do not think the

Member  has really listened to my reply. He may  have

his own opinion, but we have gone thoroughly into the

question. I would like him to understand that this is

a  modern  technological age,  and  in  the  army  we

require  people with specialist training and of  high

mental  calibre. Therefore, it is necessary  that  we

should conscript into the army people with specialist

training  who  have gone through the third  stage  of

education  in order to make the army a very efficient

force.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  answer given by the Minister was not what I was

asking for. What I asked was that two years training

should be reduced to six months. He has not answered

that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if the Member had listened

very carefully to my reply, he would have heard why I

said  that  it is not possible to train a man  within

six months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

can  make use of Saturdays and Sundays to train these

graduates.   Of  course,  six  months  may   not   be

sufficient,  but we can find ways and means  to  give

them additional training.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL DEFENCE FUND</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of committee for public donations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for Defence

whether  he  has  any  intention  of  setting  up   a

committee  for the purpose of inviting the public  to

donate to the National Defence Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stated late

last  year  that  the  target set  for  the  National

Defence  Fund  is $10 million. At present,  the  fund

stands at $8,343,897.84 as at 28th March, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Defence Fund was officially set up on

29th  January,  1968,  as the result  of  spontaneous

contributions towards national defence by some groups

of  citizens. Since then, donations from people  from

all  walks  of  life, such as school children,  taxi-drivers,

hawkers, business concerns and Government departments,

have been spontaneous, indicating a strong

sense of loyalty and concern among the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, then, to set up a committee to

invite  donations from the public, in order to  raise

another $1.7 million more, would seem unnecessary, as

most  people are well aware of the existence  of  the

National   Defence  Fund.  I  am  sure,   with   some

contributions from the large foreign and local  firms

in Singapore, the target would be easily reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions from the public must be voluntary, and

must  be willingly given by the people as the  result

of  a sense of national pride and an awareness of the

imminent   importance  of  building  up   a   defence

capability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee inviting donations from the public,

while  advantageous in spurring up contributions,  in

money or in kind, might be construed as an instrument

to coerce the public to contribute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a society of very civic-minded people

who  contribute  financially to many causes,  and  to

those  who  can well afford it, I am sure they  would

willingly step forward to contribute to the  National

Defence Fund without any pressure.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister

said that since the target is about to be reached and

the fund is going to be wound up, it is not necessary

to set up a committee. But in my view, there ought to

be  a  committee for public donations  so  that  more

money will be collected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I said that there is a limit

of   $10  million  and  there  is  no  intention   of

continuing with the Fund.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for Defence

(a)  what  is the number of gazetted Police  officers

who are provided with orderlies: (b) how many of them

are  engaged (i) in field work which necessitates the

use  of  orderlies;  and (ii) in administrative  work

which does not necessitate the use of orderlies:  (c)

whether  probationary  Assistant  Superintendents  of

Police,  who are performing the duties of  Inspectors

and   while   carrying  out  routine   investigations

accompanied  by  Inspectors, are also  provided  with

orderlies:  (d)  whether gazetted officers,  who  are

serving in the Reserve Units and who have the use  of

Riot  Squad vans for carrying out field work are also

provided  with  orderlies: (e) what  is  the  average

salary  of those orderlies and what form of  training

they  have  to  undergo; (f) how do  these  orderlies

spend  their working hours when they are not  driving

their  officers  on  duty,  and  whether  there   are

definite  instructions to ensure that those orderlies

are  kept fully occupied during their working  hours;

and  (g) whether he will consider setting up a common

pool of drivers/orderlies for the use of officers who

are  engaged  in  field  work  instead  of  providing

drivers/orderlies   to   every    gazetted    officer

irrespective of the nature of work he is engaged in.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the authorised

strength of gazetted Police officers is 205  but  the

actual strength is

192.  At  present, 164 gazetted Police  officers  are

supplied with personal orderlies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, 134 gazetted Police officers are engaged

in  field  work and 29 gazetted Police  officers  are

engaged     in    administrative    work.    However,

administrative officers are also required to perform



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



various  types of outdoor duties depending  upon  the

circumstances prevailing at the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary Assistant Superintendents of Police are

provided  with personal orderlies as a  general  rule

except  whilst they are under training at the  Police

Training  School.  Normally,  Probationary  Assistant

Superintendents performing the duties  of  inspectors

are not accompanied by inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of whether gazetted officers

who are serving in the Reserve Units and who have the

use  of  Riot Squad vans for carrying out field  work

are  also  provided  with orderlies,  the  answer  is

"Yes".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average salary of these orderlies is $228.63 per

month.  Their  training syllabus is  similar  in  all

respects to that of the regular police constables.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from driving their officers, the duties of

officers'  personal orderlies drivers include  care

and  maintenance of officers' uniform and  equipment,

accompanying  officers  on  rounds  or  other  police

duties,   acting  as  messengers,  drivers,  personal

assistants or witnesses when accompanying officers at

all  times and such other duties as the officers  may

direct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now holding discussions with the Police Adviser

with  a  view to stopping this practice of  supplying

all gazetted Police officers with orderlies.

<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is no Co-operative

Development Division in the Ministry but there  is  a

Registry   of   Co-operative  Societies   which   was

transferred from the Ministry of National Development

to  the  Ministry of Social Affairs  on  16th  April,

1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides advising persons who desire to form co-operative

societies on procedures  of  registration,

the Registry provides informal instruction on the  up

keep  of  accounts  and records to officials  of  co-operative

societies, particularly the poorer rural co-

operatives.  It also acts as auditors to certain  co-operatives

which  do  not  engage  the  services  of

professional  accountants. In 1968,  34  co-operative

societies made use of the services of the Registry as

auditors for their accounts. The Registry also  holds

inquiries  into  co-operatives  which  are  found  or

reported   to   be   mismanaged  with   a   view   to

deregistration.  In 1968, seven such  societies  were

deregistered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no representation has so far been made to

the  Ministry in regard to an amendment  of  the  Co-operative

Societies Ordinance, the Ministry will  consider   making  amendments,  if  necessary,  to   the

Ordinance in order to meet the practical difficulties

which  co-operative societies have  experienced  with

the existing Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Co-operative Societies (Modification)

(Amendment) Order, 1954, the contribution of two  per

cent   from  the  net  profits  of  the  co-operative

sccieties to the Co-operative College in Malaysia  is

not  obligatory. As far as my Ministry is aware, only

a  few cooperative societies are contributing to  the

College.  Since  the  separation  of  Singapore  from

Malaysia  in  1965, only four co-operative  societies

have been contributing to the Co-operative College in

Malaysia.  Sixteen co-operative societies  have  made

provision for this purpose but have not remitted such

monies  to  the  College partly on their  own  accord

pending  consideration of finding alternative  places

for  them to undertake the training course. In return

for  such contributions to the College, officials  of

the   contributing   co-operative   societies   could

participate  in  the  short-term  courses  of  formal

instruction in cooperative subjects conducted by  the

College.

<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bukit

Panjang   will   no   doubt   be   aware   that   the

Misrepresentation  Act, 1967, in the  United  Kingdom

was  based  on  the  English Law  Reform  Committee's

Report,  and  introduced  reforms  to  the   law   of

contracts  as well as to the law of torts. The  scope

of  this Act, which has effected some improvements in

the  law,  is  far-reaching, not  only  altering  the

substantive    law   but   conferring    very    wide

discretionary powers on the courts. The  Member  will

also  be  aware that the amendments to the  law  have

been   the   subject  of  considerable  comment   and

criticism   in   the   United   Kingdom.    In    the

circumstances, it is desirable that a  careful  study

of the Act and its effects as shown by the experience

of  the  courts  in  England should  be  made  before

similar legislation is introduced in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certain of the provisions of the Civil Evidence

Act,  1968, of the United Kingdom are already a  part

of  our law of evidence. The Act, which was passed in

the  United Kingdom late last year as a result of the

recommendations  of the Law Reform Committee,  alters

the laws of evidence in relation to civil proceedings

and  in  particular brings about certain  changes  in

respect of privilege against self incrimination.  The

Member  for Bukit Panjang can rest assured  that  the

<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Law Revision

Commissioners  responsible for  the  present  Revised

Edition  of  the Laws of the State of Singapore  must

have  fully considered the amendment to section 4  of

the  Statute  of  Frauds 1677 brought  about  by  the

United  Kingdom Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts)

Act,  1954, and for good reason thought fit to retain

the  law prior to the Amendment Act of 1954 in so far

as  Singapore  is concerned when our  own  Civil  Law

Ordinance  (Chapter  24) was reenacted.  However,  as

there  is considerable disagreement in regard to  the

scope  and  extent  of section 5  of  the  Civil  Law

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Law Reform (Enforcement of

of  1893, the matter has been set beyond doubt as  we

have  seen  fit  not  to extend the  effect  of  that

amendment   here.  Section  5A  of  our   Civil   Law

Ordinance,  added by Ordinance 23 of 1955,  re-enacts

section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, in  so  far

as  it applies to Singapore, thus preserving the rule

which necessitates a contract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



of  sale of goods of $100 and upwards in value to  be

enforceable.  At this stage, Sir, I can  only  assure

the  Member  for Bukit Panjang that consideration  is

being given to the desirability of incorporating  the

amendments brought about by the United Kingdom Act of

1954 by the Law Revision Committee which is presently

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. To ask the Minister for Culture if he will make

a  statement on the proposed conversion of Radio  and

TV  Singapura into a statutory corporation; the  need

for  such a conversion, and if such a conversion will

result  in  changes in the cultural  policy  hitherto

pursued by the Government in relation to Radio and TV

programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Selvadurai.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Question No. 16.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been thought for

quite some time that the public of Singapore will  be

better served by a Radio and Television Service  that

is  run  by a statutory board or even by a commercial

corporation.  The  pros and cons of  this  view  have

received  considerable study and  the  advice  of  an

overseas expert has also been obtained, but  a  final

decision has yet to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main advantage of a statutory hoard or of a

commercial  corporation, as opposed to  a  Government

department of Radio and TV, is that such a  structure

leads   to   better   operational   efficiency    and

convenience.  Radio and Television  has  just  become

financially  independent in so far  as  recurrent  ex

penditure  is  concerned  and  it  is  now  possible,

therefore,  to  give  serious  consideration   to   a

structural change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the outcome of that consideration, there is

no  reason  to suggest that the cultural and  overall

policy  must  be changed as a result of a  change  in

structural organisation.

(a)  whether he is aware that the Government Gazette,

which  is  published  on every  Friday,  reaches  the

public  only on the following Monday, and what  steps

he  proposes to take to make the Gazette available to

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

Gazette is published on Friday and is posted on the

same day. Recipients should, therefore, receive the

Gazette by Saturday or, at the latest, by Monday

since there is no delivery on Sunday. There have been

occasions when the Gazette was ready only very late

on Friday afternoons owing to last-minute

notifications and changes. It has, therefore,

happened that sometimes the Gazette was received on

Mondays instead of Saturdays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have been taken to ensure that material for

the  Gazette  is received, as normally required,  two

days  before the date of publication so that printing

can  be completed on Friday mornings to enable postal

deliveries by Saturday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publication of the Gazette on Fridays has been

traditional and is also convenient to the  Government

Printer  as well as to various Ministries  using  the

Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second shift has now been introduced with the

purpose  of  enhancing the output of  the  Government

Printer as well as to expedite printing efforts. When

the  second  shift is properly run in, a third  shift

will be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that a much improved service may be

expected from the Government Printer when he operates

on three shifts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

my  auditory receptors have been subjected to so much

convincing oration in the past two days that  I  have

almost  become converted to the idea that an Abortion

Bill  is  urgently required in Singapore. The macabre

description given by the Minister for Health  of  the

harms  inflicted on some of our women folk  by  back-alley

abortionists,   and    the    soul-searching

communication by the Minister for Communications make

me  wonder if this Abortion Bill, as it stands, would

be sufficient to meet the needs of thousands of women

requiring    medical    termination    of    unwanted

pregnancies.  Will the Bill, as it is, eradicate  the

parasites  in  the medical world who  thrive  on  the

miseries  and  anxieties of women wanting  abortions?

Will  this Bill, with its restrictive clauses, permit

pregnant  women openly to seek medical  attention?  I

have  the suspicion that this is not going to be  the

case. A woman with an unwanted pregnancy is usually a

desperate  woman. She wants the pregnancy aborted  as

soon  as  possible. Do you really think, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that she will have the patience to wait for  her

case  to  be reviewed by an Authorisation Board?  And

how  long  will it take the members of this Board  to

decide  on  such a case if the Board is snowed  under

with  hundreds  of applications per week?  She  would

surely find some back-alley abortionist to do the job

for  her as this can be done on the same day  of  her

visit.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the Minister for Health has stated, it is the

fundamental right of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



a  woman  to  decide when she is going  to  have  her

babies, obviously the Bill is not liberal enough.  If

the  Minister  is sincere on this fundamental  right,

then  abortion on demand is definitely indicated  and

should be legalised. I take it that when the Minister

talked  of  this fundamental right of women,  he  was

only  confining his remarks to our citizens.  Yet  in

clause  5  (8)  of  the  Bill,  our  female  citizens

residing  outside Singapore will not be  entitled  to

this  fundamental right to have an abortion. This  is

also  applicable to wives of citizens who  happen  to

reside abroad at the time of unwanted pregnancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year when the Minister for Health spoke of

liberalising  the law on abortion as a complement  to

family planning, I said to myself, "Here is a daring,

outspoken and most up-to-date Minister." I thought he

was going to introduce an Abortion Bill that will  be

an all-out Abortion Bill. Alas this is not so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Half-hearted!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> I suspect the Minister and his

advisers  have  a  lot of qualms  about  recommending

legalised abortion. Otherwise, why are there so  many

restrictive clauses? This Bill will not eradicate our

back-alley abortionists who will still create all the

horrifying  complications so clearly  illustrated  by

the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much reference has been made in this House to

the  medical  practitioners. I am not going  to  make

excuses  for  them  nor  am I going  to  explain  the

reasons for any divergent views held by some of them.

The medical profession is noble enough to weather any

storm, political or otherwise. Let me, however, point

out that medical practitioners are not economists and

thus  do  not have the vision or perhaps the acquired

ability  to  visualise the socioeconomic reasons  for

abortion. As citizens, a great majority of them  will

appreciate  the  humanitarian reasons  for  legalised

abortion. Like the rest of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



citizens,  there  is a minority among  them  who  are

beset  by  religious scruples and this has  been  the

bane  of the Minister for Health's life. Surely  this

minority of medical practitioners are free to express

their views on abortion. I respect their views and  I

hope the Minister for Health will do likewise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if abortion is legalised it will be the medical

practitioners who will be doing the operation and not

the  politicians.  Thus,  I  feel  it  is  completely

justified  for  my medical colleagues  to  air  their

opinions on a step which they will be taking, a  step

that  is  so completely radical to what they  are  ac

customed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have the feeling that no matter what we

say, this Bill will be accepted in toto by the House.

If  this  is  going  to be so, then  may  I  suggest

amending  the  title of this Bill to  read  "Abortion

(Restrictive) Bill". If this is so amended, then  the

Bill  may be more acceptable in its title as it  will

indicate  what  it is really meant to  be,  that  is,

legalised abortion will be allowed only for  medical,

legal and socio-economic reasons and not on demand.

<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, after listening to the Member

for Joo Chiat, I am glad that the Minister for Health

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take this opportunity sincerely to

congratulate the Minister for Health  on his able marshalling of

arguments in justification of this   Bill.   In  particular,  I  must

express   my admiration, perhaps not so sincerely, for the way  he anticipated

opposing  arguments,  especially   those

based on religious and ethical grounds. However, I do

not  agree  that he has, as he inferred, disposed  of

those arguments. They are,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



as he mentioned, a matter of view-point, and I am

sure he will agree that no view-point can be rendered

sick simply because the Minister for Health says so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> I do

not say that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> May I hasten to add, Sir, that I do

not wish to discuss the metaphysics of abortion, but

I rise to ask several questions -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is not question time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> - and to seek clarification on some

aspects of the Bill before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the comment by the Minister just now,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, on previous occasions you took  me

to  task  for making speeches when I was supposed  to

ask questions, but I hope the Minister will allow  me

to  ask  questions now that I am supposed to  make  a

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to urge every possible safeguard and caution

in  the  implementation of any  reforms  in  the  law

relating to abortion. I would venture to say that the

Abortion  Bill,  in its present form, justifies  that

caveat which I am entering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like first to refer to clause 5 (2) which

specifies  the  grounds  on  which  abortion  may  be

permitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, sub-clause (2) (a) specifies that the

Termination  of  Pregnancy  Authorisation  Board  may

authorise an abortion if continuance of pregnancy  in

volves  risk  to the life of the pregnant  woman,  or

injury to the physical or mental health of the woman.

Does  it not seem, Sir, that the wording itself  here

appears  to be a little risky? What sort of  odds  in

favour  of deleterious effects, physical and  mental,

should be calculated before a person can be permitted

an   abortion?  My  misgivings  over  this  type   of

ambiguity are not lessened by the knowledge that such

risk  and  possibility of injury referred to  may  be

based  on  the  opinion, formed in good  faith,  that

abortion is necessary! What is this good faith,  Sir?

Surely,  the  emphasis  should  be  on  ascertainable

medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



skill,  rather  than on flimsy grounds  of  faith.  A

theological   virtue,  Sir,  to  which  perhaps   the

Minister does not subscribe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An abortion, even when performed by a qualified and

experienced  doctor, poses itself as a risk  to  life

and a danger to health physical and mental. There has

been,   to   my   mind,  adequate  and  authoritative

assertion that this is so. This being so, is  it  not

logical  to  expect that an abortion  should  be  per

mitted  only if there is grave danger to life  or  if

there  is  grave risk of injury, and of  injury  that

will  have lasting consequences to physical or mental

health? Nowhere in sub-clause (2) (a) under clause  5

do  I  note  any qualification related to gravity  or

seriousness of risks involved. I must beg  to  differ

from  the Minister's statement that "In clause 5  (2)

(a)  the  conditions under which therapeutic abortion

can  be  done  are  unambiguously  stated."  In  some

sections of his speech introducing the Second Reading

of  this  Bill, the Minister demonstrated an uncommon

flair  for a vivid word-picture. Surely it would  not

be beyond his capacity to refer to the extent of risk

to life, and to the extent of injury anticipated that

would warrant abortion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be borne in mind that "the frequency of

therapeutic  terminations of pregnancy is  decreasing

rapidly with the advances of medical knowledge".  The

Encyclopa?dia  Britannica is the authority  for  this

statement,  which was made in as early  as  the  1963

edition, in the section on "Abortion".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time cardiac disease, tuberculosis, various

diseases  associated with pregnancy were all regarded

by  medical  opinion as indications for  abortion.  I

believe that scientific evidence indicates that  this

may  not  be  so  today  in all respects  of  cardiac

disease,    tuberculosis,   etc.   Certainly    these

conditions do require special care before  and  after

the  birth  and in some cases the social  environment

must be improved, but the conditions referred to  may

not    necessarily   and   generically   be   medical

indications for abortion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing, Sir, if I may labour on a particular

aspect  of  this clause, may I ask what is  meant  by

"risk  to  the mental health of the pregnant  woman"?

Indications   of   this  sort  are   notoriously   un

predictable. They are just as unpredictable  as  what

would  happen  if  a  mentally unstable  person  does

procure  an  abortion. Referring to a  conference  on

abortion  held  in Washington, the United  States  of

America, in September 1967, under the auspices of the

Kennedy  Foundation and the Harvard Divinity  School,

one of the conferees remarked on the vagueness of the

psychiatrists  present  about  the  indications  that

justify  abortion  on  grounds of  damage  to  mental

health. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am merely mentioning this

reference   to  underline  my  own  view  about   the

vagueness of the term "mental health" in the clause I

am discussing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (2) (b) of clause 5 also stipulates that

an  abortion  may be permitted, if it is the  opinion

formed  in  good  faith that the environment  of  the

pregnant woman, both at the time when the child would

be  born  and  thereafter, so far as is  foreseeable,

justifies  such an operation. What I  would  like  to

know  is  what  "so  far  as is  foreseeable"  means.

Presumably  we shall have to depend on the  foresight

of  the Authorisation Board. Where social work experience

is  concerned, in the technical  sense  of  the

term,  the majority of the Board members will be  lay

people:  there  will  be one  member  (who  shall  be

female)  who  has  had experience in  social  welfare

work, besides the Director of Social Welfare. And the

opinion   of   these   members,  with   social   work

experience,  could be over-ruled in one direction  or

another  by  the  medical members of  the  Board,  if

supported  by another lay member. What I am  pointing

out  is  that the weight of responsibility will  fall

upon  medical people, where the grounds to  determine

whether   an  abortion  may  be  performed  will   be

essentially non-medical grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am already sufficiently appalled by the vagueness

that hangs about like a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



woolly   cloud   over  this  so-called  environmental

clause.  But  I  must  express  my  misgivings  where

environmental considerations may be determined  by  a

caucus of persons who are not social workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Minister aware that when a similar so-called

"social  clause"  was brought up before  the  British

Parliament, the British Medical Association  and  the

Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the

Minister  for Health has on one occasion resorted  to

the views of the latter august body) had opposed this

provision on the grounds that physicians might be  un

qualified  or  unwilling to  pass  judgment  on  non-medical aspects of a case?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed those who believe that initial

distress and reasons may not be sufficient to warrant

an abortion, and that case work investigations should

be  carried  out  to determine the circumstances.  It

should be hoped that, when the occasion for the imple

mentation of this Bill does come, great care will  be

taken   to   ascertain   the   seriousness   of   the

circumstances  that  may  be  said  to   justify   an

abortion.  I  do not see in this Bill in its  current

form that there is any guarantee that a laissez-faire

attitude  will  not be adopted: in fact,  that  there

will  not  be  abortion on demand that  will  be  the

effect of this Bill, as it stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I pass on to sub-clause (2) (c) of clause 5?

Here,   at   least,   there  is   the   qualification

"substantial" to the word "risk", and "seriously"  to

the    word    "handicapped".   Would    that    such

qualifications  had been entered  in  sub-clause  (2)

(a) . However, if I may refer to this sub-clause (2)

(c) ,  I hope that abortion recommended on genetic  or

eugenic  grounds will not deteriorate  into  abortion

permitted  in a sort of generic manner. For  what  is

meant  by  substantial  risk of  physical  or  mental

abnormalities?   Would  30   per   cent   chance   of

abnormality  be adequate to warrant abortion?  Or  50

per  cent? Under such circumstances, would there  not

also be the risk of a healthy foetus being destroyed?

What is the extent of wastage that would result



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



from  the  destruction  of  foetuses  with  suspected

abnormalities? I recollect having read of an estimate

that the effect of a similar provision in the English

law  will  mean the destruction of three foetuses  by

abortion  for  every deformed child that  would  have

actualIy  been born. If this is so, then it would  be

more logical to wait for the foetuses to attain their

full  growth  and then commit infanticide  where  the

actually deformed birth is concerned. I do not  think

this  is  what  our  society will permit.  The  point

remains  that prognoses resulting in abortions  based

on  foetal  indications  have never  been  validated.

Abortions are fatal - the evidence is destroyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall refrain from commenting on sub-clause (2)

(d) at this stage, Sir. I would like to deal with

sub-clause  (3) of clause 5. Here it is stated  that  two

general  practitioners (registered,  of  course)  may

decide  on  termination  of  pregnancy  without   the

authorisation of the Board. Do I take it  that  these

two general practitioners would also be qualified  to

determine  the psychiatric condition of the  pregnant

woman  and to perform an abortion on the ground  that

this  will have less deleterious consequences on  the

mental  health  of the pregnant woman  than  ultimate

delivery of the child?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in sub-clause (5) we discover that only

one  medical practitioner (registered - but  he  need

not possess psychiatric qualifications) is sufficient

to decide, on mental health grounds, that an abortion

is   immediately  necessary.  Is  this  an   adequate

safeguard? Furthermore, in clause 10, sub-clause (3) ,

a  general  practitioner, who may have  conscientious

scruples against abortion (and whose religious convic

tions the Minister says should be respected), may  be

forced  into a position where he must determine  that

an abortion is immediately necessary to prevent grave

permanent  injury to the mental health of a  pregnant

woman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now may I touch on the clause related to incest and

rape? May I point out that this clause was originally

included in the English Abortion Bill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



but  was removed by the sponsors themselves for legal

reasons  that rape is notoriously easy to allege  and

difficult to prove. We have an apparent resort  to  a

legal  safeguard  here in our Bill. No  authorisation

for  treatment to terminate pregnancy on  grounds  of

rape  or  incest will be given unless  the  Attorney-General has certified that proceedings in respect  of

rape  or  incest have completed, or have  begun.  The

last three words are significant. Without final proof

abortion  can  be  granted on  grounds  of  rape  and

incest. I beg to seek the Minister's clarification. I

feel  that it is this sort of looseness in this piece

of  legislation to reform the abortion law that leads

me  to  fear exploitation of this Bill for the  avail

ability of abortion on demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to do is to distinguish the heat

from the light in the controversy over abortion. That

there  is  justification  for  liberalising  the  law

related to abortion in the view of those who are  not

affected  by conscientious religious scruples  (which

we  must also respect) I have no doubt. All I say  is

that  we must proceed cautiously. It would have  been

far  better  if a systematic investigation  had  been

carried  out  by the Ministry of Health  to  disclose

objectively  what would be for the good  of  the  com

munity.  But  certain difficulties are  obvious,  and

time is a major consideration. Thus for the next four

or  five  years  we are experimenting with  a  social

situation. And in such circumstances adequate control

must be exercised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health has made a most important statement on the abortion issue. But to underline the caution which I feel about the Bill, I would like to enter certain reservations about certain things that he has said. I agree with him that we want to provide a healthy social environment in which to bring up our

children.  Certainly  our society  cannot  afford  to

breed delinquents, criminals and antisocial elements.

But I must certainly question the generalisation,  as

he states it, that such types are mainly derived



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



from the ranks of unwanted children, the illegitimate

and  broken  homes. I am sure there  must  be  broken

homes  in which no abortion has ever taken place.  Is

the  Minister trying to say that abortion will reduce

delinquency? Can he substantiate with data  that  the

crime  rate  in  countries which permit  abortion  is

necessarily less than in those countries which do not

permit  it? He has referred to the annual  figure  of

one  million illegal abortions in the United  States.

There  are people who dispute this figure as  grossly

exaggerated.  But we will accept the authority  which

he  quoted. Does he conjecture that the crime rate in

America  would have shot up without these  abortions?

Has  he any indication of the crime rate among  those

who   have  procured  abortions?  He  has  said  that

promiscuity  and indeed I might add  other  forms  of

delinquency are matters that must depend on the moral

fibre and character of the individual and the type of

society that the individual comes from. I agree whole

heartedly with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, may I refer to this question of the life

of  the  foetus?  I would normally  be  reluctant  to

engage  myself in philosophical discussions  of  this

sort.  But  the  Minister himself has mentioned  this

aspect. May I refer to the opinion of Norman St. John-Stevas,  an  English M.P, who was  prominent  in  the

debate  on  Abortion in the English  Parliament?  St.

John-Stevas  writes in a journal called America,  9th

December, 1967. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is worth noting that the final form of the

(English Abortion) Bill left abortion as a crime  but

selected  certain  conditions  under  which  it   was

considered justifiable. This form is important, since

it  recognises, even in attenuated form, respect  for

the sanctity of life.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to note also that one

gynacologist wrote in the Times, 5th December,  1966,

"that the embryo becomes genetically complete at  the

time  of conception though only microscopic in  size.

It  is  uncommon,"  he continued,  "for  a  woman  to

present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



herself for abortion before about 12 weeks, by  which

time these tiny foetuses are not amorphous masses  of

protoplasm,  but are beautifully formed, move  around

freely  in  their  sac of fluid, respond  to  noxious

stimuli  and  evoke the same emotional response  from

theatre  staff, as does the delivery of  a  full-term

baby,  followed by quietness and a sense  of  tragedy

because  a  life has been destroyed." This  emotional

response was also described to me independently by  a

local surgeon, who is not a Catholic and who supports

generally the Government's stand on abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably this is the same sort of emotional

response   that  one  would  get  should  one   visit

Woodbridge to see for oneself the pitiful  plight  of

mongols and mental defectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would venture to say that there is profound sorrow to be felt in both cases over the harsh objective facts of life. Our Government wishes to reflect what our people want, and to do what is good for them. My view is that our people in general want a moderate measure of abortion law reform, and

not  abortion  too  freely available.  I  think  this

latter  caution results from a belief that grave  con

sideration  must  also be given to the  life  of  the

unborn child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any piece of legislation has an educational impact.

This  Bill must adequately reinforce in the minds  of

our  people that human life in all circumstances must

be  treated with compassion. It is this consideration

that has led me to seek the various clarifications  I

have  sought.  I  find  it encouraging  that  in  its

exercise  of the art of the possible, our Government,

in  respect of this Bill, is referring it  to  Select

Committee,  and that a period of four or five  years'

grace  will  be  given to study the effects  of  this

Bill,  inasmuch  also as this Bill  itself  has  had,

according  to  the previous Minister  for  Health,  a

gestation period of two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

according to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



explanatory statement to this  Bill,

treatment to terminate pregnancy may be carried  out,

subject  to certain safeguards, by registered medical

practitioners acting on the authority of a Board  (to

be called "The Termination of Pregnancy Authorisation

Board")  on medical, social, humanitarian and eugenic

grounds. However, I would like to remind the Minister

for  Health  of  a  recent statement  by  Dr  Hector

Maclennan,   President  of  the  Royal   College   of

Obstetricians and Gynecologists in Britain,  made  in

the Times of 21st January, 1966:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Leaving out of account the difficulties which may

be  associated  with  the  decision  to  terminate  a

pregnancy  there  still remain  problems  as  to  who

should  perform  the operation, who should  give  the

ansthetic and where it should be performed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the operation is to be limited to hospital

practice  by  recognised  specialists  it  should  be

stated  most  emphatically that therapeutic  abortion

even  in  skilled  hands is more dangerous  than  the

public   and   many  doctors  appreciate.   This   is

especially  so with a woman, pregnant for  the  first

time.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again I would like to refer the Minister for

Health  to  an  article entitled Legalised  abortion:

Report  by  the  Council  of  the  Royal  College  of

Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists  from   which   the

following quotation is taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In Scandinavia operative rates for legalised

abortion  initially  varied  from  0.9  to  3.5   per

thousand cases; more recent figures put the mortality

rate  for Denmark at 0.7 per thousand which is  still

nearly  three times as high as the present  mortality

rate  (including  abortions) for England  and  Wales.

Mortality  rates of 0.3 to 0.6 per thousand  reported

from  countries  in Eastern Europe are  difficult  to

reconcile with experience in Northern Europe  and  in

Britain.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I am quoting this is that the other

day  the  Minister mentioned several cases  of  women

with  unwanted pregnancies, but he did not state over

a  period  of  how  many years that  the  cases  were

recorded at Kandang Kerbau Hospital.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I continue with my quotation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'During 1962 when there was an estimated number of

2,800 therapeutic abortion operations carried out  in

National   Health  Service  Hospitals,  four   deaths

following  therapeutic abortion were registered  with

the  Registrar  General and three of these  were  the

subject of confidential enquiries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoting again from the same report with regard to

immediate morbidity resulting in abortion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Non-fatal serious complications occur in not less

than  3  per  cent  of  cases of  legalised  abortion

induced  by  experts  under  modern  conditions,  and

morbidity  rates as high as 15 per cent are reported.

Immediate complications include haemorrhage,  rupture

of the uterus, salpingitis, peritonitis, septicaemia,

renal failure, thrombosis and embolism.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the risks and ill

effects  of  legalised  abortion  apparent  in  these

quotations,  let  us not forget that  the  operation,

even when done in hospital, is not without risk.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to arguments in support of socio-economic

abortion, the success of the Japanese effort

is  often quoted as an example. Sir, I would like  to

quote  Professor  T. Kobayashi, of Tokyo  University,

who in reviewing the position of Japan says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our serious concern was to overcome a population

explosion  brought  about  by  a  loss  of  land  and

repatriation   of   the  Japanese  disarmed   forces,

accelerated by the usual postwar boom produced by new

marriages  and  reunited families. The situation  was

worsened  by a tremendous decrease of food production

and chaotic social conditions in our destroyed land.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Kobayashi said that out of 1,026 women who

had  undergone induced abortion, 68 per  cent  showed

some  kind  of  regret and fear  of  the  experience.

Evidently,  it  was a desperate measure  taken  by  a

people  whose culture and temperament had bred  other

desperate  practices such as hara-kiri  and  kamikaze

suicide  techniques.  But the  population  problem  m

Singapore  is  nowhere  like  the  post-war  Japanese

situation.  Our birth rate has been steadily  falling

since 1959 from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



39 to 28.6 per thousand in 1966. The rate of fall has

accelerated even further since the formation  of  the

Family  Planning and Population Board and  the  birth

rate for the first six months of 1967 shows a 13  per

cent  fall over the same period in 1966. There  would

appear  to be no cause for alarm and for the adoption

of desperate measures such as abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in advocating abortion for socio-economic

reasons,  the unborn child is regarded  as  a  social

inconvenience  and economic burden.  Projecting  this

reasoning a step further, legalised euthanasia or so-called

mercy killing would become equally acceptable.

Why  should  society be burdened with the  aged,  the

mentally  defective, the physically  handicapped  and

the  chronic  incurables? Then  how  about  legalised

suicide? An equally good case can be made out for it.

Think  of the many painful and cruel methods of self-destruction, not infrequently unsuccessful. Should we

not  legalise it, have proper institutions to  ensure

swift, certain and painless demise for those who feel

that  they are no longer of use to society? At least,

Sir,  we can obtain their consent, unlike in abortion

where the subject has no say in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the objection of a certain section of the

public  to the Bill on religious grounds, I am  aware

that  some Members of this House may take the worldly

stand  that  in  the  rugged  society  of  Singapore,

religious  principles  have no relevance  where  such

principles  are incompatible with the  political  and

economic  development of Singapore. To  such  persons

who  have made success their god, it is natural  that

religious  principles  may  be  dismissed  as   super

stitious beliefs. All the same, it is very much to be

regretted if our society is to be developed along the

lines  that  the amount of respect to be accorded  to

any  principles is to be determined in terms of money

that  the  principles can earn  for  us.  If  such  a

society was already a fact in Singapore, I would have

no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



hesitation  in saying, "Let us have abortion  by  all

means."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from my own personal observations of the

manifestations of the beginning of such a society  in

Singapore, there is apparently a great need  for  the

liberalisation of the law on abortion to minimise the

consequences  of  promoting a  barnyard  standard  of

morals.  With  the number of social  escort  agencies

sprouting  all over the island, it must  be  admitted

that  tourism is becoming more of a bedroom  pastime.

It,  therefore,  becomes necessary for  us  to  enact

legislation to get rid of our ill-conceived fruits of

pleasure-cum-industry. Facts are facts and  since  we

pride ourselves on our pragmatic approach to life, we

must  face  the fact that if Singapore is to  develop

along  the  lines of the shanty towns which  flourish

around  foreign  military bases in Thailand  and  the

Philippines,  any objection to the Bill would  merely

be  of  academic  value. But my  point  i5  that  our

society has not degenerated to such a level and  that

our  laws  must  not be fashioned to  facilitate  the

development   of  our  society  on   the   basis   of

promiscuity.  This  is  particularly  more  so  in  a

secular Republic in which we must be tolerant of  and

must  give consideration to religious people as  well

as  those  with  religious convictions,  particularly

those  who  subscribe to the Christian religion  that

the  sanctity of life is inviolable even in the  case

of  a  newly conceived foetus. Sir, here I would like

to  say  that I am a free thinker. I have no reigious

bias. To them the termination of the existence  of  a

foetus  is just as heinous an offence as the  killing

of a human being, except when it is necessary to save

the  life  of the mother. They have every  reason  to

object in so far as the Bill appears to have,  as  an

ulterior objective, the control of population growth.

The  Bill  conveys an impression that it is  designed

for  population control. I myself do not believe  it.

Nevertheless, it is the fault of the Bill.  Even  the

Minister's supporters say that this Bill is good  for

population control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is that so?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In view of such vehement and valid

objection, it seems to me that a law which embodies a

radical concept repugnant to a substantial number  of

citizens  and  which is sponsored  as  a  measure  of

expediency is likely to bring about a train of events

which  will secure the subsequent revocation of  such

law. Sir, in view of the religious objections to  the

Bill and as Singapore is a secular state, I feel that

their opinions should be taken into consideration. We

cannot just brush them off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may be aware that Russia after

the Communist Revolution enacted a law to provide for

and  to  facilitate abortion on the  ground  that  by

releasing women from labour in bed they will be freed

for  labour  in factories. It is not surprising  that

not  long  afterwards the Russian Government reversed

its  edict on the grounds that women are more  useful

to  the state in the production of human beings  than

in the proluction of factory goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the same cynical spirit the Nazi

Government  of Germany enacted stringent  legislation

against abortion on the ground that it is the  sacred

duty of a German woman to augment the Teutonic race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that when laws relating to the

preservation of human life are tampered with,  it  is

the  beginning of the end of the right to exist as  a

human being. It is with totalitarian regimes that  we

associate the control and regulation of the functions

of a woman's body for the ultimate glorification of a

metaphysical entity known as the "State".  Admittedly

the  abortion  envisaged  by  the  Bill  is  strictly

voluntary.   But  the  process  of  transition   from

"voluntary" to "compulsory" is invidious and  subtle.

And  therein  lies  the  valid  basis  for  fear   on

religious grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to quote Professor T.N.A.

Jeffcoate:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The destruction of the living embryo offends

something  fundamental in human nature and  the  most

scientifically detached gynaecologist cannot fail  to

approach  the operation with an uneasiness which  has

been  variously accredited to 'primordial  revulsion'

and 'subtle archaic motives'.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a discussion of the risks of carrying out

abortions,  reference must be made to the effects  on

the  doctor himself. Doctors feel that their  primary

professional  role is to preserve  life  and  not  to

destroy  it. This feeling of uneasiness will  not  be

decreased by the knowledge that some abortions that a

doctor  is  made to do may not be necessary  at  all.

Should  abortion laws be liberalised,  it  cannot  be

assumed  that doctors will kill off as many  foetuses

as  demanded with impunity. Carl Muller, Professor of

Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Berne,

recently commented:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In countries where abortion is entirely legal and a

doctor  may have to undertake an enormous  number  of

operations on healthy women during a single  day,  it

can  happen that he breaks down and needs psychiatric

help.  It  seems  that  for these  mass  abortions  a

special  robot-like  constitution  is  needed,  which

every doctor does not possess. Some authors from  the

Communist  states  have  ascribed  the  increase   in

complications  after abortion in part  to  'signs  of

exhaustion' in the operator.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries where abortion is permitted for medical

reasons  only,  the doctor has to  assess  each  case

carefully.  When the situation requires it,  he  will

perform  the  abortion.  Liberalising  the   law   on

abortion  can  only serve to blunt the desire  to  he

conscientious  by  removing the need  to  be  so.  In

serving  his  patients, a doctor's ethics  should  be

judged not only by what he will do for them but  also

by what he feels he cannot do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the objection to the Bill on psychological

and  moral  grounds,  I am given to  understand  that

doctors  are  called to safeguard  life  and  promote

health, not to kill or destroy. Their code of ethics,

crystallised  in  the Hippocratic  Oath,  makes  this

abundantly clear:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...I will ... abstain from whatever is deleterious and

mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to anyone

if  asked, nor suggest any such counsel; furthermore,

I  will  not give to a woman an instrument to produce

abortion ...'



<br><br>It  is  also expected that the demand on our  medical

facilities would continue to be pressing despite  the

effort of the Government to enlarge and increase such

facilities to keep pace with the demand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



It  appears  reasonable  to conclude  that  with  the

liberalisation of the law on abortion, the demand  on

our  inadequate and , overworked hospital and medical

facilities  and  staff would become more  unbearable.

Without  going  into  the pros and  cons  of  medical

objections  to  the  liberalisation  of  the  law  on

abortion,  I am sure that Members in the  House  will

agree  with  me  that if this Bill is intended  as  a

means  of population control, then I think it  should

be thrown into the Singapore River.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I have to stress over and over again the

precise purpose of this Bill is that if the objective

of  the  Bill  is  inchoate or incoherent,  the  Bill

itself  cannot be otherwise. Its purpose is bound  to

manifest itself in the particular provisions  of  the

Bill  in  the  way in which particular  remedies  are

proposed  for the prevention of mischief  which  this

Bill  is  intended  to  regulate  and  which  may  be

anticipated   to  arise  after  its  enactment.   For

instance,  let us refer now to clause 5 of  the  Bill

which  forms  the operative provisions .  Sub-clause

(2) of the proposed clause states the four grounds on

which  the Board may authorise treatment to terminate

pregnancy. The grounds in paragraphs (a) , (c) and (d)

are  quite acceptable in so far as the purpose of the

Bill is to rationalise the laws relating to abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three provisions I have just referred to are, in

a manner of speaking, amplified and extended versions

of   the  existing  provisions  in  our  Penal   Code

specifying  the circumstances to which  abortion  may

not be considered to be a crime. But in paragraph (h)

of  sub-clause (2) of clause 5 a controversial ground

is  introduced. The provisions are to the effect that

if  the Board is of the opinion formed in good  faith

that the environment of the pregnant wonlan justifies

the   termination  of  a  pregnancy,  the  Board  may

authorise  an abortion to be performed. My  objection

is  that  in the term "environment", which is defined

in the said paragraph to include family and financial

circumstances  of  the pregnant woman,  there  is  no

any  danger that may result to the physical or mental

health  of a pregnant woman if abortion is performed.

If   it  is  the  intention  of  the  Government   to

liberalise  the  law  on abortion  for  the  sake  of

abortion, then it is irrelevant to introduce any such

restrictions as contained in sub-clause (2) .  But  if

it  is the intention of the Government to rationalise

the laws relating to abortion, then it is unjustified

in introducing an unduly wide ground for abortion. As

I see it, any law which has the specific objective of

rationalising the situation relating to  abortion  in

Singapore,  should  spell  out  regulations  for  the

control  of  the  manner and mode of  performance  of

abortion to safeguard the life and health of  persons

who  have  to undergo abortion. By seeking  to  place

restrictions  on the circumstances in which  abortion

may be performed, the law would be lending itself  to

the  creation of circumstances which would enable the

illegal  abortionists to carry on with  their  trade,

which is a mischief this Bill is supposed to prevent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confusion that seems to charactense the drafting

of  this Bill is further shown when the provisions of

sub-clause  (2)  of  clause 5 are compared  with  the

provisions  of sub-clauses (3) and (5) thereof.  Sub-clause  (3)  is  to  the  effect  that  a  registered

practitioner, after consultation with  another  in  a

Government  hospital  or in an approved  institution,

may  perform  an abortion on the ground mentioned  in

paragraph  (a) of sub-clause (2) of clause 5  without

the  prior authorisation of the Board. Sub-clause (5)

is   to   the  effect  that  any  registered  medical

practitioner  may  perform an  abortion  without  the

prior  authorisation of the Board if  he  is  of  the

opinion formed in good faith that the abortion is  im

mediately  necessary to save the life or  to  prevent

grave  permanent  injury to the  physical  or  mental

health  of the pregnant woman. As I see it, there  is

nothing  to  prevent  a woman who  is  determined  to

terminate  her pregnancy from putting up a convincing

show  before  the registered medical practitioner  to

enable him to form the opinion in good faith that  it

is  immediately necessary to perform an  abortion  to

prevent grave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



permanent injury to the physical or mental health  of

the pregnant woman.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may recall a certain incident,

which  was widely reported in the local press  a  few

years back, about an English woman who worked herself

into  a  hysterical  fit  in  order  to  justify  the

abortion  of  her  unborn baby who  might  have  been

deformed as a result of a certain drug taken by her.

Moreover, the Bill does not contain any provision  to

prevent  a  woman  from repeatedly  having  abortions

performed on her. I should think it is reasonable  to

require   that,  where  the  woman  is   married   or

cohabiting  with a man, she attends a course  at  the

family  planning  clinic after she has  undergone  an

abortion. In my view, sub-clause (5)

of  clause  5 of this Bill is tantamount  to  making

abortion   permissible  in  all  circumstances.   The

provisions  of sub-clause (5) seem to place  a  great

deal of faith on the integrity of the members of  the

medical profession in Singapore. With all due respect

to  them and also to Members of this House who  are

members  of this honourable profession, my impression

is  that  most  of the practitioners in  the  illegal

abortion  trade at present flourishing  in  Singapore

are  members of the medical profession. Even when  it

is  a criminal offence to perform abortions except in

the very restricted circumstances permitted under  the  Penal

Code,  the  consequences of a conviction for  illegal

abortion are not sufficient to deter doctors as  well

as quacks from performing abortions. With the present

Bill there is much less deterrence to such doctors to

perform   abortions  which  are  not   envisaged   or

permissible  under the provisions  of  this  Bill.  I

cannot  see any provision contained in this  Bill  in

respect  of the penalties that may be suffered  by  a

doctor who performs an operation not on the basis  of

an  opinion  formed in good faith to the satisfaction

of the Board or in circumstances which are beyond the

scope of the Bill. I wonder whether mere infringement

of  the  provisions  of  this Bill  would  constitute

substantial grounds to cause a registered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



medical  practitioner  to  be  deregistered  by   his

medical association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in paragraph (a) of sub-clause (2) of clause 8,

it  is stated that only the consent in writing of the

applicant  over  eighteen years of age  is  required.

That  means  a  married woman, who is  over  eighteen

years  old  and  who is not insane or  feeble-minded,

does  not  have to consult her husband regarding  the

abortion of their unborn child. Where the husband has

strong  religious  objection to  abortion  and  where

abortion  has been permitted under paragraph  (h)  of

sub-clause  (2) of clause (8) , a domestic dispute  is

bound  to arise between the husband and the  wife  in

such circumstances. Is it the intention of the Govern

ment to 1e1 in such domestic dispute as a ground  for

divorce? I should think it is not only reasonable but

also  logical  to  provide for  the  consent  of  the

husband  when  abortion is to be  approved.  Even  in

family planning, consent is required of both parties.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I wish to comment on sub-clause (1)

of  clause 10 where it is provided that a person  may

refuse  to  participate in any operation to terminate

pregnancy  on the ground of conscientious  objection.

This  provision is weakened by placing  the  onus  of

proof  in  any  legal proceedings on the  person  who

raised  the objection. Further in sub-clause  (3)  of

clause  10,  the  whole  purpose  of  providing   for

conscientious  objection is  nullified  by  requiring

that  such  a person may nonetheless be compelled  to

participate  in any abortion when it is necessary  to

save  the  life or prevent grave permanent injury  to

the  physical or mental health of the pregnant woman,

and  no  provision is made to determine the  criteria

for  assessing whether such an opinion  is  valid  or

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last provision to which I have just referred

serves to substantiate my contention that the Bill is

not designed to rationalise the laws relating to abor

tion  but  rather to give effect to the  Government's

policy of promoting birth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



control,  if it is the intention to have  a  Bill  to

liberalise  the laws relating to abortion,  it  would

have  been  better for the Bill not to  restrict  the

grounds  on  which abortion may be performed  but  to

control  and  regulate the persons  by  whom  or  the

manner by which abortion is to be performed. With the

impression  that the Bill has an ulterior  motive  of

promoting birth control, it is legitimate for persons

with religious principles to fear that this Bill is a

forerunner of other Bills which seek to legalise  the

murder of persons who cease to be capable of making a

useful  contribution to the life and econonly of  the

society in which we live.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We all get pensions!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> It is a reasonable fear which the

Government   has  not  effectively  dealt   with   by

sponsoring  a  Bill which supposedly liberalises  the

law  relating to abortion and, at the same time, does

not  effectively deal with the mischief which  it  is

supposed to remedy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking a stand against the Abortion Bill, I am

convinced that any little gain from liberalising  the

law  on  abortion  will be more than  offset  by  the

losses. I am in complete agreement with Professor Tow

Siang  Hwa who suggested at a forum in the University

of   Singapore   recently  that  the  population   in

Singapore  can confidently be solved and  any  future

anticipated explosion can be averted by the following

steps:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a redoubling of the present family planning

effort with greater attention to personal contact and

follow-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, post partum tubal ligation after the third

delivery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, an educational programme ainied at all

levels  of society, stressing the benefits of  family

planning and the truth about abortion. Not just  tell

the public the bad aspects of abortion by the illegal

abortionists  and  keep  quiet  about  the  risk   of

abortions done in the hospitals. That is not fair.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to meet the socio-economic pressures

contributing towards abortion, Family Welfare Bureaux

should  be established to dissuade women from seeking

abortion and to arrange for financial assistance  and

the adoption of "unwanted" babies. Legislation should

be  introduced to ensure greater security of pregnant

women  in  terms  of  maternity leave  with  pay  and

maternal  benefit,  conditional  on  the  multiparous

recipient being sterilised after confinement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion is a complex and deep-rooted social and

economic  problem, its  solution  requires   social,

economic, medical and educational measures. It cannot

be solved by doctors wielding curettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with my suggestions here, I have also

a  few questions to ask. Of course, the Minister  may

say  this is not Question Time and that I cannot ask

supplementary questions. My first question  is  this.

Is  this Bill needed in Singapore? According to  both

the  present  Minister  for  Health  and  the  former

Minister  for Health who spoke with such vigour,  how

many  investigations had been carried out before this

Bill  was  introduced? Can the Minister tell  us  how

many supporters there are in Singapore who are behind

this Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Have a referendum!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> That is what I am going to say, if

the Government is so confident about it, why not hold

a referendum, especially when there is no Opposition?

Lifting the Whip is only an eyewash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, why do the Government not allow the

Parliamentary Secretaries a free vote as well?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question is, who are going to be

appointed  to  the Select Committee on  the  Abortion

Bill?  If  the Minister's cronies are appointed,  the

opponents of the Bill are done for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth question is this. Does the Abortion Bill

also  apply  to foreigners who come here?  They  will

know  about  it  and come here. The  Minister  should

clarify this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last question is about the ceiling of the fee.

What  is it? Is it $5? If it is $5, and there  is  no

stipulation  in  the Bill to prevent foreigners  from

taking advantage of this Bill, then our medical staff

are  going  to  be worked to death.  I  think  it  is

reasonable   for   the  Minister  to   provide   some

safeguards against this in the Bill. Another question

is,  how  can  the  Minister  check  against  illegal

abortions,  since the Bill is drafted in such  a  way

that  abortion  is given not as of  right  or  as  of

demand?  How  will  the  back-street  abortionist  be

checked?



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as has been

expected,  clearly divergent views on the  Bill  have

been  expressed by hon. Members in the course of  the

debate.  As has also been expected, the opponents  of

the  Bill  have  taken up and repeated  the  familiar

arguments  usually  expressed  by  those  who  oppose

legalised abortion. Of course, they have put  forward

their  arguments in a different style and form  often

by  the  rearrangement of the language.  Furthermore,

some  have  even attempted to conceal the  fact  that

their arguments spring primarily from their religious

and  ethical  dogmas which are based  on  one  single

debatable   hypothesis  -  that   abortion   is   the

destruction of the foetus which is human life or  the

beginning of human life and is, therefore, bad.  That

is  a debatable hypothesis. Some, like the Member for

Paya  Lebar,  even went further and alleged  that  by

introducing  the  Abortion  Bill  we  are  trying  to

legislate to kill children. How interesting it is  to

note that one has just to stretch such an argument  a

little,  to end up in an apparent absurdity,  as  has

happened  with the allegation of the Member for  Paya

Lebar which I have just mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some also attempt to put up a facade of

rationality  and  of  being  scientific  by   quoting

excerpts from some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



learned  medical journals in the hope  of  concealing

the  fact  that  their arguments  spring  from  their

fundamental religious conviction, as in the  case  of

the Member for Punggol as well as some others. By the

rigmarole   of  old  familiar  arguments   that   the

protection  of  the  individual must  extend  to  the

unborn  child,  that the destruction  of  the  foetus

affects  the  humane feeling for life, and  that  the

liberalisation  of  the  law  on  abortion  in  other

countries  has  not  reduced the  number  of  illegal

abortions, the Member for Punggol seeks to  give  the

impression  that  he is taking a purely  humanitarian

stand and not a religious one. Unfortunately, he lets

the cat out of the bag by his statement, and I quote,

"On  what grounds does the Government seek to reverse

a  long-held tradition of our society about the right

to  life  of  the unborn child? Is it on the  grounds

that this foetus is not human, and therefore does not

enjoy the right to life which is embodied in our law?

If  this  is the view of those who wish to liberalise

our abortion laws, then it is up to them to prove it,

for  the  weight  of  evidence lies  heavily  against

them."  So  says  the Member for Punggol.  He  should

know, however, that the issue he has raised is within

the  realms  of  religious hypothesis and  dogmas  on

which    mankind   has   disagreed   for   centuries.

Unfortunately  for the people who have  raised  these

arguments  to  cover what, in effect,  are  arguments

which  spring  from religious and ethical  dogmas,  I

have  already forestalled these arguments. I think  I

have  adequately disposed of them under the  category

of  opposition views based on religion in my  opening

address. I remember that I ended my speech under  the

head  of religious objections by stating that  it  is

futile to allow ourselves to be involved in religious

arguments for or against abortion which, in any case,

will  never  result in any satisfactory  conclusions,

even  if the debate goes on till the cows come  home.

However  cleverly  these opponents build  their  case

around  their religious dogmas with a view to justifying  them, often quoting from learned authorities  ad

lib in order to give the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



trappings  of being scientific, the significant  fact

to notice is the lack of facts and figures to back up

these theoretical arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of my having anticipated the arguments

opposing  the  Bill and classifying them  into  three

distinct  categories  - first, religious  arguments;

second, ethical, moral and social reasons; and third,

medical  reasons - and I have systematically disposed

of  them - the arguments brought up by Members of the

House  who  oppose  the Bill have unfortunately  been

repetitions of the same old familiar arguments.  What

I,  therefore, propose to do now is to touch on  some

of  them  and Members may like to refer to my  speech

which  I  made  on moving the Second Reading  of  the

Bill, in rebuttal of the rest of their arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to touch upon is that

made by the opponents concerning the arguments on the

destruction  of  life. The Member  for  Punggol,  the

Member  for  Paya Lebar, the Member for  Jurong,  the

Member for Moulmein and, I think, the Member for Bras

Basah  say that the unborn foetus is human  life  and

that abortion amounts to the killing of life. In  the

course  of  their  debate,  this  concept  has   been

extended  as reflecting a lack of respect  for  human

life,  built  on  the hypothesis that  such  lack  of

respect  will  lead to social and moral decline  with

consequent  deterioration in the moral  character  of

the  people. So they say. The premises on which  such

arguments  have  developed are medieval  and  we  can

argue  till  the cows come home without reaching  any

agreement on this point. Tn law, the unborn foetus is

not  life as it is understood, for no abortionist  in

any  community has been charged with murder  for  the

destruction  of  the foetus. The  extensions  of  the

arguments  are  extremely picturesque  and  wild.  To

permit  the  destruction of  the  foetus,  they  say,

affects  the  humaneness of life; it may  affect  the

whole  of society, and it may eventually lead to  the

slippery path downhill. It has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



extended   to   say  that  this  may  lead   to   the

justification  of taking other forms of  human  life,

such  as  the  sick,  the old  and  the  economically

useless.  Such an argument is not only dangerous  but

also  mischievous.  No  community  anywhere  in   the

present   world,   irrespective  of   its   political

character, has ever thought of permitting the killing

of  human  beings, as it is generally understood,  be

they   sick,   old,  infirm,  paralysed  or   totally

decrepit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the social reasons. Are we, as suggested by the Member for Punggol, really making a law so that members of the medical profession can take over the work done by criminals in order to do it better? Of course not. It is because our law has prevented members of the

medical  profession  from freely  doing  this,  where

there is a crying need, that criminals have been able

to  take over and provide a much needed service. They

do  it  in  a  haphazard, dangerous and irresponsible

manner  and  yet,  as the Member  for  Alexandra  has

stated,  they earn the gratitude of women  who  carry

their  confidence and gratitude even  to  the  grave.

Should we not give our medical profession the freedom

they  should have had many years ago? A Bill of  this

nature,   complex  in  character  with   considerable

safeguards  for the women, the medical  practitioners

and  the  community, offers the sanction  of  society

under specific conditions. It is not a licence for  a

permissive  society.  I have  already  stated  in  my

opening speech that if the object is merely to remove

the present restraints on abortion in the Penal Code,

this  Bill in its present form will not be necessary.

And yet the opponents have not taken note of that.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the Member for Punggol has claimed,

and I believe that the Member for Bras Basah has also

claimed  that  Singapore, with  the  passing  of  the

Abortion Bill, would become an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



abortion centre, perhaps they have not read the  Bill

carefully and I ask them to read it again;  in  fact,

we have gone so far as to write complex provisions to

prevent this. For example, it is provided in clause 5

(8)  of  the Bill that no woman can have an  abortion

unless  she has been a resident in Singapore  for  at

least  four months. Any visitor who has to reside  in

Singapore  for four months will find it too  late  to

have an abortion. Perhaps the Member for Punggol does

not  understand this. This is the sort  of  provision

that  we  have  put into the Bill,  because  we  have

learnt  from the experience of Japan and  the  United

Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if you look up the immigration regulations,

you will see that no foreigner is allowed to stay  in

Singapore for more than two weeks. If the Member  for

Punggol  likes,  he  can,  in  a  question, ask  the

Minister for Defence

to clarify that. He will give him the same answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the arguments



put  forward by the Member for Moulmein. He got a bit

awry  when  he  referred to legalising the  right  to

suicide and! to provide facilities to see blue films,

etc., as something equal to the passing of this Bill.

This  is,  quite clearly, a facetious approach  to  a

serious  problem.  His argument got  rather  confused

when  he  referred to the success of  the  Government

family  planning programme, the result  of  which  he

said   was  encouraging.  And  then,  curiously,   he

proceeded  to  say  next  that  under-population  can

hamper  economic growth and development.  Presumably,

he was not referring to Singapore when he said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Point of

clarification,  Sir,I  was not  talking  of  under-population in Singapore. I was only making a  general

statement   about  economic  development.  Population

control is very essential. Under-population can be  a

problem.  Over-population can be  a  problem.  I  was

making a general statement which can be applicable in

all situations. I went on to explain that Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



would  never  face  that  problem.  So  I  think  the

Minister has got me wrong there.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in that case the Member's

general  statement is neither here nor there.  May  I

proceed  by  saying that it is also because  abortion

has  a  special  place  in  community  concepts  that

special provisions have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger to unmarried girls and widows has been

referred to by the Member for Geylang Serai  who  has

stated  that  the  Abortion Bill  will  aggravate  an

unhealthy  situation which has been  created  by  the

extensive  family planning programme now  under  way.

This is a debatable point because family planning  is

made  available to married women and, if I may repeat

again,  I  have  dealt with the point about  abortion

leading  to  promiscuity  rather  adequately  in   my

opening speech. Perhaps the Member for Geylang  Serai

might like to refer to my speech again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again turning to the Member for Moulmein, he also

accused  me of losing the thread of my argument  when

in  arguing  that  since  the  laws  on  abortion  in

Singapore are outdated and irrational, he asked why I

was  sponsoring a Bill which seeks to perpetuate  the

concept that "abortion is intrinsically wrong".  That

abortion  has  been "made the subject  of  a  special

piece of legislation with innumerable safeguards,  is

a  strong indication that the proponents of the  Bill

are  not  clear in their conscience" about  abortion.

That  is  what  the Member for Moulmein has  alleged.

First and foremost, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that

the Bill does not seek to perpetuate the concept that

abortion  is intrinsically wrong. Surely the  concept

that  abortion is intrinsically wrong or right  is  a

pronouncement of an ethical and religious nature, and

I  have  time  and again said that to be involved  in

ethical  and  religious arguments for or against  the

Bill  is  entirely futile. Further, it is astonishing

for  the  Member  for  Moulmein to  allege  that  the

conscience of the proponents of the Bill is not clear

or is dubious. Apart from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



the  fact  that  it is a non sequitur  and  therefore

illogical, on the contrary, I am sure that unlike the

opponents  of  the  Bill who are torn  between  their

dogmas  and  the  humanitarian  appeal  to  alleviate

suffering, the proponents have a clear conscience.  I

for  one have no doubts about it. However, the Member

for Moulmein's aforesaid trend of argument, which was

clearly involved and apparently confused, does  serve

to  illustrate the typical way in which the opponents

go about attacking the Bill by basing their arguments

on   false  presumptions.  Another  good  example  of

presuming falsely is that, time and again, they  have

insisted even in the face of facts that the Bill will

allow abortions on demand. However, let me state once

again  that an elaborate Bill such as the one  before

us  has been made to contain all the safeguards which

are necessary in order to ensure the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) That abortions are to be made available under

certain  specified conditions as have  been  provided

and  drafted with care in the Bill and that abortions

are  not  allowed on demand. We are not in favour  of

abortions on demand because, as I have stated  in  my

opening  speech,  this may lead to recurrent  demands

for  abortion  and we know, as a medical  fact,  that

repeated  abortions  result  in  a  higher  rate   of

mortality and morbidity. In fact, I have revealed  in

my  opening  speech the decision of Government  which

was  taken  even  before the Bill  was  presented  to

Parliament,   that  in  order  to  prevent   repeated

abortions, where a woman who presents herself for  an

abortion  has  three children or more,  the  abortion

will  be  permitted on condition that she  agrees  to

sterilization subsequently. Where is the abortion on

demand? It is a fantasy that was flourished again and

again by the opponents of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) From the medical point of view, we have to

provide  for the most aseptic conditions under  which

abortions can be done so that the risk is absolutely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



minimal.  There must, therefore, be adequate  control

of    operations.    Otherwise,    the    back-street

abortionists  will  certainly not  only  continue  in

business but will be having a booming one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) We must provide safeguards for doctors who

have conscientious objections, and make it an offence

for anyone to compel others to have an abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these conditions are to safeguard the

interest o1 persons who are in the minority like  the

Member  for  Moulmein  whose  ethical  and  religious

beliefs make them oppose abortions. I do not think it

is necessary for me to go on to elaborate further why

such a Bill ir necessary. The conditions to safeguard

the interests of such persons are so apparent, and  I

have  already  stated them in detail  in  my  opening

speech,  that only an ostrich will not  be  aware  of

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Member for Moulmein in his speech has

complained  that I have not spared the House  of  the

sordid details of the traumatic experiences of  women

undergoing  abortion at the hands of the  back-street

and illegal abortionists or by do-it-yourself methods

in  the case studies which I recounted in this  House

to  illustrate  the desperation of our  women  caught

with  an unwanted pregnancy and the terrible cost  in

pain,  suffering and health. I am sorry, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if  they did make some Members uneasy or  cause

them  to  wince a little in their seats, particularly

those who are torn between their religious dogmas  on

the  one  hand  and,  on the other,  the  irrefutable

evidence of human agony and suffering facing them.  I

am afraid I had to do so. However, being realistic, I

also  know that it would not be possible to  dislodge

the hard-held opposing views of some Members based on

ethical  and  religious dogmas with which  they  have

been inculcated for years. To have attempted to do so

would have been just as difficult as it is to make  a

duck's back wet. But it would have served its purpose

if  they  had stirred the conscience of the opponents

to the Bill who have come out with a strong belief in

their righteousness, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



face up to the realities of human agony and pain  and

make  them ponder over it even if it does not end  up

in correcting their dogmatism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein also picked out one of the

examples  I  quoted of a 33-year old  Roman  Catholic

Chinese housewife. He very strongly remarked that  if

only  she  had  obeyed her religious  teachings,  she

would  have  been spared the agony.  This  is  indeed

interesting  and proves the point that I have  stated

in my opening speech, that it is all very easy to put

on  a straight collar and start moralising on someone

else's anguish and predicament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Katong. He has been

quite  assiduous  in his study of the  Bill  and  has

talked  quite  a  lot  about legal  expressions  like

"mental health", "foreseeable" and so

on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> The expression "mental health" is

not legal terminology.



<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It has a legal interpretation

and this is the point I want to make. These are terms

used by our legal draftsmen who drafted this Bill and

when they use these terms they have decided cases  to

guide them. I do not think hon. Members will allow me

to  go  on  to  quote legal precedents  in  order  to

explain what these terms mean, but if the Member  for

Katong  puts up sonic questions on these legal terms,

perhaps I may be able to satisfy him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the Member for Joo Chiat? He

expressed  some  disappointment  that  we  have   not

introduced  a  Bill  whereby abortion  will  be  made

available on demand. But as a surgeon he will realise

the point which I have made just now, and also in  my

opening address, that to allow repeated abortion  is,

from  the  medical point of view, not  a  good  thing

because  it  does increase the rate of mortality  and

morbidity.  This is one of the reasons  why  we  have

decided not to make abortions available on demand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah made a long speech and

concluded  by  saying that since we are  liberalising

the  law  on  abortion, why do we not  also  legalise

suicide, after mentioning hara-kiri and kamikaze? May

I  tell the Member that suicide, in fact, is no legal

offence because of the simple reason that no one  can

be prosecuted for suicide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b>

Successful suicide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Under the law, attempted suicide

is  an  offence hut suicide is not. So  if  a  person

commits  hara-kiri  successfully,  he  will  not   be

prosecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the point about family planning

in  conjunction  with the Abortion  Bill.  All  those

Members who support the Bill and those who oppose  it

have  congratulated the Government on its success  in

family  planning, and this is accepted. However,  Mr

Speaker.  Sir, the possible effects of this Bill  are

interpreted differently by those who support the Bill

and  those who oppose it. Those who oppose it express

enthusiasm  for  the  Government's  family   planning

programme and welcome its extension. I would like  to

state  that the effects of the Abortion Bill  on  the

Government's family planning programme have been very

carefully  considered by my Ministry and  the  Family

Planning and Population Board, it is because of  this

that   one  of  the  fundamental  features   in   the

administration of the Abortion Bill will be its close

tie-up  with the national family planning  programme.

We already have an excellent post-partum programme in

our maternity and gynaecological wards at the Kandang

Kerbau Hospital and Thomson Road General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family planning staff from the Board interview

every  woman  who has delivered a child and  who  has

been  admitted  for  an  abortion.  These  women  are

encouraged  to take up family planning. In  fact,  in

1968, 50 per cent of such women actually did so.  The

family planning staff will, when this Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



is  implemented, interview every woman who  has  been

granted an abortion in the hospital, as they do  now,

and encourage her to take up family planning. That is

why   the  amendment  to  the  Family  Planning   and

Population  Board Act becomes necessary. If  a  woman

has  not  subsequently adopted family  planning,  the

Termination  of  Pregnancy Authorisation  Board  is

likely   to  take  an  extremely  dim  view  of   any

subsequent application by the woman for an  abortion.

The  recommendation  for  abortion  from  the  Family

Planning  and Population Board, supported by evidence

of  the practice of family planning in their records,

will  make it very easy for women to get an  abortion

in  the case of contraceptive failure. This would  be

made  quite clear when a woman comes in for her first

termination of pregnancy. In addition, a  woman  with

three  or more live children who is then to be  given

an   abortion  will  he  asked  to  accept  voluntary

sterilization as a condition of the authorisation  of

abortion.  These two complementary steps will  ensure

that  the  family planning programme will not  suffer

and that women will not come repeatedly for abortion.

It  will,  in fact, stimulate the practice of  family

planning,  contrary  to what  the  prophets  of  doom

amongst  the opposition to the Bill say.  Because  of

this  close  and intimate tie-up, the situation  that

occurred  in Japan, where the Eugenic Protection  Law

was  implemented independently of the family planning

programme  with  consequent  detrimental  effects  on

family planning

practice, is not expected to occur in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the rate of population growth in

Singapore is falling. This has also been repeated  by

many  speakers both for and against the Bill. I would

Iike  to  remind  Members again that  even  with  our

present  rate of population growth of 1.8  per  cent,

our  population  will double in  39  years.  Our  aim

eventually, and as soon as it is practicable,  is  to

reach the one per cent rate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



of  growth. By 1970, at the end of the present  five-year family planning programme, we will reach 1.5 per

cent, It is going to be much harder to reach one  per

cent  growth rate because the rate of fall from three

per  cent  to  two per cent is always  much  quicker,

whereas the rate of fail from two per cent to one per

cent  requires  a  tremendous  effort.  So  far,   no

developing  country has achieved this  and  we  shall

only  achieve it with a broad measure of support  for

all  measures  of population control and  our  family

planning programme needs all the support it  can  get

to achieve its goal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent social measures have been introduced and

through  the  Employment Act, much to the unhappiness

of  the Member for Bras Basah, maternity leave  after

the  third pregnancy is denied. This measure and  the

raising   of   hospitalisation  charges   for   later

pregnancies are part of the broad Government  support

together  with the Voluntary Sterilization  Bill,  of

family  planning in Singapore. This Bill is a further

measure in our effort to control the growth of population  and this work is by no means done yet, although

we  have  achieved considerable success to date.  Far

from  tarnishing the good name of the  Republic,  the

passage  of  the Abortion Bill, which is a  piece  of

modern  social legislation conceived for the  welfare

of  women  and  their families as  well  as  for  the

benefit  of Singapore, will redound to the credit  of

the  Government, whatever some hon. Members may  like

to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications has pointed out how much this Bill means as a further and final step in the emancipation of women in Singapore - women who are already enjoying equaL rights, equal pay and a host of privileges provided for in the Women's Charter. The emancipation of women is the logical consequence

of  our efforts tobuild a just and equal society with

equal  and adequate opportunities for the living  and

those who are to he born.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just summarise the

central  purpose  of the Bill' it is  to  reform  and

liberalise the law of abortion in Singapore which  is

al   present   not  only  uncertain  and   completely

unenlightened  and restrictive, but also  ineffective

in  that  the  majority of our women, faced  with  an

unwanted pregnancy, resort to be relieved by going to

the back-street or illegal abortionists, usually with

tragic results. It offers an alternative to our women

who  qualify under the specific conditions as set out

in   the   Bill   to  have  an  abortion   which   is

comparatively  safe and under aseptic conditions,  it

thereby liberates our women from the fear of unwanted

pregnancies, it also benefits the family by ensuring,

as  far  as possible, that every person born in  that

family  is a wanted child and also avoids the tragedy

of  having  children  born with  physical  or  mental

abnormalities.  It therefore serves  to  protect  the

health  and  welfare of the mother  as  well  as  her

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Bill will also enhance the welfare of

our  community by ensuring that every child  born  in

Singapore  is  a  wanted child. It also  ensures  the

quality  of  our  children  and  that  they  will  be

properly   cared  for  and  have  opportunities   for

education and the full development of their faculties

so that they can grow up and lead meaningful lives in

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress again, Mr Speaker. Sir, that this

Bill  does respect the religious and ethical  beliefs

of  our people. No one is forced to have an abortion.

Therefore,  to  those  whose  ethical  and  religious

beliefs have made them oppose abortion, I would  like

to  ask them again this question: Is it right in  our

multi-racial  and  multi-religious  society  for  any

person  or  group of persons, on grounds of religious

dogmas,  to deny others, whose religious and  ethical

beliefs  do not forbid them to have an abortion, the

opportunity  to take advantage of the  provisions  of

this  proposed  law? If their ethical  and  religious

beliefs  forbid them to support abortion,  the  least

they  can do, in the name of humanity, is to  abstain

from voting against the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, introduced concurrently with the Abortion

Bill,  forms,  together  with  the  Singapore  Family

Planning and Population Board Act of 1965, a trio  of

social  legislation  of major importance.  The  three

laws  are  a charter to liberate women from  unwanted

pregnancies  and are as far-reaching in their  social

import  as  the Employment Act, the Central Provident

Fund  (Amendment)  Act  and the industrial  Relations

(Amendment) Act are to the working community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Voluntary Sterilization Bill provides for a

means of preventing the unwanted or harmful pregnancy

by  the  sterilization of either the female  or  male

partner  of  a  union.  Female  sterilization  is  at

present  practised quite frequently, in this country,

the need for it, and possibly for male sterilization,

is  likely to increase progressively. There  are  far

fewer  ethical  objections to these  operations  than

those to the termination of pregnancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our present law in regard to sterilization is

obscure  and  much  open to criticism.  There  is  no

specific reference in the Penal Code to sterilization

except reference to emasculation, which is an offence

defined as a grevious hurt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, sterilization is probably not unlawful

provided  there  is full and valid  consent  for  the

operation  and  that it was done for the  benefit  or

well-being  of the person. But this is  by  no  means

certain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless sterilization is performed for the purpose of

treatment, it might however be considered an  assault

on  the  person  if performed for any other  reasons,

such  as  for family limitation, social and  economic

pressures, high parity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



eugenic  considerations. In such circunistances,  the

operation is not made lawful even if consent is given

in such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposition, however, has no direct judicial

authority  to support it, because it has  never  been

tested in a court of law, Therefore, the state of the

law  on the subject is such that no one can say  with

certainty what the law is. Meanwhile, doctors have to

take  responsibility for the sterilization operations

which  they have to perform to protect the health  of

women  and  to protect mothers from giving  birth  to

potentially abnormal babies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill, therefore, is to correct the

ambiguity  in  the  laws regarding sterilization.  It

will  make it lawful for sterilization operations  to

he  performed for purely medical conditions as a form

of   treatment  if  the  registered  practitioner  in

consultation with another practitioner agrees that it

is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any other case, the operation can be performed on

any  person  so long as the person is  (a)  above  21

years  of age; (b) has the valid consent not only  of

himself  but of his wife, if he is married;  and  (c)

has  three or more living children. If the person  is

under age, the operation can be performed only if the

parents  or  guardians of the person signify  consent

for  such  treatment; or if the person  is  afflicted

with   any  hereditary  form  of  illness   that   is

recurrent, mental deficiency or epilepsy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilization has such a vital part to play in the

prevention of pregnancy from the stand-point  of  the

health  of  the  individual or the happiness  of  the

family and for population control, that the need  for

new  legislation  to  cover  its  performance  is  as

urgently required as that for the Abortion Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that the Abortion Bill should be

complemented with the simultaneous passage of  a  law

on sterilization.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made in describing the Abortion Bill

that  it  was the experience in some countries  which

had  liberalized  their  laws  on  abortions  that  a

significant  number  of women  were  having  repeated

abortions. For such women, it would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



preferable  to undergo sterilization than be  allowed

to go through repeated ordeals of abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be infinitely simpler if niarried couples

submit to sterilization after they have the number of

children  they  have planned for.  For  a  relatively

simple operation they are rid once and for all of the

worry  of  a possible unplanned pregnancy. For  them,

they are once and for all rid of the inconvenience of

practising contraception. They will also he free from

any further expenditure for birth-control measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the woman burdened with the care of too many

children,  where  her health is  sapped  by  repeated

pregnancies,  it  is a relief to  be  free  from  the

tyranny of fertility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent report of a series of 186 sterilised women

from  the Medical Research Council, Medical Sociology

Research Unit, in the University of Aberdeen,  showed

that  most of the women were satisfied with and  were

enthusiastic advocates of sterilization.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilization will also be permitted for eugenic

reasons.  For  example, it would be  permitted  where

there  is  a likelihood of transmission of hereditary

diseases  or where one of the partners is insane,  or

manic-depressive, or schizophrenic, or feeble-minded.

In  words  that  have become memorable,  Mr  Justice

Oliver Wendell Holmes, a great jurist, delivered  the

following opinion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is better for all the world, if instead of

waiting to execute a degenerate offspring for  crime,

or  to  let them starve for their imbecility, society

can  prevent  those  who  are manifestly  unfit  from

continuing their kind.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation in the male is a simple one. It is

done  under local anaesthetic and can be done in  any

out-patient surgery. Perhaps the Member for Joo Chiat

will know this better. In the operation, each of  the

two  small tubes, known as the vas deferens,  leading

from  the  testes are cut. In this way, sterility  is

achieved  without  affecting  the  man's  libido   or

virility  and there is a good chance that  the  tubes

may  be  re-joined, if required, successfully  at  a

later date. This operation is medically known as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



vasectomy.  It  is important to point out  here  that

this is entirely different from castration, which  is

a form of emasculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In women, the operation is less simple as the tubes

leading  from  the  woman's  ovaries,  known  as  the

Fallopian tubes, are within the abdominal cavity. The

operation requires a small incision into the abdomen,

but  the  other part of the operation  is  nearly  as

simple  as for a male. Here again, I think the Member

for Joo Chiat will know this better. The operation is

required to be done under general anaesthesia and the

patient  has  to  be  warded. Needless  to  say,  the

operation  carries slightly more risk  compared  with

the  negligible risks of the operation on  the  male.

The operation on the female is called a ligation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Abortion Bill, there are certain safeguards

written  into the Voluntary Sterilization Bill  which

will  effectively prevent abuse. One of the important

safeguards  is  never  to  permit  sterilization   of

persons against the person's will. We must never  get

into  the  position where the Bill,  introduced  with

such high ideals and good intentions, is exploited by

unscrupulous  and cruel persons as had-  happened  in

the  mad days of Nazi Germany during the Second World

War   where   several  thousands  of   persons   were

sterilized without their consent. We must  never  get

into  the position where this law can be used against

particular persons or against a community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is to allow for sterilization of persons to

be  done  entirely voluntarily and  at  the  person's

request. Coercion will be an offence. Since there are

both serious social and medical implications for  the

operations of sterilization which have essentially  a

permanent result and cannot be so easily undone, very

careful  safeguards  have been introduced  and  these

are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The authority of a Eugenics Board will be

required  to authorise the sterilization of  persons.

The  Board will consist of five members who  will  include a Judge, two registered medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



practitioners  and  two  others  appointed   by   the

Minister,  one  of whom must have had  experience  in

social welfare work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Consent of the person, parent or guardian in

case  the applicant is below 21 years of age, and  of

the  spouse  should the person be  married,  will  be

required.  The  reason for requiring consent  of  the

marital  partner  is that the operation  without  the

consent  of  the spouse can be considered  a  marital

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Sterilization will be carried out only in

Government hospitals or an approved institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The operation will be carried out only after a

period  of  30 days has elapsed from the day  of  the

application  in  order  to  give  time   should   the

applicant change his mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) For the medical practitioner and other medical

staff, a conscience clause is included in the Bill so

that no person will be obliged to participate in such

an operation if it is against his conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) The Bill will continue to be in force for a

period  of  four years, which may be extended  for  a

further  period  of one year, which in  effect  means

that  a  critical assessment can be made  as  to  the

effectiveness of the legislation and Parliament  will

have the opportunity for debate on it again if it  is

to be re-enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill makes provisions making it

legal to carry out the operations of sterilization on

a  male  or  female  person  on  application  and  by

approval of a Eugenics Board. Sterilization does  not

carry  the  same emotional and ethical considerations

as  those raised by legalised abortion. Sterilization

is   a  form  of  contraception  which  is  virtually

sterilization for life. As such, it has the advantage

over  the  other  forms  of contraceptive  techniques

which   are   less  convenient,  and  not  completely

effective.  But  being irreversible, serious  thought

must be given by the applicant and great care must be

taken by the Board in approving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



the application before the operation is undertaken so

that  it  is  never regretted. It has therefore  been

necessary  for careful safeguards to be written  into

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is with pleasure  that  I  rise

again  to  speak  in full support  of  the  Voluntary

Sterilization Bill now before this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical sterilization through ligation is the most

reliable  contraceptive method, as  it  involves  the

snipping-off  and  tying up of either  the  Fallopian

tubes in the case of the female, or the seminal tubes

in  the  case  of the male. This method is  generally

asked  for  by  women who already have more  children

than  they  can adequately care for, and  the  simple

operation   is   normally  done   immediately   after

childbirth. I have witnessed such an operation. It is

the  most convenient contraceptive method for  women,

especially:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) those in the low income group who need a

reliable  family  planning  method  which   is

permanent  and without incurring any recurrent

cost;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) those whose education is low and therefore

have  difficulty understanding the anatomy  of

the body and the whys and wherefores of conception; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) those whose husbands, unfortunately, are most

uncooperative  and  show little  understanding

and  feeling,  by refusing to countenance  any

visible form of contraception being practised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical sterilization, fortunately, is not a

controversial issue as mentioned by my colleague, the

Minister  for  Health, as in the case of legalisation

of  abortion and is generally being accepted  as  the

most  reliable  method for family planning  purposes.

This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



nothing new therefore and is, in fact, offered as the

number  three order of priority to women in Singapore

as  a  family  planning method under the Government's

Five-Year Mass Family Planning programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to quote the following relevant

paragraph  of  the  White Paper  on  Family  Planning

(Command  Paper  No.  22  of  1965)  tabled  in  this

Parliament on 27th September, 1965:



<br><br><i>Choice of Family Planning Methods</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'5.2 It is the aim of this Plan therefore to be both

bold  and imaginative by offering all who want Family

Planning a "menu card" as it were, of choices in  the

following order of preference:

<pre>

           (a) Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD).

           (b) Contraceptive Pill (CP).

           (c) Surgical  sterilisation through ligation,

                   etc.(for those with 6 or more children).

           (d) Diaphragm with Paste.

           (e) Vaginal tablet types.

           (f) Condoms.

           (g) Rhythm method.

</pre>

<br>but the whole emphasis of the Plan is to offer IUCD.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now, our Kandang Kerbau Maternity

Hospital  has been performing a few hundred  of  such

cases  each  year,  at  the request  of  the  mothers

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of surgical sterilization for males,

which  in  medical  jargon is called  vasectomy,  the

method  seems  to be popular in some  countries  like

India,  where it has recently been reported  that  as

many as 5,7 million have been sterilized, of whom  80

per  cent are males, in Singapore, however, vasectomy

has  not quite caught on. I think this House will  be

interested in a true case history which occurred when

I was in the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th December, 1967, I received a letter in

Chinese from a Naval Base worker and the free English

translation goes as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dear Minister Yong,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be pleased if you could let me know whether

our  Government  Hospitals provide services  for  the

sterilization of men



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



- i.e. vasectomy.  I  intend   to   undergo   this

sterilization as a means of family planning. I  am  a

Singapore  Citizen  and  I  now  have  six   children

already, their ages ranging from 15 years, 14  years,

13 years, 11 years, 7 years and l½ years. I am now 41

years  of  age and my wife is 34 years old. According

to information given to me she is in the most fertile

age group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I had my fourth child, I had starteti to

practise  birth control. Despite this I had two  more

children. This is most distressing. I have tried  all

the  methods of birth control, and the latest  method

used  was  the  oral pills, which my  wife  had  been

taking for the past few years. But unfortunately  she

did not agree with the pills and developed rashes all

over  her  body. She had consulted a doctor who  gave

her  injections and medicines to take  by  mouth  but

these were of no avail. This is most distressing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Family Planning Board held its exhibition

at  the Victoria Memorial Hall this year, I specially

went  there  to learn more about family planning.  At

that exhibition I bought a book on "The hows and whys

of  modern family planning". After carefully studying

this  book I am convinced that vasectomy as described

in  that book is the best method of birth control for

me.  So  I went to the Family Planning Clinic at  the

Kandang Kerbau Hospital for advice and service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by a nurse in the clinic that at the

moment  the Government does not provide this  service

and  that if I wanted this service I should write  to

you  and  perhaps  you may be able to  give  me  some

guidance.   Finally  she  also  recommended   me   to

Youngberg  Memorial Hospital where  this  service  is

being provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Minister, when I went to the Youngberg Hospital to enquire about this service, I was surprised to hear from a member of the staff there that the operation fee alone was $108.00, and inclusive of medicines and injections the total charges would come to about $130.00. My monthly salary is only $252.00

with  which  I  have  to  feed  a  family  of  eight.

Moreover, three of my children are in middle schools

and two in primary schools. To meet daily expenses is

already  a difficult task, and to spend half  of  one

month's salary on this operation would be impossible.

Because I am in dire need of this operation and  have

therefore  taken the liberty to write to you,  and  I

hope that you will he able to recommend me to one  of

the Government Hospitals to have this safe and simple

operation done.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was indeed touched by the highly responsible

outlook  of this man, over his deep concern over  the

welfare  of  his  wife and family. I  therefore  gave

instructions that this man's wishes for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



vasectomy be met at the earliest possible date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to state that the simple and successful

operation  was  performed  by  none  other  than  the

Professor  of  Surgery, Mr Chan Kong  Thoe,  of  the

University of Singapore, and I was privileged  to  be

present  at  the operation which took  place  in  the

Outram Road General Hospital on 26th January, 1968. I

understand  that both the Professor and  the  patient

are  most happy and satisfied with the results of the

operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation was done free of charge for this man.

Of course, under this Bill, we shall be asking for  a

nominal fee of $5, hereafter, for such operations.
