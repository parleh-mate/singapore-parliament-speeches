bestowing on me this high office.

predecessors  in the conduct of the proceedings  in

me in my shortcomings.

on  them to assist me in accordance with the  rules

of  procedure  and with decorum. The  dignity,  the

rules  of procedure and the privileges of the House

must  always be safeguarded, and I shall do my best

to  uphold these at all times. If, however,  in  my

endeavour  to exercise order and firmness  in  this

House,  my occasional remarks should appear  to  be

abrupt, incisive and perhaps even painful,  I  will

attribute these to my professional training  rather

than to my nature. Thank you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



2.34 p.m



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, on behalf of all Members

of this House, extend to you our congratulations on

the  occasion of your election as Speaker. You are,

Sir,  the fourth to be elected to this high  office

since  the introduction of parliamentary government

in   Singapore.  Your  appointment,  moreover,  has

broken what could, inadvertently, have crystallised

into  a  convention - that the robe of the  Speaker

should fall on the shoulders of those with a  legal

training.  The  three previous  Speakers  were  all

members  of  the legal profession.  This  could  be

attributed   to   the  judicial  atmosphere   which

envelopes this particular office. A great  deal  of

the  ritual  associated  with  the  Speaker  has  a

judicial  flavour.  Even functionally  there  is  a

great deal of similarity between the Judge and  the

Speaker.  The  impartiality both  are  expected  to

maintain   between   contending   and   contentious

factions  has  to  be,  it is  generally  believed,

judicial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these may have been among the reasons for

the  choice of Speakers from members of  the  legal

profession.  Therefore, in electing a distinguished

surgeon,  whose professional regalia is  the  white

robe  and cap, the House has, quite rightly, denied

that  impartiality, even if it has to be  judicial,

is  necessarily a monopoly of members of the  legal

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me add that in electing you to this

responsible  position, the  House  was  not  swayed

wholly    by    your   professional   achievements,

considerable though they are. It is also  based  on

the  high  regard we have for your sense of  social

responsibility; for your belief that  in  this  day

and  age  it is not enough for a citizen to confine

his  interests  and responsibility  to  the  narrow

field  of his profession. We are all aware that  in

many  developing  countries  professional  men  are

paying  a  heavy  price because of their  steadfast

reluctance     to     undertake     the     broader

responsibilities  of  citizenship.   As   societies

become  more  unstable and chaotic,  not  only  are

professional standards lowered but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



even  the  dignified practice of  many  professions

becomes more and more difficult to maintain. So the

increasing number of professional men who  find  it

necessary  to pack their bags and wander about  the

face  of the earth in search of new pastures.  They

could have averted this tragedy had they manifested

an  active  concern for the wider problems  of  the

societies  in  which  they lived.  They  and  their

children need not have, as many of them are  today,

become mendicants hawking their professional skills

to such countries which would care to buy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Sir, are a professional man acutely aware of

the  wider responsibilities which professional  men

should shoulder to ensure their status and dignity.

You have, despite the heavy demands made on you  by

your professional responsibilities, shouldered  the

responsibilities of citizenship as well. You  stood

for  election  twice in your present  constituency.

You  have, as the Deputy Speaker of this House,  as

the    Chairman   of   the   Detainees    Aftercare

Association, as a Justice of the Peace, and as  the

Chairman   of  the  University  Council,  concerned

yourself with many public affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are among the many reasons which prompted

this  House  to  elect  you  as  Speaker.  We   are

confident that, with this wide range of experience,

you  will be able to discharge ably and judiciously

the  new and heavy responsibilities that have  been

entrusted to you. You can be assured, Sir, that for

our part we will give all the cooperation necessary

to  lighten  the burdens of your office.  In  some

Parliaments  the  Speaker  is  exposed  to  hazards

ranging  from moral intimidation to mortal  injury.

But the Parliament of Singapore, I am happy to say,

has,   even   where   it  has   occasionally   been

boisterous,  maintained  a decorous  purposefulness

which,  I  am  sure,  Sir,  you  will  continue  to

maintain. Thank you.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to welcome you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



to  your  office. On this occasion it seems  to  me

appropriate  to  remind  this  Parliament  and  the

nation  that  the  office of Speaker  occupies  the

highest  pinnacle of prestige in the  structure  of

our system of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your office, Mr Speaker, Sir, embodies the

dignity  of  a  country's representative  assembly.

Much of your work will be formal and ceremonial  in

character, but behind all these rituals  and  forms

of   things   lies  a  very  grave  and   important

responsibility of presiding over the debates of our

Parliament, safeguarding its privileges, and acting

as its representative. Mr Speaker, Sir, the nature

of your office is judicial. Perhaps it was for this

reason that the office of Speaker in Singapore  had

been  previously occupied by eminent men  from  the

legal profession. In the early days of our history,

when  parliamentary institutions were in the  stage

of  transplanted infancy, the selection of men with

legal  training was, in retrospect, both  wise  and

necessary.  The letter and spirit of  parliamentary

rule required careful nurturing, and men with legal

qualifications were the best possible and available

candidates  for  the  office of  the  Speaker.  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   legal  qualifications   are   not

essential for the proper discharge of the duties of

the   Speaker.   Indeed   the   technicalities   of

parliamentary procedure, I believe, can be  learned

from  textbooks. The experience of  countries  with

long  traditions  of parliamentary  government  has

shown  that  there  is absolutely  no  evidence  to

presume  that  only a lawyer can make a  successful

Speaker. What is more essential, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

is parliamentary rather than legal experience. This

experience,  Sir,  you have  acquired  first  as  a

Member of Parliament, and then as Deputy Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being the first non-legal man to be elected

Speaker,  you, Sir, have made history in Singapore.

As  in  all walks of life, some Speakers are better

than  others.  But  whoever assumes  the  Speaker's

mantle  inherits the dignity and the responsibility

that go with the office. In breaking precedent with

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



past, we in this Parliament firmly believe that you

will   guide  its  proceedings  with  dignity   and

impartiality,  and  with credit  to  your  surgical

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, superficially, one may not see

the relevance of some ingredients of success in the

surgical  profession  to the  qualities  which  are

deemed to be necessary for the successful discharge

of  the duties of the Speaker. If one examines  the

specialised  competence that distinguishes  surgery

from other professions and occupations, one may  be

inclined  towards this view. Yet  there  are  other

qualities  in  the  career of a successful  surgeon

that are relevant in the discharge of the duties of

the  Speakership.  These  are,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

integrity, judgment, common sense, patience,  tact,

a  sense  of  humour, self-confidence, presence  of

mind,  and  firmness  tempered  with  courtesy  and

kindness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the dignity of your office

you will be rewarded by the strain of long hours in

the Chair. You have exchanged the right to generate

heat and passion for the obligation to sit with  an

unruffled demeanour through more speeches than  any

other  of my Parliamentary colleagues will probably

wish  to  hear. You sit as the Judge, and  will  be

exercising  your judgment all the  time.  You  have

been  with  us  long  enough to  have  acquired  an

intimate  understanding of parliamentary  life  the

individual and collective problems of the  Members,

and their strengths and weaknesses. For this reason

we  are confident that you will not allow an  over-technical  interpretation of the rules of procedure

to  restrict debate, and when a situation calls for

interruption  you will give a stern  rebuke  if  it

merits  sternness,  or supply a  touch  of  humour,

which  can dissolve a strained situation in a burst

of laughter, provided, of course, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  laughter is that of human beings and not  that

of gibbons. It is the nature of the office that the

Speaker seldom speaks, but when he does he speaks

with authority, and this authority comes from  his

impartiality  and its acceptance  by  the  Members.

When you speak, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



it  will  be the voice of authority, for  you  have

demonstrated   your   impartiality   during    your

apprenticeship   as   Deputy  Speaker,   and   this

Parliament   has   indicated  acceptance   in   the

unanimity of its support of your candidature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have the

endorsement of my Parliamentary colleagues  when  I

say that we will do our best to make your work less

tedious  and  more pleasant by working  within  the

framework  of the best of parliamentary traditions,

that  is,  to give and take with firmness but  with

courtesy.  It  was once said with  reference  to  a

Speaker  in  the  British Parliament  that,  and  I

quote,  Sir, "The office of Speaker does not demand

rare  qualities, it demands common qualities  in  a

rare  degree."  And  with this, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

permit me to congratulate you.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate you on

the  occasion  of  your  election  as  Speaker   of

Parliament.  I believe hon. Members of this  august

House  do warmly welcome a gentleman in your person

as  Speaker. I am sure, Mr Speaker, you will be  a

living  symbol  in  Parliament  of  our  democratic

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be permitted on this

occasion to introduce a personal note in my tribute

to  you,  because  your  many  accomplishments  and

qualities have evoked a great deal of admiration. I

believe  many know you now as a surgeon  of  repute

and  skill. But it is interesting to note that  you

first obtained your Bachelor of Arts (Honours)  and

Master  of  Arts  degrees at London  and  Cambridge

Universities  before  obtaining  your  Bachelor  of

Medicine   and  Bachelor  of  Surgery   degree   at

Cambridge  University. I understand that  you  were

also  no mean sportsman, having excelled in cricket

and tennis during your student days and represented

your  university in badminton. If I  may  say,  Mr

Speaker,  you  are  a forerunner  of  the  kind  of

individual we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



aim  to  build up among our young citizens,  always

excelling in all pursuits and endeavours.  We  note

with the greatest sense of pride your international

status  and  renown as a Fellow of the Colleges  of

Surgeons of England, Australia and America. We  are

grateful that in recent years you have devoted your

time  and  skill  to  the  training  of  our  local

surgeons.  I  believe  you have  not  only  devoted

yourself  to  your  profession  but  have  actively

undertaken  the  task  of rehabilitating  political

detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you undoubtedly possess the

qualities of a man of the mind, hands and spirit. I

will  follow  you  as  a  guiding  beacon  in   our

deliberations in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me join my colleagues who

spoke  before  me  in congratulating  you  on  your

election to this high office. Sir, in expressing my

views, I am sure that I will also be expressing the

views  of all the Members present here when  I  say

that  we  have no doubt that the choice of  you  as

Speaker of this House is the most appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, your experience as Deputy Speaker during the

past  two  years will stand you well for  the  high

office that has been entrusted to you. We are aware

that  your  acceptance  of this  office  will  mean

further  sacrifices on your part. Your professional

activities  as  one  of  our  eminent  surgeons  in

Singapore will have to be curtailed. I am sure  the

House  and the people of Singapore will be grateful

for the sacrifices that you have agreed to make  in

accepting the office as Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are well aware that you will discharge your

high  office  as  Speaker of this  Parliament  most

justly  and  aptly.  Sir, in  the  course  of  your

duties,  if  you find us Members of  the  House  at

fault  for  lack of understanding of  the  Standing

Orders or making tiresome and boring speeches, I am

sure  you will bear with us. We are well aware that

sometimes  some  of us ask supplementary  questions

followed by more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



supplementary  questions. You  may  sometimes  feel

like  participating  in the debate  yourself  which

your  high office does not allow you to do so  now.

Your  task is made more difficult by the fact  that

all  of us are Members from one party and, as such,

you  will  have  to  bear with us,  especially  the

Backbenchers,   in   sometimes   criticising    the

Government  or  commending  it  on  any  particular

issue.  With  your guidance. I am sure  this  House

will be able to discharge its duties honourably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it will not be out of place for me at

this juncture to pay a tribute to our last Speaker,

Mr  P.  Coomaraswamy,  who has  always  given  us,

especially the new Members of Parliament, a helping

hand in discharging our duties as Members here. His

friendly  approach  and  guidance  will  always  be

appreciated  by us and we look forward  to  similar

guidance and assistance from you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Being the Speaker of this House, I will always

have  the last word! I would like to thank the Hon.

of   basking   in  this  sunshine  of  praises   so

generously showered on me, I propose to get down to

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, the Research Division of my Ministry has

been studying the subject in some depth. There  has

been  no  evidence that these companies  have  been

established  to  defraud the public.  Some  of  the

larger concerns are achieving substantial turnovers

and are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



providing  participants who borrow with useful,  if

expensive, credit and those who lend with high,  if

risky, returns on their investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies are registered under the

Companies  Act,  and there are no legal  powers  to

regulate  their operations under this Act.  Whether

the   subject  merits  new  legislation  is   being

considered in my Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Since the Ministry of Finance has studied this

subject  in some depth, will the Minister  disclose

to  this House the number of chit fund companies in

Singapore  and  the  various  amounts  of   paid-up

capital?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I intend to publish the findings of the Research

Division  in an information paper in the course  of

time.  There are now 23 companies registered  under

the  Companies  Act. I do not have the  details  at

hand  of their total capitalisation. But, as I said

earlier,  some of them are quite considerable.  For

instance,  the  biggest  of  them  has  an  average

monthly  auction  value  of $862,000.  The  average

monthly  amount collected from members  of  various

groups  of this company was $615,000 and the monthly

amount  paid  by  way of loans was  $497,000.  This

shows  the  scale of operations of  some  of  these

companies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Can the Minister say whether to date any company

has failed in its operations?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Not to my knowledge, although the trouble will

start  when  members or clients of these  companies

default  on  their payments. This has happened  and

has led to action taken in the civil court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether  his  Ministry  has  reached   any

agreement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



with  any private commercial firms so as to prevent

those  firms  from employing any civil  servant  or

employee  of  a statutory board; and  what  is  the

rationale behind such a move.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there is an understanding between my

Ministry  and certain large industrial  firms  that

these  firms will not make offers of employment  to

employees  of  the Government and statutory  boards

without  first  obtaining  the  agreement  of   the

Government   or  the  statutory  boards  concerned.

Similarly, the Government and the statutory  boards

will not make offers of employment to employees  of

these industrial firms without first obtaining  the

concurrence of the management of these firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid expansion in both the public and

private sectors in recent years has resulted  in  a

shortage  of  people with the necessary  skills  in

management   or   in  professional  and   technical

training.  Under such conditions, there exists  the

temptation  for  an  organisation  to   solve   its

staffing  problem  by  stealing  staff  from  other

people.  This practice called "crimping"  does  not

increase  the  pool  of persons with  the  required

skill  in  the  country. This is  not  only  of  no

benefit to the economy as a whole, but it can  have

disruptive effects.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I cannot predict what

changes  will,  in  fact, take  place  in  American

policy towards Vietnam during the coming months and

years,  I  cannot foresee what military  and  other

implications it would have for Singapore's  foreign

policy.  However,  whatever  new  circumstances  we

might  find  ourselves in as a result  of  American

policy  changes or, for that matter, of  any  other

country,  our basic policy of ensuring  Singapore's

security and political integrity remains unaltered.

Precisely  how  we further this basic  policy  will

depend on circumstances then prevailing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I point out that the Minister for Foreign

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law governing bills of exchange,

cheques and promissory notes is the Malaysian  Bill

of Exchange



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance, 1949 (Federation of Malaya Ordinance No.

75  of  1949). The operation of this Ordinance  was

extended to Singapore by the Modification  of  Laws

(Bills  of  Exchange) (Extension) Order, 1965,  and

remains  in force by virtue of section  13  of  the

Republic of Singapore Independence Act, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things, the Bill of Exchange

Ordinance determines what a non-business day is for

foreign   exchange   transactions   and   for   the

computation  of time for the payment  of  bills  of

exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiences in international currency crises in

the  past years have made local banks reluctant  to

conduct  on  Saturdays foreign  exchange  business,

such  as  the  sale of foreign currencies  for  the

retirement of bills, telegraphic transfers,  demand

drafts  and  the purchase of foreign currencies  in

respect  of  export bills, etc. This is because  if

banks   in   Singapore  transact  foreign  exchange

business  on Saturdays, they would not be  able  to

cover  their  positions  because  of  the  Saturday

closure  of other international financial  centres,

particularly the London and the New York markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After due consideration, and taking account of

the  representations made to it by the  Association

of  Banks in Malaysia-Singapore, the Government has

decided to allow banks in Singapore to close  their

foreign  exchange operations on Saturdays. This  is

in keeping with the practice of other international

financial centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House seeks to amend the

law  by  making  Saturdays  non-business  days  and

excluding them from the computation of time for the

payment  of bills of exchange. This amendment  does

not  cover  bills  drawn and payable  in  Singapore

currency - known as Singapore bills - and such other

bills  which the Minister may prescribe. For  these

bills, Saturday would still be a business day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the special relationship with Malaysia

and Brunei, provision is made for the exemption  of

Malaysian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



and  Brunei  usance  bills  and  cheques  from  the

proposed   amendments.  Banks  in  Singapore   have

indicated  that,  in  order to promote  Singapore's

tourist industry, they are prepared to continue  to

accept traveller's cheques on Saturdays.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Manufacture Ordinance was enacted

in February 1959. The main objective underlying the

Ordinance  was  to  control  the  establishment  of

certain   manufacturing   industries   which   were

considered   essential  operations,  and   it   was

necessary then to limit them because of the limited

domestic  markets  and of other  economic  factors.

Until 1967, this Ordinance was not much used. Since

then, industrialisation has gained momentum and  it

is  necessary now to implement this Ordinance  more

stringently. However, many aspects of the Ordinance

are ineffective. The proposed amendment, therefore,

aims  at  tightening the legislation. To this  end,

the   Ordinance  may  be  used  as   an   important

instrument    in   controlling   and    channelling

investments  into industries which are economically

beneficial to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision under section 5 (2) (a) and

(b)  of  the Ordinance which provides for automatic

registration  of  companies  which  have  been   in

production  or  have  bona  fide  made  substantial

preparations prior to the gazetting of a particular

product under the Schedule to the Ordinance. It  is

necessary to impose some pressure on such companies

which  might  otherwise  be  lax  in  applying  for

registration.  To this end, the amendment  to  this

section  provides  the condition that  registration

should  be  effective within  six  months  of  such

specification  of goods published in  the  Gazette.

Thereafter,  all  applications  shall  be   treated

afresh.  Those  who fail to apply for  registration

within the six months' period shall be guilty of an

offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine

not  exceeding $10,000, and to a fine not exceeding

$1,000  for  every  day during  which  the  offence

continues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsections (3), (4) and (5) of section 5 should

be deleted, as there is no reason why the Registrar

should  not undertake further application within  a

certain period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the revocation of certificates referred

to  in  section  6 of the Ordinance, the  amendment

empowers  the  Registrar to revoke the  certificate

where   it   has  been  proved  that  a  registered

manufacturer has ceased production for a continuous

period   of   three  months.  To  complement   this

particular action, the Registrar may also determine

the  minimum quantity of goods to be produced by  a

registered manufacturer. This additional  power  is

provided for in the additional subsection (5).  The

amendment, in effect, incorporates a more  specific

and wider scope in the conditions for revocation of

the certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a measure for implementing the Ordinance more

effectively,  the  amendment to section  8  of  the

Ordinance has been introduced so as to increase the

penalty for offences committed under the provisions

of  the  Ordinance. For those who  have  failed  to

register in respect of a particular item of  goods,

the  fine  has  been  increased  from  $10,000   to

$50,000.  The penalty for those who have failed  to

comply with any condition for registration has been

increased   from   $5,000  to  $10,000;   and   for

manufacturers  who  have contrived  to  give  false

information  to  render the Ordinance  ineffective,

the  fine  for  such an offence has been  increased

from  $500  to  $1,000.  In  this  connection,   an

additional  subsection (5)  has  been  added  which

allows the Registrar to compound offences under the

Ordinance, instead of imposing fines by  the  court

upon conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the main purpose of the Ordinance aims at

protecting   the   interests   of   some   of   the

manufacturers  who are required to  register  under

the Ordinance, some form of an annual fee should be

imposed. To this end a new section 11 (1)  and  (2)

has been added to the Ordinance, which empowers the

Minister to impose an annual duty according to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



a  schedule drawn up on the basis of fixed  capital

investment.   This  is  defined   as   the   actual

expenditure  incurred  by  the  enterprise  on  its

factory  in Singapore and on any plant or machinery

used   in   Singapore   in  connection   with   the

manufacture  of  the registered product.  In  cases

where the industries enjoy protection and, to  some

extent,  virtual  monopolistic  positions  in   the

domestic  market, the Minister may impose different

rates of duties for different categories of goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 13 of the Ordinance is repealed and re-enacted whereby the Minister may exempt any person

from  the provisions of this Ordinance, and he  may

also  impose a restriction on the quantity of goods

to  be  manufactured  by a registered  manufacturer

where he considers it is in the public interest  to

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, can the Minister enlighten the House on why

it is necessary for him to be empowered to impose a

restriction  on  the  quantity  of  goods   to   be

manufactured?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, would you like to answer that question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I will be happy to answer this at the end of

the  debate.  I do not know whether there  are  any

other Members who would like to speak on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no other Member wishing to speak-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there may be instances where it would be in

the public interest to allow not one monopoly but

possibly a small number of producers to produce

for the Singapore market. Under such

circumstances, two options are open to the

Government. The first is to allow a free-for-all,

and let them compete. The end result could be

either all survive at some level of profitability

or other, or one will knock out the others and

establish a monopoly. In order to avoid this kind

of a situation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



it may be necessary to require that at least in the

initial  stages each of the licensed  manufacturers

will  produce  a certain amount, and no  more  than

that  amount for the domestic market.  This  is  to

enable  all  the  participating  manufacturers   to

establish  a  foothold  in the  enterprise  and  to

ensure  that in the long run they are more  viable.

It is not possible to say on a priori grounds which

is  the  better  policy.  It  all  depends  on  the

circumstances,   the  type  of  products,   the

technical factors, the finance available, and a lot

of other things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service Salaries Commission, under the

chairmanship of Mr G.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



J. Harvey, recommended in its report that provision

be made in the Pensions Ordinance for the premature

retirement  of  an  officer or groups  of  officers

under  special circumstances where,  to  quote  the

Commission,  "there  can be no possible  shadow  of

criticism of the officers concerned."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been instances where it is clearly in

the  interest  of the service and of  the  officers

concerned to allow them to retire. Under the law as

it  stands,  such retirements can only be  effected

under the provision relating to retirements in  the

public  interest. This is not satisfactory because,

through  usage over the years, there  is  a  stigma

attached to retirements in the public interest.  To

retire officers under this clause simply because of

the  absence of a more appropriate one, results  in

casting  an  unfair slur on the officers concerned.

The amendment under consideration is to rectify the

situation  by  providing for premature  retirements

that are not made on disciplinary grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Pensions Ordinance

to allow an officer who has completed not less than

15  years  of  service to be retired. In  order  to

protect the interests of officers, such retirements

may  only  be  allowed  with  the  consent  of  the

President on the specific advice of the Cabinet. An

officer  retiring  in such circumstances  would  be

eligible  for normal retirement benefits  based  on

the number of years of service he has put in.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Under the Pensions Ordinance, 1956, a serving

officer   may  be  pensioned  off  in  the   public

interest. May I ask whether there is any difference

between  retirement under that  Ordinance  and  the

present  amendment Bill? If there is no difference,

then what purpose does this Bill serve to amend the

Pensions Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson

had not been paying attention to what I said on the

Second  Reading of this Bill. I said quite  clearly

that  retirement in the public interest  carries  a

certain stigma. It is presumed that the officer who

was  retired in the public interest was not  up  to

his  task and was therefore asked to retire "in the

public interest".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been very clear instances where it was

in  the interest of the officers concerned as  well

as  in the interest of the service that they should

be  retired. But under the existing Ordinance, that

is not possible because an officer can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



only  retire  on reaching the retiring  age  or  be

retired in the public interest. The purpose of this

amending  Bill,  therefore, is to  make  retirement

possible  for an officer whose behaviour cannot  be

criticised. In the words of the Commission:  "there

can  be  no  possible shadow of  criticism  of  the

officers concerned."



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is that where it is in

the  interest of the service as well as the officer

concerned that he should be retired, he could be so

retired under this Bill without any stigma attached

to his retirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, can the Parliamentary Secretary

state whether under this amending Bill we can  deal

with those officers who are inefficient?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Although the Member's remarks were on the

principle  of the Bill and should have been  raised

at the Second Reading, I do not mind answering him.

The  answer  is no. For those officers who  do  not

perform their duties efficiently, they can still be

retired in the public interest under the provisions

of  the old law. But the present amending provision

is   to   enable  officers  to  retire  when  their

retirement is, in fact, in their interest  as  well

as  in  the interest of the service, with no stigma

whatsoever attaching to such retirement.

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now quite apparent that Singapore is

building  an  excessive  number  of  hotel   rooms.

Research  done  by the Singapore Tourist  Promotion

Board  shows that by the end of 1972 the number  of

hotel  rooms  available  would  increase  from  the

present  level of 2,800 rooms to 13,000  rooms,  or

about  four times. One estimate of tourist arrivals

in  1972  puts the number at 680,000 compared  with

about 360,000 in 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong last year, there were 6,400 hotel

rooms  catering for some 600,000 tourist  arrivals.

Allowing  for some degree of under-supply of  hotel

rooms  in  Hong Kong, these figures show  that  the

hotel  room  supply in Singapore  will  be  far  in

excess  of  demand unless a special effort  is  now

mounted  to  attract more tourists to the  Republic

and to lengthen their stay here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board is in the

process  of  stepping  up  its  overseas  promotion

activities,  particularly in Japan, Australia,  the

United States of America and Germany. The Board has

engaged full-time representatives in Sydney and San

Francisco to handle promotion work in Australia and

the United States of America. In Tokyo a very well-known Japanese firm has been appointed by the Board

as our advertising and public relations agency. The

Tourist  Promotion  Board  is  at  present  in  the

process  of  establishing  another  representative,

this time in Germany.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also developing new facilities

and improving existing ones to give tourists a more

interesting  time. A large aviary is  fast  nearing

completion in the Jurong industrial estate. It will

be  one of the finest in the world. The high-lights

will  be  a  flight cage covering an area  of  five

acres  and  a 100-foot man-made waterfall.  To  the

best  of  my  knowledge, these are the  largest  of

their  kind  in  the world. A no  less  spectacular

marine-land is being designed and planned  for  the

Bedok reclamation area, whilst a first-class zoo or

a zoological garden is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



proposed  to  be  established in  the  vicinity  of

Seletar Reservoir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most concentrated development of

tourist facilities in Singapore will eventually  be

located in the island now named Blakang Mati.  Here

we  have engaged at some cost a well-known American

corporation   with   great   experience   in    the

development  of tourist facilities. It will  review

the  development plans that we have made for this

island. Their final recommendations and plans  will

be submitted to the Government in six months' time.

Subsequent development of Blakang Mati  will  be  a

joint effort between the Government and the private

sector,     with    Government    providing     the

infrastructure  facilities, such as jetties,  roads

and utility services, and certain basic attractions

such   as  an  18-hole  championship  golf  course,

museums, art and craft centres, marinas and  so  on

and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plans to bring more tourists to Singapore

and  to  lengthen their stay are, needless to  say,

very   costly.  Not  all  of  them  can  be   self-supporting. In addition to the money spent  on  the

aviary,  zoo, marineland and on projects at Blakang

Mati,  the  Tourist  Promotion Board's  budget  for

overseas promotion and advertising also has  to  be

increased  in the coming fiscal year.  It  will  be

increased to $1.3 million from the previous rate of

$400,000.  This  increased sum, however,  is  still

small compared, for instance, to what Hong Kong  is

spending on overseas promotion and advertisement - no less than $2.1 million by the Government alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Republic's hotels and restaurants benefit

from  Government's efforts, it is, therefore,  only

equitable   that   they   should   make   a   small

contribution. Hotels are already doing  so  on  the

basis  of  a  three  per cent cess  on  hotel  room

rentals.   It   is  proposed  to  make  first-class

restaurants  and bars do likewise. These  would  be

bars  which  hold any of the following licences:  a

public house first-class (extended) (tourist hotel)

licence,  or a public house first-class  (extended)

licence, or a public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



house   first-class   licence.  Restaurants   which

qualify  are those operating a bar service  holding

any  of  the aforementioned licences. All bars  and

restaurants in gazetted tourist hotels are also  to

be included in this scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, there are more than 360 of such

establishments.  An  amendment   to   the   Tourist

Promotion Board Ordinance seeks to impose  a  three

per  cent tax on the sale of each item of  food  or

drink in selected bars and restaurants. Their names

will  be gazetted shortly and they will be required

to pay the stipulated tax as from 1st of March this

year  to the Comptroller of Customs and Excise  who

will be appointed by the Tourist Promotion Board to

collect such tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this amendment, the Bill

introduces three others. The first seeks to  change

the  method  of appointing members to  the  Tourist

Promotion Board. Whereas existing legislation  provides specifically for some members of the Board to

be drawn from a particular body or institution, the

proposed  amendment does not set such a limitation.

The  other  two amendments are minor in  character.

They  seek to change the commencement date  of  the

financial year from 1st January to 1st April and to

bring   the  provision  regarding  the  laying   of

regulations  before  Parliament  into   line   with

current practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, the promotion

of   tourism   is   a  very  important   means   of

strengthening our economy. The Minister  said  just

now  that we must take measures to do so.  He  said

the  number of hotel rooms in Singapore is becoming

too excessive for our requirements, and unless more

tourists are attracted to Singapore, tourism as  an

industry will not be as revenue-producing  as  that

in  Hong Kong. The proposed measures to remedy  the

situation are very wise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not an expert on tourism, but I feel that

there  are  certain aspects of tourist  development

which are not comprehensible. For instance, has the

Tourist Promotion Board any experienced guides  who

can  inform  the  tourists  about  the  history  of

Singapore?  According  to my knowledge,  the  Board

does not seem to have done this in the past. I feel

that  it should pay more attention to these aspects

of  tourist  development  in  future.  The  Tourist

Promotion  Board should employ tourist  guides  who

are  more conversant with our history. They  should

be  genuine guides for tourists. People of  dubious

character  should  not be encouraged  to  serve  as

tourist  guides. Only in this way will tourists  be

able  to  know  that  we  are  progressing.  But  I

understand some tourist guides are employed by  the

Tourist Promotion Board on a temporary basis. These

guides take tourists to places which do not reflect

well on Singapore. For instance, they take tourists

to  the  death house where old and sick people  are

waiting  for  their death. Naturally  the  tourists

will report unfavourably on Singapore. This is  the

kind of thing that should not be stressed too much.

Some  guides even tell the tourists that the people

of Singapore are backward. I think this is not good

for  Singapore  and  I hope the  Tourist  Promotion

Board will take action to remedy this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister said that since 1967 we

have built more and more hotel rooms and there  are

now  a  good number of first-class hotels.  I  feel

that the charges of these hotels are very high  and

are  even more expensive than those charged by  the

first-class hotels in Hong Kong. For instance,  for

a  single  room the charge here is $56, whereas  in

Hong  Kong it is from $30 to $40. Some hotels  here

charge  as  much  as $100 for a  room.  This  is  a

discouraging factor for tourists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I feel that developers of hotels and

people in the tourist trade have a wrong conception

of  certain  matters. They think that tourists  are

all westernised people and that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



want  a  certain kind of recreation. Hence we  have

strip-tease  dances  in our nightclubs.  We  should

know  that tourists might have seen even more naked

dances  in Europe and elsewhere. So if we  want  to

attract tourists by these methods, I must say  that

they are all wrong. On the other hand, it will only

create  a bad impression on others. Such places  as

night-clubs, bars, and restaurants are visited  not

only  by tourists but also by the local people.  We

can  say  that three-quarters of the customers  are

our  youths  and  some older folks. Therefore,  the

intention to attract foreign exchange by tourism is

defeated. Instead, it will create a bad environment

for  our people. What we should do is to create our

own  unique  tradition and try to impress  our  own

cultures  on  the  tourists  to  enable   them   to

understand  us better. The traditional cultures  of

our    various   races   have   their   own    good

characteristics  and are unique in  themselves.  We

should  avail  ourselves of  every  opportunity  to

manifest  them fully especially to the tourists  in

order to convey a good impression to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Minister for Finance said that we

will try our best to promote tourism and to do more

publicity  work abroad to attract more tourists  to

Singapore.  Of course, it is necessary  to  set  up

various tourist spots and attractions in Singapore.

These  will  also provide interest  for  our  local

people  who might otherwise go to unsavoury  places

to  pass  their  time. The Minister said  that  the

Government  has recruited experts from  America  to

advise  it on how to develop tourism and to set  up

various  tourist  spots. I think these  people  who

come here to advise us on matters of tourism have a

different background and different views on how  to

promote  tourism.  In Singapore, we  should  create

something  that is unique and that can reflect  our

own  culture. We should not ape others. I  feel  we

have  many  people  in  Singapore,  especially  the

artistes,  who can help the Government  to  reflect

local conditions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



4.09       p.m



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all let me avail myself

of  this  opportunity to congratulate  the  Tourist

Promotion Board on its success and achievements  in

promoting   tourism.  The  main  purpose   of   the

amendment Bill is to enable the Board to collect  a

three  per cent cess on all sales of food and drink

from tourist food establishments and tourist public

houses  in order to use such cess to subsidise  our

publicity  promotion  efforts.  This  is   a   very

practical  method. We know that the Government  has

already  spent  large  sums  of  money  on  tourist

promotion and that it has set up offices in various

parts  of the world to publicise Singapore in order

to  attract more tourists to come here and in order

to  earn a large amount of foreign exchange for the

benefit  of  our  economy.  As  a  result  of   the

strenuous  efforts  of the Government   to  set  up

various tourist attractions, our tourist trade  has

improved  greatly today. It has earned praise  from

all  quarters. Since the promotion of tourism  will

involve  Government  in  expending  large  sums  of

money,  it  has every reason to impose a  cess  on

tourist   hotels   and   food   establishments   to

supplement its expenditure. By this means, it  will

be  able  to  do more publicity and  attract  more

tourists  to Singapore. This will also bring  about

more job opportunities for our people. As a result,

we  will improve our economy. This measure is  most

appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I want to know who will have

to  pay the three per cent cess. If proprietors of

hotels  and food establishments are asked  to  pay,

then  they will pass the three per cent cess on  to

their customers. Therefore, the customers will have

to  bear the additional charges and the proprietors

and  owners of these establishments will not  have

to  pay  the cess. I feel there should be  certain

regulations to ensure that the new tariff does  not

fall on the shoulders of the tourists. I understand

there have been a number of complaints against  the

high charges made by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



hotels,  just  as what the Member for  Delta  has

described.   If  we  impose  on  the  tourists this

additional  cess,  it  would  definitely  have   an

unfavourable   reaction  on  the   tourist   trade.

Secondly, what yardstick would the Minister use  in

classifying  hotels  as  tourist-class  or  first-.

class? Thirdly, when can we see the, completion of

the  Bali  project  and how much  money  will  be

involved? Fourthly, at the moment we are short  of

good  cooks. We have to recruit cooks, mainly  from

Hong  Kong and elsewhere, because of the increase

in  hotels. This will not only incur a loss in  our

foreign, exchange, but will also deprive our people

of  jobs. So I wonder whether the Tourist Promotion

Board  can  set up some kind of training school  to

train cooks for local employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> There has been considerable debate in this

House,  in  the  press, among trade  and  financial

circles, over the ways and means of developing the

tourist  industry. Everyone agrees  that  something

has to be done, but nobody has thought of what  has

to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just told this House that to woo

tourists  from  abroad,  money  must  be  spent  on

publicising  Singapore. Experience has  shown  that

the amount of money needed to increase the flow of

tourists    cannot   be   obtained   by   voluntary

contributions from the industry. It  is  with  this

view  in  mind that I support the Bill to  levy  a

cess  on  or through the industry which  stands  to

gain  from  the  efforts of the  Tourist  Promotion

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In going through this Bill, I notice that no

intention  is stated or indicated as to  who  would

have to pay the cess in the first instance. Is  the

cess  to be collected as a sort of turnover tax  on

lodging,  food  and  drinks,  or  is  it  to  be

additional to the bill to be presented to the guest

or customer? I cannot agree with my colleague that

the cess should be borne by the industry. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



would  prefer  to have the cess as an addition,  to

the  bill. The three per cent cess levy is  not  a

heavy  one  and is unlikely to cause any resentment

to  tourists or the local consumers of  food  and

drinks in certain more costly places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Government levy in Japan is ten

per  cent and in Taiwan thirteen per cent.  Hotel

operators and restaurateurs will most likely pass

on  the levy through increased prices, if they  are

asked to pay a levy on the gross salary and, in so

doing,  they  are  more often  likely  to  increase

prices by more than the levy. What can be worse is

that  not  only are the prices increased,  but  the

volume  of  sales is reduced to a lower figure  in

order to defraud on payment of the cess as well as

income tax. This is less likely to happen and there

is less incentive to do so if the levy is initially

and  directly  paid  by the guest  or  customer.  I

foresee that the rate of levy will be going up  and

not  coming down in the future. Other countries have

a  much higher rate than this Bill seeks to impose.

The  Minister has the power to vary the levy at any

time,  and I frankly do not anticipate him lowering

the  rate.  The  higher  he varies  the  rate,  the

greater will be the incentives to defraud.  It  is,

therefore,   better  to  start   the   cess   under

conditions   where  there  is  less  incentive   to

defraud. Having said this, it only remains  for  me

to  add that it should be decided that the cess  be

paid  directly by the customer who partakes of  the

food  and drinks in the same way as the hotel guest

is  now paying for his room. Therefore, either  the

schedule  is  amended  or the Minister,  under  the

powers   conferred  upon  him  under  section   11,

specifies a minimum cess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person can go to a first-class hotel and have a

cup of coffee which may cost a dollar. If he goes

alone,  which is unlikely, he has to pay a cess  of

three cents. If he takes two friends along, he  has

to pay nine cents. This will be awkward. I suggest,

therefore,  a  minimum  cess  of  five  cents   and

thereafter to the nearest five cents.

4.27 p.m



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much obliged to Members

for putting forward various useful suggestions. The

Member  for  Delta  has  brought  up  a  number  of

relevant points which I propose to reply to in some

detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as regards tourist guides. At present,

they  have  to be licensed by the Tourist Promotion

Board.  They  are carefully selected,  trained  and

examined.  The examination papers include questions

on   the   history  of  Singapore.  In  fact,   the

examinations  are quite stiff and I  doubt  whether

any  Member  will  relish  going  through  such   a

stringent course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards death-houses, which happen to be in my

constituency,  it is very difficult  to  put  these

institutions out of bounds to people  who  want  to

see  them. I do not think it is practical to  debar

foreign  visitors from having a look  at  them.  In

fact,  I am told that some enterprising members  of

my  constituency  are  selling  little  coffins  as

souvenirs to tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also says that hotel charges are too

high compared to Hong Kong. I do not know what  the

facts  are, but I would agree with her that at  one

time  hotel  charges in Singapore were  very  high.

That  was  because there was an acute  shortage  of

rooms  and  the hotels decided to charge  what  the

traffic  could bear. The Government  wrote  to  the

members  of the trade who were represented  by  the

Hotel   and   Restaurant   Association,   or   some

association by this name, and asked them  how  they

would  respond  to government controls.  They  said

"No".  They  objected  to government  controls  and

thought  that  this should be left  to  the  market

forces  of supply and demand. I am holding them  to

this  answer,  because in the years to  come,  when

there  is an excess of hotel rooms, I hope we  will

not  hear complaints about hotel charges being  too

high,  but cut-throat competition forcing them  too

low. So I think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



problem of high hotel charges will solve itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards entertainment in hotels as a tourist

attraction, the Member complained about the  rather

low   standard   of  strip-tease  performances   in

Singapore   which  do  not  come  up   to   foreign

standards.  I  agree with her, but I  am  not  sure

whether  she is in favour of improving our standard

to that in Soho or San Francisco. Of course, she is

right  that  the  patrons of these shows,  and  the

people  who go to bars, are not tourists but mostly

local  residents. However, if they  want  to  spend

their  money  this way, we cannot  stop  them.  The

Government is not a religious organisation.  It  is

not a moral institution. Possibly the only thing we

could  do is to increase the entertainment  tax  on

this  kind of performances. Anyway, I do not  think

any special measure is called for in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member, however, has made a very valuable

contribution in saying that we should not encourage

this  foreign type of entertainment,  but  that  we

should  develop  our  own special  characteristics.

Actually, the Tourist Promotion Board is forming  a

company, in conjunction with private enterprise, to

stage  cultural  performances for  the  benefit  of

tourists at a small charge. If all goes well,  they

will  be performed in West Point Garden in about  a

month  or two from now. Then it will depend on  how

well  these cultural shows are received. The Member

is  absolutely  right in saying that when  tourists

come here, they want to see something exotic of the

Orient,  and  not some inferior imitation  of  what

they could see at home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board also proposes, as

part  of its long-term programme, to stage  once  a

year,    possibly   around   our    National    Day

Celebrations, a cultural festival in which we  will

invite cultural troupes from the countries of South-east  Asia,  each  of  which has  got  dancers  and

musicians of very high standards. I do not think we

will be able to stage one this year, but certainly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



in  1971  we  should see something quite  good  and

spectacular along these lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked who pays for the

hotel cess. The answer is the consumer pays for it.

I agree with the Member for Havelock that that is a

very good idea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also asked for

information  on a number of points.  I  have  taken

down notes, but I am having difficulty in trying to

decipher  my  own writing. So, if I  missed  out  a

number  of  points, I hope he will  excuse  me.  He

asked  what is the standard for inclusion for  this

three  per  cent cess. There is a body in Singapore

called, I think, Licensing Justices, and if anybody

wants to sell intoxicating liquor as a business, he

will  have to obtain a licence from this body. They

grade  licences into "first-class", "second-class",

and  so on. The conditions of a first-class licence

are   spelt  out.  The  place  must  have   certain

standards  of  comfort or cleanliness and  drinking

hours  are  more generous than those in  a  second-class  licence. So we think it is a good  thing  if

all   those  who  have  first-class  public   house

licences,   i.e.,  licences  to  sell  intoxicating

liquor, are included in this scheme. We will  leave

out  the  third-class licences, otherwise you  will

get all the coffee-shops into the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the island of Bali, we are ready to

start  off, but our partners, unfortunately, are  a

bit  slow  in getting their money, their designers,

or  whatever  it is. So while we hope to  get  this

project off the ground quickly, the private  sector

is still dragging its feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shortage of cooks, the catering school,

which is now being rapidly expanded, does of course

give training in cooking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> They are being trained in the Army!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Army also trains cooks. But I doubt whether

they  will find employment in our hotels! I  always

believe that a good cook, like a painter, is  born.

You cannot train a man to be a first-class painter,

nor can you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



train a man to be a first-class cook. However, how

these  hotels  are  going to  get  cooks  is  their

business. The Government has got enough worries  of

its  own  and will not bother with the troubles  of

others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock has made a very useful

suggestion,  and  that  is that  there  must  be  a

minimum  charge of five cents, and everything  will

be  rounded off to five cents. I think we can  look

into  this in our regulations rather than spell  it

out in the Bill itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second-time"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  of  this House  are  aware  that

entry   into   Singapore  is   governed   by   the

Immigration  Ordinance, 1959, its regulations  and

orders made thereunder. These immigration laws have

proved   to     be  extremely  effective   legal

instruments  in  attaining our  main  objective  of

controlling  the  lawful  entry  of  persons   from

outside  Singapore  and  ensuring,  among   other things,  that those who arrive for the purpose  of

employment   do  not prejudice  the  employment

opportunities   of   citizens  and   other   lawful

permanent residents of Singapore who have similar  or

corresponding qualifications and skills. The laws

have, however, failed to reduce or minimise illegal

immigration into the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members of this House are also aware that

Singapore has a coastline which is about 79 miles

long and our shores are only a short distance away

from the Malaysian mainland and from the nearest of

the   neighbouring  islands.  It is  a   near

impossible  task to patrol our territorial  waters

all  the  time without incurring heavy unnecessary

expenditure  on the establishment of  an  effective

and  credible sea patrol system to prevent  illegal

immigration into Singapore. The open nature of  our

coastline  with easy accessibility  both  from  the

neighbouring Indonesian islands and from the  south

of  Johore  makes illegal entry into  Singapore  an

easy   task.   Once  in  Singapore,   the   illegal

immigrants   are  not  only  harboured   by   local

residents  and citizens but are also provided  with

employment   opportunities  in   contravention   of

prevailing immigration and other labour laws of the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full immigration control on travel between

Singapore and West Malaysia was implemented on  1st

July,  1967.  Despite this, however,  there  is  at

present  relatively free movement between  the  two

countries  but there is no exit control  to  ensure

that  those who arrive for temporary visits of  one

kind or the other leave the Republic within the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



period of the authorised visit. Owing to the social

and   economic   conditions   prevailing   in   the

neighbouring  countries, many  such  visitors  will

want  to remain in Singapore beyond the periods  of

their  authorised  stay if their  presence  remains

undetected. In addition, therefore, to  the  large

number of illegal immigrants who enter Singapore, there  are large numbers of persons on Visit Passes

who   remain  here  unlawfully.  Since  1959,   the

following  persons  have been apprehended  by  the

Immigration,  Police and Customs  Departments  for

illegal   entry   or  for  contravention   of   the

Immigration    Ordinance   or   regulations    made

thereunder:



<pre>

           Year       Number apprehended

           1959              130

           1960              360

           1961              116

           1962              140

           1963              204

           1964              436

           1965              128

           1966              854

           1967            2,640

           1968            2,980

           1969            2,593

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above figures give a rough idea of the size

of the problem but do not reveal the true position,

because there are probably thousands of others  who

have remained undetected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department is doing all it can

within the limits of its manpower and resources to

remove  illegal immigrants and those who contravene

the    immigration   laws:   There   are    obvious

difficulties in removing such immigrants  who  have

been  apprehended. For instance, there  are  people

who  claim birth in Singapore but cannot produce  a

shred  of  evidence to substantiate their claim  to

local birth. Despite that, they refuse to return to

wherever  they came from. Again, there  are  others

who  have established family ties with citizens and

residents of Singapore and, therefore, do  not  wish

to  be removed or be separated from their families.

In  the  case  of  minor  children  of  tender  age

particularly  those under 15 years of age,  removal

is all the more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



difficult because they cannot be removed to another

country  to fend for themselves, if the whereabouts

of  their parents and other near and dear ones  are

not known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill before the House is to

strengthen  the hands of the Government  to  combat

effectively the menace of illegal immigration,  and

not  only to deal a severe blow to traffickers  and

harbourers  of  illegal and prohibited  immigrants,

but also to punish those who employ such persons in

contravention of the immigration laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill introduces

the definitions of the words "employ" and "harbour"

for  purposes  of  the Immigration  Ordinance.  The

definitions   are   simple  and   will   facilitate

prosecutions  for the offence of employing  or,  as

the  case  may  be,  of harbouring  an  illegal  or

prohibited immigrant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that illegal immigrants may be severely

dealt   with,  clause  3  provides  for  a  heavier

sentence, on conviction, to imprisonment for a term

not  exceeding one year or to a fine not  exceeding

$4,000  or to both such imprisonment and fine.  The

Government  hopes that the heavier  penalties  will

have  a  deterrent  effect and  thereby  reduce  or

minimise  illegal immigration into  Singapore.  The

sentence  under  the  existing  law  is  half   the

penalties  provided for under the Bill before  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression "paragraph (a) of" appearing in

subsection  (2)  of section 15 of  the  Immigration

Ordinance is redundant as there is no paragraph (a)

in  section 60 of the said Ordinance. Clause  4  of

the  Bill,  therefore, introduces an  amendment  to

delete the above expression which is unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the explanatory statement to the Bill states

that the principal amendments are to subsection (1)

of  section  56 of the Immigration Ordinance  where

two  new  offences are created, namely, trafficking

in  prohibited or illegal immigrants and  employing

any  such immigrants. In addition, opportunity  has

been   taken  to  amend  paragraph  (a)   of   that

subsection by inserting the words "enters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



unlawfully or" and amending the existing  paragraph

(d)  of the same subsection dealing with harbouring

of   an  illegal  or  prohibited  immigrant.  These

amendments, which are proposed in clause 5  of  the

Bill,  and  the  introduction  of  the  definitions

proposed in clause 2 are, as has been stated above,

to facilitate prosecutions under these provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 of the Bill also

proposes  heavier  penalties  for  offences   under

paragraphs  (a), (b) and (d) of subsection  (1)  of

section 56 of the Ordinance. The offences under the

paragraphs  mentioned relate to entering unlawfully

or  attempting  unlawfully to enter  Singapore,  or

abetting   any   person  to  enter   Singapore   in

contravention   of   the   immigration   laws,   or

harbouring  an  illegal or a prohibited  immigrant.

The penalties which have been proposed are twice as

heavy  as  those  provided for under  the  existing

provisions and should go a long way in helping  the

Government   to   curb  illegal  immigration   into

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the new offence of employing an

illegal  or prohibited immigrant, the penalty  will

be  similar  to  that for the offence  of  unlawful

entry  or  abetment  of  such  an  offence  or  for

harbouring illegal or prohibited immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other new offence of trafficking,

however,  it  is proposed for the consideration  of

this House that the penalty imposed be imprisonment

for  a  term of two years and a fine not  exceeding

$4,000.  This  will  have  a  deterrent  effect  on

traffickers,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot agree more with the

Minister  for  Defence that our  Government  should

plug  up the loopholes in our immigration laws.  In

fact,  we should hold the Minister responsible  for

the  situation we are in today where a few thousand

illegal  immigrants are undetectable in  Singapore.

As stated by him,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



the  number  of illegal entries into  Singapore  is

increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have quarrelled with him on this

amending  Bill had he been a little far-sighted  on

the provision in regard to the legal immigrants and

the illegal immigrants. This amending Bill does not

make  a  clear distinction between the  case  of  a

legal  immigrant who comes to Singapore on a  Visit

Pass  and  who is entitled to stay only within  the

authorised  period,  and the  case  of  an  illegal

immigrant. What I find fault with this Bill is that

the  two  types of immigrants come under  the  same

provision  and  the  one with the  Visit  Pass  who

overstays receives the same penalty as the  illegal

immigrant.  In other words, if the legal  immigrant

has  overstayed  the authorised period  through  an

oversight, he could be punished by a fine of $4,000

or  two  years'  gaol  or even  both.  The  illegal

immigrant who is unfortunate to be arrested is also

subject  to  the same penalty. Hence  there  is  no

distinction   between   the   two   categories   of

immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this Bill is passed without some form of

differentiation  between the two categories,  I  am

sure  it  will attract a lot of criticism from  the

public.  I  may  have to defend  the  Minister  for

Defence  for  his short-sightedness! Of  course.  I

will  not  join with the public in criticising  the

Minister because he is my colleague. But the public

will  say  that  the Minister cannot  differentiate

between  the  legal and the illegal immigrants.  I,

therefore, sincerely urge the Minister to look into

my suggestion and make some form of differentiation

between these two categories.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to seek clarification on

the precise status of people from West Malaysia who

were  in Singapore prior to the imposition of  full

immigration control. I believe the number  of  such

people  is  very large and I am not very clear  how

they will be affected by the proposed changes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this is the first time

I  have the pleasure of expressing my thanks to the

Member  for Bras Basah for fully supporting what  I

have proposed. He says that there is no distinction

in the Bill between those who overstay in Singapore

and  those who have come in illegally. In the  eyes

of  the  law, I think a person who has stayed  here

longer  than he is permitted to is also an  illegal

immigrant.  But whether he should be  treated  more

leniently  than the man who comes in  illegally,  I

think  there is enough leeway in the law  to  allow

the  court to exercise its discretion. I have  full

confidence  in  the  ability  of  our   Judges   to

differentiate  between the severity  of  the  cases

mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> The trouble is that the Bill does not make it

clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I would be much obliged if the Member for

Bras Basah can suggest any legal phrase to make  it

clear.  We have had the Attorney-General's Chambers

and  law specialists in my Ministry working on this

Bill. I think they would be very grateful indeed if

the  Member  could  further  improve  and  make   a

distinction  between  someone  who  overstays   and

someone who has come in illegally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> You should have approached the Attorney-General's

Chambers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> For the information of Members, before a Bill is

placed  before this House, it is always  vetted  by

the Attorney-General's Chambers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Alexandra, he wants a

definition  of  the  status  of  people  from  West

Malaysia  who  were here before the  imposition  of

full  immigration control. I think the general rule

applies. If a person from West Malaysia is  staying

here  and  holds a Singapore identity card,  he  is

allowed to stay here unless he leaves Singapore, in

which case he would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



travelling on some sort of a document. If he  is  a

Malaysian  citizen, he will be  travelling  with  a

Malaysian  passport. Therefore, once he is  out  of

Singapore,  he will be treated in the same  way  as

other  visitors from outside Singapore. He will  be

given  a visitor's pass which limits the period  he

can  stay  in Singapore. I hope that clarifies  the

Member's question.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> I think the Minister has not explained all the

possible positions of people from West Malaysia.  I

do  meet  such people every Friday in the meet-the-people  sessions. There are people who  claim  that

they  came  here  prior  to  the  introduction   of

immigration  controls  but  they  carry   Malaysian

identity  cards. I wonder what kind  of  status  we

will give them under the proposed changes. It would

seem that if there is no clear-cut status given  to

them,  we cannot be certain whether they are  legal

or  illegal immigrants. We do not know what kind of

status to give to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, it is very difficult to find out when they

actually came here. It could be that they came here

after  the  immigration laws were passed  and  they

just threw away their visit passes. But I can see a

problem  here.  I  do not think we  would  be  very

severe with these cases until we go thoroughly into

the case of every individual.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this is a subject which

has great difficulties. Perhaps more thought should

be given to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, more thought will be given to it. I think

that  answers all the points raised by  Members  on

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is my intention to refer the Bill to

a Select Committee. I shall now explain the reasons

motivating the introduction of the Bill  and  deal

only with the salient provisions thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law in force relating to surveyors is

contained in the Surveyors Ordinance (Chapter 201).

This  Ordinance provides for licensed surveyors  to

survey  land  and  prepare  plans  for  provisional

registration  of  deeds in the Registry  of  Deeds.

Final  surveys  and  plans,  as  required  by  the

Registration of Deeds Ordinance (Chapter  255)  and

by the Land Titles Ordinance, 1956, have to be done

by  the  Survey Department and the plans in respect

of  these  surveys  duly  certified  by  the  Chief

Surveyor. The need for final surveys to be  carried

out by the Survey Department arose from the lacunae

in  our  law  which  did not require  surveyors  to

submit  their  survey records and  computations  to

that   Department,  nor  were  they   required   to

demarcate  the land surveyed by them with permanent

boundary marks. In the past, final surveys of  land

needed for development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



by  the private sector did not pose too much  of  a

problem. However, the intense development  of  land

over    the    past   few   years   arising    from

industrialisation  and  housing   has   imposed   a

mounting burden on the Survey Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing volume of survey work has made it

desirable for surveys of privately-owned land to be

best  left  to  licensed surveyors in  the  private

sector,  just  as  the designing  of  building  for

private  individuals and firms is generally carried

out  by  architects in private practice. This  will

thus  obviate duplication in survey work and enable

purchasers of land in the private sector to  obtain

their titles to land more expeditiously, apart from

enabling  the  Survey Department to concentrate  on

survey   works   for  Government  departments   and

bringing  up  to date litho-production  and  survey

records  which are presently unavoidably neglected.

Similarly,  surveyors attached to Statutory  Boards

by  carrying out final surveys of the Boards'  land

could  thus  enable industrialists to obtain  their

titles  expeditiously  and assist  them  to  obtain

loans  on mortgage of properties leased to them  by

the  Boards. The transfer of this function  to  the

licensed  surveyors in the private sector, however,

necessitates introduction of necessary  legislation

to  control their activities and conduct as in  the

case  of  other  professional bodies  such  as  the

architects,   accountants,   and   advocates    and

solicitors;  hence the Bill now  before  the  House

which  will  also  repeal the  out-dated  Surveyors

Ordinance (Chapter 201).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides, inter alia, for the

constitution of a Land Surveyors Board as  outlined

in clause 3 thereof and with powers -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to register any person who is not less than

21   years  of  age  and  who  is  resident   in

Singapore   as   registered   surveyor   if   he

satisfies the Board that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) immediately before the coming into operation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



of the Act he is a licensed surveyor; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) he has obtained a certificate of

competency  issued  by  the  Board   after

passing the prescribed examination; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) he has passed a professional examination

recognised  by  the Board and  has  passed

such  further  examination  and  has  such

practical   experience  in  surveying   in

Singapore as the Board may prescribe;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to refuse to register an applicant who is

not,  in  the  opinion of the  Board,  of  good

character and reputation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to order the cancellation of the registration

of    a    registered   surveyor   in   certain

circumstances; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to make rules, with the approval of the

Minister,  to give effect to the provisions  of

the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an offence under clause 17 of the Bill for

any  person  to make or cause any falsification  of

the  register  or to make any false  or  fraudulent

declaration to procure registration. Clause 18  of

the  Bill  also  forbids a  person  who  is  not  a

registered surveyor from engaging in practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A registered surveyor shall be entitled under the

provisions of clause 19 to undertake title surveys.

What is a "title survey" is defined in clause 2  of

the Bill. Where a registered surveyor is engaged on

the title survey of any land in respect of which  a

deposit  for  survey  fees  has  been  made  by  an

applicant  for  subdivision of the land  under  the

Planning  Ordinance, 1959, he  shall  be  paid  the

prescribed  fees  by the Chief Surveyor  from  such

deposit in accordance with any rules made under the

Act. This is provided for in clause 20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A novel feature of this Bill is the requirement

laid  down  in clause 21 that, on completion  of  a

title survey, the registered surveyor who signs the

plan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



thereof  shall deposit such plan together with  the

relevant field books, calculation sheets and survey

data  with  the  Survey  Department  and  all  such

documents  shall, if such plan is approved  by  the

Chief Surveyor or other officer appointed by him to

approve the same on his behalf, become the property

of  the  Government and shall be filed as permanent

survey records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 of the Bill imposes an obligation on a

registered surveyor who has prepared and signed any

assurance plan to complete the title survey of  the

land  described  in  such plan within  a  specified

period. A registered surveyor who fails to complete

the title survey within the specified period may be

liable  to  disciplinary action and the  Board  may

order  another surveyor to complete the  work.  Any

registered   surveyor  against  whom   disciplinary

action  has  been  taken by the Board,  may  appeal

against  the  decision of the  Board  to  the  High

Court. This is provided for in clause 14.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that land surveys by

registered  surveyors  are  properly  carried  out,

provision  has been made in the Bill for the  Chief

Surveyor  to approve all survey plans or  assurance

plans  prepared by them before such  plans  can  be

accepted for the purposes of registration under any

written  law.  Under clause 22, the Chief  Surveyor

may   withhold  his  approval  where   no   written

permission  for subdivision has been obtained  from

the   Competent   Authority  under   the   Planning

Ordinance,  1959. Under clause 24, he is  empowered

to  undertake  the correction of any error  arising

from  the work of any registered surveyor  and  may

recover  the  cost  of such correction  in  certain

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall the statement made in this

House  at  the  last sitting by  the  Minister  for

Finance, which outlined in some detail the need  to

revise  the  present  sewerage  fees  to  meet  the

requirement  of the World Bank for an  $18  million

loan to help finance the foreign exchange component

of the cost of our sewerage expansion projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several proposals for the revision of the

sewerage  tariff  had  been considered.  The  basic

question  was whether the proposed increase  should

be based on the number of sanitary fittings, or the

volume  of sewage and trade waste discharge,  or  a

combination of both. Eventually, it was decided  to

levy  an  additional charge of 20 cents  per  1,000

gallons  of  metered water consumed in addition  to

the  existing  fee of $2 per sanitary  fitting  per

month now being levied on domestic premises. In the

case   of  non-domestic  premises,  the  additional

charge  levied  is  50 cents per 1,000  gallons  of

metered water consumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of a flat rate means that all

registered consumers of water, including those  now

not served with modern sanitation, will have to pay

the  additional  charge.  It  is  hoped  that  some

householders will become less reluctant to  abandon

the  bucket-system if they have to  pay  a  charge,

small  as it is, for a sanitary service which  they

do  not  enjoy. And, in order to be fair  to  those

consumers  of  water  now  not  served  by   modern

sanitation,  the Public Works Department  would  be

duty-bound to extend its sewerage facilities to all

such consumers as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it now stands, subsection (1) of section 43 of

the  Local Government Integration Ordinance,  1963,

only empowers the Director of Public Works



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



to  levy a fee on one or more sanitary fittings. To

enable  Government  to give  effect  to  the  above

decision, it is necessary to amend the Ordinance in

order that the Director may also levy a fee on  the

amount of water used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last nine years some $69 million has been

spent on sewerage projects and today just over half

our  population is served by modern sanitation. The

long-term  objective of Government  is  to  provide

sewerage facilities throughout the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More money is needed as the provision of modern

sanitation  is  costly; the  proposed  revision  of

tariff  is expected to result in additional revenue

of  $4.2 million in 1970, and $4.8 million in 1972.

However,  as  pointed  out  by  the  Minister   for

Finance,  the  majority of consumers  will  not  be

required to pay more than an additional sum  of  $1

per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment Bill is directly

the result of the Ministerial statement made by the

Minister for Finance in this House on Tuesday, 23rd

December last year, in which he disclosed that  the

Government  intends  to  levy  a  sewage  fee   and

increase the charges for water consumed both in the

domestic  and  commercial sectors.  Just  now,  the

Minister  for  Law  and  National  Development,  in

moving the Second Reading of this Bill, pointed out

that  after  some consideration it was  decided  to

impose  the  increase  on all consumers  of  water,

whether they enjoy sewerage facilities or not.  You

will  remember, Sir, that many questions were asked

of  the  Minister for Finance arising  out  of  his

Ministerial statement, and the answers he gave have

thrown  some  light on the reasons  compelling  the

Government to resort to taking such measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having gone through the Ministerial statement,

Sir,  and also the answers to subsequent questions,

and the Bill, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



is  obvious  to everybody that the days of  cheaper

public  utilities are gone. In other words, nothing

is  free today. For that matter, no government  can

afford  to  pay a heavy subsidy on public utilities

without  bringing  the country to  economic  chaos.

This   has  been  so  in  several  countries  where

political issues arise out of such matters,  but  I

do  not  think  we  will fall into  this  pit.  For

example, Sir, medical facilities in Singapore  were

free  some time ago. Today charges are being levied

on those who seek them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we see the rates of water increased. In the

last  few years the rates ranging from 60 cents  to

$1.30  per 1,000 gallons have been increased to  80

cents  to  $1.50,  together  with  a  10  per  cent

Government  tax.  This  increase,  I  believe,  was

carried  out  in 1966. And even though these  extra

charges  or levies will be collected by the  Public

Utilities Board on behalf of the Government, to the

consumers they definitely mean an increase  on  the

rates  they  are  paying now. Together  with  this,

there is an extra levy of $2 per fitting per month.

This  adds up to an increase of nearly 50 per  cent

of  the  rates, as compared with the increase  over

the last few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, Sir, this increase will impose a

heavier  burden on the consumers, especially  those

in  the  lower income group, i.e., the farmers  and

labourers.  And  we  know that the  possibility  of

further  increases cannot be ruled out because  the

Minister for Finance was non-committal in his reply

to  my  question  at the sitting  on  the  23rd  of

December last. Hence I suspect that there  must  be

more valid and cogent reasons than this, and I feel

that  the  Government owes the people an answer.  I

hope it will not be failing in its duty to disclose

the  other  reasons which prompt it  to  make  such

charges  and increases. The people, I am  positive,

will be ready to accept these increased charges  if

they  fully  understand the intentions  behind  the

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot run away from the fact that water

in  Singapore  means  life  or  death  to  us.  The

majority of our people depend on pipe-water, and if

they are deprived of it, then I think hell will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



break  loose.  We all know that the Government  has

taken  pains  to ensure that water is  readily  and

easily  available. But I am arguing this  from  the

point  of  view of the extra 20 per cent charge  on

water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> 20 cents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am sorry, a 20-cent charge per 1,000 gallons.

We  know  that  water is a precious  and  priceless

commodity.  We also know that it is imported,  like

other  raw materials, and has to be treated  before

it  can  be consumed. Let me then add that  because

it is precious, it is therefore worth the price we

are asked to pay. I fully support this move, but  I

must   ask   the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development  what steps are being taken  to  ensure

that water will always be readily available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the World Bank has given us an $18

million  loan  to develop our sewerage  facilities,

may  I  ask  him what concrete plans are  afoot  to

extend sewerage facilities throughout the Republic?

Also,  what  concrete plans are in hand  to  ensure

that  by  the  early or the late  l970s  the  whole

country  and its people will enjoy modern  sewerage

facilities? Because by then no one can quibble that

he  has  to shoulder the burden of increased  water

charges   while   others  who  are  enjoying   such

facilities are not similarly charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are always people who

take   things   for  granted.  From   them   little

appreciation can be expected, except that they will

always  grumble whenever there is an imposition  of

increased  taxes  or charges. To me,  these  people

never  seem to understand, for example, that  water

has  to  be  imported and stored and  also  treated

chemically before it can be piped into their  homes

and made safe for drinking. The process involved, I

am  told, is both complicated and costly. To  these

people,  Sir, let me say this: think of  what  they

are getting, and ask themselves whether it is worth

the price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been fortunate enough to travel

outside the Republic on several occasions.  In  the

course of such tours



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



I  came  across some countries in Asia  and  Europe

where  one  cannot drink the pipe-water. Therefore,

one  has  to  buy mineral water or beer  to  quench

one's thirst. What is the difference, one may  then

ask?  The  difference is that  such  pipe-water  is

often  muddy  and  dirty and is meant  for  washing

only.  I  am also told that if one drinks from  the

tap, one gets sick because the water has never been

treated  chemically. I am sure we do not want  that

to happen to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a city state with a population of

some  8,800 persons per square mile. As this number

will increase each year, we cannot afford to and we

do  not  wish  to  have non-treated or  undrinkable

water from our taps, as is found in some countries.

Sir, I believe this situation is unwelcome not only

on  health grounds but also because we do not  wish

our  people  to quench their thirst  with  beer  or

mineral  water.  With respect, Sir,  the  situation

that  exists  in those countries could  be  due  to

certain  prevailing conditions, but we in Singapore

certainly   want  our  water  crystal   clear   and

drinkable straight from the tap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again may I reiterate that the price we will

be  paying  for  water is well worth  it.  But  the

Government must take steps to explain the  proposed

increase  in  charges,  whether  they  be  due   to

sewerage fittings, sanitary fittings, or in respect

of water consumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fully supporting this amending Bill, I

hope  the  Minister concerned will  look  into  the

problem  of supplying water to the remotest village

or  kampong  in  the Republic where well  water  is

still  being used. This is most unhygienic and  bad

for  health. During the past two years  or  so  the

Government  has  conducted  several  exercises   to

remove public standpipes. It has instead encouraged

those people relying on standpipes to connect water

to  their  homes.  Much has been achieved  in  this

respect, and, as a result, many remote villages and

kampongs have benefited. But there is still much to

be  done  in  supplying pipe-water to the  remotest

places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for a fact that many poultry and pig

farmers are today making use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



of  pipe-water in the course of their work and they

have to pay for it at the commercial rate. However,

these  farms are in the rural areas and I hope  the

Minister  for Finance will consider their case. It

is a bit unfair to these people to have to pay more

for  the water consumed when, in fact, they do  not

enjoy  sewerage  facilities. No doubt,  the  answer

given  by  the  Minister for Finance  at  the  last

sitting  of Parliament was that a line  had  to  be

drawn  somehow. However, let us hope that the  line

drawn  will  not  result in a lop-sided  tax  which

imposes a heavier burden on these farmers. I wonder

whether  the Minister for Finance will give special

consideration  to the consumers  of  water  in  the

rural areas by reducing the rate of Government tax.

After all, they do not enjoy sewerage facilities. I

am  positive  that, as citizens,  the  people  will

understand  their  responsibility  to  the   State.

However, a clear explanation must be given to them,

otherwise  they will think that in spite  of  their

poor condition the Government is being hard on them

in  making a general imposition of increased  water

charges   irrespective  of  whether  or   not   the

consumers enjoy sewerage facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, whilst once again expressing my full

support  for  this Bill, I hope the  two  Ministers

concerned will carefully consider the points I have

just now raised.



<br><br>6.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that with a

growing population resulting in an increase in  the

number   of   houses,  flats  and  factories,   the

consumption  of  water in Singapore will  increase.

When  the  water supply is low, there  is  need  to

conserve water. For this purpose, I agree  that  as

an  inducement to conserve water it is necessary to

increase the water charges. But the reason given by

the Minister is that, because of the development of

modern  sanitation, it is necessary to recover  the

increased expenditure. Hence, for this purpose, the

Minister has proposed an increase of 20 cents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



per 1,000 gallons of water for domestic use. I wish

to point out that even with the further development

of  modern  sanitation, not everyone  in  Singapore

will  be served with modern sanitation. The  people

in  the  rural districts will still not  be  served

with it for some time. It would seem that by paying

increased water charges, these people are  in  fact

paying for modern sanitation for urban dwellers.  I

am  afraid  this does not seem fair  to  the  rural

dwellers.  The Minister may argue that  the  people

enjoying modern sanitation will be using more water

because  of  the  use of water  closets  and  will,

therefore,  be paying more for their water  supply.

But the average amount of water used per day in the

water  closets in a home is negligible and  so  the

burden  of  the  increased water charges  is  still

equally  borne  by those without modern  sanitation

and those with modern sanitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to satisfy both purposes - conserving

water  and developing modern sanitation - I  propose

that part of the increased expenditure be recovered

by an increase in water charges and the rest of the

increased  expenditure be recovered  by  increasing

charges for water closets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it appears to me that the need to

increase   water  charges  has  not  been  properly

explained  to the people in general. I  would  urge

the  Minister to take steps to explain  clearly  to

the  mass  the reason behind the need  to  increase

water charges.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first take advantage of

this   opportunity  to  congratulate  you  on  your

election to the Speakership and to assure you of my

continuing regard for your office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which is under discussion now seeks to

authorise  the  Government to  levy  fees  for  the

removal  of sewage and trade effluent and  for  the

amount  of  water used on premises.  But  the  main

burden seems to be the increase in the charges  for

the  consumption of water. Water, Sir, is the  main

burden of my comment. As the Member for Punggol has

commented, water is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



extremely  precious commodity in Singapore.  I  can

recollect  that  it was not so  long  ago  when  we

experienced  the  discomfort  of  rationing,  as  a

result  of  a  rather dry spell. More recently,  of

course,  we suffered from a surfeit of water.  But,

however  much  rain  may  fall,  water  has  to  be

collected, stored, processed, treated and purified,

and the supply must be transmitted and distributed.

There  must be maintenance of these activities  and

there  must  be,  in  addition,  an  administrative

charge for the collection of rates. Obviously,  the

scale  of  expenditure involved must  be  enormous.

Just for the sake of comparison, although it is not

relevant,  before  coming into this  House  earlier

today,  I  read in a recent issue of the  Tunes  of

London  that  for  a  study of how  to  purify  the

Thames,  which  is becoming apparently  a  sort  of

massive sewage disposal channel, the cost is half a

million pounds. But coming closer home, Sir, it was

only   last   year  that  Seletar   Reservoir   was

officially   opened.  This  effective   engineering

achievement has resulted in multiplying  our  total

reservoir  capacity  by four times,  increasing  it

from   1,750  million  gallons  to  6,900   million

gallons.  I obtained the figures from the  brochure

which  the Ministry of National Development  issued

in  commemoration of the opening. But  the  Seletar

project  cost  $27 million, and we had  to  find  a

source of foreign exchange for nearly half of  this

sum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not the mere cost in terms of dollars

and  cents  that we have to consider. Let  us  note

that the water surface of Seletar Reservoir is  800

acres.  Sir,  let me ask the Minister for  National

Development  how  many  acres  of  land   have   we

reclaimed   from  the  sea.  It  is  an   odd   but

nonetheless real fact of our existence that, on the

one  hand,  we  try our best to increase  our  land

acreage  by converting sea into land, and,  on  the

other hand, in the centre of our island we have  to

convert valuable real estate into masses of  water.

Both operations cost a great deal of money. Even if

we  were to think of the operation of attempting to

change sea water into fresh water, we have to spend

even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



more, if at all this were commercially feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this should indicate that water is an

expensive (besides being a precious) commodity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look at the question from another angle: water

in   its  original  form  would  not  be  safe  for

drinking.   There  are  all  sorts  of  pollutional

elements  in water. The effect of contamination  is

to  add  all  sorts of micro-organisms,  add  algae

bacteria  and  so  on, as well  as  colour,  taste,

smell,  alkalinity, turbidity and poison to  water.

But  the  community, on the other hand, and rightly

so, insist and should insist that water be not only

safe  to  drink, but also agreeable in  appearance,

taste  and  smell, so that it may be properly  used

for  domestic and other purposes. At the same time,

water  must contain substances that should  prevent

it  from being corrosive to metals, and indeed that

it  should contribute to the dental health  of  our

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demand for water, with all the desirable

qualities  I referred to, has to take into  account

the   capital,  labour  and  skill  that  go   into

converting water in an undrinkable state  to  water

in its eminently potable form that emerges from our

taps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, as the Member for Punggol has also

pointed out, when we open the tap for water we  may

immediately receive it in a glass to drink at once.

Let  us remember that there are places where to  do

this  would be very hazardous indeed. When  I  note

how  efficiently we are served with water,  hot  or

cold,  I  remember  that such  efficiency  may  not

necessarily characterise supply in other countries.

I  remember  an  instance when  I  was  visiting  a

certain  country and I had occasion either to  turn

on the tap or the electric switch. What I turned on

was  not quite important, but some of my colleagues

here  will  bear  me out that, as a  result  of  my

action,  water  began  to  fountain  out  in   fair

quantity from the electrical fixing on the ceiling!

Other  odd experiences I have had too, all of which

have  strengthened my healthy regard for the people

in  our  community  who  are  responsible  for  the

provision of water to our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, finally, that while we have to reserve

large  sums of money for installations like Seletar

Reservoir and that we have to charge our people for

this,  the  sooner we can make places like  Seletar

Reservoir a recreational resort for our people, the

better. Bearing in mind that the public use of  the

precincts  of  reservoirs has to be accompanied  by

safeguards  against pollution, it is  obvious  that

the  more intensive use is put to such places,  the

more  economic it will be and the more readily will

our  people  accept the burden of extra charge  for

water  utilities. I would imagine  that  the  first

reaction  to this increase in charge would  be  for

one    to    deprecate   it,   but   after   fuller

consideration, I am sure it will have  the  support

of our people.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of

this  Bill.  Before I come to the substance  of  my

speech,  perhaps I may be permitted to  comment  on

some  of the points raised by previous speakers  in

so  far  as  they  concern economic  and  financial

policy.  I am sure that my colleague, the  Minister

for  Law  and National Development, will deal  with

the other aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Back-benchers have said, and indeed have

emphasised,   that  water  is   a   very   precious

commodity. One would have thought, therefore,  that

they  would  be concerned not over the increase  in

the  price  of  water, but whether we are  charging

sufficiently  high  rates  for  such   a   precious

commodity to ensure that it is not being wasted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol says that farmers and

residents  of  rural  areas are  not  being  fairly

treated  in  this respect. They pay this additional

20  cents  per 1,000 gallons of water and  some  of

them  do  not  have sewerage facilities.  They  use

water to feed chickens and pigs. Of course, if they

do  so they must be prepared to pay the price.  But

that  is  not  my point. My point  is  this.  On  a

previous occasion I said that there must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



be  some rough justice in this. If we were to go by

the  strict rule of charging the consumer the  cost

of the water he uses, then, of course, those people

in  farms and the rural areas would not have to pay

this 20 cents extra. If we were to charge them  the

actual  cost  of bringing water to the farms,  they

might  well have to pay $1.50 for 1,000 gallons  of

water  and  not 80 cents. So farmers and others  in

the  countryside should be thankful that  they  are

getting  water  so cheaply now. I think  that  also

goes for what the Member for Anson said about water

rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to approach

this  subject from a wider viewpoint. This  is  the

entire  question of our water supplies in  relation

to  our  past, present and future needs  and,  more

particularly,  to take into account our  dependence

on  external sources for our water supplies.  Until

the Government took measures to increase the supply

and  storage  capacity on the island  of  Singapore

itself,  we  were  dependent on  our  supplies  and

storage  of water on Johore for nearly all  of  our

water requirements. Seletar Reservoir was completed

last  year, but until then Singapore produced  only

18  million  gallons a day out of the  102  million

gallons a day consumed. Therefore, more than 82 per

cent  of  our  water consumption was supplied  from

Johore.  With the completion of the Seletar scheme,

we  are  now  able  to supply 40 per  cent  of  our

requirements. This is an improvement but it is  not

enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the completion of Seletar Reservoir,

storage  capacity in Singapore was enough for  only

two  weeks' supply. With Seletar Reservoir, we  now

have  just  over  two months' supply.  This  is  an

improvement  but again it is not adequate.  So  the

Government  and  its agency, the  Public  Utilities

Board,  are  proceeding  with  further  schemes  to

increase  storage capacity and to get more  sources

of  supply  of  water from the island  itself.  The

P.U.B. has  worked  out several  schemes  in  this

respect.  They are now in the process  of  engaging

consultants    to   design   and   supervise    the

construction of two water supply and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



storage  schemes: one in the Kranji  area  and  the

other  in  the  Ulu Pandan area. Construction  will

probably  start next year and will be completed  in

1974.  By then we would increase significantly  the

percentage of local requirements, which can be  met

from supplies on the island itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hon.  Members will, without question, accept  the

proposition that we should be dependent  as  little

as  possible  on outside supplies for  so  vital  a

product as water. To do otherwise would be to  give

dangerous hostages to fortune. If they accept  this

proposition,   Members   must   also   accept   the

inevitable  consequences that  flow  from  it.  The

setting  up  of water supply and storage facilities

on  the  island itself is more costly than  getting

them  from  across the Straits of Johore.  If  this

were  not  the  case, our water engineers  in  past

decades  would have been doing what  we  are  doing

now. Already the cost of producing and distributing

water to domestic households exceeds the rate of 80

cents per 1,000 gallons which they are paying. With

the  completion of the new schemes I have mentioned

and  others,  the cost will increase. This  follows

logically. Water engineers will begin with the most

economical  projects first, which, in the  case  of

the  island  of Singapore, is the Seletar  project.

Then   they  go  on  to  more  expensive  and  less

economical  means of collecting and storing  water.

This  is  the price we have to pay for  not  giving

unnecessary hostages to fortune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present increase in water rates is to pay for

sewerage   services  which,  in  the   past,   were

subsidised  by  the  general taxpayer.  So  to  the

question  asked by the Member for Punggol to  which

he  wants  an  unequivocal answer -"Will  there  be

further  increases in water rates?" - I  say,  yes,

there will be further increases in the water rates.

So  those  who grumble at the present  increase  in

water rates should bear in mind the deeper and more

serious issues which I have outlined.



<br><br>6.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



for Finance mentioned  sewerage projects and  the  increase  in

water rates. I feel that in certain respects he  is

not  correct, because I remember that last year  he

informed us that Singapore made a lot of money as  a

result of the revaluation of the German mark. Since

we  have  made  so much money, we should  be  in  a

position to pay for this additional expenditure and

not  ask the poor people in the rural areas who are

not  enjoying sewerage facilities to pay for  this.

We  must draw a line somewhere so that we are  fair

to  all.  For instance, we can levy more  taxes  on

liquor  or  increase the income tax rate  for  rich

people.  That  will be fairer. Or  perhaps  we  can

increase the tax on cigarettes and tobacco.  It  is

not fair to make the poor people pay more for their

water  consumption,  as  they  have  to  meet   the

expenditure  incurred by their  children  on  their

maintenance,  food, clothing and  schooling.  I  am

voicing my opinion on behalf of these people and  I

request   the  Minister  to  consider  this   point

seriously.



<br><br>6.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are told that the Government

is  going  to  develop the sewerage  system  and  I

assume  from the Minister's speech that  eventually

it   will   be   on  an  island-wide  basis.   This

development will cost the Government a few  million

dollars. The money is borrowed from the World  Bank

with interest, and the people will be asked to  pay

for the cost of this development project. Singapore

will then be able to tell the world, "Look, we have

not  only  high-rise flats but also a  very  modern

water-borne sewerage system." This is very well and

laudable.   The  Government  and  the   people   of

Singapore are proud of this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody will quarrel with the Government over

this  development project if we can afford it.  But

the point is this. This huge sum of money has to be

repaid with interest. I therefore would like to ask

the  Government why we cannot postpone this project

until  we are in a position to carry it out without

having  to  get  a loan from the World  Bank.  Sir,

unless there is great urgency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



for  this  sewerage development  which  the  people

cannot  do without, I sincerely urge the Government

to  reconsider  this matter and  give  priority  to

other  projects which merit it. Assuming that  this

project is very important and the Government cannot

do  without it, why cannot the cost be met by other

forms of taxes? Though the increase of 20 cents for

1,000  gallons of water is insignificant, it  still

affects   the  lower-income  group  who  form   the

majority  of our community. I believe,  Sir,  there

are  a  thousand and one ways of raising taxes  for

this  sewerage development, as the Member  for  Ulu

Pandan has said, and the Government should lay  its

hands upon them instead of choosing to finance this

sewerage  project by increasing water charges.  For

example,  the Government can easily increase  taxes

on    entertainment,   petrol,   liquor,   tobacco,

cosmetics,  night-clubs and admission rate  to  the

Turf Club. Last but not least, the Minister for Law

and  National  Development can negotiate  with  the

Minister for Health to increase the abortion fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to raise is the

discrepancy  involved  in  the  rates  charged  for

water.  The  rate charged for domestic  consumption

has always been lower than that for commercial use.

Since  the commercial rate is increased by 50 cents

per  1,000  gallons, the domestic  rate  should  be

lower  than  20 cents because the businessmen  will

pass   the  increase  to  the  consumers.  So   the

Government  should  not adopt  the  attitude  of  a

person  who pretends that he is healthy and  chubby

by  slapping  his  own  face,  making  it  red  and

swollen,  and showing it to the people and  saying.

"Look,  I  am healthy," when, in fact, he  is  not.

Therefore,  if  we  cannot  afford  the   cost   of

financing this project, we should postpone it.



<br><br>6.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once the principle is accepted

that we pay our way, and I think Singapore accepted

it  quite  some time ago, then it is  only  logical

that the maintenance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



of  our  sewerage system has got to  be  put  on  a

rational,   self-sustaining   and   self-developing

basis. Nobody is going to come here to give us some

money  to clear our waste or to improve our  sewage

disposal system. We have just got to find the money

ourselves, whether we like it or not. The Ordinance

which  this Bill seeks to amend already empowers  a

charge  to  be made for water closets and  urinals.

What  is  sought now is a charge on  fittings  that

discharge waste into the sewerage system and on the

water that is used to convey that waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, this is only a logical

extension of the law, and the recoupment of cost of

sewerage  development. Everybody in  Singapore  who

lives  in a house connected to the sewerage  system

knows that more water is flushed into it than  from

only the water closet or the urinal. The water from

the  bathroom,  the kitchen sink, etc, is  emptied

into the sewerage system. The amendment to the  law

to  include a charge for sanitary fittings or other

fittings  which  discharge waste is therefore  fair

and  necessary. When levying such a charge,  it  is

only  logical  and  fair to take into  account  the

water   that  goes  into  the  sewers.  Hence   the

amendment Bill which seeks to impose a levy on  the

amount  of water used in houses which are connected

to the sewerage system is again logical and fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps the most appropriate time here to

touch on a subject which is a critical problem, not

only  in Singapore, but also in many parts  of  the

world.  Just because we do have an excellent system

of  potable  water, we often take other things  for

granted.  We have but a small island, and  although

our  birth-rate is slowing down, our population  is

growing.  As  more and more land  is  required  for

human  habitation, less and less land is  available

for   catchments  and  reservoirs.  Therefore,  the

problem  of  getting enough potable  water  becomes

more acute. Costs have gone up and will continue to

go  up.  This is inevitable with population  growth

and  economic development. If our only  problem  is

rising,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



costs, we should consider ourselves fortunate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are two huge pipes carrying

enormous amounts of water to us every day, if  one

of  these pipes, let alone two, were for one reason

or  another  to be unavailable, we would  be  in  a

rather  difficult position. We have, therefore,  to

think in terms of developing a larger capacity  for

domestic water resources. This will, of course,  be

costly,  but unless we intend to go without  water,

we  have no alternative but to spend the huge  sums

necessary for water works of one kind or another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do this, Sir, we should have a

rational basis to apportion the charges for use  of

water.  I support this Bill because it provides  us

with that rational basis.



<br><br>6.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill

and the proposed increase in water rates, as it  is

clear  that  the  proposed increase  is  not  being

resorted  to as an easy way to raise more  revenue,

nor   is  it  an  action  aimed  at  rectifying   a

departmental  financial deficit  brought  about  by

maladministration. I feel that the increase  should

be   viewed  in  the  wider  context  of  the  vast

expansion  programme being undertaken by the  Water

Department  with a view to ensuring that  the  high

standard  of  service  hitherto  attained  can   be

maintained  in  the  long run. Over  the  last  ten

years, our consumption of water has gone up by some

50  per  cent.  This  is a good indication  of  the

increasing  affluence of our society. With  greater

economic growth almost guaranteed, coupled with the

inevitable population growth, the increase  in  the

consumption  of water will, I feel  sure,  be  even

more dramatic in the next decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible government, it is our duty to

see  that we can, and will, in the next five or ten

years,  continue  to  be  able  to  cope  with  the

substantially increased demand for water. To ensure

this  for the future, we are now being called  upon

to pay a very small

price  in the form of a proposed increase in  water

rates.  An average household, I understand, uses  a

maximum  of  between 10,000 and 12,000  gallons  of

water  a month. In terms of dollars and cents,  the

monthly outlay of a family works out to between  $8

and  $10. The proposed increase will raise this  to

between  $10 and $12 respectively. The  difference

is  quite  insignificant indeed when one  bears  in

mind  how  precious water is. However,  there  will

always  be  grumbling  among  some  people  at  the

slightest  suggestion of an increase in  the  price

they  have  to pay for any type of public  service,

but  they may do well to make a few comparisons  to

ascertain  for  themselves what  better  things  or

services  they can purchase with $10 or $12  spread

over a period of one month. Take an average smoker.

He  spends ungrudgingly between $10 and $30 or even

more  per month on cigarettes. The Member for  Paya

Lebar  has  just  told me that he spends  something

like $100 per month on cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be argued that cigarettes give greater

satisfaction  than water. But can  anyone  honestly

say that he can live without water? I can think  of

many  more  contradictions reflecting the illogical

traditional attitude of some of our consumers,  but

I think I have made my point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me congratulate

you on your election as Speaker of this House. This

is  an  opportune moment for congratulation as,  on

the  eve  of Chinese New Year, many people will  be

wishing  one  another "Happy  New  Year".  Let  me,

therefore,  wish you a very happy term  of  office,

Mr  Speaker.  Because the Minister in  charge  has

introduced  this  amendment  Bill  which  seeks  to

impose  a  levy  on sanitary fittings  and  on  the

volume  of  sewage and trade waste  discharge,  the

people's festive spirit has been dampened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speeches made by the two Ministers, we

can   understand  clearly  the  reasons  for   this

increased taxation. It is mainly because the  World

Bank  has  loaned us $18 million for the expansion

of  our sewerage scheme, on condition that the loan

should  help  finance  only  the  foreign  exchange

component  of the sewerage project, and  also  that

the  revenue  earned  on  the  project  should   be

adequate  to cover operating expenses.  Also,  from

the  long-term point of view, it is clear that  our

water  supply  will be insufficient. Therefore,  in

the  coming  years we will have to build  two  more

reservoirs. We have built reservoirs in  the  past,

but  we will need to build two more reservoirs - one

in  Kranji and the other in Ulu Pandan - in future.

But  the explanation given for the increased  water

charges  is not justifiable. I, of course,  realise

the  large  sums of money involved in the expansion

of  sewerage services. This project will enable the

Government  to increase its revenue. The Government

will,  therefore, have to invest in something  that

will give us security, so that our economy will  he

viable.  Undoubtedly, for the sake of our long-term

interest and for the ensurance of our future  water

supply,  the  Government has to  implement  various

schemes   to  achieve  this  objective,   including

legislation against waste of pipe-water. I  believe

that  our  people  will understand the  justifiable

policy of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, the important question

is   whether  the  Government  has  considered  the

consequences  of  the increased water  charges.  We

understand  that  about 70 to 80 per  cent  of  the

people belong to the lower income group, and  their

monthly  income  averages between  $150  and  $300.

Normally  even  those with bigger  monthly  incomes

than  this do not find it easy to maintain a family

with  a few mouths to feed. For instance, just  now

the  Member  for Paya Lebar said that some  people,

like himself, spend $100 a month on cigarettes. You

can thus see that this increased charge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



will  make  the burden on the poor people  heavier.

For  those people who are now in receipt of  public

assistance,  they have not only to  maintain  their

family with this assistance, but also to meet other

expenditure.  This additional charge, as  proposed,

will   therefore  aggravate  their  problem.  Small

traders,  hawkers,  and small coffee  stall-holders

also belong to the low income group, and I hope the

Minister will give sympathetic consideration to all

these  poor  people  and  exempt  them  from   this

additional tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those in the higher income group, I agree to

the  imposition  of the increased charge  on  them,

because  they  are  getting fat salaries.  Even  an

additional  charge  of $50 or  $100  will  have  no

effect on them, as it is within their means to pay.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, our Government, being democratic

and  socialist, needs to look after the welfare and

interest  of  our people. In view  of  our  ideals,

namely,  to  tax  those who are able  to  bear  the

additional  burden of tariff, and to  exempt  those

who  are  not able to bear it, I hope the  Minister

will  reconsider imposing this proposed tariff,  so

that  all  the people will support the Government's

policy.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like all human beings, we

resist paying increased charges. But luckily we  in

Singapore  have an abundant supply of clean  water,

and  because of this, we lack appreciation of  this

precious commodity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to give the Government

authority  to levy increased charges on  water  for

the  financing  of  the sewerage system.  In  fact,

after  listening  to  the  speeches  of  both   the

Minister for Law and National Development  and  the

Minister  for Finance, I would say that the  sooner

the people of Singapore realise that water is still

relatively   cheap,  the  better  for   them.   The

imposition  of  the additional 20 cents  per  1,000

gallons  for domestic consumption and 50 cents  per

1,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



gallons  for  commercial consumption  is  only  the

beginning, because without the Minister for Finance

having to tell us about it, I think it is already a

well-known fact that the water charges will have to

be further increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, we want to extend and improve our

sewerage    system.   With   its   extension    and

improvement, more water will be needed. Since  this

is so, it goes without saying that we have to build

more   reservoirs,  which  means  that   additional

capital expenditure is required. In fact, when this

Bill  was introduced, I thought to myself that this

additional  charge  would  be  acceptable  to   the

people, because it is no longer economic to  supply

water  at  80 cents per 1,000 gallons for  domestic

consumption.  As  has already  been  indicated,  it

costs over 80 cents to produce 1,000 gallons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think over this point soberly, it is

unlikely  that the increase in the water rate  will

cause  hardship even to the lower income  group.  I

would  say  there  would be more hardship  for  the

people  if  we  were to carry on as  before  at  an

uneconomic rate, and if we do not find the finances

to  run an adequate and efficient water system  and

we  let it slide back to the point where we are not

sure whether our taps are going to give us adequate

water  for  bathing and cooking. On that  basis,  I

think  it is might and proper to impose this little

additional  increase in charges now to ensure  that

we  continue  to enjoy an efficient  water  system,

adequate for our people now and in the future.



<br><br>6.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have taken more time than

anticipated, but it goes to show the great interest

Members of this House have in matters which  affect

their constituents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have expressed grave concern for

the  poorer  section of our community. Though  they

have  given  their blessing to this proposal,  they

have criticised it on the ground that this is a tax

on the poor, and that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



we  should  be taxing the rich. But let me  correct

any  misapprehensions on this  matter.  It  is  the

Minister  for  Finance  who  deals  with  financial

matters, and he has given his explanation. But  let

me  reiterate that this new tax will only  mean  an

extra  $1 per month for the poorer section  of  the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind Members again that in respect of

the  tax on Public Utilities Board bills, there  is

an  exemption for the poorer section -  no  tax  is

payable if the P.U.B. bill does not exceed $10.  As

a  result  of  the imposition of this  extra  $1  a

month, certain P.U.B. bills will go up. In order to

spare the consumer who previously paid $10 and will

have  to pay a little more now from having  to  pay

another  tax on his bill, the exemption of  tax  on

bills   has  been  increased  from  $10   to   $15.

Therefore,  the Government is as concerned  as  all

Members  are  with  the  poorer  section   of   our

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also correct one other misapprehension.

Some  Members  say that this new measure  will  hit

people  in  the rural areas, as it is in the  rural

areas  that  the poorer people live. I disagree.  I

think  there  are  more poor people  in  the  urban

areas, especially in the middle of Chinatown,  than

there  are in Sembawang, Punggol and Jurong.  I  am

not  saying that the farmers live on the fat of the

land,  but  they are better off than the people  in

many  sections of Chinatown, for instance.  And  in

case  Members  think  that the  Government  is  not

looking  after the poor people, who do  they  think

are  living in the Housing Board flats? One-quarter

of  our population are housed in flats built by the

Housing and Development Board. These one-room, two-room,  three-room and four-room flats are  occupied

by the poorer sections of the community. The richer

people  do not qualify to live in these flats.  And

let  me  remind Members again that all these  flats

are  served by modern sanitation. So the imposition

of this tax is not as unjust as they think it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst dealing with the financial and economic

aspects of the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



measures,  the  Minister for Finance  gave  Members

details  of  the  proposed water  projects  on  the

island. I need not add to that except that  I  must

remind  Members  again that the last  time  we  had

water  rationing in Singapore was  in  1963.  Since

then we have been all right. At that time Singapore

consumed 60 million gallons of water per day. Today

Singapore consumes more than 100 million gallons of

water per day. This is a 40 per cent increase in  a

period of six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take Members back to modern sanitation. In

the  year 1949 the population was one million  with

one-quarter  of them served with modern sanitation.

Twenty  years  have gone by. In the year  1969  the

population was two million. Half the population was

served  by  modern sanitation. I have informed  the

Member  for Bukit Panjang, in answer to one of  his

questions,  that it is the long-term  objective  of

the   Government   to  provide  modern   sanitation

throughout  the island. I do not think  any  Member

here  will  disagree with me that this  is  a  good

objective. But when we can reach this objective  is

not  certain  in the sense that I cannot  name  the

year, that is, whether it will be in early 1970  or

late  1970, as the Member for Punggol wants  me  to

say.  All  I can say is that, looking at  our  past

records, perhaps in 15 years' time we might be able

to  serve 95 per cent of our population with modern

sanitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked just now what projects we

have  for modern sanitation. Members will know that

we have two main sewage disposal plants, one at Kim

Chuan  Road  in  Paya  Lebar,  which  is  near  the

Airport, and the other in Ulu Pandan. We propose to

build two more sewage disposal plants, one at  Kaki

Bukit  to  serve  the  areas in  the  vicinity  and

extending  to  Changi, and the other in  Jurong  to

serve that vicinity and, in particular, the rapidly

expanding industrial estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has asked, why should

we have modern



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



sanitation  when we cannot afford it  and  have  to

borrow  money  and pay interest on it?  You  cannot

borrow money unless you pay interest. Do we want to

advance or do we not? Are we to rely on the  bucket

system forever?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Advance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Should we not look ahead to some date not too far

away  when,  if  not  all, at  least  most  of  our

population  will  have  the  benefits   of   modern

sanitation? To keep the Member for Bras Basah happy --



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Get the money first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I hope when the Minister for Finance is preparing

his  budget,  he will take the Member's  advice  to

heart as to the method of taxing and raising money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should give the House some figures of

the amount of water that passes through the sewers.

I  think it was the Member for Anson who said  that

very little water was used for the sewerage system.

Of  the  total  daily consumption  of  100  million

gallons  of  water, or a little  more,  42  million

gallons  are used for domestic purposes; 21 million

gallons  for  industrial and  commercial  purposes,

including  the  ships  in our harbour;  29  million

gallons  by  the Government, Statutory Boards,  the

Armed  Forces and public standpipes. Eight  million

gallons  of  water a day are lost in  distribution.

Sixty  per  cent  of  the domestic  consumption  or

approximately 25 million gallons a day go down  the

sewers. This is the domestic user. Twenty per  cent

of  the water consumed by industrial and commercial

users and Government and Statutory Board users,  or

approximately 10 million gallons of water, go  down

the  sewers  that way. So in all, out  of  the  100

million  gallons  of water we use daily,  about  35

million  gallons of water go down the sewers.  This

is not a negligible amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, may I just say

that  the  Minister for Finance made a  Ministerial

statement last December explaining this proposal. I

have given added reasons for it today



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



and he has come again to explain this matter to

Members. If Members cannot understand it, neither

can their constituents. I hope Members will go

round their constituencies and explain the

situation, and if some of them are still not

satisfied, then it is the Members' duty to try to

satisfy them with a reasonable explanation. We

hope we ourselves have done our best.
