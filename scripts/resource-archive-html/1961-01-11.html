<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  a  few  days  ago  a  handful   of

desperadoes, from the basest of motives, managed to

create among the Malay public an atmosphere of fear

and  tension  with a view to precipitating  clashes

between Malays and Chinese on 6th January. But  for

the  speedy action taken by the Government with the

active assistance of members of the Muslim Advisory

Board,  Malay P.A.P. Assemblymen, U.M.N.O. leaders

and Malay religious leaders, 6th January might have

turned  out to be a day of terror and mourning  for

many of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vast majority of the non-Malay public was

unaware  of the mood of tension and fear  that  had

been built up among the Malays, it was because  the

Government,   with  the  help  of  Malay   leaders,

succeeded   in  preventing  these  anxieties   from

spreading among the non-Malays as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the danger has passed, we feel it our

duty  to tell the people of Singapore about  how  a

handful of desperadoes plotted death for Malays and

Chinese alike.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plot began on 14th December, 1960, with a

meeting  in  Changi  of a body calling  itself  the

Angkatan   Revolusi  Tentera  Islam  Singapura   or

A.R.T.I.S. for short. The leader of this group  was

a   man  called  Abdul  Ghani  Bin  Hassan.  It  is

worthwhile  noting  that he had been  sentenced  in

1949 to six years' imprisonment for robbery (though

he only served three years). He was sentenced again

in 1951 for two years for theft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting was ostensibly called to discuss

Malay  rights,  but a pamphlet distributed  at  the

meeting  made  it  clear that A.R.T.I.S. had  more

sinister motives - to provoke shedding of blood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, quote a few passages from this

inflammatory pamphlet:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This pamphlet is directed to my own race, the

Malays,  who  are  now fighting  to  realise  their

aspirations   and  rights - Singapore's  independence

that is untamed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the uncontrollable elements of the weather

in  the high seas, to be followed later by a  calm,

so   will   our  fighting  spirit  finally   emerge

triumphant.'



<br><br>It goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`History teaches us that the aims and aspirations

for  the race and country are achieved through  the

sacrifice of lives and property.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is reprehensible about this pamphlet is not

that  it  protests  against the  real  or  imagined

grievances  of  the  Malays. There  is  room  in  a

democratic  country  for protest  over  grievances,

whether real or imagined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is dangerous and unforgivable is the

incitement to violence and hatred. Anyone,  whether

Malay  or Chinese or Indian, who, in a multi-racial

society, glorifies violence and preaches hatred and

uses them as political fuel inevitably prepares the

ground for racial carnage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fortunately these exhortations to violence

alarmed many of the Malays who were present at  the

meeting and they did not therefore respond  to  the

appeals   of  leaders  of  A.R.T.I.S.  So   nothing

happened for a few days after this meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on Christmas Day, rumours began circulating

to  the  effect that Malays would assemble  on  6th

January to protest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



against  the  P.A.P.  Government's   alleged

neglect of Malay interests and alleged favouring of

Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These and other rumours gained circulation very

rapidly  among the Malays. One of the  rumours  was

that  the  Malays would march to the Istana  Negara

and  that  any attempt by Government  to  stop  the

procession would be answered by rioting. The Malays

were also told to prepare for an alleged attack  on

them by Chinese on 6th January, which was a Friday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 28th December, a new rumour was added - that a

Malay member of the Singapore Work Brigade had been

murdered.   This  was  a  complete  lie   but   the

fabricators   of  this  and  other   rumours   were

deliberately out to create an atmosphere  of  panic

among the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on 31st December, the Police raided a house at

Fernhill  Road and seized a quantity of  stencilled

posters.  The posters were inflammatory in language

and  talked of violence and revolution if Singapore

were  not  returned  to  the  Malays.  These

anti-Government posters were scheduled to appear on  3rd

January, as a prelude to racial disturbances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posters were issued under the name of

A.R.T.I.S. and so on the morning of  1st  January,

the  Police  arrested its president,  Abdul  Ghani.

Under  interrogation, he made a  number  of  useful

disclosures  and admitted that he  had  a  hand  in

preparing  the posters. He also revealed  plans  by

A.R.T.I.S. for engineering armed violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 3rd January, there was widespread fear,

largely  induced  by false rumours  spread  by  the

plotters, of racial disturbances in Malay areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In between spreading these vicious and dangerous

rumours calculated to bring about the loss of Malay

as  well as Chinese lives, the plotters decided  to

make  some money out of the anxiety they had caused

to  their  own  people.  So  one  of  the  plotters

contacted  a  bomoh. While spreading rumours  about

impending  racial clash, the plotter also  informed

his   victims  that  "invulnerability"  charms  and

shirts could be bought for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



a  price from the bomoh. The bomoh is said to  have

done well selling invulnerability charms and shirts

for  as  much  as $15 apiece. Three Malays  wearing

these  shirts were found in the house and  detained

by  the Police but the bomoh unfortunately vanished

before the Police appeared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of these plotters toured various

kampongs spreading false rumours that fighting  had

broken out between Chinese and Malays and that  the

Malays  should stand in readiness for  6th  January

when widespread racial clashes were to be expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of 5th January, the Police seized

copies of a Malay magazine just before they were to

be  distributed. This magazine carried an editorial

unjustly  accusing the Government of provoking  and

hurting the feelings of Singapore Muslims.  It  was

also learnt that the proprietor of the magazine had

intentions of making a statement on the subject  at

Sultan Mosque after mid-day prayers on 6th January.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not suggested that the proprietor was

in any way connected with the A.R.T.I.S. group. The

appearance  of this editorial may have  been  sheer

coincidence. But in view of the prevailing  air  of

tension  among the Malays and in view of  the  fact

that  according to rumours Sultan Mosque  had  been

selected  by the plotters as the spot to spark  off

clashes, it became necessary for the Government  to

prevent circulation of the magazine and request the

proprietor not to make a statement at the mosque.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on the morning of 6th January, the Police

discovered in an unoccupied hut, seven jungle green

uniforms  with  shoulder  badges  bearing  a  white

crescent and star on a green background.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police also discovered four flags with Arabic

inscriptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 4th and 5th January, rumours about an

impending  racial clash on 6th January  had  gained

wide  currency among the Malay public. Fortunately,

the  non-Malay public knew little or nothing  about

these  rumours  or  else the air  of  tension  and.

anxiety might have spread to the non-Malays as well

and thus created an extremely ugly situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be asked, why then did 6th January

pass off peacefully?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the Police acted swiftly. They

arrested  a  number of the plotters.  To  date,  15

persons  have  been  detained  in  connection  with

A.R.T.I.S.  This  organisation was fortunately  not

large  or influential and these timely arrests  put

it out of action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important factor was the wholehearted

assistance  given  by  Malay religious,  civic  and

political leaders in helping to combat the  vicious

rumours  that the plotters had deliberately spread.

Representatives of the Muslim Advisory Board, Malay

P.A.P.  Assemblymen and leaders of U.M.N.O. issued

warnings telling their brother - Malays not  to  heed

the   mischievous  lies  of  the  plotters.   These

warnings  were broadcast over the Malay section  of

Radio Singapore throughout the night of 5th January

and 6th January morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also sent out field units equipped

with  loudspeakers  to broadcast  the  messages  of

Malay leaders in Malay areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay leaders also approached leaders of mosques

requesting them to be on the look-out for  mischief

makers  and  to  counter  dangerous  rumours.  This

assistance by Malay religious and political leaders

did a great deal to neutralise the mischief created

by the plotters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason was that these rumours, though

they  created anxiety among the Malays,  roused  no

Malay   animosity   against  the   non-Malays,   in

particular, against the Chinese. The fear  was  not

that  the Chinese would attack the Malays,  as  the

plotters had said they would, but that the plotters

would  stage  a  small incident which  might  panic

people into racial clash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was to prevent such an accidental sparking off

of  racial  clashes that the Government thought  it

prudent  not to draw the attention of the non-Malay

public to what was happening. A sudden announcement

about  it a few days before 6th January might  have

alarmed  the  non-Malay public who, by  and  large,

were  unaware of the rumours and fears  circulating

among large numbers of Malays.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



An  island-wide mood of anxiety and fear could have

provided the plotters with greater opportunities to

start trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most important reason was that the

Malays,  though  anxious, behaved sensibly  by  not

saying or doing anything to provoke conflict.  This

as  much  as anything else ensured that 6th January

passed off without incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that A.R.T.I.S. has been broken up and the

mood  of  anxiety and fear has subsided, it  is  as

well to reflect calmly on what had taken place  and

why it took place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to note is that a handful of

desperadoes,  without any following  or  influence,

were  able  to inculcate in hundreds  of  people  a

dangerous mood of anxiety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should frankly recognise the reasons for this.

The  Malays are deeply conscious of the  fact  that

they  are  a  minority in Singapore. This  minority

complex  feeds on the fact that there  is  economic

distress among the Malays. Of course, the truth  is

that  economic  distress is not  confined  only  to

Malays.  If  there are poor and unemployed  Malays,

there   are  many  poor  and  unemployed   Chinese,

Indians, and other non-Malays as well. It is not  a

question  of solving just Malay poverty or  Chinese

poverty  or Indian poverty, but poverty in general.

It is economically impossible, in a complex society

like  ours,  to solve poverty in terms of  this  or

that race. However, the unsophisticated Malay, like

the  unsophisticated Chinese or  Indian,  does  not

understand  the  complex nature of the  problem  of

poverty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the racialist plotters

tried  to work on the economic discontents  of  the

Malays,  in  particular, unemployed  Malay  youths.

Their  propaganda claimed that the  Government  was

favouring the Chinese at the expense of the Malays.

This  was  completely  false, but  same  unemployed

Malay youths may be ready to believe such false and

dangerous propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's attempts to solve the Nanyang

University issue was again deliberately,  distorted

by  the  plotters to mean that the  Government  was

favouring Chinese education by offering equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



financial aid to Nanyang; that it favoured  Chinese

when  it  offered  to take Nanyang  graduates  into

Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are, of course, completely distorted

and  mischievous  interpretations  of  Government's

actions and intentions, but we should not be  blind

to  the possible effect such propaganda can have on

unemployed Malays or on a minority community  in  a

society  which has not yet learnt to think and  act

nationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a political atmosphere it is necessary

for  all  of us - Malays, Chinese and Indians - not  to

say  and  do  things which might create  fears  and

suspicions,   which   reckless   opportunists   and

plotters  can  exploit with a view to sparking  off

racial  conflict. We must never  forget  how  in  a

multi-racial society there is always the danger  of

racial  explosion being sparked off by even trivial

acts  of  stupidity and miscalculation, in addition

to  deliberate acts of provocation. It is timely to

draw  attention  to the lunatics in  the  non-Malay

world  who are saying and doing stupid things which

could, if unfettered, explode in racial violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are non-Malays who, in the name of

revolution or culture or education, are saying  and

doing things which, whether they intend it or  not,

are  increasing  the anxiety of the Malay  minority

and  thus making them ready prey for reckless Malay

demagogues like those who organised A.R.T.I.S.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, give an illustration of this sort of

lunancy. Yesterday, that is Tuesday, the Government

banned  a  locally  produced Chinese  book  called,

"Wind  and  Rain in Rubber Estates". It is  a  long

poem  purporting to deal with the life  of  Chinese

rubber  tappers in the Federation.  It  is  a  well

written  and, for the most part, a sensitive  piece

of literature written with great feeling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, for all its poetic language and

feeling  the intent of the poem is not unlike  that

of  the  manifesto of the A.R.T.I.S. group which  I

quoted earlier. Like the A.R.T.I.S. manifesto, this

poem  glorifies  violence and inspires  hatred.  It

endorses   hatred  and  violence   as   justifiable

political fuels and bases for political action. The

eventual result of poems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



like this must be to build up an atmosphere of fear

and hatred to be consummated in racial violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poem after recounting the hardship and

exploitation  of  rubber  workers,   which   is   a

legitimate  theme for any poem,  then  goes  on  to

describe  the  deliberate shooting  of  a  pregnant

Chinese woman tapper by Security Forces during  the

Emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote a few extracts to show how the

poem exploits hatred with a view to inciting people

to   revolutionary  violence.  I  quote,  Sir.  One

passage reads like this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The rubber workers

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift the companion covered in blood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! She is a pregnant woman.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-spattered body

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soaked clothing

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been torn into shreds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain and the dark red blood mingling

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow like a spring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! A pitiful woman.'



<br><br>Then the poem goes on to describe the plight of her

children, left uncared for as a result of the

killing. The poem then says this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The hearts of rubber workers can no longer be

calm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow, hatred fill their hearts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gloomy sky

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blows the angry wind

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy rubber estate is filled with thick

mist

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, how gloomy and cold is the great earth!'



<br><br>Then  towards the end of the poem, the clarion call

is  sounded for revolutionary violence. This is how

the  passage  reads - after the pregnant  woman  has

been  murdered,  the  tappers carry  the  body  for

viewing by the other estate tappers:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They open wide both eyes,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hold tightly their tapping knives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, the tapping knives!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they flashed the light of hatred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, eyes!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if arrows of vengeance follow the sound of

rubber-buckets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of rubber buckets

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is no longer a fearful sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of rubber buckets

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compels them to run to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road of life and death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carry the flashing knives

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to fight

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, ready to fight...



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They run over many slopes

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping on the bloodstained little path.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They run towards the terrible sound of

rubber-buckets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They run towards the path of battle!'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Sir, the "sound of rubber buckets" is

the  poetic  symbol for rifle fire. The  poem  then

goes on to describe how the enraged rubber tappers,

armed  with tapping knives, rush to join the  armed

Communist  forces presumably engaging the  Security

Forces who had killed the woman tapper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this dangerous and mischievous

poem came to the notice of Government when students

of  a  Chinese  school applied  for  permission  to

dramatise this poem for performance at a concert to

be  held  on  the 27th of last month.  The  student

organisers  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of   Home

Affairs   a   synopsis  of  this  poem  which   was

deliberately misleading. The synopsis merely  said,

and  I  quote  from  the synopsis,  that  the  item

"eulogises   the  mountains  and  rivers   of   the

motherland,  particularly the sturdy robust  rubber

plantations.... This work also describes  the  life

of  rubber  tappers  who keep company  with  rubber

estates  while running on the plain wielding  their

tapping knives.... They use their tapping knives to

allow that snow-white latex to flow slowly...." You

can  see Sir, from the extracts of the poem that  I

have  read  that  the synopsis was  completely  and

deliberately  misleading. And because  this  was  a

completely  misleading account  of  the  poem,  the

Government  in  all  good faith was  deceived  into

approving this mischievous play or poem.  The  true

nature  of  the poem came to light when, just  four

days  before the concert, the organisers  submitted

to  the  school  principal  galley  proofs  of  the

programme  to be sold at the concert. The programme

was  almost wholly devoted to long comments on  the

play.  Thousands of copies of the programme  had

been  printed for sale without the approval of  the

principal..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government's attention was drawn to the

real nature of this poetic drama and the programme,

it  told the organisers that they could not perform

the drama or distribute the programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



They  were  told that if they had not deceived  the

Government  by  providing a  completely  misleading

account  of  the  poem-drama, they  need  not  have

incurred the expense and labour of rehearsing  this

item and printing the special programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the concert, that is, 27th

December, the organisers announced to the assembled

audience  that  because  of Government  action  the

announced play could not be performed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some undesirable and irresponsible elements

exploited  the  situation by  suggesting  that  the

Government  had  been  unreasonable,  that  it  was

stifling  the  free  development  of  culture   and

repressing creative expression by local artists. So

hundreds of people present at the concert left with

the impression that the Government had unreasonably

repressed progressive Chinese culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider what would have been the effect

on our relations with the Federation Government and

on all right-thinking people had poems of this sort

advocating  revolutionary violence and  hatred  and

praising  the  violence  of the  Malayan  Communist

Party   been  allowed  to  be  performed  for   the

edification  of  school  children  and  a   Chinese

audience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what would have been the effect on our Malay

brothers  who fear Communism and who are from  time

to time told by Malay communalists that Chinese are

working for the victory of Chinese Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, though the poem was ostensibly

revolutionary in intent, its presentation was  such

as   to   excite   racial  animosity   among   less

sophisticated  people. The  woman  tapper  who  was

killed  was a Chinese. A large majority of  members

of the Security Forces are Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this poem and poems of a similar

nature  would  have been, wittingly or unwittingly,

to gradually bring the two major races to the brink

of racial conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know who were the reckless adventurers

who   prevailed   upon  these   misguided   student

organisers to stage this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



inflammatory  play.  What  would  have   been   the

consequences  had  these adventurers  succeeded  in

getting  this play performed at Badminton  Hall  on

the night of 27th December?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result would have been that on 27th December

the  feelings  of hundreds of unsuspecting  Chinese

would  have  been worked up at the  Badminton  Hall

even  as on the same night racialists toured  Malay

areas trying to work up fear and hatred against the

Chinese.  One group would have worked  up  sympathy

for  violence and hatred in the name of revolution,

while  the  other  would  have  worked  up  similar

emotions in the name of racialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each by different routes would have reached the

same  goal - that is, racial conflict. This  must  be

the  inevitable  outcome  in  Malaya  of  political

action  based  on  glorification  of  violence  and

hatred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has repeatedly warned that in a

multi-racial society all efforts to direct politics

on  the  basis of revolutionary violence and hatred

must eventually lead to racial conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, this poem repeats the clarion call

made  by the plotters of A.R.T.I.S. Let me  repeat

the  message  of A.R.T.I.S. to contrast  with  the

message  put  forward by the poem. The  A.R.T.I.S.

manifesto says-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the uncontrollable elements of the weather

in  the  high seas to be followed later by calm  so

will  our fighting spirit finally emerge triumphant

for the Malay race in Singapore and mark as a final

seal to our struggle".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History teaches us that the aims and aspirations

of  race  and  country  are  achieved  through  the

sacrifice of lives and property."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is both the same glorification of violence

and  appeal  to  hatred in both the  poem  and  the

A.R.T.I.S. manifesto. One makes the clarion  call,

as  I said, Sir, in the name of Communism, and  the

other in the name of racialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a Malayan situation the end-result of

these  two sorts of lunacy would be racial carnage.

It  is  the ordinary people who, by and large,  are

the victims in such racial conflicts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call upon all peoples - Malays, Chinese,

Indians - all loyal and patriotic Malayans to  resist

these  two  lunacies. To allow  ourselves  to  come

under  the  influence of either of the two  lunatic

groups is to open wide the gates to the horrors  of

racial civil war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events I have described earlier should remind

all right-thinking citizens of how easy it is for a

handful of irresponsible men to bring this city  to

the  brink  of  racial tension  just  by  spreading

unfounded rumours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs but a spark to set off the explosion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our advice is: Do not listen to rumours which

speak of impending racial conflicts. They are false

rumours  started by irresponsible elements  who  do

not  care  about the welfare of any race. All  that

these  dangerous  men hope for is  to  make  a  few

dollars or advance their personal glory out of  the

slaughter of innocent people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By repeating such rumours people would only be

playing  into the hands of irresponsible  elements.

People  would be unwittingly helping to create  the

atmosphere   of  tension  and  fear   which   these

dangerous men want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people hear such rumours of racial clashes or

stories  calculated to foment hatred between  races

they should not pass them on. They should tell  the

police  about it, or their Assemblymen or community

leaders, so that action can be taken in time to nip

in the bud such dangerous plots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most of all, let us remember that we live in

a  mixed  community where old suspicions and  fears

have  not  been completely eradicated. As  long  as

this is the case, the danger of communalism exists.

It   is   like  a  wild  and  hungry  beast  pacing

impatiently behind the bars of a cage. We who  bear

no hatred against races and creeds intend that this

wild  beast  remains locked in  its  cage  so  that

eventually it will waste away and die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if any lunatic tries to unlock the cage and

let  the  beast  loose, then  we  should  stop  the

lunatic before he gets anywhere near the cage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of racial peace, Sir, is eternal

vigilance - vigilance against the lunatics who  think

they   can   make  use  of  this  wild   beast   of

communalism. The truth is that it will destroy  the

lunatic as well as the innocent people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, therefore, never allow ourselves to be

fooled  by the lunatics out to let loose  the  wild

beast of racialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our hopes of a happy and prosperous Malaya

depend   upon  our  being  able  to  preserve   the

harmonious relations that have existed between  the

races  for  generations. If that  peace  should  be

shattered,  wittingly  or  unwittingly,  then  that

would  be  the beginning of decades of  horror  and

carnage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this Government has never ceased to

reiterate   the  urgency  of  creating  a   Malayan

nationalism  and  outlook at the earliest  possible

moment. Without this sense of Malayan identity, our

many  races  remain  exposed at  any  time  to  the

blandishments of reckless racialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a sense of responsibility and fear of the

terrible  consequences  of  racial  conflict   have

inhibited  the vast majority of people from  saying

or  doing  anything calculated to spark off  racial

conflagration, we would like to warn the people  of

Singapore  against a minority of reckless  lunatics

who  want  to  see a clash between  the  races,  in

particular, the Malays and Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we want to tell the people of

Singapore  about  the activities of  this  reckless

minority so that they may be on guard against these

dangerous and despicable men and not be taken in by

their lies and deceit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of us, because we are by nature

peaceful  and  law-abiding, may refuse  to  believe

that   anything   could  happen  to   disrupt   the

harmonious   relations  which  have   existed   for

generations  between  the  various  races.  But  as

recent  events  have shown, it is  possible  for  a

handful of evil and reckless adventurers to create,

almost overnight, an atmosphere of fear and anxiety

which could lead to racial carnage.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>Statement by the Minister for Home Affairs</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the statement by the

Minister for Culture should be a reminder to us all

of the delicate nature of the communal problem. For

the   Government,  trying  to  solve  the  communal

problem, is like walking on a knife's edge. In  its

efforts  to  develop a Malayan outlook and  Malayan

loyalty,  it has to meet the subtle and underground

propaganda  of the Chinese chauvinist,  the  Indian

communalist and the Malay racialist. If it tries to

assist  the Malays, the Chinese chauvinist  depicts

such  action  as  pro-Malay and  anti-Chinese.  Any

action  to help the Chinese is presented by  Malay

racialists as pro-Chinese and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Government is not pro-Chinese, pro-Malay

or pro any particular race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is first and last pro-Malayan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a pro-Malayan policy, as it becomes more effective, will

meet  with  the  hostility of all communalists  who

have  a political vested interest in racialism.  In

an effort to combat the growth of a Malayan outlook

the communalists may, with increasing recklessness,

try to fan the flames of racialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to deal with such elements. We

will deal with them firmly and vigorously as we did

with  the  organisers of A.R.T.I.S. and with  those

who  tried  to perform a mischievous  play  at  the

Badminton Hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A.R.T.I.S. plot was smashed and the people of

Singapore  were spared the terror of  racial  riots

because of the vigilance and determination  of  our

police force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our police have proved that they are ready to

deal  with  any plot by any race to disturb  racial

harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with the A.R.T.I.S. plotters, the

police had an extremely difficult and delicate task

to  perform. Most of the plotting was in secret. To

have  taken action too soon would have resulted  in

our not knowing the extent and ramifications of the

plot.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the police had to take action without

unduly  alarming the non-Malay population who,  for

the most part, were unaware of what was going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out, the police carried out their

operation smoothly and effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the tragedy communal conflict could

bring  to  all  races,  let me  state  here,  quite

categorically,   that  the  Government   will   not

hesitate  to  act swiftly to detain and  neutralise

plotters out to create racial strife.

Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Yang

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been drafted in pursuance of the

People's   Action   Party's  programme   on   Rural

Development as outlined in "The Tasks Ahead",  Part

2, page 33. Therein we stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We shall take the requisite powers to grant long

term leases to squatter farmers on lands which they

now  occupy  and on farming lands which are  either

uncultivated  or  which are being cultivated  on  a

mere  maintenance  basis  with  a  view  to  future

speculation. Under these arrangements rents due  on

such  leases which farmers can afford will be  paid

to the owners and it shall be made a condition that

no  such  lands  may be alienated to persons  other

than farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of all agricultural lands at present

in  the  occupation of squatter farmers which  have

been  zoned  in  the  Master  Plan  as  sites   for

satellite  towns  or  potential industrial  estates

will be reviewed and the fullest consideration will

be  given  to the representation of the members  of

the farming community before any decisions are made

as  to the future use to which such lands shall  be

put.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill recognises the position of farmers

in  our  society and aims at giving them a  greater

security  of tenure, and helping them to  make  the

best  use  of our available agricultural  land.  By

providing   these   necessary   preconditions    of

certainty  and  stability,  a  more  intensive  and

scientific  cultivation of agricultural  land  will

result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill creates statutory rights of an

exceptional character and directly interferes  with

the   ordinary  rights  of  private  ownership   of

property  by  giving special treatment to  farmers.

However, such inroads into the original concept  of

the  sanctity of private ownership of property  are

inevitable  in  our  society.  The  State  has   to

reconcile - in  this  particular  case - the  competing

needs   of  different  sections  of  the  community

between  farmers  and landowners, and  between  the

competing  demands for growing foodstuffs,  or  for

industrial, housing and other purposes in the  uses

of  land.  It is our intention to refer  both  this

Bill   and  the  complementary  Control   of   Rent

(Amendment  No. 3) Bill to a Select  Committee  for

careful   study,   and   to  enable   the   people,

particularly   landlords  and   farmers   who   are

affected, an opportunity to make representations on

them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With land to meet our requirements strictly

limited, it is essential that all available land be

put  to the most economic use. The Master Plan  has

set  aside approximately 18.5 per cent of the total

area  of  the  Island for agricultural purposes.  A

total  area of approximately 38.8 square miles  out

of  a total of 209.5 square miles (not counting the

areas  subject  to tidal waters) is  zoned  off  as

"agricultural" in the Master Plan. The 1958 Revised

Land  Use  Survey showed that out of this  area  of

38.8  square miles, approximately only half  (about

19.4  square miles) was being used for agriculture.

It  is  clear therefore that not all the lands  set

aside  for  agriculture have been put to  full  and

intensive use. Encouragement and assistance by  way

of granting security of tenure as well as by active

assistance by the Primary Production Department  in

technical  and  scientific advice can  improve  the

position of our farmers and increase the supply  of

pigs,  poultry and vegetables for the people  as  a

whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two Bills, the Control of Rent (Amendment

No.  3)  Bill, which I shall be moving  after  this

Bill,  together  with  this  one,  will  provide  a

positive  protection for farmers which was  lacking

hitherto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Agricultural

Leases   Bill  is  a  logical  follow-up   to   the

intentions  of  the Master Plan,  as  it  seeks  to

provide  the  farmers within the agricultural  zone

the  necessary  security  of  tenure  to  encourage

efficient farming. Farmers will now be eligible for

leases up to 12 years and can go ahead and plan for

farming improvements, secure in the knowledge  that

they  have complete security for the period of  the

leases,   provided   they   fulfil   their   normal

obligations as lessees. The landlord, on the  other

hand,  will  be  able to obtain  an  economic  rent

subject to a maximum over the present rents for the

lease  which  he will be required to grant  to  the

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will benefit farmers primarily within

the  areas  zoned as "agricultural" in  the  Master

Plan.  However,  the  definition  of  "agricultural

land" is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



being  widened to include "lands designated by  the

Minister   by  notification  in  the   Gazette   as

agricultural land". It will thereby be possible  to

extend  the  benefits of long leases to farmers  in

those areas of good agricultural land which are not

at  present  zoned as "agricultural" in the  Master

Plan  for  there  are pockets of good  agricultural

land,  for  example, in the Potong  Pasir  and  the

Braddell  Road  farms at present  zoned  as  "green

belt" areas in the Master Plan. We are prepared  to

consider  designating such lands as  "agricultural"

for the purposes of this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the definitions of "farmers" and "tenancy",

the  benefits  of leases will also be  extended  to

bona fide farmers who have been occupying and using

agricultural  land for a period of  not  less  than

four  years  immediately preceding the coming  into

operation  of  the Bill, provided such  farmer  has

tendered  to  the landlord rent in respect  of  the

land,  whether or not such tender has been accepted

by  the  landlord.  This is a  departure  from  the

normal theory of freedom of contract and the  House

will  appreciate  that it is a necessary  departure

aimed at achieving certain economic objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for a lease of not

more  than  12  years to be granted to  the  tenant

farmer  at  his request at an economic rent  to  be

agreed  between  the tenant and the  landlord.  The

lease would make provision for all the matters  set

out  in  the Schedule to the Bill. If no  agreement

can  be reached between the landlord and the tenant

on the terms of the lease, the tenant may refer the

matter for arbitration under the Bill. Sir, we have

put  the figure at 12 years. It may well be,  after

hearing  representations from all parties concerned

in  the Select Committee, that the number of  years

may  be increased to 15, or even slightly more. But

we  have  to weigh the competing interests  between

the  present and future user. If, for instance,  we

were  to tie up the land to a hypothetical 30 years

of  agricultural use and a lease is granted, it may

well  be  that  long  before  the  30  years,   the

development of industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



in  the island would have so progressed as to  make

it uneconomic for the land to be allowed to be used

as  a poultry farm. Therefore, we have to weigh the

balance  between,  on  the one  hand,  the  present

certainty  for  as  long as it can  conceivably  be

planned and, on the other hand, without necessarily

tying  up  the future to a point where we may  have

cause to regret our having mortgaged the future  so

far in advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 provides for a restriction on

letting  or  leasing of agricultural  land  to  any

person for other than agricultural purposes without

the  express written permission of the Commissioner

of Lands. This is an important limitation. Also, in

further  pursuance of the objectives of the  Master

Plan, it achieves two targets. First, a farmer  can

only  transfer the lease to another farmer. Second,

a landlord who has land in an agricultural zone and

who   is   paying   assessment  on   it   has   two

alternatives:  either to develop  the  land  as  an

agricultural piece of land for farming  within  the

definition  of  the  Bill, or to  let  it  out  for

farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made in clause 7 for a Panel of

Arbitrators  from  which  an  Arbitrator  would  be

nominated  to deal with a particular  case.  It  is

envisaged  that the Arbitrator will be assisted  by

officials from a section to be set up in  the  Land

Office  to  administer  the  two  Ordinances.   The

Arbitrator will, after hearing both parties, decide

on the terms of the lease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I did mention during the Second

Reading  of the Control of Rent (Amendment  No.  2)

Bill  that  the  original intention of  putting  it

before  the Rent Conciliation Board was then  being

considered  and it was thought unwieldy because  it

would,  in  the initial phase, completely  inundate

the  Rent  Conciliation Board as  it  had  not  the

machinery that would be adequate to deal  with  and

adjudicate between parties in this sort of cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill provide an informal

procedure for arbitration under the Bill. Clause 11

provides  for  rules to be made to  carry  out  the

purposes of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 expressly provides that the Bill shall

not  apply  to the Crown and safeguards the  rights

and  powers of the State under the Land Acquisition

Ordinance.  This  is a necessary  proviso  because.

even  in  the  agricultural  zone,  land  shall  be

required  for schools, clinics, parks, installation

of electricity units, community centres, and so on.

It  also provides that the provisions of Parts  III

and  IIIA  of  the Control of Rent  Ordinance  will

apply  to agricultural land comprised in any  lease

executed under the provisions of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the government machinery of

a  country  is  in the hands of those  who  protect

capitalism, they always think of ways and means  to

pass  legislation beneficial to the rich. When they

are  affected  by  the  tide  of  anti-exploitation

revolution  started by the progressive  countries,

they will pretentiously pass legislation for the

so-called  protection of labour and welfare  in  which

there  are many defects. This is just to bluff  the

people   in  another  form.  They  never  put   the

legislation into practice, but they just bluff  the

people. In the past, although the various strata of

our  people  were  under  the  protection  of  some

legislation,  only the farmers had  no  protection.

Therefore,  the farmers were doubly  oppressed  and

were left to prosper or die by themselves. Often in

the  past,  they  were  oppressed  by  the  immoral

landlords  on  the  pretext  that  they  wanted  to

beautify  this  city. Our existing legislation  was

passed  in  days  gone  by. Therefore,  the  Judges

usually  granted the applications of landlords  for

the possession of land, thus affecting the farmers.

But  since  the P.A.P. Government took  office,  we

have  passed  temporary legislation to protect  the

interest  of the farmers. At the moment, there  are

still some unscrupulous landlords who want to  make

use of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



loopholes in the law to intimidate the farmers  and

to  destroy  their  agricultural land  and  houses.

Therefore, I must warn those unscrupulous landlords

that if they still want to make use of mean tactics

to disturb the peace of our country, our Government

will take legal measures to deal with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our agriculture here is quite

developed when compared with that of other areas in

South-East  Asia.  Our  agricultural  products  are

being  sold to the Federation of Malaya  and  other

places. Therefore, the farmers have a place in  the

economic  position of our society. Before  it  took

office, the P.A.P. laid great stress on agriculture

and  they  made  promises in this respect  to  pass

legislation  to protect the farmers in  order  that

they  can  live  in security and peace  to  develop

their  agriculture  to the best of  their  ability.

Therefore, after this Bill was read the First time,

all   the  rural  people  and  organisations   have

expressed  their support for it. They welcome  this

Bill  because  it specifically provides  for  their

protection  and tenure of lease so that  they  feel

that  they  can  have  security  in  earning  their

livelihood through agriculture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land available for agriculture in Singapore

is  limited,  apart  from  the  agricultural  lands

designated  in  the  Singapore  Master  Plan.  Some

people  might misunderstand the provisions of  this

Bill.  They  might think that whenever there  is  a

dispute,   the   law   will   provide   for   some

unfavourable   measures   detrimental   to    their

interest.  This  depends  on  what  the  Government

attitude  is. If the Government is for the interest

of  the  capitalists, then, of course, the  farmers

will  be affected. The Bills passed by the previous

Government  on labour and so on, did not  have  any

practical   effect.   But  the  P.A.P.   Government

represent  the people and we are working  in  their

interest.  Therefore, the Agricultural Leases  Bill

is  a manifestation of our policy and this Bill can

be  said  to  be  for the good of the  farmers,  to

protect them and to give hem security of tenure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this House feel it an honour  to

discuss  today  the Agricultural Leases  Bill.  The

people  of  Singapore can now see that  the  P.A.P.

Government  is fulfilling its election promises.  I

believe  that hon. Members here and all the  people

outside  the House will strongly support this  Bill

and will feel glad about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past legislation detrimental to the people has

been and will be swept out by new legislation. This

achievement  must  be attributed  to  the  people's

Government  because the people have entrusted  this

duty  to  the P.A.P. Government, and the Government

have peacefully carried out their task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Prime Minister

mentioned  what  the  P.A.P. promised  the  people

during  the  elections. Under the Master  Plan,  in

regard to those areas where farmers live which  are

not   designated   under  the  Master   Plan,   the

Government will take proper steps to declare  those

areas  as  agricultural lands so as to  enable  the

farmers living there to have the protection of  the

law.  We fully understand that up to now the arable

lands  which  are  available  for  agriculture  are

limited. The Government have the duty to take  care

of those valuable lands and put them to better use.

Those lands classified as good for the interests of

the  country  and  for specific uses  will  not  be

declared  agricultural lands,  unless  construction

thereon  is  beneficial to the people as  a  whole,

such as building hospitals schools, markets, and so

on. Otherwise, these lands will not be acquired  to

the detriment of the farmers. Some people may think

that  the  word "agriculture" means only

vegetable-growing.  It is clearly provided in the  Bill  that

the   word   "agriculture"  includes  horticulture,

floriculture,  rubber, coconut and fruit  planting,

dairy  farming, livestock and poultry breeding  and

rearing, market and nursery gardening, the  use  of

land as fish-ponds and prawn-ponds, and the use  of

land  for  other purposes of agriculture. The  Bill

will protect the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



present  users of agricultural land. This  is  very

important.  Without these strict  provisions,  this

Bill will lose its original intent and purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many industries

useful to farmers. They were taken to task by  some

landlords in past legislation. For instance,  after

the farmers had cultivated the land for a time, the

landlord  would make use of the old  law  to  drive

them  out.  Some  farmers had  just  started  their

agricultural  work and some landlords thought  that

they  had  some bad habits and they tried to  drive

them out and rob them of their cultivated land  for

their  own  use. Therefore, in the past the  people

were   in   fear  when  they  carried   out   their

agricultural work because the landlords  wanted  to

take back their land unreasonably. The present Bill

will rectify the defects in the old law and try  to

protect  the  farmers in this  respect.  Our  Prime

Minister  has  just  now clearly explained  certain

aspects of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognise that statutory tenure of

lease  is  very important to enable the  people  to

carry  out  their agricultural plans without  fear.

Clause  3  of the Bill provides that the period  of

lease for agricultural land will be up to a maximum

of  12  years. At the same time, both the  landlord

and the tenants will agree on an economic rent.  If

both sides could not agree to that, then the tenant

can  ask  that the issue be put up to an arbitrator

to consider. The Bill also provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) two hundred per centum of the annual rent

thereof  paid during the year 1960, in respect

of the first five years;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) fifty per centum of the annual rent thereof

paid  during the first five years, in  respect

of the second five years; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) fifty per centum of the annual rent thereof

paid  during the second five years, in respect

of the remaining two years.'



<br><br>These  are  the rentals provided in the  Bill.  For

instance, if a farmer in 1960



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



pays a rental of $24, then when the Bill comes into

effect, the rental for the first five years  should

not  be over $48, and during the second five years,

the  rent  should not exceed $72, and for the  last

two years, it should not exceed $108.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we think that the maximum of

the   rent  payable  is  necessary.  Without   this

provision, the landlords will increase the rent and

the  tenants will not be able to bear this.  As  to

the rent to be paid by the tenant, it is to be that

agreed  between him and the landlord at an economic

rate.   The   arbitrator  will   also   take   into

consideration  the relevant facts to  consider  the

proper  rent  to be fixed. We believe that  through

negotiations,   the   result   achieved   will   be

beneficial  to both sides. The Government  believes

that  both sides can co-operate and understand  the

purpose of Government's intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that clause 3 (4) of

this Bill will not be made use of in future. But if

some   landlords   despise  the  meaning   of   the

provisions  of  the Bill, then the Government  will

have  no  alternative but to use this provision  to

deal with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government fully

understands that in order to improve the livelihood

of  the farmers, the matter does not depend only on

one  side.  It does not depend on this Agricultural

Leases  Bill  alone. It must also depend  on  other

bases  which will help to bring about improvements,

namely, the Primary Production Division and others.

They   have  to  pay  careful  attention  to  these

problems.  We  believe  that Government  will  take

immediate necessary steps to protect the livelihood

of  the  farmers. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support  this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency

the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  recommnedation  to

proceed  with this Bill, and I beg to  move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Rent Ordinance was originally

designed  to impose controls on landlords in  order

to  prevent the full effect of a shortage  of  land

and  housing arising from the last war from falling

completely   on  the  shoulders  of  tenants.   The

Ordinance imposed restrictions on increases of rent

that  could be charged for premises and  also  gave

the tenants protection from eviction. From time  to

time,  the  Ordinance has been amended, and  as  it

stood  in 1959, the Ordinance enabled an order  for

the  recovery of possession of any premises  to  be

given   inter  alia  in  cases  falling  with   the

provisions of paragraphs (i) and (k) of section  15

(1)  of the Ordinance. They enumerated two sets  of

circumstances. First, where the premises  consisted

of a building or buildings of a temporary character

and  the  site is required by the landlord for  the

erection  of a building or buildings of a permanent

character;  and  the second set  of  circumstances,

where  the  landlord  of any  premises  intends  to

demolish the same for the purpose of rebuilding  on

the  site,  and  the Court is satisfied  that  such

demolition is necessary in the interests of  public

health  or town improvement. Sir, until this  Bill,

fortunes  have been made at the Bar in arguing  the

intricacies on the meaning of "town improvement and

public  health", and many a landlord has been  able

to reacquire possession of his land. But I think it

weighs  heavily  on  the  conscience  of  many   an

advocate  acting  on behalf of landlords  that  the

provisions of paragraphs (i) and (k) of section  15

(1)  of the Control of Rent Ordinance have operated

harshly  against tenants, who have suffered  to  be

removed without compensation in the interests of an

abstract  ideal  embraced  in  the  phrase  "public

health and town improvement".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Ordinance as it stood did not give

protection,  where  land was being  cultivated  but

where  no buildings which can constitute "premises"

as  defined in the Ordinance existed on the plot of

land.  This  worked adversely against farmers  who,

though in occupation of and in cultivation of land,

nevertheless  were not protected by  the  Ordinance

because  they  did  not have  their  homes  on  the

holdings they cultivated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to redress the position. Sir, it

is  inevitable that development which is beneficial

to  the  community as a whole must proceed. But  at

the  same time, a balance has to be struck  between

this  and the other important aspect, that  of  the

occupiers who are usually economically in the lower

income brackets. This amending Bill seeks in a fair

and  equitable manner to maintain the  balance,  on

the one hand, development of land by owners of land

and, on the other, the interests of the tenants who

have  to  be sacrificed by being evicted  from  the

land in order that the land can be developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill extends the protection of the

Control  of  Rent  Ordinance to  agricultural  land

which  includes  houses and other  buildings  built

thereon,  whether before or after the  7th  day  of

September, 1947. The rent of agricultural land will

then   be  subject  to  the  control  of  the  Rent

Conciliation Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in Part IIIA provides that no order or

judgment  for  the  recovery of possession  of  any

agricultural land or of any premises comprised in a

tenancy shall be made or given under section 15 (1)

(i)  or  (k)  unless the landlord has obtained  the

prior written consent of the Commissioner of Lands.

The  Commissioner of Lands may require the landlord

to  satisfy him that the development proposed is in

the  interests  of town and country  planning,  and

that  the eviction is therefore desirable.  He  may

also require the landlord to deposit with him a sum

of money recommended by the Panel of Assessors as a

fair  compensation to the tenant. If  an  Order  of

Court for recovery of possession is made, this  sum

will  be  paid over to the tenant. If no  Order  is

made, the sum will be refunded to the landlord.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this proviso requiring the

consent  of  the Commissioner of Lands  before  any

action  can  proceed for the recovery of possession

of agricultural land is complementary to the clause

in  the sister Bill, which prevents the transfer of

agricultural land from one person to another person

other  than  for  the  same agricultural  purposes.

Where  land  which  is being used for  agricultural

purposes  is sought to be recovered to be developed

other  than  for  agricultural purposes,  then  the

Commissioner  must first be satisfied  that  it  is

imperative in the interest of public health or town

improvement  or town planning. In this  way,  added

protection is given to tenants who are not desirous

of  obtaining  long  leases  for  various  reasons,

either because they do not wish to be burdened with

a   long  lease,  or  because  they  may  fear  the

adjustment  in  rent which is allowable  under  the

Agricultural   Leases  Bill  to  approximate   more

closely an economic rent if a long lease is  sought

for.  This impediment in the power of any  landlord

in  recovering  possession of his land  gives  some

measure of protection to the month-to-month  tenant

farmer who may wish to continue as a month-to-month

tenant  farmer  rather than acquire  a  twelve-year

lease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all farmers or other tenants (including, in

this case, any person who has occupied and used any

premises  whether built after 7th September,  1947,

or  not  for a period of not less than three  years

prior to 1st January, 1961) will now be able to get

compensation  if required to move in the  interests

of  town planning and public health. This is a move

made  to  make recovery of possession  of  land  by

private  owners  more approximate to  what  happens

when the Government recovers Crown property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 26B [clause 5] of the Bill provides for

the  manner  of  the  appointment  of  a  Panel  of

Assessors and section 26c for rules to be  made  to

give  effect to the provisions of this part of  the

Ordinance. The Control of Rent (Amendment No. 4)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  will  be  repealed.  The  provision   of

paragraphs  (i) and (k) of section 15  (1)  of  the

Control  of  Rent  Ordinance will come  into  force

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel of Assessors will consist of not less

than  three persons and will assess the quantum  of

compensation that should be required in each  case.

They  would  be guided by the Government  Rates  of

Compensation* which are applicable in the  case  of Government  clearances. Copies of these  Government

rates of compensation have been distributed for the

use of the Members of this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, what the two Bills will contrive to do

is  that squatters in the agricultural zone or such

other  areas,  which, although  not  designated  as

agricultural  zone  in  the  Master  Plan,  are  so

designated  by  the Minister, will be  entitled  to

complete  protection by either asking  for  a  long

lease; or if he chooses to stay as a month-to-month

tenant,  to  be prevented from eviction unless  the

Commissioner  of Lands decides that the  owner  can

commence  proceedings for recovery, because  it  is

necessary in the interest of public health or  town

planning.  Those  squatters  who  are  outside  the

agricultural  zone,  or such areas  which  will  be

designated as agricultural zone, will not have  the

same   privileges  as  tenant  farmers   like   the

squatters you have in the city area. They will have

to  go,  in the first instance. New buildings  will

have  to go up in the congested areas of the  town.

But in asking them to go, private landlords will be

asked  to  observe the minimum standards which  the

Government itself offers to all squatters  who  are

asked  to move from Crown land. Here again, instead

of  referring  the matter to the Rent  Conciliation

Board,  we  have  decided to  set  up  a  Panel  of

Assessors   in  the  hope  that  thereby   a   more

expeditious   method   of  assessing   compensation

payable would be devised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our intention to refer this Bill also

to  a  Select Committee for proper scrutiny of  its

provisions  and  its  effect and  side  effects  on

existing interests, either on the landlord  or  the

tenant or the squatter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if this Bill is restricted  to  the

city  area,  I  will not oppose it. But  this  Bill

concerns the whole rural area. In respect  of  this

Bill,  I  wish  to  request the Government  to  pay

attention  and  give due and careful consideration.

Outwardly  looking, it is the Government which  has

extended its facilities and establishments  to  the

rural areas. In fact, it is not so. If we carefully

study  the  consequences of this Bill,  it  is  not

difficult  for  us to see that this Bill  possesses

many  harmful effects which will injure the welfare

of  the  people.  And the people  who  will  really

receive  the  blessings will be the  landlord.  The

Nanyang  Siang Pau published the contents  of  this

Bill  on  22nd December. For example, the landlord,

under  the  Control of Rent Bill, if  he  wants  to

apply for getting back any agricultural land or any

house,   should   get   the   permission   of   the

Commissioner  of Lands beforehand. The Commissioner

of  Lands,  however, has absolute  power  over  the

request  of the landlord. Before he agrees  to  the

request  of  the landlord, the latter must  observe

the following. First, regarding the asking back  of

the agricultural land, the landlord must prove that

it  is for the sake of the development of the city,

or for construction plans. Taking all these matters

into  consideration, if approval cannot  be  given,

the  landlord  will suffer a great loss.  Secondly,

the  landlord will be instructed to pay a  deposit.

The   amount  according  to  the  opinion  of   the

Commissioner of Lands is meant for the compensation

of  the  tenants, for the Court may have instructed

the  landlord to get back his agricultural land  or

house.  We all know that under the Singapore Master

Plan,  many  rural  areas  are  listed  as  housing

development   areas.  These   areas   are   densely

populated by attap-hut squatters who have lived  in

these  places  and obtained their food  from  these

places for tens of years. Although their lives  are

hard, they are happy for they commit themselves  to

heaven. Although in some places the villagers  have

been oppressed by the landlords, yet they have

co-operated  and formed their united organisations  to

negotiate with the landlords. In most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



cases, the danger has been averted and now there is

peace. In recent years, many landlords have

is. The point of order seems to be that perhaps the

hon. Member was reading his speech. But I have  not

noticed  anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps  the

Member can carry on. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

now  the landlords are backed by the Government and

protected  by  the law. It is believed  that  these

landlords  will  take advantage of the  passing  of

this  Bill  to pursue their activities  on  a  wide

scale.  If  only they can get the approval  of  the

planning section, after submitting their plans, and

pay  some  compensation to the tenants  which  will

satisfy  the  Minister, they can  chase  out  these

unfortunate  attap squatters. The  governing  party

sympathizes  with  these  few  landlords  who  were

unable  to  increase  their  wealth  in  time.  But

thousands  of  villagers will become  homeless  and

unemployed  as  a  result  of  the  loss  of  their

agricultural  lands and houses. I wonder  why  this

situation   will   not  attract  the   Government's

sympathy.  I really cannot understand why  the

so-called Government for the working masses will adopt

this sort of attitude and policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the compensation mentioned in this

Bill,  it  is not clearly stated. For example,  the

Bill  provides that the Minister will appoint three

assessors.  When the Court approves the request  of

the   landlord,  they  have  to  suggest   to   the

Commissioner   of   Lands   what   is    reasonable

compensation  for the tenant. But the  Commissioner

is  not  bound by their consideration, findings  or

suggestions. After all, what is reasonable and what

is unreasonable? I think there should be a standard

and  a reasonable provision. Does it mean that  the

fate  of  these  unfortunate squatters  has  to  be

controlled by the authorities? According to the way

of  compensation in the past, for  a  wooden  house

with concrete floor the compensation was one dollar

per square foot; for the other type of earth floor,

it  was eighty cents per square foot. Each of these

attap  houses  mostly occupies  over  1,000  square

feet.   If  it  is  based  upon  the  standard   of

compensation in the past, then the most  they  will

get is about $1,000 or a little more. Moreover, the

squatters   live   together  with  their   parents,

brothers   and   sisters.  How  can   this   little

compensation do anything for a family of more  than

ten  people? Even if they can rent an S.I.T. flat,

how long can they carry on paying rents?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the passing of this Bill will

greatly  harm  the  attap squatters  in  the  rural

areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what  I want to say now is very simple.  Just

now,  when  the Member for Punggol was  making  his

speech,   I  was  wondering  whether  he  was   not

following  the footsteps of the former  Member  for

Hong   Lim,   because  his  speech  was   full   of

distortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these two Bills clearly show

that  they will provide protection for the  farmers

in  the  rural  areas.  But  from  the  Member  for

Punggol's  viewpoint,  the purposes  of  these  two

Bills  are  to  bring harm and suffering  to  those

oppressed people living in attap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



huts in the rural areas. If he wants to pursue this

course  of  distortion, then  the  Government  will

simply  refute it. But that is not good  enough.  I

will,  however,  do my best to explain  to  him  in

simple Mandarin the meaning contained in these  two

Bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, when he was a P.A.P. candidate for the

last  election,  1�  years  ago,  the  Member   had

proposed to the rural people our Five-Year Plan. If

he  had  not read or seen it for himself, he  could

have gathered it from the other Assemblymen that we

had  promised  certain things in our plan  for  the

rural  areas. The P.A.P. Government wants  to  help

the farmers in the rural areas by putting them in a

secure  position. They fully understand  that  many

landlords have made use of the laws prevailing then

to drive out the tenants of the land. Therefore, we

have  thought  of a method to let  farmers  have  a

secure long-term lease. We hope these two Bills can

put our farmers under very favourable conditions so

that  there  will be a chance for them  to  develop

agriculture  for the good of the country.  How  can

they achieve this purpose?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, all those landlords who have been

unscrupulously making use of the laws to drive  out

their tenants will be prohibited from doing so. The

landlord  must  first get approval  from  the  Land

Office. He must let us see clearly why he wants  to

drive  out  the  tenants from  his  land.  If,  for

instance, a farmer does not like a long-term lease,

he  can  still carry on as usual, by paying monthly

rents  for  the land and so on. This is  the  first

method of protection provided by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method of protection is this. If a

tenant  wishes to have a long-term lease, he  wants

his boss to give him 12 years' secure position.  If

the  boss does not agree to that, he will  have  to

put up his case to the Land Office for a reasonable

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these two Bills are clearly for the protection

of  the  rural farmers. But the Member for  Punggol

says  that they are bringing harm and suffering  to

the farmers and are oppressing them. I hope he will

bring out his proof in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



Assembly  to show how these Bills will bring  about

suffering  and harm to the farmers.  If  he  cannot

substantiate this, he can make investigations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I hope it will be best for the Member for

Punggol  not to occupy the seat over there, because

that  seat has a very bad significance. The  Member

formerly  occupying that seat spread all  sorts  of

lies. I hope the Member for Punggol will not pursue

the same course.

Hong Lim will definitely fight against the acts  of

oppression   and  tyranny  against  their   elected

representative.  They  shall  also  decide  whether

their  elected representative should be subject  to

third degree. They shall also cast their verdict on

this  Government. May I ask - would  there  be  more

attempts  to  silence and smear Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan

before the battle of Hong Lim begins? If there are,

I can say that such attempts shall not succeed. The

people  of  Singapore now know full well  the  true

nature of this Government. The by-election for Hong

Lim  would  essentially be a  fight  waged  by  the

people  of Hong Lim against the oppressive policies

and  the  acts  of  tyranny and arrogance  of  this

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> In this fight in Hong Lim, the odds

will  be  against Mr Ong Eng Guan. The  Government

has  the whole machinery of the State behind it.  I

ask - would there be a greater degree of control  of

the  Press? Would Mr Ong Eng Guan be allowed radio

time?  Would Mr Ong be allowed equal opportunities

in  the  use of Hong Lim Green and other  parks  in

Hong Lim?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Will he repeat in Hong Lim

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> When Mr Ong applied for the use of

Hong  Lim  Green  last  time  to  explain  to   his

electorate  about  the  16  resolutions,   it   was

rejected, not once, but three times. There are many

other doubts in my mind, but Mr Speaker. Sir,  the

people are with Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> No, Sir, It is wrong to delay the

by-election. In 1957, when Mr David Marshall resigned

from  the Assembly, the former Government held  the

by-election     without     unnecessary      delay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> In 1958, the Kallang by-election was

also  held immediately after the resignation  of  a

City   Councillor.   But   contrary   to   accepted

democratic practice, this Government wants to delay

the holding of the Hong Lim by-election. Why? There

must  be reasons. The people know them. One of them

is  that  the  Government is  not  prepared  to  be

defeated in Hong Lim, as it was not prepared to  be

defeated  in  Tanjong Pagar. We remember  that  the

Prime Minister dared not accept Mr Ong's challenge

to resign.

was afraid. Anyway, he has my full sympathy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, two weeks have now passed. The

people of Singapore demand that the by-election for

Hong  Lim  should be held immediately  and  without

delay.  All  delaying tactics or  smears  or  other

undemocratic  practices would be of no  avail.  Let

the people of Hong Lim make their decision.

the  Member for Aljunied has mentioned quite a  lot

of  things.  But let me first say that  it  is  not

unexpected that the hon. Member should talk  of  an

immediate by-election today. He has, just like  the

Member   for   Hong  Lim,  tried   to   throw   out

smokescreens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



and lay red herrings across the path of everything.

And now today he is asking if there is going to  be

a  by-election. Everybody knows that there is going

to be a by-election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Go ahead then.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nobody can stop it. It is in

the law. It must come. The only point we would like

to  ask  the  Member  for  Aljunied  is,  why  this

unseemly haste? Is there any reason why he wants it

immediately? Or is it because he is afraid-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> The people demand it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> that before that by-election

takes  place, some very unpleasant truths  will  be

divulged?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, we would like to trace the

events  which  led to the present  vacancy  in  the

constituency  of  Hong Lim. Let us  ask  first  the

question: why did Mr Ong Eng Guan resign from  the

seat for Hong Lim? Has the Member for Aljunied made

any  attempt to answer that question? Did  he  say,

"Mr Ong Eng Guan resigned because he needed a  new

mandate  from the people."? Or did he say that  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan resigned to tell the people of  Hong

Lim  the truth about himself and the P.A.P.? Or did

he  say  that Mr Ong Eng Guan resigned so that  he

could  escape from being exposed as a  purveyor  of

falsehoods in this Assembly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the records speak for

themselves.  They have been indelibly imprinted  in

the   annals  of  this  historic  session  of   the

Singapore Legislative Assembly. Let me recapitulate

the salient facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the 1961 Budget debate, the

then  Member  for Hong Lim repeatedly made  certain

allegations and insinuations about the integrity of

the  Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and

Law.  Despite  the then Member for Hong  Lim  being

called  a rogue and a liar both inside and  outside

this  House by the Prime Minister and the  Minister

for  Labour and Law, he never dared to take up  the

challenge to repeat outside this House what he  had

said under cover of privilege inside the House. The

Leader of the House thereupon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



moved  that this House condemn the Member for  Hong

Lim for his dishonourable conduct unbecoming of  an

elected  representative of the people  in  that  he

repeatedly used the privilege of this Assembly as a

cloak   for   spreading  malicious  falsehoods   to

unjustly  injure innocent persons both  inside  and

outside  this  Assembly;  After  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  had  put his case before the  House,  the

then  Member  for  Hong Lim  pleaded  for  time  to

prepare  his  case  and answer.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister  then  graciously said - I  quote  from  the

unrevised  transcript  of the  proceedings  of  the

Legislative Assembly on 19th December,  1960,  page

25, line 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dr Toh Chin Chye: Mr Speaker, it is not the

intention  of the House to prevent the  Member  for

Hong Lim from speaking in this Chamber; neither  is

it  our  intention  not to give him  time  to  seek

advice  on  his  motion. As he so decides,  I  will

move,  Mr  Speaker,  that  this  Assembly  do  now

adjourn to Friday, 23rd December.'



<br><br>And  so,  Mr Speaker, the scene shifted to Friday,

23rd   December.  After  your  ruling   about   the

admissibility  of  the motion of the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  had been thoroughly debated  by  all  the

legal  luminaries of this Chamber,  if  I  remember

correctly, the then Member for Hong Lim was given a

chance  to  reply to the motion which suggested  to

him alternatives of either withdrawing unreservedly

his   unfounded  allegations  against   the   Prime

Minister  and the Minister for Labour and  Law  and

apologising  to this Assembly for his dishonourable

conduct  or  repeating outside  the  Assembly  when

challenged the charges he made inside the Assembly.

The  then Member for Hong Lim - and I quote from  the

unrevised  transcript  of the  proceedings  of  the

Legislative Assembly on 23rd December,  1960,  page

44:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

substantiate all the things I have said.'



<br><br>Then  there  followed  an  interjection  from   Mr

Speaker which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker: So do I take it then that the

Member  for Hong Lim does not wish to withdraw  his

allegations;  he  does  not  wish   to   give   any

explanation of them, and his desire is to  try  and

substantiate  the  allegations  he  made  in   this

Assembly?  Is that the course the Member  for  Hong

Lim is taking?'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



And the reply was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: Yes, Mr Speaker, I have

nothing to apologise.'



<br><br>However,  Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Ong Eng Guan  could

not  substantiate his allegations on 23rd  December

and  he  again asked for time to prepare his  case.

The  debate therefore was again adjourned  to  29th

December, 1960, to give time to the then Member for

Hong  Lim to marshal all his facts so that he could

substantiate  the allegations he made  against  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and Law.

But  what happened on 29th December, 1960?  Did  we

sit  in  Committee  and  listen  to  the  array  of

witnesses and facts which the then Member for  Hong

Lim  was  supposed  to have brought  before  us  to

substantiate  his  allegations  against  the  Prime

Minister  and the Minister for Labour and Law?  The

House  on  that  day was filled  to  capacity.  The

gallery  was waiting for the self-proclaimed  great

revolutionary to set off the fireworks.  But,  Sir,

what  actually  turned out was that  there  was  no

great revolutionary. It transpired that he was only

a  pretender. And instead of fireworks, we found  a

damp   squib.   All   those   brave   words   about

substantiating  the allegations  came  to  nothing.

Instead Mr Ong Eng Guan ran away by resigning  his

seat  for  Hong Lim. He could not and he dared  not

face the truth. That was actually what happened. He

had  to  run  away, and run away  from  what?  From

truth,  truth which would have exposed Mr Ong  Eng

Guan   as   an  opportunist,  a  vilifier   and   a

scandalmonger. Following this, on 29th December,  a

statement   was   issued  by  the  P.A.P.   Central

Executive  Committee. Allow me, Sir, to  quote  the

relevant section. It is a short passage:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [that is, Mr Ong Eng Guan] has, among many

other  falsehoods, made grave charges of  political

corruption against Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr  K.  M.

Byrne.  It is his duty now to tell the truth either

at  a  mass meeting in Hong Lim repeating  all  his

lies  or, if he is afraid to meet the people,  then

to  repeat  these  charges before a  Commission  of

Inquiry  which  will  be open  to  the  public  and

reported by the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Commission has made a thorough

investigation of the truth and made its report,  it

will be published to the whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



of  the  people and then Mr Ong Eng Guan can  come

down to Hong Lim and repeat his allegations. The

by-election  will be held as soon as possible  and  we

hope  to  meet  Mr Ong Eng Guan in  Hong  Lim  and

expose  him  to  be   the dirty  liar  and  covertly

scoundrel that he has already been publicly called.

We  are confident that when the people of Hong  Lim

know the truth, they will pass judgment on him in a

manner which deserves a coward and a rogue.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the Member for Aljunied thinks we should

have an immediate by-election. Of course, he quotes

quite  a  number  of  other things.  He  is  asking

whether  there is any control of the Press, whether

he  is  going  to be given radio time, and  whether

there  is  going to be a voice for  Hong  Lim,  and

rights  of  the people, almost suggesting  that  we

might  employ  third-degree tactics on  people  who

might  stand for election. All these do not need  a

reply.  They have been adequately replied time  and

time  again  in  this  House  by  Members  of   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always good to talk of going back to the

people,  but  does he really mean it? If  that  was

true,  then  Mr Ong Eng Guan should have  resigned

earlier  when he was first challenged by the  Prime

Minister. Why did he resign only when he  was  left

to  face the music, when the Speaker had laid  down

the  proper procedure to followed, and when Mr Ong

Eng Guan realised that evidence had to be given  on

oath  in Committee and he could not make more false

speeches  from his seat in the Assembly  where  all

the  speeches  are privileged? Does this  not  show

that he could not face the truth?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not this anxiety to have an early by-election

merely  a  masquerade to run away from  the  truth?

Now,  the hon. Member for Aljunied thinks we should

hurry  the by-election so that the people  of  Hong

Lim and the people of the whole of Singapore may be

deceived. Again we ask: why this unseemly haste? Is

it  not  right  and proper that all  the  facts  be

revealed to the people? Why must the vision of  the

people be besmogged with smokescreens emitted  from

Mr  Ong  Eng Guan? Let the people of the whole  of

Singapore, not just the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



people  of  Hong Lim, know the whole  truth  first.

Then  after  knowing the truth, let the  people  of

Hong   Lim  decide  as  to  who  should  be   their

representative in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we may ask: how did the Opposition react

to all this? Mr Speaker, Sir, let us have a clear

view of the issue before us. Grave allegations have

been made against two of the Ministers, and yet the

Opposition  in  this Assembly, and  especially  the

Member for Cairnhill, -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Huh!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -is not interested in pursuing

the  truth  of  these allegations. The  Member  for

Cairnhill said, and I quote from the Straits  Times

of 31st December, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [in other words, Mr Ong Eng Guan] is now

fighting  the battle of the Opposition in  the

by-election against the Party in power.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, all that the Opposition can think

of and are interested in is that they should oppose

the  Government. They are not interested  in  truth

itself.  If those allegations were true, then  they

could  bring  down the whole Government,  in  which

case  it  would mean new General Elections for  all

the  constituencies in Singapore instead of just  a

by-election for Hong Lim. Is it because the  Member

for  Cairnhill  and certain other people  who  have

been mentioned in the Press like Mr Marshall, Mrs

Leon  Soh, the Member for Aljunied, the Member  for

Punggol,  all  know  that  these  allegations   are

baseless and false? And yet they want the people of

Hong  Lim to vote a new representative on the basis

of false allegations and before the truth is placed

before  them? One irresistible conclusion  is  that

the Opposition has, as somebody has said before,  a

vested interest in lies and falsehoods, and I  hope-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is a direct reference,

of  course,  to Members of this Assembly - that  they

have  vested  interests in lies and  falsehoods.  I

think  the Parliamentary Secretary should be a  bit

more  careful with his language, and withdraw  that

expression.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw the word "lies".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I want the whole expression

withdrawn - "vested interests in "lies and

falsehoods" - all of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Otherwise there

will be a motion moved against him!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw, Sir. The Deputy

Prime  Minister  has  already categorically  stated

that a by-election will be held as soon as possible

after  the Inquiry Report has been tabled. It  will

not  be  long.  We need no further  assurance  than

that. But it is in our interests that before the

by-election,  we  first know the truth. Let  us  first

know the facts that have led to the resignation  of

Mr  Ong Eng Guan and the consequent vacancy in the

constituency of Hong Lim. All these are  intimately

connected with the coming by-election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now our duty and our right, not only to

ourselves and the people of Hong Lim, but  also  to

the  people of the whole of Singapore, to lay  bare

all  the facts to find out whether Mr Ong Eng Guan

was telling the truth or merely spreading malicious

falsehoods. If they are proved to be lies, then his

skin  must  be  thick indeed if he dared  to  stand

before  the  people of Hong Lim again. As  for  the

Member  for  Aljunied, I do not think I am  letting

out a secret when I say that there are some who are

of  the opinion that there also ought to be  a

by-election in Aljunied.



<br><br>4.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  just  now  brought  in  my  name  in  this

controversy, I feel that I should now rise and tell

a few salient facts to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, I must say that the Government

has no right to think that this by-election is a

fight between Mr Ong Eng Guan and the P.A.P. A

by-election has to be held under the law. It should

not be delayed because of what the Government

thinks: that Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



Ong  Eng Guan may stand as a candidate and that the

Government  have to meet Mr Ong Eng  Guan  at  the

polls. A by-election is for all people who care  to

stand  as candidates in that by-election.  And  the

Government  should, therefore, not treat  this

by-election  as  a fight that they have to  carry  out

against Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker, Sir, made mention of a

statement which we had issued to the Press, and  he

quoted the Straits Times. I would like to thank him

for that quotation, because it strengthens the case

of  the Opposition - that the Opposition claims  that

the Press has been muzzled. To this extent, Sir - we

sent a statement giving the reasons why we were not

contesting the by-election, and that statement  had

been distorted to mean almost nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell this House how that statement should

have  read  if  the  Press had  been  fair  to  the

Opposition. We said that we had no sympathy for Mr

Ong  Eng Guan - and we still say it here that we have

no  sympathy for Mr Ong Eng Guan. But we  did  say

this:  "that  because  of the  fact  that  the

by-election  is  going  to  be a  battle  between  the

Opposition and the Party in power which, by  reason

of  its  majority, could unjustly use its power  to

silence the Opposition". Those important words were

left  out  by  the  Press which, according  to  the

Minister  for Culture, is free to publish  what  it

feels  should be published. It is so free  that  it

distorts  the statement of the Opposition.  And  we

still  say  that it is quite free  to  do  what  it

wants. I am not saying that the Government has told

the Press not to print it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What did you say?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have said many a time

that   there   is   such  a  thing  as   suggestive

intimidation.   And  I  repeat   it   here   again:

suggestive intimidation is more heinous  than  open

intimidation,  because  open  intimidation  can  be

nailed  whereas  suggestive  intimidation  can   go

unchallenged.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You are wrong. You are not

being intimidated, are you?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if the Government had done

some  intimidation of the Opposition, then we would

have been able to nail that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the fight in Hong Lim. The by-election

in  Hong Lim must not be taken by the Government to

mean  that it is a fight between Mr Ong  Eng  Guan

and the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Are you putting up a candidate?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister for Culture

has yet to learn a little bit of culture!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have said we are not putting

up  a  candidate because we feel that Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan,  although we have no sympathy for him, has  a

fight  on  his  hands against the Party  in  power;

although it is rather ironical that he should  have

come  out of that Party in power to now fight  that

Party  in power! The Minister for Culture,  in  his

address  at  the Sixth Anniversary meeting  of  the

P.A.P., said that Mr Ong Eng Guan-because  we  are

not putting up a candidate - is being supported by us

and  therefore he is a Right-wing. Whereas  not  so

long  ago he was accused as a Left-wing adventurer.

I  do not know what he is-Left-wing adventurer or a

Right-wing. I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Nobody knows.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The people always look to the

Government  to tell the truth. And the  truth,  six

months ago, was that he was a Left-wing adventurer;

and  the truth, ten nights ago, was he was a

Right-wing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Metamorphosis!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, because of what has been

taking  place in this Assembly during the last  few

sittings,  the people of Singapore have  taken  too

great  an interest in this by-election that  is  to

come. Because so much has been said and so much has

been  left unsaid, it is the view of the Opposition

that  there  should be no delay whatsoever  in  the

holding  of this by-election. We are not  concerned

with the fact that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



Government is very anxious indeed to try  and  make

out  a case against the ex-Member for Hong Lim, the

ex-Minister  for  National Development,  their

ex-Treasurer of the Party, and these three "exes"  may

in  due  course  be the real axe to  chop  out  the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like to state, on behalf of my Opposition colleagues,

particularly  on behalf of U.M.N.O.,  that  on  the

problem of the ex-Member for Hong Lim, our stand is

to  know the truth in this controversy between  the

Government  on  the one hand and the ex-Member  for

Hong  Lim on the other. We deny categorically  that

we  would like to derive some benefit out of  this

controversy.  I  am shocked to hear  the  statement

made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Home Affairs accusing the Opposition Members of

trying to gain an interest in this affair. But as I

said  earlier on, we believe in the truth. Although

we are unable to substantiate the truth, truth will

always remain truth. We consider the action of  the

Government  in  moving  a  motion  to  suspend  the

services of the ex-Member for Hong Lim as being an

act  or a motion which would create a precedent  in

the  future  in  this Assembly whereby  freedom  of

expression -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is now going

back  to  the motion which has been adjourned  sine

die. He, of course, cannot do that. He must not now

debate  a  motion  which,  although  it  has   been

adjourned  sine die, is still in the possession  of

the House.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

accept  your  advice, but what I really  wanted  to

bring  home  to  the Government was  this - that  the

attitude of the Opposition was touched upon. Let me

say  here  that in this matter, the  stand  of  the

Opposition  is that truth will triumph.  Therefore,

we  sympathise  with  the statements  made  by  the

Member  for  Aljunied so that an early  by-election

could  be held for the vacant constituency of  Hong

Lim.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

gratifying  to  the Government  to  know  that  the

Opposition  are  good watch-dogs of democracy,  and

their  anxiety to see that the by-election is  held

as soon as possible will probably be fulfilled much

sooner  than they are prepared for. I suspect  that

all  this  anxious questioning on the part  of  the

Member  for Aljunied was with one aim in view.  We,

the   Government,  want  to  establish   a   simple

question. Before Mr Ong Eng Guan presents  himself

as  a  candidate in the by-election, we think  that

the  people  of Hong Lim should have the  right  to

know  whether  they will be asked  to  vote  for  a

candidate  who  is  proved  to  be  a  purveyor  of

falsehoods, or whether they are going to  be  asked

to  vote for a candidate who is obviously a man who

speaks  the truth. And it is quite right before  we

can  do this. If we are convinced, as we are,  that

Mr  Ong Eng Guan is a purveyor of falsehoods, that

he   has   been  using  this  Assembly  to   purvey

falsehoods and to assassinate characters,  then  we

say that he is not only a menace to himself and his

friends but a menace to democracy. Because  a  very

recent   case   was  a  gentleman  called   Senator

McCarthy,  who used Senate privilege precisely  for

this  purpose,  of  using lies  and  falsehoods  to

assassinate  the  character  of  so  many  innocent

people,  so much so that at a later period  of  his

political   life,   responsible   newspapers   were

precisely making the same demand that action should

be  taken against him to prevent him from using the

Senate  as a cover to assassinate the character  of

innocent people, and that if he continued to do so,

then  he  would bring democracy into disrepute  and

contempt. Not only democracy but Assembly privilege

will   become  a  weapon  to  spread  terror  among

innocent people. So that is exactly what we want to

establish:  whether Mr Ong Eng Guan is a  purveyor

of falsehoods. Then let us prove it. If he is not a

purveyor of falsehoods, let him go back and let the

people  of Hong Lim reelect the honest man. But  as

we  believe  he is not so, then it is our  duty  to

bring  him  before a Commission and establish  once

and  for all whether he is an honest or a dishonest

man.  Therefore,  the Opposition knows  this.  What

they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



interested in is that Ong Eng Guan has now become a

useful tool to fight some other battle. I am  quite

convinced, as they have taken great care  to  point

out,  that they have no sympathy with Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan.  But  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  played  with   the

adventurous Left once upon a time. He got  nowhere.

So  now he has decided to use the Opposition to put

him   into  power.  And,  therefore,  Sir,  it   is

necessary,  because Mr Ong Eng Guan is politically

quite  a  shrewd  man. He knows that  too  open  an

embrace by the Right-wing would have been the  kiss

of  death.  So we notice that the S.P.A. statement

has  this invocation. "We have no sympathy with Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan. But we hope that he will fight  the

battle  of the Opposition." To a man for  whom  you

have  no sympathy, if you say, "Well, we are  going

to  support  him.  We are not going  to  put  up  a

candidate because he is fighting the battle of  the

Opposition", what is the battle of the  Opposition?

Is  it  the right of an elected Assemblyman to  use

Assembly privilege to tell falsehoods? Is that  the

right  of  the Opposition? Again we have Mr  David

Marshall  also  will  this preface:  "We  have  no

sympathy for Mr Ong Eng Guan. But we think that he

will fight a heroic battle for democracy." There is

the leader of the Singapore Congress who also, I am

told, is an animal lover - a sort of fighter for  the

under-dog - also coming out with the same  statement

to say that they have no sympathy and so on, but on

the  other hand, "he is fighting a great battle for

democracy."  Therefore,  I  say,  Sir,   that   the

Opposition's  stand itself simply  indicates  this.

They  think they are going to use Mr Ong Eng  Guan

to  have  a little battle with the Government.  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan thinks he can use the Opposition  to

fight  his battle. Therefore, though the two  sides

think that they are fighting a kind of battle where

each  one  thinks that it is getting the better  of

the  other,  what simply it all boils  down  to  is

this.  The  Opposition know that they  either  hang

together or hang separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that the Member for Cairnhill

alleged  that  the Government, either  by  indirect

intimidation   or  otherwise,  had  pursuaded   the

newspapers  not to publish the magnum opus  of  the

S.P.A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



In  fact, Sir, that statement was published in  the

Chinese Press, but to our consternation, it was not

published  in the English Press. As far as  we  are

concerned, that statement makes it more  than  ever

clear that the S.A.P.-the Right-wing - is now using a

bankrupt   Left-wing  adventurer,  or  a   bankrupt

Leftist  who  tried to play with the Left-wing  and

who  could  not get anywhere. Therefore, they  have

decided  to use him for their political  ends.  You

will notice, Sir, that so far the only support that

has  come to Mr Ong Eng Guan is not from Socialist

groups, not from workers and not from trade unions,

but  from the Right-wing, who once upon a time were

claiming that Mr Ong Eng Guan was a menace and  so

on.  Now  they  are saying that he  is  becoming  a

fighter  for democracy. Therefore, I say,  Sir,  in

this battle, as far as the P.A.P. is concerned,  we

regard  Mr Ong Eng Guan and the Opposition - as  far

as U.M.N.O. is concerned, I am quite glad they have

not yet made a statement - as having flocked together

as  the Opposition. As far as we are concerned,  we

know  that  Mr Ong Eng Guan is merely a shield,  a

battering  ram  to  be  used  by  the  S.P.A.,  the

Singapore Congress, and the Workers' Party. And  in

that  strain we are prepared to take on all corners

at  Hong Lim, and if the Member for Aljunied  feels

that  there  should be a by-election  in  Aljunied,

then we are prepared to take him on there too.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

whether the Left-wing groups or the trade unionists

will support Mr Ong Eng Guan or not one cannot say

that today. That will only be known if Mr Ong  Eng

Guan is allowed to contest the Hong Lim seat. Then,

and  only  then,  will that be  known.  That  point

really  does  not interest me this afternoon.  What

really interests me, Mr Speaker, this afternoon is

the  point  made by the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the Minister for Home Affairs who, by the nature of

his  documented speech, gave me the impression that

he  was speaking for the Government on this matter.

He  said,  "What  is the hurry  to  hold  this

by-election?" Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, the Government seems to  think  that

the by-election in Hong Lim is a matter between the

P.A.P. and Mr Ong Eng Guan, and that it does  not

concern  anybody else. Might I suggest to them  and

remind  them  that  in  this matter  the  paramount

consideration is not the P.A.P. Government, or  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan, but the electorate of Hong Lim?  If

the   Government  choose  to  delay  this  election

because   they   want  to  go   to   the   election

strengthened, then it is the electorate of Hong Lim

that  is suffering. The point of representation  in

the Assembly, Mr Speaker, is this: that no part of

the island should be without representation. At the

moment, Hong Lim is without representation, and  in

the democratic concept of parliamentary government,

that  should  not  be  so. The  business  of  every

government  is  to  see  that  when  a  vacancy  by

resignation, death or other cause occurs, a writ of

election  is  expeditiously issued and an  election

takes  place.  Listening to the speeches  from  the

Government benches, one gets the idea that this  is

a  private matter between Mr Ong Eng Guan and  the

P.A.P. in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the original motion which

led to this resignation, you ruled that this was  a

matter  which  concerned the whole  House,  and  we

accepted your ruling and we debated that motion  on

that  basis.  The  subsequent  statements  of   the

Government  in  this  Assembly  today  confirm  the

impression  that some of us might  have  had,  that

this is a fight they are continuing against Mr Ong

Eng   Guan  personally,  and  that  they  are   not

concerned with the electorate of Hong Lim.  Whether

Hong  Lim  is represented or not does not  seem  to

matter  two hoots to the Government. All that  they

are  interested  in is to go to the  electorate  of

Hong Lim only when their hand is strengthened.



<br><br>5.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I really did not wish to

speak  on  this motion for the adjournment,  but  I

want to dispel any impression which the Member  for

Farrer Park might have given when he said just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



now  that  every part of the island must always  at

any  time be represented in this Chamber. That  has

not been according to facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of the previous Government, the

Member  for  Bukit  Timah was  detained  under  the

P.P.S.O. for several years, and during that period,

the electorate of Bukit Timah had no representative

in  this  Chamber. Now, what we wish to  say  quite

clearly is this; that the people of Hong Lim should

be  given the opportunity to see light. It was  not

the  Government who forced the resignation  of  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan. Perhaps the electorate of Hong  Lim

should  even  ask - upon what grounds  or  upon  what

right had their elected representative in tendering

his  resignation from this Chamber? If Mr Ong  Eng

Guan,  when  he  was their representative,  were  a

responsible person, he would have considered not so

much  his  own skin and not so much his own  pride,

but  he should have considered the interests of the

people whom he represented. Did he do it? If he had

thought  more deliberately and carefully, he  would

not  have quitted this Chamber in such a hurry  and

indecent haste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we say we will have the by-election, we mean

it.  At the last sitting of the Assembly, in moving

the motion for adjournment of the motion to censure

the  ex-Member  for  Hong Lim for  his  conduct  in

purveying falsehoods, I said very clearly  that  we

were  going  to set up a Commission of  Inquiry  to

investigate  into  the  allegations  made  in  this

Chamber; that Mr Ong Eng Guan had dared not appear

in  this Chamber to substantiate what he had  said,

or   to   substantiate  what  he  said   he   would

substantiate.  It is important that  not  only  the

electorate  of  Hong Lim, but also  the  public  at

large,  including  the public  in  the  Federation,

should  be  given an opportunity to  know  what  is

right  and what is wrong. If we were really  afraid

of a by-election, what we could have done was, very

simply,  not to have any inquiries made  either  in

this  Chamber or outside. But, as Members  in  this

House  know,  a Commission of Inquiry  has  already

been established.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



It  will  be sitting next week and we hope  that  a

report will soon be produced by the Commission; and

when that has been done, it will be duly tabled  in

this  House, and the by-election will then be held.

It  is important that at this juncture we should not

confuse  either the electorate of Hong Lim  or  the

people   of  Singapore  on  the  issues  that   are

involved. Whether a man who is prepared  to  be  as

unscrupulous as to tell lies in this Chamber should

be  considered worthy of representing a section  of

the people of Singapore - that is the main issue.  We

will  wait  for  the findings of the Commission  of

Inquiry  and we certainly hope that this  time  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan  does  not also run  away  from  the

Commission of Inquiry as he has run away from  this

Chamber.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  amuses us Members of the Opposition  is  that

when  the  former  Member  for  Hong  Lim  was  the

Minister for National Development on the Government

side  and used the same tactics which he later used

against the Government, there was no protest at all

from  the  Government benches.  He  accused,  if  I

remember  rightly, Sir, the Member for Farrer  Park

roundly,  and  I think the Government benches  were

just  amused. But when the Member for Hong Lim came

to the Opposition-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering how all

this  has  anything to do with the  matter  we  are

discussing-the  by-elections  in  Hong  Lim?   Past

conduct of that nature, surely, has nothing  to  do

with the by-election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I mention that because an

accusation  has been made that we are  siding  with

the  Member for Hong Lim and using him as  a  tool;

whereas if anything. Sir, by the fact that  we  had

been at the receiving end here for a long time when

the  Member  for  Hong  Lim was  the  Minister  for

National  Development, one  would  expect  that  we

would be against the Member for Hong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



Lim  in  the by-election. That is why I  wanted  to

clear  the  air:  that we here were more  tolerant,

more charitable and more willing to receive and yet

give  the Government a fight. Now, in the Hong  Lim

by-election, Sir, instead of having the by-election

quickly,  the Government apparently is not prepared

to  take what we before were able to take from  him

when  he  was their comrade. I would suggest,  Sir,

that they should show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



the same spirit of charitableness and patience as

we showed them when the Member for Hong Lim was on

their side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
