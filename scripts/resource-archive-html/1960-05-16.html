<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause (Amendment of section 13)-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members are aware that the intention of  the

Pawnbrokers (Amendment) Bill is to give  the  poor

the benefits of obtaining a loan at a cheaper rate

of  interest. This, of course, does not meet  with

favour by the pawnshop operators, who live on  the

interest  paid by the poor. In the course  of  the

deliberations   on  this  Bill,  the   pawnbrokers

attempted  to coerce the Government by  suspending

business  even  before the  Bill  becomes  law.  A

warning issued by the Government to withdraw their

licences  brought them to their senses.  Within  a

few  days,  the  pawnshops resumed  business.  The

pawnbrokers  have  learnt that  if  they  want  to

convince  the Government of the justice  of  their

case,  coercion is not the proper way.  They  have

come  to  realise that this Government  cannot  be

cowed into submission by threats. Thus, after  the

resumption of their business, the pawnbrokers were

told  in a statement that the Government is always

prepared  to  consider their  views  if  they  can

produce  sound reasons to convince the  Government

of  the  justice of their actions. Since  then,  a

further   representation   has been   made   to

Government.   This   representation    is    under

consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Government has gone into the

question of providing alternative means of  giving

loans  to those who are in need. Several proposals

are  now under consideration, and its implications

examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause before the House is to give the

Government  more flexible power to deal  with  the

situation  in  the interim period by enabling  the

Minister  to vary the rate of profits whenever  he

thinks the time is opportune. In order that  those

who  have to frequent the pawnshops should receive

some   immediate  benefit  from  the  Government's

policy of helping the poor and at the same time to

avoid  a  possible  temporary dislocation  of  the

service  in  case pawnbrokers resort to exploiting

those  who  are  in distress, the  Government  has

decided  when  the  Bill  becomes  law  that   the

Minister  should exercise the power  conferred  in

this clause to reduce the rate of interest from 24

per  cent  to 18 per cent per annum in  the  first

instance.  The Government will also take immediate

steps,  when the Bill becomes law, to reconstitute

the  Pawnbrokers Licensing Board so that  it  will

implement  the  Government's intention  of  having

more  competitors  in  the field  instead  of  the

present  monopolistic provision and to cancel  the

business  licences of those who deliberately  seek

to exploit the distressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   this   is   another  classic   example   of

Government's  inconsistency.  If  this  Government

feel  that they want to help the poor, so  do  we.

And  if Government feel that the pawnbrokers might

close  down,  thereby causing  difficulty  to  the

poor,    we    will   support   Government.    But

unfortunately this has happened, and a little  too

often, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, at the last sitting I

pointed out that "An Ordinance to suppress betting

places"  actually  legalises  and  promotes   more

gambling   places.  I  also  mentioned  that   the

monogamous   marriage  Bill  legalises  polygamous

marriages.  For mentioning that, I was accused  of

being  a chameleon, changing colours, changing  my

opinion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



and  after  having hailing the Bill at  a  women's

meeting, coming here and attacking it - that is just

the point of my argument, Sir. Yes, I did hear it.

But why did I then speak against it? It is because

when the monogamous marriage Bill was introduced-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are going right back to

debating   on   monogamy.  I   think   we   should

concentrate  on  this Bill now. I think  the  hon.

Member was quite correct in mentioning these facts

in  passing, but if she goes into detail and tries

to  reopen the debate on monogamy, of course,  she

is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I am not

trying  to  reopen  it. I am trying  to  show  how

Government confuses not only me but also the  rest

of  the  people in Singapore. I was just going  to

show  that  it was because I was confused  by  the

words  "a  monogamous  marriage",  which  legalise

polygamous marriages that made me say one thing at

one time and another thing at another time. In the

same  way,  this  is going to confuse  the  public

because  at  one  stage  the  amendments  in   the

Pawnbrokers  (Amendment) Bill were to  reduce  the

rate  of interest, but today, if the amendment  is

accepted  and  the  Bill is passed,  it  does  not

reduce the rate of interest. That was what  I  was

trying  to  compare  when I  mentioned  monogamous

marriages. When the Bill says it is out to do  one

thing  and in the end it does not do the thing  it

claims to do, the public gets so confused. When we

say  one  thing at one time and another  thing  at

another  time,  we  are accused  of  changing  our

minds.  We change our minds now because  the  Bill

has changed its colour, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, did say it was going to reduce

the rate of interest. The Minister did say, even

today, that it is to enable the poor people to be

able to get loans at a lower rate. After that, as

the Minister said, it did not meet with the

approval of the pawnbrokers. Not only did it not

meet with their approval, but the Government were

very firm in their decision. And when the

pawnbrokers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



threatened,  the Government threatened  in  return

and  told  them  in no uncertain terms  that  they

would  not  be  coerced. In the Select  Committee,

Sir,  the  Government showed firmness, and  I  had

great  confidence in them. Some of the members  of

the  public  did tell me that the Government  were

going to withdraw the clause reducing the rate  of

interest.  They seemed to believe that  they  knew

the  reason why the Government wanted to  withdraw

the clause. It did shake my confidence for a time.

But when I was in the Select Committee, I put that

all  to  idle  rumour, because the Government  was

very  firm.  In fact, some of the Members  of  the

Select  Committee on the Government  benches  were

selling  me  the idea, "Mrs Seow, do not  believe

the  pawnbrokers. They will never close down. This

is  just a bluff and they will continue even if we

reduce the rate." So I stood as firm as they  did

because  I  thought that they knew what they  were

talking about. Then, at the last sitting, when the

Third  Reading  of  the  Bill  was  deferred,   my

confidence  began to be a little shaken.  But  the

Minister  did reassure us that the measures  which

he  was  taking were - shall I quote him -  (this  is

dated 7th April, 1960):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just to give the Government time to take such

measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  counter  the

suspension of business by Singapore pawnbrokers."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> 7th of April of what?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Of the Straits Times. Well,

Sir,  having  been reassured like  this,  I  again

said, "What the public said was just wild rumour."

But today, Sir, the Minister has given me the idea

that  the  warning was something  more  than  wild

rumour,  because, after having been so firm,  Sir,

the  Minister  said, as reported  in  the  Straits

Times of 25th March, 1960:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Ong, in describing the pawnbrokers' refusal

to  accept the pledges as a calculated attempt  to

embarrass the Government, taking as an excuse  the

government's crisis, says,. 'No Government can  be

coerced  into accepting all kinds of  things.  The

moment  they  use this kind of tactics  we  cannot

ignore  the  situation that is  created  and  must

consider measures to stop it.'"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



That  was  quoted from the Straits Times  of  25th

March.  Then  on the 29th of March, it  was  again

reaffirmed, and this time the Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He had given the pawnbrokers a chance to

reconsider  their  action  before  the  Government

decided  to  take  `other measures'  to  meet  the

situation."



<br><br>Then,  on  the  30th of March, we  hear  that  Mr

Kularajah  is  starting  a  cooperative   pawnshop

society, and the Minister for Labour and Law said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a new venture in co-operative

enterprise."



<br><br>And   we  read  in  this  paper  that  the   draft

constitution  is  now  being  finalised   and   an

inaugural meeting to form the society will be held

next  week. After all this assurance, Sir, we have

come  here today to cancel that very clause  which

is going to reduce the interest rate.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you blame me, Sir, if I start wondering

whether, in view of the reason put forward by  the

public  and the warning that they have  given  me,

that  the Government for certain reasons  want  to

withdraw that amendment, there is anything more to

it  than just wild rumour? What are the Opposition

and  the  public  to think of this  inconsistency?

Government  have always said that they  cannot  be

pushed   from  pillar  to  post.  What  mysterious

powers,  Sir,  have the pawnbrokers  applied  that

they  have driven the Government now not only from

pillar to post, but from post to nowhere?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement to the Press, the Minister for

Home  Affairs  has  interpreted  the  pawnbrokers'

refusal   to   take  pledges  as  an  attempt   to

intimidate  Government, as I have read  just  now,

Sir. Now do the Government admit giving in to this

intimidation?  Otherwise, what could  explain  the

Government's wanting to withdraw that clause  now?

And  to  add insult to injury, Sir, after  showing

all  this weakness and inconsistency, we  are  now

asked  to  give  the Minister power  to  raise  or

reduce  the interest whenever he has more strength

to do it, since it has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



shown  that  he has given in to this  intimidation

and  is too weak to implement it. Now we are asked

to  give  him  power so that at any time  when  he

regains his strength he is going to implement it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cannot the Government decide one way or

another if by reducing the interest it is going to

be  detrimental to the State of Singapore and  its

people, the poor and the pawnbrokers? Cannot  they

decide, "We will not reduce it."? If they think it

is  good,  cannot they decide, "We will reduce  it

one  way  or  another", and not keep everybody  in

suspense,    the    pawnbrokers   included?    The

pawnbrokers do not know whether they are going  to

function on 2 per cent or whether tomorrow or  the

day  after  the  rate is going to be  1  per  cent

again - when the Minister has the power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would appeal to the Government to make a

decision.  Surely they know what  they  want.  Are

they  going to reduce the rate of interest or  are

they going to let it remain as it is?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Mountbatten seems to me to have a most simple

and innocent approach to this problem. Considering

that she has been a Member of the Select Committee

to  study the Pawnbrokers (Amendment) Bill,  I  am

horrified  to see how utterly ignorant she  is  of

the  problem  she is supposed to have  studied  on

behalf  of  the  Assembly and on  behalf  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Not the pawnbrokers!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> And not, as my colleague has

said,  on behalf of the pawnbrokers. If she thinks

that,  by this amendment, the Government is  being

chased from pillar to post, then she is even  more

foolish  than I thought any Member of the Assembly

could be. Obviously, she has not taken the trouble

to  read  today's  Order Paper  Supplement,  which

defines  the way in which the amendment to section

13 is being sought.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



May I read it for her benefit the actual wording

of the amendment we are now seeking:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PAWNBROKERS (AMENDMENT) BILL as reported from Select Committee (Paper L.A.

5 of 1960) - Recommittal in respect of the

following new clause:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause:

<pre>

'Amendment of

section 13.           Section 13 of the Pawnbrokers Ordinance is hereby

                      amended by inserting immediately after subsection (4)

                      thereof the following new subsections:-

                            "(5) The Minister may by order amend the rate of

                            profits and charges specified in Schedule B to

                            this Ordinance."'"

</pre>

<br><br>and so on and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no evidence whatsoever to support

the charge made by the Member for Mountbatten that

this  Government is being chased  from  pillar  to

post. On the contrary, when we discovered that the

pawnbrokers   were  attempting  to   coerce   this

Government,  we  called them up  and  said,  "Look

here, chums, don't try to be funny." And these are

salutary words, because the next morning they  all

opened  up.  And  this is not the behaviour  of  a

Government  that is being chased  from  pillar  to

post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say quite frankly that the fault lies

completely  and  entirely  with  the  pawnbrokers,

because they utterly failed to make a case  before

the  Select Committee. The Member for Mountbatten,

being  associated with big business which,  as  we

know, gives full support to the S.P.A., must  have

advised  the  Select Committee about the  way  the

pawnbrokers  operate.  Members  of  the   People's

Action  Party  can be excused for not  having  the

depth  of knowledge about the intricacies  of  the

pawnbrokers'  business.  Either  the  Member   for

Mountbatten  took her duties very  lightly  during

this Committee Stage, or there were other reasons,

of  which  I cannot understand, why she could  not

have  assisted the pawnbrokers to lay  their  case

before the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pawnbrokers made such a poor case that the

Select  Committee had no alternative but to reject

the  application for reconsidering the  reduction

of the rate of interest. But after the findings of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



the Select Committee were known, Government made a

study  of  the method of financing pawnshops,  the

whole  machinery  of pawnshop financing,  and  the

system  of  loans, and they came to the conclusion

that  the  matter was not as simple as either  the

Select Committee believed on the one hand,  or  as

straight, forward  as  the  pawnbrokers,  through

their solicitor, had made out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the whole pawn business is in itself an

isolated money market in Singapore. Because of its

special  function within a limited sector  of  the

economy,  it became possible for the pawn  broking

business  to draw a substantial amount of  capital

at   comparatively  high  rates  of  interest  for

lending  to  persons, mostly  consumers,  at  even

higher rates of interest. The pawnbrokers were,  I

think,  right in saying that a great  majority  of

their  capital came from small deposits loaned  to

them by miscellaneous small men, possibly hawkers,

small businessmen and so on, at very high rates of

interest,  which vary from time to time, depending

on  how urgent the demand of the pawnbroker is for

this  short-term capital. Because the  people  who

have   this  capital - and  they  are  mostly  small

people - have not developed the more modern approach

to  means of investment, they are willing to  part

with their capital at very high rates of interest,

round  about  12  per cent per  year.  Given  this

fundamental  factor  that  a  great  part  of  the

capital which the pawnbrokers now rely on can only

be  obtained at 12 per cent interest per year,  it

is  not  reasonable to expect that they will  lend

money  at an identical rate of interest.  That  is

one aspect of the money market in the pawn broking

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect, and this is more vital, is

that  when  pawnbrokers are short of  capital  for

some  reason or other, and they cannot go to  this

group  of small savers for loans to help them  out

of  a very tight financial position, they have, as

lenders in the last resort, the goldsmiths who, as

a  result of convention and tradition, have agreed

to  accept  pledges  made  to  pawnshops  and  not

redeemed at certain agreed price levels. Now  what

complicated the position after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



the  Select  Committee's Report was published  was

that a number of goldsmiths, for reasons which are

still obscure, had to go out of business, and that

confused the whole situation. This was one of  the

principal reasons which led the Government to come

to the conclusion that it would be prudent for the

time being to have a reappraisal of the situation.

Hence  the  amendment that we now seek. This  will

give  the Minister authority from time to time  to

lay  down the maximum rate of interest which could

be charged on pledges. And I can assure the Member

for  Mountbatten that the rate of  interest  which

will  be  effective forthwith would be  a  reduced

rate of interest, and we are carrying on with  our

intention to see that the poor people who have  to

borrow  money  can  do so at  as  low  a  rate  of

interest as possible. The rate of interest is  the

price which a borrower has to pay for the loan  of

capital,  and  that price must vary from  time  to

time  according to the supply and demand  position

in  the  market. It is, therefore, necessary  when

one regulates a price, whether it is the price  of

a  commodity  or the price of a loan  of  capital,

that  there  should be provision for variation  to

meet the supply and demand position of the market.

We are of the opinion, having studied the question

in  some detail, that it is not possible today  to

bring down the rate of interest as rapidly as  was

originally envisaged in the first Bill. And it may

take some time before we could reduce the rate  of

interest to that extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many factors in the situation which

have to be dealt with before we can make available

to  persons, who want loans from pawnshops,  loans

on  low terms which we think the poor need and the

poor deserve.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may take some time because it means that the

market  for  loan money must be made  more  fluid.

Obviously here, the short-term market for  capital

which  the  pawnbrokers  are  now  tapping  is  an

imperfect market in that the people who have money

can only channel it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



through  this one sources  When we make  available

to  them  other sources of investment,  the  final

result no doubt will be that the rates of interest

which  they  now  receive will be reduced  in  the

course  of  time. Of course, the one factor  which

makes   for  high  rates  of  interest   in   this

particular   sector   of  the   economy   is   the

instability  of the pawnbrokers' business  itself.

Supposing you are to lend your life savings  to  a

pawn  broking  business. You have $3,000  and  you

know that there is a certain risk - the business may

go  bankrupt and the man may disappear. You  would

expect  a  higher rate of interest than  what  you

would  get from Government bonds. That is  in  the

nature of things. But when we improve on the whole

organisation of this particular part of  the  loan

market, I say the end result will be that we shall

be  able  to provide a lower rate of interest  for

patrons of pawnshops than it is possible today.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the facts which the Hon. Minister for Finance says

only  reached  the  Government  after  the  Select

Committee had submitted its report and as a result

of which Government is now having second thoughts,

to  my  mind,  were all available  in  the  report

itself.  The  pawnbrokers were  represented  by  a

lawyer. They gave their evidence before the Select

Committee.  The facts which the Hon. the  Finance

Minister  now says impel the Government to  change

its  mind and to reconsider its decision were  all

available to the Select Committee. The fact that a

greater  portion of the monies which are lent  out

by  the  pawnbrokers are monies invested by  small

men at 12 per cent or 10.8 per cent is set out  in

the  evidence  contained in the  Select  Committee

Report.  What the Finance Minister has  now  said -

that is to say when the major portion of the money

comes from investors who get 12 per cent on it, it

is  hardly reasonable to expect the pawnbrokers to

lend  out  at  I  per  cent, was  all  within  the

knowledge of the Select Committee. Even  in  spite

of  that  the  Select Committee would not  deviate

from   the  position  which  the  Government   had

originally taken up; that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



would  bring the rate of interest on loans by  the

pawnbrokers  to  the same level  as  that  of  the

moneylenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

Finance  Minister is not correct in  his  estimate

that  one has to go carefully over this situation.

But  I  do  accuse the Government  of  introducing

legislation such as this in a hasty manner, and of

not thinking out all the full implications of such

a  move  before  the  Bill is introduced  in  this

House.  I  would  submit,  with  respect  to   the

Minister  for  Home Affairs, that before  he  even

thought  of  introducing such a measure  he  might

have  consulted the pawnbrokers, found  out  where

their  money  market was, and  how  they  financed

their  loans; if he had taken that little  trouble

to  go into these matters, he might possibly  have

satisfied himself at that early stage that  1  per

cent  for pawnbrokers was not possible. Even  when

the   Minister   for   Home  Affairs   moved   the

postponement of consideration of the Report of the

Select  Committee after the pawnbrokers  had  made

their  representations, the Minister did not  give

any  inkling to the House that the Government  was

having  second  thoughts  about  the  matter.  The

impression  given  to  this  House  was  that  the

adjournment of the consideration of the  Bill  was

being  sought  for to tell the pawnbrokers  in  no

uncertain  terms to behave and not for the  reason

that  the  pawnbrokers had made out a  good  case.

However, Sir, there is another aspect of the  Bill

in which I am particularly interested. It is this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is highly undesirable as a form of

legislation,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  that,  where  the

Bill  itself  sets out a fixed rate  of  interest,

there  should  be further provision  in  the  Bill

enabling  the  Minister by an Order  to  vary  the

statutory provision of a fixed rate of interest. I

think  such  legislation  is  highly  undesirable,

particularly  when  the  Minister,  on   his   own

account,  can,  by  an Order,  vary  the  rate  of

interest either up or down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister for Finance has said that until

economic  conditions in this country  settle  down

and  people have other avenues of investment,  and

until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



such  time  as people give up the idea  that  they

must get this high rate of interest on investment,

we will be left with the position that pawnbrokers

can only get a major portion of their monies which

they  can  lend out from small investors who  will

ask high rates of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that introducing the new

subsections (5) and (6) into the existing  section

13  is no way of keeping invested the monies  that

are  already going into the pawn broking business.

Unless  the  investors  are satisfied  that  their

monies  will  remain at a given rate of  interest,

without  the  unilateral action  of  the  Minister

intervening and reducing their rates of  interest,

I  am afraid very few people will invest with  the

pawnbrokers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Buy gilt-edged bonds!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am on the topic of pawnbrokers, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  We are told that  the  pawnbroking

business  today  is working at half-steam  because

the majority of the small investors have withdrawn

their  monies and because of the uncertainty  with

regard to the present position. We understand that

about $15 million to $20 million have already been

withdrawn.  If  uncertainty is to  continue  as  a

result  of  this legislation, that $15 million  to

$20   million  will  stay  away  permanently  and,

possibly,  yet  more money will be withdrawn  from

this particular type of banking facility, which is

now available to the poor man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has probably made up its mind what

the  rate of interest should be. If Government has

made up its mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, then I suggest

that  Government  should  set  out  the  rate   of

interest  in  the  Bill  and  not  hide  behind  a

Minister's order. Surely, the Government must have

some   idea   now  after  all  these   months   of

investigation. I believe, they have spent 6  or  7

months   investigating  this  particular  problem.

Government should know now what is the appropriate

and fair rate of profit, which a pawnbroker should

derive from his business. All the Government  need

say is that it wants to amend the figure "1"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



to  "1½".  I  think  the Hon.  Minister  for  Home

Affairs   in   his  Second  Reading  speech   said

Government was considering 18 per cent, that is if

I  have heard him correctly. All that the Minister

need have said was, "Strike out the figure `1' and

insert '1½' ". That would have met the situation,

instead  of keeping both the pawnbrokers  and  the

investing  public in the pawnbroking  business  in

doubt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether the

provision is specifically set out in the  Bill  as

1½   per  cent  or  in  the  rules  to  be   made

thereunder, uncertainty as to whether the  l½  per

cent  will continue indefinitely, or only for such

time  as  the  Government can either persuade  the

investors  or  the  pawnbrokers,  or  make   other

arrangements  to make capital available  for  this

particular form of enterprise. So long  as  it  is

the  intention of the Government to try and  bring

about  a  situation  whereby  interest  rates  are

reduced, then it does not matter whether you  have

written  1½ per cent into your statute or  whether

it is an order by the Minister which this Assembly

can  accept or reject. The provision is there.  In

my  submission, on principle, just  answering  the

point that the Member for Farrer Park has made, it

is  just as sound to say that a ministerial  order

can  vary  the interest, subject to this  Assembly

annulling it, because in any case, rather than  go

through   three  readings  on  a  certificate   of

urgency, I Thiok it is neater and more decorous to

have a debate arising out of a resolution to annul

a ministerial order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to answer the other point made by

the Member for Farrer Park. To a certain extent, I

would  say  that it is an irresistible  conclusion

that   the  Minister  for  Finance,  having  taken

everything  into consideration, has  decided  that

the Minister in charge should proceed warily. That

is  not the same as saying that we have decided to

allow  things to remain as they are  or  that  the

Pawnbrokers (Amendment) Bill was ill conceived. It

has  brought the rate down from 24 per cent to  18

per cent in the first instance. It is a continuing

issue for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



some  time.  It  is the opinion of the  Government

that  the  borrowing impecunious public should  be

made to pay less heavily for their unthrifty ways.

But ultimately the issue is this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we are not resolving this matter

with  a finality which should perhaps be desirable

in these matters. Not being able for reasons which

the  Minister  for  Finance has stated,  to  bring

about the final position in one phase, I think the

Members on the other side should be grateful  that

we  have  decided to face the position by reducing

gradually, and we hope less painfully, from 24 per

cent to 18 per cent. Meanwhile, of course, I think

the   pawnbrokers  are  fully   aware   that   the

Government intends not only to hear evidence,  but

also  to  know  from its positive  operations  the

conditions of the pawnbroking business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in India the banks run a

pawnbroking  business. Every  bank  has  a  branch

which   has   a   pawnbroking   department.   That

possibility here is being explored. In Israel, the

State  runs a pawnbroking business. I think  there

is  as much a measure of finality in economic  and

financial matters for the pawnbroking business  as

is possible in the circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the Prime

Minister has very effectively dealt with the point

why the rate of interest should not be set down on

the  statute book, because we expect that, in  the

course  of  time, there will be further variations

in the rate of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reply to the other point made by

the  Member for Farrer Park; it is that during the

Select Committee's consideration of this Bill, all

information  was made available to us.  I  dispute

this  point,  Mr  Speaker. It is  true  that  the

pawnbrokers presented a case.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various measures were proposed but it was

necessary  to  evaluate  the  reliability  of  the

information  on which they were based  as  it  was

obvious  that the pawnbrokers were in the position

of  supplicants making out a case. They had an axe

to grind. And it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



a  misfortune that they did not present their case

as  ably  as they could. For instance, there  were

doubts  on at least two points. The first  was  on

the amount of profit that they made from the sales

of  unredeemed  pledges. There  were  also  doubts

whether the figures on the overhead costs  of  the

pawnbroking administration were correct.  And,  of

course,  the  whole business of the  role  of  the

goldsmith - the re-discount facilities, so to speak,

that  go  to  them - was not  at  all  brought  out

clearly  before the Select Committee. As a  Member

of  the  Opposition, the Member  for  Farrer  Park

could  hardly take the Government to task for  not

accepting  the  findings of the Select  Committee,

because  the  Opposition  Members  in  the  Select

Committee   came   to   agreement   over   certain

recommendations. And it was the Government itself,

in  the course of events which developed after the

publication     of    the    Select    Committee's

deliberations,  which sought  further  information

and   made  a  more  detailed  appraisal  of   the

situation.  And  it  came to the  conclusion  that

certain changes were necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking for

myself, I rather got the impression, after  having

read  the Report of the Select Committee that  the

Government had not given in to the representations

made  by  the pawnbrokers to the Select Committee,

that  the Government had already made up its  mind

on  one  per cent rate of interest per month,  and

that they were not going to be influenced one  way

or  the  other by any argument advanced by anybody

in Select Committee. What impressed me was that as

the  pawnbrokers borrowed at 10.8 or 12  per  cent

rate  of interest per annum, they could hardly  be

expected to lend at 12 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear from what the Hon, the Minister

for Finance has said that the pawnbrokers are,  in

fact,   performing  a  function  which  in   other

countries is either performed by State banks or by

the  Government itself. It is also  an  undisputed

fact  that a greater proportion of the money  lent

out  by  the  pawnbrokers to small borrowers  come

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



the   investing  public.  If,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

Government  is really keen and sincere  in  making

available to the public this form of service, then

I  think  that they should try to set the mind  of

the  investor  at rest. I am not saying  that  the

Minister for Home Affairs is not going to exercise

the power given to him in the best interest of the

State,  but  what I am telling the  Government  is

that  the  main objective should be to  create  an

atmosphere of confidence for the investor.  If  an

investor  who invests his money in January,  1960,

cannot  confidently  expect to  get  12  per  cent

interest  at the end of the next six months,  then

he  is  not going to lend. If a potential investor

had  this at the back of his mind, "Well, tomorrow

the  Minister might by an order vary the  rate  of

interest  in so far as the pawnbroker is concerned

from 18 per cent - or whatever it may be - to 10 or 12

per  cent:  naturally this is going to  affect  me

and, therefore, the pawnbroker will not be able to

pay  me  the  interest which he now says  he  will

pay."  then  he  would  Thiok  twice  and,  having

thought  twice, he might not go to the  pawnbroker

with  his  money for investment, thereby depriving

the  poor man of this service. The Government says

that  this  service is now being provided  by  the

pawnbroker  and  that if it is  not  going  to  be

provided,  then  either  a  State  bank   or   the

Government itself would have to provide it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the

question  is  rather more complex  than  what  the

Member  for Farrer Park has set out. These  people

are not the investing public in the sense that one

would  think they are if one reads the  commercial

page  of  the Straits Times. These people comprise

domestic  servants, small shop-keepers, vernacular

school teachers perhaps with small savings  of  up

to  $5,000, and the wives and widows of this class

of  people,  and  they have for  quite  some  time

regarded  this range of activities as  a  sort  of

normal means of investment. The pawnshop is one of

them.  Pawnbroking is fairly lucrative but rather

risky and speculative,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



because  the  pawnshop might pack  up.  Only  some

years  ago,  pawnshops have  packed  up  and  that

increases  the rate of interest below which  these

people  are not willing to lend their money.  Then

there  are  other  things. Goldsmiths  too  borrow

money  from these people at fairly high  rates  of

interest.  The  greater the risk, the  higher  the

rate  of interest charged. Therefore, the question

of  inducing a supply of capital from these people

is not something that could be decided just by one

act of legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole problem is one of bringing home to

these people the fact that there are other avenues

for   investment.  There  are  the  stock   market

equities, Government loan market, property market,

and  so  forth, which it is true may  yield  lower

returns  but  which, in the long run, taking  into

account  the  risks  involved,  are  more  to   be

preferred than speculative ventures such  as  they

have been accustomed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I cannot agree with the Member for Farrer

Park  that the fixing of the rate of interest once

and  for all would increase the confidence of this

class  of  investors in the supply of  capital  to

pawnshops.

Members on the Select Committee expressed the view

that  if  this threat should materialise, then  it

would  be the responsibility of the Government  to

undertake the running of the pawnbroking  business

themselves or to devise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



some  ways or means whereby the greater proportion

of  the people who patronise these pawnshops could

borrow  money. But what is most astonishing  today

is  the  Government's proposed  amendment  to  the

Bill.  The  Government has said that it cannot  be

pushed  from pillar to post, but I am  afraid  the

inconsistent  stand adopted by it  on  this  issue

would  appear to mean that it is not  prepared  to

fight  for  the masses but that it is prepared  to

kowtow to the threats of the capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of the Opposition has said, this

matter  was not gone through in a thorough manner.

The  Minister himself has said that members of the

P.A.P. did  not  know much about the  pawnbroking

business as regards the supply of capital. But  it

should be the responsibility of the Government  to

look  after  the  affairs of the  poor  people  of

Singapore  and  it  should  be  the  duty  of  the

Government to go thoroughly into this Bill  before

embarking  upon  certain steps.  This  is  another

example where the Government has embarked  upon  a

certain  scheme and cause suffering  to  the  poor

people, some of whom depend on the pawnbrokers for

loans. I would like to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

this  Bill  will not only affect the  Malays,  but

also  the people of other races comprising trishaw

riders, hawkers, and so on. Whenever they  are  in

difficulty, they have nowhere else to borrow money

from,  except the pawnshops. During Han Raya Puasa

(Malay  fasting  day), some Malays faced  hardship

because of the steps taken by the pawnshops  which

refused to accept pledges, and some of them had to

go  over  to  Johore Bahru to pawn their  pledges.

This  is  an  example of how unwise the Government

has  been  in  taking such a  hasty  step  to  the

detriment of the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, on this amendment, the Opposition has charged

that the Government has been driven from pillar to

post.  Far from it. We have proved that we can  be

very  firm and yet reasonable. In deleting  clause

5, we are taking a realistic view.

<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite impossible to legislate at one per

cent  when  economic and trading  conditions  vary

from  time  to  time. From the evidence  taken  in

Select  Committee, it is evident that much of  the

capital   that   is   being  employed   by   these

pawnbrokers is borrowed capital. It also  goes  to

show  that they do not have sufficient capital  to

operate this pawnbroking business. Therefore, much

of their income goes out to pay high dividends to

these  small-time investors. If they  could  rally

sufficient  capital of their own  to  operate  the

pawnbroking business, I am sure they will be  able

to  operate  at  one  per  cent.  If  co-operative

societies in this country can operate at  one  per

cent  and  pay dividends to their members  at  the

rate  of 3 to 5 per cent per year, I see no reason

why  pawnshops in this country which operate on  a

larger  scale will not be able to operate  at  one

per cent.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

matter  is confusing enough without the Government

trying  to  confuse us further. The  Minister  for

Finance accuses me of having taken the proceedings

of the Select Committee very lightly. I do not see

any  reason  why,  because the Minister  for  Home

Affairs,  or  the Government, and  the  Opposition

walked out of that Select Committee with the  same

opinion, we should stand firm by our decision.  If

the  Minister  means that the present  gesture  of

Government  to  negative clause 5, which  we  have

decided upon in Select Committee, is the result of

the  Government's extra energy or extra  attention

in  the  Select Committee, then that,  of  course,

cannot  be  proved because when Government  walked

out, it had the same opinion as the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other confusing point is this: if Government

is  going to negative the clause because  it  paid

more  attention  in  Select  Committee  than   the

Opposition, it means that the representations from

the  pawnbrokers  in  Select Committee  were  more

effective to Government than they could have  been

to  the Opposition. But Government claims that the

pawnbrokers did not make out a good case. If  they

did  not  make  out  a  good  case,  then  why  is

Government going to negative clause 5 today?  Sir,

this is all very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



confusing. On the one hand, Government  says  that

the  pawnbrokers did not make out a good case but,

on  the other hand, it is Government who is giving

in to them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Just a short rejoinder, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  When I said that  the  Member  for

Mountbatten  had  taken  her  duties   in   Select

Committee  rather lightly, perhaps I  should  have

qualified  my  remark that it  was  based  on  the

assumption - and  I think a correct  assumption - that

since  the  Government  is  on  the  side  of  the

workers,  the  Opposition is on the  side  of  the

business  interests. Therefore, when we  hear  the

Opposition Members of the Select Committee saying,

"One  per  cent is all right", well  what  do  you

expect the Government to do?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which she made - I was just about

to jot it down when she concluded, and I am afraid

I have to leave my remarks at this stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I wish to say that the Government's

intention  to  help the poor has not deviated.  In

fact, this is the underlying factor in many of the

Bills  that the Government has introduced. If  the

Opposition  Members had listened carefully  to  my

speech  just now, they would have been aware  that

the  moment  the  Bill  becomes  law,  it  is  the

intention of the Government to reduce the rate  of

interest  from 2 per cent to 1½ per cent  in  the

first  instance. In dealing with this matter,  the

Government  has  to  take into  consideration  the

position of the fluctuating money market. But  the

stands.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report of the Select Committee on the

Societies (Amendment) Bill has been published and

is  in  the hands of Members of the Assembly.  It

will  be observed that considerable interest  was

evinced  in the Bill and quite a number  of  oral

and written representations were made on the Bill

by  individuals,  parties and  associations  with

various shades of opinion. The Report shows  that

in  the final reprint of the Bill, as amended  by

the  Select  Committee, the  Government  has  not

acted in a dictatorial manner or shown itself  to

be   indifferent  to  the  views  expressed   and

suggestions made by Members of the Opposition and

public  bodies and associations. On the contrary,

the    Government   has   given   very    careful

consideration   to   the  views   submitted   and

objections  raised and, as can  be  seen  in  the

Report,  has  accepted and  incorporated  in  the

final Bill a number of the points raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cite some of the principal changes which

are  worthy  of note and which are indicative  of

the  Government's  considerate  attitude  in  the

deliberations  of this Bill. The  Government  had

already stated that there was no ulterior  motive

in requiring political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



associations to register. But in order  to  allay

any   fear  still  further,  the  Government  has

agreed,  in  clause  5  of  the  Bill,  that  the

Registrar  shall not have the power to  call  for

the   minutes  of  any  meeting  of  a  political

association  or  ask  for a list  of  members  of

political  associations. In order to  remove  all

doubt,   clause  4  now  makes  it   clear   that

previously  excluded societies, like a  Lodge  of

Freemasons or political associations, would  also

be  given a year's time, like exempted societies,

to register under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 now gives a person the right to appeal

to  the  Minister  against  the  refusal  of  the

Registrar  to consent to the change of  place  of

business    of    a   society.   This    followed

representations  made  that  the  Registrar   may

unreasonably withhold his permission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 8, the words "place of meeting" have

been deleted, in view of representations made  of

the  difficulty in notifying the Registrar  every

time a place of meeting is to be changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of various representations made in

respect  of clause 11 in the original Bill,  this

clause  has been negatived and substituted  by  a

new  clause  14  which meets some of  the  points

raised   in  these  representations.  The  former

clause  11 gave rise to misunderstanding  of  the

Government's  intentions,  which  has  now   been

dispelled by the new clause. Under clause 14 only

ex-office bearers of dissolved societies are made

guilty of an offence under the Ordinance it  they

become  office-bearers of another society without

the  written  permission of the  Minister  within

three   years  of  the  date  of  the  previously

dissolved society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clauses 15 and 16 introduce

Government's amendments to sections 18 and 19  of

the Ordinance to provide for additional effective

control and supervision of shady societies by the

Registrar,  or suspected by him of  indulging  in

moral  abuses,  by enabling him to authorise  the

Police to investigate and report on them.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I was one of the

Members of the Select Committee. When the Muslims

(Amendment)  Bill was discussed,  many  questions

concerning  payment to the kathi  were  asked  by

various  sections  of society. According  to  the

directive  issued by the Minister, the  kathi  is

empowered by the Shariah Court to charge a fee of

$30  if the marriage is held in the house of  the

bride or the bridegroom, and $15 if it is held in

the   house  of  the  kathi.  But,  Mr  Speaker,

unfortunately, there are many kathis in Singapore

who  do  not  make  proper  assessments  because,

according  to  the rules, $15  and  $30  are  the

maximum amounts, which means that a lesser amount

could  be  paid,  but  some  of  the  kathis   in

Singapore demand the full payment, that  is,  $30

or $15 as the case may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious matter from the point of view

of  Malay  opinion in Singapore, and I  hope  the

Minister  concerned will give  consideration,  if

possible,  to  amend  the rules  of  the  Shariah

Court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A1, line 17 to line 1 in page A2, to

leave  out "either as the principal object or  as

an  ancillary object" and insert "as the sole  or

principal object".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure it is not the intention of the

Government  that  this  legislation  should  cause

inconvenience  to more people than  is  necessary.

Sir,    the   definition   of   "mutual    benefit

organisation"  is so wide in its scope  that  many

organisations which should not be registered  will

have  to  apply  for registration or  be  declared

illegal. The purpose of my amendment, Sir,  is  to

limit  the  scope so that those which  should  not

register  need not register. Sir, the  definition,

as  it  stands, makes no difference between mutual

benefit organisations which have that aim  as  its

principal  or  main object, and those  whose  main

object  is  something else but which  have,  as  a

subordinate or ancillary function, the  giving  of

some mutual benefit. Sir, in page A2, clause 2 (c)

opens the door very wide indeed. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the relief or maintenance of the members or

subscribers   when  unemployed   or   when   in

distressed circumstances;".



<br><br>Sir,  if  the staff of a business firm  feel  that

they  want  to  help the widow and the  fatherless

children  of a colleague of theirs who  has  died,

and  they  pass the hat round, I believe they  may

immediately  be  regarded  as  coming  under  this

provision,  because they are providing  relief  or

maintenance  of  the members or  subscribers  when

unemployed  or  when in distressed  circumstances.

Supposing  in  a  school the  teachers  subscribed

money  to aid members of their staff and the  boys

subscribed  money  to  aid the  members  of  their

class,  would  that  come  under  this  provision?

Supposing in the case of a religious organisation,

where  they have a small section to aid  the  poor

members, would they then have to register twice? I

believe  they  have  to.  In  the  case  of  other

religious organisations like the Buddhist temples,

if  they  have a small section devoted to  helping

their members, I believe they will come under this

provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose stated by the Government in

introducing this Bill is that a good many  persons

have    taken   advantage   of   mutual    benefit

organisations  to  get  up  their   own   spurious

organisations in order to swindle the  public.  We

agree with that purpose. It is a very desirable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



object.  But  surely  in  order  to  achieve  that

objective, it could be so done that not  too  much

inconvenience  and not too many  difficulties  are

caused  to honest and charitable people who  would

then  be discouraged by the requirements of having

to  revise their rules, to invest funds in certain

trustee securities and postal savings bank,  where

they draw less interest than elsewhere, having  to

employ  an  auditor and having to employ  a  book-keeper  to  draw up a

statement of accounts  every

year.  Surely some of these could be  excluded  by

limiting  the definition to such organisations  as

have  mutual  benefit as their sole  or  principal

object, and not as an ancillary object.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing, Sir, they all apply, they fill in the

forms   and   they  write  to  the  Registrar   of

Societies. We wonder whether the Registrar or  his

assistant  will have the time to study  all  these

documents. Very likely after all the trouble taken

by so many people, the documents will just pile up

and  the Registrar will wait for complaints before

he  goes  into  an investigation  of  the  various

societies. If that is the case, why not wait until

the complaints come and, in the meantime, make the

gate  narrower so that those, which apply, are  in

such numbers that the documents can be handled  by

the   staff   of   the  Registrar  of   Societies.

Otherwise,     it    is    imposing    unnecessary

difficulties, like the old-fashioned method  where

the  teacher  says to a boy, "All right,  write  a

thousand  lines", when we know very well that  the

teacher will not go through the thousand lines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks very much

as if the Member for Tanglin is even more confused

than  the Member for Mountbatten on the matter  of

mutual  aid organisations. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

purpose  of  this Bill is to bring  under  control

organisations,  which  receive  subscriptions   or

donations from their members in return for  future

benefits.  That is the purpose of  this  Bill.  It

will  never cover those cases, which he  has  just

imagined; say, somebody suddenly gets ill  in  the

Anglo-Chinese School and they pass the hat round.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



Surely  that is not a mutual aid organisation.  If

you    will    look    at   the   definition    of

"subscription" - these associations  always  collect

subscriptions - you will see what the word means:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"subscription" means a subscription paid by a

member   or   subscriber  to  a   mutual   benefit

organisation'-



<br><br>that is, the payment of the subscriptions must  be

to a mutual aid organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there must be an organisation. It must have

members in it. They must pay subscriptions or make

donations. That is the sort of thing that we  have

in mind.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is need of a definition for mutual aid.

Everyone  must know exactly what it is. There  are

many  organisations, which say they have principal

objects,   which   do  not  concern   mutual   aid

activities,   but   have  nevertheless   ancillary

activities, which cover mutual aid activities. The

net   must   be  enlarged  to  catch   all   these

organisations. If there is to be a definition of a

mutual   benefit  organisation,  it  must   be   a

comprehensive one. This definition must be  looked

at also in relation to clause 45. In clause 45, it

is  provided  that contributions made  to  a  life

assurance  company  or co-operative  societies  or

trade  unions will be excluded from the  operation

of  this Ordinance. In all other cases where their

primary  object  does not concern  mutual  benefit

activities, they nevertheless must register  under

the  Ordinance; otherwise, there would be no means

of  introducing  an  effective control  over  such

organisations.

may  be peculiar and although we do not have  what

is known as a mutual benefit organisation, we have

a  teachers'  society where the members  subscribe

regularly. If somebody is in need, the members may

decide to vote money. Would they come under this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is an illegal society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Then it becomes illegal. That

is  the  point, Sir. Reference has  been  made  to

clause  45.  Both  of them are related  really.  I

wonder  if  it will be proper for me to debate  on

clause 45 as well, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It might be convenient to touch on

that amendment as well, so that when we do come to

clause  45,  there  can just be  a  formal  motion

before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, at the Select Committee

meetings  two  ways were suggested  by  which  the

number of societies affected could be reduced. One

was  by  narrowing the gate and letting a  smaller

number come in to register. The other was to  make

the  gate as wide as possible, and when they  come

in,  the  Minister  would be given  the  power  to

exempt as many categories as he thought should  be

exempted.  The  categories  mentioned   as   being

deserving  of  exemption were insurance  companies

and  bona  tide voluntary charitable and religious

organisations.   The  words   "bona   fide"   were

purposely  inserted  because we  all  desire  that

spurious  organisations should not be  registered.

But  what  did  we find, Sir? When  the  Bill,  as

amended,  came  before  the Select  Committee  for

adoption, we found that the Government had decided

to   exempt   insurance  companies - that   is   all

right - trade   unions - we  do  not   mind   that - co-

operative   societies -  we  do   not   mind   that

either - and  exclude bona fide voluntary charitable

and religious organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Government might not have

realised it, the implication is bad. It means that

of  those  bona  fide  societies  which  could  be

exempted,  the  Government  has  decided  that  in

addition  to  insurance companies,  only  the  co-operative societies and the trade unions  will  be

included. What about the others? Does it mean that

they  are  not  to be trusted? Does it  mean  that

their  standard of honesty is not as high as  that

of  the  trade unions and co-operative  societies?

Surely,  we know there are good elements  and  bad

elements  in  all  spheres  of  life  and  in  all

organisations. If we decide to exempt, say,  trade

unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



and  co-operative  societies, then  by  all  means

exempt  also  bona fide voluntary  charitable  and

religious  organisations. If you do  not  wish  to

exempt   bona   fide  voluntary   charitable   and

religious  organisations, then  why  exempt  trade

unions and co-operative societies? I wonder if the

Government  fully  realises the  wrong  impression

that  might  go around. That this Government  does

not  like  religious societies and  voluntary  and

charitable  organisations.  I  therefore  ask  the

Government  to  reconsider the question.  We  went

further  into this and the impression,  which  the

representors and Members of the Opposition got  in

the  Select  Committee was that the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Labour and  Law  was

quite   convinced,   like  ourselves,   that   the

suggestion was reasonable. But, of course, he knew

that  he  was  not  the  one  to  make  the  final

decision.  I would like to read to the House  from

the  Report of the Select Committee on the  Mutual

Benefit  Organisations Bill, page  C85,  questions

Nos. 831 and 833:



<br><br><div align="center">"Mr Wee Toon Boon</div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;831. Mr Speaker, you have taken some

considerable  time to point out what actually  the

representor  has in mind. It appears  to  me  that

what  he  has  in mind is that those  institutions

such  as  medical benefit societies  or  financial

companies  or  those  run on  a  commercial  basis

should   be  registered.  Is  that  Mr   Rayner's

opinion?".



<br><br>Mr Rayner's reply was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is so.".



<br><br>Mr Wee Toon Boon speaking again:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, just now Mr Rayner also said that

not  all  religious organisations were  bona  fide

organisations, if we were to accept  the  proposal

that  there should be provision for the  exemption

of  certain  organisations, would  he  agree  that

provision  should  also be  made  to  check  those

organisations   which  had  been   exempted   from

registration under the Bill?".



<br><br>We  jump,  Sir, to question 833 - you  are  speaking

here, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anyway, the principle which the Parliamentary

Secretary   has  in  mind  is  accepted   by   you

(addressed  to  Mr Rayner), the  principle  being

that if you are to exempt, there must be power  in

some  way,  either  in  the  Bill  or  some  other

Ordinance,  to  look  into the  affairs  of  those

organisations exempted?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Mr Rayner's reply was:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I entirely agree, Sir.".



<br><br>Mr Wee Toon Boon asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, could the witness suggest what

sort  of  check we could put on the management  of

exempted institutions?".



<br><br>You said, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is what Mr Rayner has explained?

-In  the  first  place, they  will  probably  be

registered under the Societies Ordinance. That  is

your first check. Should there be a whisper of any

abuses, the Registrar of Societies will call  them

up  immediately under his powers, If the Registrar

of  Societies  finds that they are  abusing  their

powers, he  will  no doubt communicate  with  the

Registrar under this Bill.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we ask, as a compromise, a partial and not

even  complete  exemption for bona fide  voluntary

charitable   and  religious  organisations.   Full

exemption   is   being  given  to  trade   unions,

cooperative societies and insurance companies. For

voluntary  charitable and religious  organisations

of  the  bona fide type, we ask only for a partial

exemption.  After they have applied for  exemption

and   the  Government,  after  investigation,  has

considered  that  certain organisations  are  bona

fide, then these organisations should be exempted.

I  am  sure,  Sir, that in order not  to  give  an

impression  that  there  is  discrimination,  this

concession could be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have given

considerable thought to this Bill and we  find  it

necessary  to  take  powers to  control  all  such

organisations, whether their primary  objects  are

matters which concern mutual benefit activities or

not. That is very essential to a proper scheme  of

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Tanglin

has  overlooked the provisions of clause 15. If  I

may  invite him now to take a second look at  this

clause.  There  it is provided that "a  registered

organisation   shall  not  be  affected   by   the

provisions  of  the  Societies  Ordinance,  if  no

activities  are carried on by it other than  those

of a mutual benefit organisation." If it is purely

a  mutual benefit organisation, then it need  only

register  under  this Ordinance. But  if  such  an

organisation intends to function as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



society as well, then it would be necessary for it

to be registered under the Societies Ordinance. At

present,  the  whole  position  is  very  confused

because mutual aid organisations and societies all

appear  on the same register. That has facilitated

considerable  fraud  in the  setting-up  of  these

organisations. I will refer the Member for Tanglin

to clause 46 of this Bill. The distinction is made

there  between  the  honest  type  of  mutual  aid

organisation   registered  under   the   Societies

Ordinance,  and the dishonest type of association,

which  has  hitherto been acting fraudulently.  In

the  case  of those associations which  run  these

mutual  benefit  schemes and which are  registered

under the Business Names Ordinance, they would  be

required  to  register under this  Bill  within  a

period  of  three  months.  In  the  case  of  the

reputable  type of organisations,  which  are  all

registered  under  the Societies  Ordinance,  they

have  a  period of one year in which to  register.

That means to say, if they find that they are,  in

fact,  nothing  more  or  less  than  mutual   aid

organisations,  then  within  a  year  they   must

register under this Bill. Now, if they are  mutual

aid  organisations and also function as societies,

they  will  have to register themselves under  the

Societies  Ordinance as well as under  this  Bill.

That is what we have tried to do in this Bill.  We

have excluded life insurance companies, those  co-

operative societies, which run benefit schemes, as

well  as those trade unions, which also run mutual

benefit schemes, from the provisions of this Bill.

Now  in  the case of the association of  teachers,

which  the  Member for Tanglin is very  interested

in,  if  it has a mutual benefit scheme, then  all

that  it has to do is to register within one  year

after this Bill. If it is already registered under

the  Societies  Ordinance, this registration  will

continue.   So  there  should  be  no   difficulty

whatsoever, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am sorry

if  I gave the impression that, I was fighting for

those  organisations, which have,  as  their  main

object, the running of a mutual benefit scheme.  I

was  not. I was pleading, as the representor,  Mr

Rayner,  had pleaded before the Select  Committee,

for those who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



already  registrable under the Societies Ordinance

and whose activities are not of the mutual benefit

society  kind  to  be exempted.  For  instance,  a

religious organisation has the worship of  God  as

its main object. Then, as an ancillary object,  it

has   a   benevolent   section.   Now,   such   an

organisation,  I believe, must register  a  second

time.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Chinese temples which operate

mutual  benefit  schemes on a  big  scale  as  the

principal  object, they should be  registered.  We

are  not asking that such temples be exempted. But

in  the  case  of  other organisations  where  the

benevolent  section is an ancillary  object,  they

should be put on an equal footing with that of the

trade unions and cooperative societies.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of the amendment moved by the Member  for

Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the object of the Government

is  to  control undesirable organisations for  our

own  benefit. I believe that the purpose  of  this

Bill  is  to abolish secret societies,  which  run

illegal benefit schemes for their members. No  one

can oppose these objects. But I fear, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  the extent to which the Government  is

attempting  to  control these  illegal  activities

will  cause considerable hardship and difficulties

to innocent and honest citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the explanations given by the Minister for

Labour and Law in reply to the questions raised by

Members of the Opposition, I am not confident that

religious  organisations  will  receive  exemption

from  registration. In the past, the  majority  of

these  religious organisations were exempted  from

registration  and, as I have said, the  object  of

these  organisations is primarily  to  assist  and

look after the welfare of the members. The form of

the  assistance is varied and wide  in  scope.  In

difficult circumstances, these organisations  come

to the aid of their members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if these organisations have to

be  registered, I am afraid that  they  will  not

have   the   means   to  do  so,   unlike   other

organisations.  Some  of  the  members  of  these

mutual  benefit  organisations are  aged  people.

Some of them go to mosques (surau); they are  not

active  and  they are very poor. It is  difficult

for  them  to comply with the provisions  of  the

law,  as they cannot actively participate in  the

running  of  their organisations. It is  possible

that  they may even be afraid of becoming members

of such organisations, and this will lead them to

believe  that  they have no freedom  to  practise

their own religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the Opposition Members are

pressing for the amendment moved and we hope that

the  Government  will look thoroughly  into  this

matter.  As  the Government has reconsidered  its

attitude   towards  the  Pawnbrokers  (Amendment)

Bill, I hope that the Minister for Labour and Law

will give special consideration to this amendment

in  the interest of the welfare of the people  of

Singapore.  Perhaps  the  Government   will   put

forward  an  excuse  saying that  such  religious

organisations  did not put up representations  to

the Select Committee. In the Report of the Select

Committee  on  the  Mutual Benefit  Organisations

Bill, it appears that the Buddhist temples sent a

representative  who was completely  in  the  dark

about   the   functions  of   Buddhist   temples.

Similarly,   the   members  of  other   religious

organisations who are old people do not know  the

provisions of the law, and I am afraid  that  the

freedom  of  the  people to engage  in  religious

activities  will be restricted. I have  no  doubt

that it is not the intention of the Government to

restrict religious activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it  was pointed out in the Select Committee

by  a learned lawyer, Mr L. Rayner, that in  his

opinion it would be undesirable and dangerous  if

the  definition of "mutual aid organisation" were

to  be  narrowed  down.  I remember  the  witness

telling  us how well versed he was to  get  round

awkward



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



portions  of legislation. If the definition  were

narrowed down, many organisations which would  be

caught  by  this Bill would escape  registration,

and this would defeat the very purpose which this

Bill is trying to implement



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill is implemented, certain bona fide

voluntary  charitable and religious organisations

would  also be affected. The argument put forward

by the Member for Tanglin is that registration of

these   bona   fide  voluntary   charitable   and

religious   organisations  would  cause   immense

difficulties and hardship. We on this side of the

House  do appreciate the additional work that  is

required to be done to comply with the provisions

of  the  Bill,  but we do not believe  that  this

additional    work    would   discourage    these

organisations from continuing to do the good work

they  have  been doing. These organisations  have

gone  through more difficult times, and I am sure

the  additional  work would not deter  them  from

continuing to do their good work. After  all,  it

is  agreed that this Bill is a good one. There is

a   need  to  control  and  register  mutual  aid

organisations. It is accepted that such bona fide

voluntary  charitable and religious organisations

are  very  few  in  number, and they  are  either

registered or exempted societies. If provision is

made in this Bill for exemption for this type  of

organisation,  it would also open  the  door  and

give  opportunity  to others  not  so  bona  fide

organisations to seek exemption. There were about

110  cooperative  societies,  150  trade  unions,

1,024 exempted and 1,027 registered societies  at

the end of 1959. There can be no justification in

involving    the    Government   in    additional

expenditure to recruit additional staff  for  the

work when it is accepted that perhaps only a very

few would get exemption.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek clarification on

this clause from the Hon. the Minister for Labour

and  Law, because the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister for National Development - who is  of

the  same  religion as mine - is not with  us  this

afternoon.  And  I  hope the other  Members  will

follow what I have to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have just approved the Muslims (Amendment) Bill. I would like to support my

colleague, the Member for the Southern  Islands,

on  the question of the welfare of mutual benefit

organisations   which   have   been    registered

according   to   the  existing   law   or   those

organisations which are to be registered.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the big problem which I think the Minister

for Labour and Law can clarify is the position of

the suraus and the mosques, the majority of which

are administered by the kampong folks themselves.

I  would like to ask the Minister for Labour  and

Law  this  question: is it the  policy  that  the

special  privileges of the Malays, which  include

their religion, will be implemented? If so,  they

can go further in the matter of the upkeep of the

suraus and mosques. Could they be exempted for  a

certain time to avoid corruption which all of  us

know?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we should control their financial

affairs, because it is found that there are  many

people who exploit such organisations. So what  I

think  is important, Mr Speaker, is the position

of  the  suraus and the mosques, the majority  of

which  are  being  managed and  assisted  by  the

kampong  folks who themselves are not members  of

any  organisation at all. So this is  a  big  and

serious question to me and maybe to my colleagues

also,  and  in  order to overcome this  will  the

Minister  for  Labour  and Law  put  into  effect

certain  rules such as bait-ul-mal  in  order  to

upkeep  the  suraus or mosques? Because  this  is

included in the Muslims (Amendment) Bill which we

have discussed, but nothing can be done Singapore

because  we  know that the laws of Singapore  are

not  based on Islamic law and we know that we are

prepared  to face realities today. Therefore,  as

to  what  kind  of action will be  taken  by  the

Muslim  Advisory  Board on the problems  which  I

have raised and whether such representations have

been  brought  to the notice of the  Minister  or

not,  I  do  not know, but I think   it  is  most

important to uphold one of the religious precepts

of Islam.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some of us can be

very  grateful to the Almighty that we were never

born stupid. Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has  got

nothing to do with suraus and masjids. No surau

or masjid  will  ever be required  to  register

under this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin was

talking  about a religious society or  a  society

that  is formed to worship God. Well, so  be  it.

Form a society to worship God. But if you collect

subscriptions  and  run  a  benefit  scheme   for

members of that society, then we require it to be

registered  under this Bill. That  is  the  right

thing to do. One must realise that there has been

a  lot  if fiddling about with such funds,  which

properly belong to the persons who contribute  to

these  organisations. We are  trying  to  do  the

right  thing for the people of Singapore  and  to

see  that  these associations are  brought  under

proper control. I referred this House just now to

clause  46  of this Bill. We show the distinction

there between the fraudulent type of organisation

and  the honest organisation. The fraudulent type

of  organisation is able at present to produce  a

certificate  of registration under  the  Business

Names  Ordinance  to  claim  that  that  is   its

authority to defraud the public. We say  to  such

organisations,  "You must register  within  three

months  and  you must comply with the rules  that

are  laid  down in this Ordinance. Otherwise  you

are  an  unlawful organisation." There  are  also

fortunately hundreds of the good type  of  mutual

aid  organisations.  They are really  first-class

mutual  benefit organisations. They have  a  real

history  and  tradition of their  own.  Now  they

would,  within  one year, have to register  under

the  Mutual  Benefit Organisations  Ordinance  if

they have benefit schemes. They will also have to

register   under   other  Ordinances   if   their

activities are more than mutual aid. If they are,

in  fact,  societies and are registered as  such,

they will then continue to be on the register  of

societies  as  societies. That  is  what  we  are

trying  to  do.  We  are not harassing  religious

bodies  or trying to put charitable organisations

out  of business. We are trying to be reasonable.

We want to see that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



there is effective control over the activities  of

these  organisations, and  that  is  why  we  have

introduced this legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something new. The provisions of

the  Bill  are  founded on the Friendly  Societies

enactment  in  England, which has a  long  history

behind  it.  We  are not trying to  introduce  new

legislation to harass or to make it difficult  for

the  law abiding people of Singapore, or for  that

matter  religious organisations or those  who  are

associated with charitable organisations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to answer the Member for River Valley first.

I  think  he read only part of Mr Leslie Rayner's

statement.  May  I  quote from Question  798?  Mr

Rayner said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a good thing to have the definition as

wide as possible, leaving the power to exempt with

the Registrar, with an appeal to the Minister."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he made the suggestion. All right, make the

definition   and   then  you  exempt.   Sir,   the

Government  accepted  that suggestion  apparently,

the  definition was made wide, and the  Government

then proceeded to exempt certain categories and to

leave out certain categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our point, and that of Mr Leslie Rayner's,

was  that  if the Government agree to exempt,  why

not  exempt  the honest type, as the Minister  for

Labour  and  Law has said - the type that  is  doing

good work? Why does the Government not also exempt

them  as it has exempted the trade unions and  the

cooperatives? I am only asking for the same thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> For the simple reason that

trade  unions and co-operatives come under special

trade  union  Ordinances and certain  co-operative

Ordinances. They are already under control. If the

Member for Tanglin wants to produce a Bill for the

control  of  his  churches and Methodist  missions

which  run the Anglo-Chinese School, by all means.

Then  we  will exempt them from these  mutual  aid

provisions.  Have  the controls under  the  Anglo-Chinese School Ordinance then.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The only amendment which has been

proposed is to clause 2.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



But  might I remind hon. Members that we are  also

discussing the amendment to clause 45 which is  in

the  name  of  the Member for Tanglin?  When  this

discussion   ends,  there  will  be   no   further

discussion on the amendment, which is proposed  to

clause 45.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

whether  in  the  case of religious  organisations

they  are  to  be registered under  the  Societies

Ordinance? If they are, then they have to register

twice if they have a benevolent section.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the point that I made

for the benefit of the Member for Tanglin is this:

that there are special legislations to control the

books  and  the  finances  of  trade  unions   and

cooperatives.  There  is  no  legislation  in  the

Societies  Ordinance to control the  accounts  and

the finances of any society. If you will remember,

when we made amendments to the Societies Ordinance

recently, the Registrar will not even be  able  to

call for certain thing if they happen to belong to

political   associations.  Under   the   Societies

Ordinance,  there  is no power to  look  into  the

books and the accounts. Under the trade union laws

and  the laws of co-operative societies, there  is

power  to do so. There are no laws at present  for

the  registration,  control and  scrutiny  of  the

accounts  of  any religious body or  it  religious

order.

by  the  Minister and the Prime Minister. I  would

like to say this about his wrong impression of  my

Tanglin  is so simpleminded that he has overlooked

the fact that the main purpose of hearing evidence

constructive ideas the witnesses can tender to the

gives  power  to  the  Legislative  Assembly,   by

resolution, to add to, vary or revoke the whole or

any  part  of  any Schedule to the Ordinance.  The

First  Schedule  to  the Ordinance  specifies  the

institutions, authorities, persons or funds  whose

income  is exempted from income tax under  section

13 (1) (e) of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government is now seeking to

include  its  Federal Land Development  Authority,

established  under  the Federal  Land  Development

Ordinance,  No.  20 of 1956 of the  Federation  of

Malaya,  in  the First Schedule to the Income  Tax

Ordinance and so exempting its income from  income

tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Local Land Development Boards and

Corporations,  Part  III  and  Part  IV   of   the

themselves have funds







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



which may produce an investment income before  the

money is fully absorbed in development schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money, which the Federal Land Authority has

invested  and  the  Land  Development  Boards  and

Corporations may invest in Singapore, is  in  fact

Federation  Government money employed  temporarily

to  earn  interest until needed. As  such,  it  is

justifiable to exempt from income tax the interest

from  these investments, on the general  principle

that Governments do not seek to tax each other. In

this   connection,  I  may  point  out  that   the

Governments of Singapore and the Federation appear

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of accidents of history and by virtue of

its   geographical  position   there   exists   in

Singapore  a large number of immigrant population.

Since  they have been denied a stake in the State,

and  as  a  result of the neglect and  the  short-sighted policy of the colonial rulers in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



the   past,   this  large  number   of   immigrant

population  has always orientated their  political

thinking  and  outlook towards  the  countries  of

their   birth.  They  live  in  a  world  all   by

themselves  and their ways of living and  attitude

of  mind  have in no way been identified with  the

country and its people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the citizenship law in 1957

has   undoubtedly  given  many  of  the  immigrant

population  a stake in the country,  and  to  date

more  than  400,000 people have obtained Singapore

citizenship. Nevertheless, it would be foolish for

us if we think that all these 400,000 new citizens

have  identified  themselves completely  with  the

political  aspirations  of  the  people  of   this

country. A large number of new citizens have taken

advantage of the very liberal citizenship  law  to

obtain citizenship for the sake of convenience  in

order   to   enjoy   rights  and   privileges   of

citizenship, such as employment, public assistance

and  other social services, with little obligation

on their part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this position cannot be maintained for

an indefinite period of time, particularly at this

critical  stage of nation building. The  continued

increase  in  the  number  of  unassimilated   new

citizens, whose loyalty lies elsewhere or who have

not  shown  by  words or actions to be  likely  to

identify  themselves  with  the  destiny  of   the

country,  cannot be tolerated. The  possession  of

dual citizenship, the ease with which a citizen of

the  U.K. and  Colonies and  those  born  in  the

Federation  can  obtain  citizenship  must  cease,

particularly  at this time when the Government  is

also   facing  the  terrible  problem  of  finding

employment  for  its  large number  of  unemployed

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to

confine  citizenship  rights  to  those  who  have

demonstrated their undivided loyalty to the  State

and  intention to reside here permanently, and  to

debar  those  who  seek to obtain citizenship  for

reasons   of  convenience  or  expediency  thereby

hoping to enjoy the best of two worlds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill, which by virtue of

this  Bill  will  be  deemed  to  have  come  into

operation with effect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



from  6th  April,  1960, the date  this  Bill  was

introduced in this Assembly, have been drafted  to

provide for a more effective test of loyalty,  for

the  opportunity to make a genuine declaration  of

real  regard for this country, and for the  chance

to  identify  oneself  in common  unity  with  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 now provides that the period of

residence  required in Singapore before a  citizen

of  the  U.K. and Colonies, or of the Republic  of

Ireland,  or a Commonwealth citizen, or  a  person

born  in  the Federation, can become a citizen  of

Singapore by registration is not less than 8 years

out  of  the  12 years preceding the date  of  the

application. Previously, the period was two  years

for  a citizen of the U.K. and Colonies, a citizen

of India and a person born in the Federation and 8

years for other Commonwealth citizens and citizens

of  the  Republic of Ireland. A common  eight-year

period  is  now  made  applicable  to  all   these

categories of persons. An eight-year period  would

enable  a person to demonstrate more tangibly  and

genuinely an intention of permanent residence  and

regard  for Singapore. The former two-year  period

is often in actual fact less than two years, since

absences  for less than six months are counted  as

residence.  This increased period for  application

by  registration  will bring our legislation  into

line  with the citizenship laws in the Federation.

As  the Explanatory Statement states, the Minister

shall have a discretion to accept applications  by

registration other than those from persons born in

the Federation. Except also in the case of persons

born  in the Federation of Malaya, applicants  for

Singapore citizenship by way of registration  will

also   be   required,  like  those  applying   for

citizenship by way of naturalisation,  to  make  a

declaration of intention to reside permanently  in

Singapore.  When  this Bill comes into  operation,

the  Citizenship Rules will be amended to  provide

for   two  recommenders,  who  must  be  Singapore

citizens,  in  support of such applications.  This

provision   already  exists   in   the   case   of

application  by  way of naturalisation  and  could

help   the  Minister  to  ascertain  whether   the

applicant  intends to reside here  permanently  or

not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 3, the period of residence required in

Singapore before a person can become a citizen  of

Singapore  by  way of naturalisation is  increased

from  8 years to 10 years out of the preceding  12

years  of  the application. This is also  in  line

with  the citizenship laws of the Federation. This

ten-year  period  is  a  more  effective  test  of

loyalty and regard for this country especially for

those  who  originally came from foreign countries

as  defined  in the Ordinance. They have  much  to

benefit  here by becoming citizens, and a  further

increase  of two years in the period of  residence

is  not  unreasonable. Furthermore,  in  order  to

inculcate a sense of Malayan consciousness  and  a

sense  of belonging in future would-be applicants,

it  is  now  provided that with  effect  from  1st

January  1961,  an  applicant  for  naturalisation

shall   satisfy  the  Minister  that  he  has   an

elementary knowledge of the Malay language, unless

he  is  over  45  years of  age.  It  is  not  the

intention  that the standard of the test  will  be

such that the majority of the applicants will find

it  difficult  to  pass it. Those  who  have  been

residing here for a number of years and can  speak

some Malay should experience little difficulty  in

passing the test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 4 as it stands in the Bill, the

intention  is to enable the Minister to  terminate

by  way of declaration the citizenship of a person

who  has  after  6th  April,  1960,  acquired  the

citizenship  or  nationality of a country  outside

Malaya,   or  who  has  voluntarily  claimed   and

exercised the rights of a citizen or national of a

foreign country. But at the Committee stage of the

Bill,  I  propose  to introduce  an  amendment  to

clause 4 to provide that in so far as claiming and

exercising  rights  are concerned,  a  person  who

voluntarily claimed and exercised any rights of  a

foreign  country accorded exclusively to  citizens

or  nationals  of that foreign country  shall,  by

virtue  of  such action, cease to be a citizen  of

Singapore. In clause 4 as it stands, provision  is

also being made to the effect that citizens of the

U.K. and  Colonies or of the Republic of  Ireland

and  Commonwealth citizens, who are also  citizens

of  Singapore  and  who  exercise  rights  of  any

country  outside Singapore and the  Federation  of

Malaya for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



time  being  included  in section  3  (1)  of  the

British  Nationality Act, 1948, not  being  rights

available to all Commonwealth citizens,  might  be

deprived of their Singapore citizenship.  In  this

respect,  Singapore is following the  Federation's

practice  in the matter, and, like the Federation,

is not insisting on such citizens renouncing their

existing  citizenship, as in  the  case  of  those

applying for citizenship by way of naturalisation,

on becoming Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Clause 5, the opportunity has also been taken

to provide for the Minister to deprive a person of

his  citizenship if his activities are prejudicial

to  the security of Malaya or to the interests  of

the  public  safety,  peace  or  good  order.   At

present, section 22 (c) does not bring within  its

scope  the  criminal activities of secret  society

thugs and hoodlums and the nefarious activities of

other criminals like big-time smuggling operators,

for   instance,   who  have  been  able,   through

intimidation,  fear,  bribery  or  conspiracy,  to

escape   being  convicted  in  Court   to   prison

sentences  of  not  less  than  two  years.  I  am

confident  all  decent citizens of Singapore  will

agree  with  me  when I say that these  scum's  of

society  should not enjoy the status of  Singapore

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends the Schedule to the Ordinance by

modifying  the  form  of Oath  of  Allegiance  and

Loyalty   to  be  taken  by  those  applying   for

citizenship by way of registration. This  modified

form  of  Oath is a declaration of their undivided

and  unequivocal loyalty to Singapore and is  also

complementary to the provision in clause  4  which

renders citizens of the U.K. and Colonies, of  the

Republic  of  Ireland,  and Commonwealth  citizens

liable   to   be   deprived  of  their   Singapore

citizenship if they exercise rights not  available

to  all Commonwealth citizens outside Malaya.  The

other  amendment  in clause 6 is  a  consequential

amendment in keeping with the new Constitution  of

Singapore  to the Oath of Renunciation, Allegiance

and   Loyalty   taken   by  those   applying   for

citizenship by way of naturalisation in  that  the

words  "Her Majesty's Representative in Singapore"

are substituted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



by  the  words "His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the implications of the Bill

before the House. It will be our citizens who will

be  the  final arbiter of the shape of  things  to

come  in  Singapore. They will  dictate  what  and

which  kind  of  government  they  want  and  what

policies should be pursued. It is only reasonable,

therefore,  to expect that in guiding and  shaping

the  future  destiny of Singapore  the  compelling

urge  and motive force which should influence  its

citizens in their work, actions and desires is the

bond of common unity generated and sustained by an

undivided   loyalty   and   deep   affection   for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for

Home   Affairs   has   submitted   the   Singapore

Citizenship (Amendment) Bill to the House to amend

the  Singapore Citizenship Ordinance, 1957.  There

are  only six amendments to be discussed  by  this

House.  After detailed examination, we  will  find

that these amendments are very necessary. They can

close the loopholes of the previous Ordinance,  so

that they will be more effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under the Rendel

Constitution,    the   Singapore    constitutional

delegation went to England to negotiate  with  the

British  Government and, as a result, an agreement

was  reached between Britain and Singapore whereby

self-government was granted to Singapore. When the

new  Constitution came into force, the old  Rendel

Constitution was repealed. On the 21st of October,

1957,   a  citizenship  law  was  passed  in   the

Legislative Assembly. Those who have the necessary

residential qualifications are entitled to  become

citizens  of this country. I am glad to  say  that

those  who have qualified as citizens of Singapore

have  carried  out  their duties  as  citizens  of

Singapore,  and they have enjoyed the rights  that

they  are  entitled to. A great  majority  of  the

citizens of Singapore have not changed their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



loyalty to this country. They obey the laws  of

this  country.  They have the interest  of  the

country  at  heart.  They  should  deserve  our

commendation and our admiration. There are only

a few citizens who do not obey the laws of this

country.  They engage in all sorts of  criminal

activities. This, we must stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in a hurry to

register  the people of Singapore, we passed  a

Singapore citizenship law in this House.  There

are  many detailed provisions in the law  which

are  not  appropriate and proper. They are  not

applicable  now.  Therefore,  they  should   be

amended so that they can be in keeping with the

present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to give fair

treatment and to protect the interests  of  the

citizens  of Singapore has been the  consistent

policy  of  this  Government.  I  am  sure  the

Members  of  this  House  will  not  forget  or

overlook  the  fact that both our Minister  for

Labour  and  Law and the Minister  for  Finance

have   been  working  day  and  night  to  find

employment for these citizens. According to the

Labour   Exchange,  there  are   about   50,000

Singapore citizens who are jobless. This number

does  not include those who are not registered.

There  are  about 60,000 children  who  are  of

school-going  age and who, on completing  their

education  or  when they leave school  halfway,

will  have  to  find work. This is  a  problem,

because Singapore is not yet industralized, and

to  find  employment for them  is  not  simple.

However,  we  must  take  immediate  steps   to

alleviate this situation. Therefore, we  should

see  to  it  that  all  the existing  vacancies

should  be  filled by Singapore citizens  only.

That  is  to  say, all vacant posts  should  be

reserved for the citizens of this country only,

except   those   posts  which  require   higher

qualifications. This policy and  this  decision

are  necessary and correct. For example, if the

proprietor  of  a  shop has  children  who  are

jobless,   we  cannot  expect  him  to   engage

employees  from outside. I am sure the  Members

of this House will have the same feeling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, there are many people who are jobless, but judging from the income of the

people  here,  Singapore is still  one  of  the

countries  which  enjoy  a  high  standard   of

living. That is why many people want to come to

this  country  to earn a living. On  the  other

hand,  Singapore is one of the greatest trading

ports in the world. That is why many people  of

various  racial origins reside  here.  As  time

goes  on,  they  will become endeared  to  this

country, because of the fact that it is easy to

find  a living here. They have abandoned  their

nationality  and  now look to this  country  as

their homeland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government does

not   object  to  those  with  good   character

applying  for  citizenship.  That  is  why  the

Citizenship   Registration  Office   is   still

accepting applications. The amendment Bill that

is  being  discussed here today has  some  very

important  changes. Citizens of  the  U.K. and

Colonies  and Commonwealth countries must  have

lived  here for at least 8 of the 12  preceding

years before they qualify to become citizens of

Singapore.   This  is  correct  and  necessary,

because one's loyalty can only be tested  after

one  has stayed here for quite a long time. One

can then decide which country to be loyal to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is ridiculous for

a citizen of a country not to know its national

language, unless he is uneducated or for  other

special    reasons.   Therefore,   the    basic

qualification for citizenship of a  country  is

to know its national language. In Singapore, it

is  necessary for a person to know the national

language  before he can apply for  citizenship.

But those who are 45 years old and over will be

exempted from this test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, these six amendments will not hamper those who want to become citizens of

this  country  if they are not engaged  in  any

criminal activity. The Government will be  glad

to accept such people as citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, credit should be given to  many  of

the   clauses   in   the   Singapore   Citizenship

(Amendment)   Bill,  especially  to  those   which

stipulate the qualifications for those who  intend

to  be citizens of Singapore, and the extension of

the  residential  period from 8 to  12  years  for

foreigners.  I  give praise, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,

where  it is due, but it is also my duty  to  make

healthy  criticism  where  I  consider  it  to  be

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it can truly be said today that all the Hon. Ministers were born in the

Federation of Malaya with the exception of two  or

three. Similarly, it can be said that many of  the

Government Members of the Assembly come  from  the

Federation  of  Malaya. We are now separated  from

the  Federation  of  Malaya  because  of  colonial

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.M.N.O. does not support the clause, which

imposes  a  restriction  on  those  born  in   the

Federation from becoming citizens of Singapore. We

should not hit back at the Federation just because

they  have imposed similar restrictions on  us.  I

still  remember,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  that  the

Minister  for  Health - he  is  not  in  the   House

today - issued  a  challenge to the effect  that  if

U.M.N.O. were  to  bring about a  merger  between

Singapore  and  the  Federation  of  Malaya,   the

People's  Action Party would accept all conditions

and  policies in line with those of the Federation

of Malaya. I regret to say that it seems that many

of the Ministers of the Government of Singapore do

not like their native land. We cannot deny that we

want  to  see more employment. Can it be  possible

that the problem of employment will be overcome if

we  are to impose restrictions on persons born  in

the   Federation   from   becoming   citizens   of

Singapore?  In  my  opinion,  we  should  not   do

anything  to offend the Federation of  Malaya,  as

they  might  help  us to achieve independence.  We

should  be patient in this matter for the good  of

the  future.  The  imposition of  restrictions  on

Federation  citizens  from  becoming  citizens  of

Singapore will make things more difficult  for  us

in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is more strange, Mr Deputy Speaker, is

that  the  qualifications set out  in  the  clause

concerning  persons  born  in  the  Federation  of

Malaya are different from those concerning persons

who   are  citizens  of  the  United  Kingdom  and

Colonies,  or  of  the Republic  of  Ireland.  One

additional qualification concerning the latter  is

that  they  should satisfy the Minister that  they

intend  to reside permanently in Singapore.  I  do

not  understand  why there is this discrimination.

It  is  not specifically mentioned that  a  person

born  in  the  Federation of Malaya  should  state

whether  he  "intends  to  reside  permanently  in

Singapore"  if  he  wishes  to  acquire  Singapore

citizenship.  I hope the Government  will  clarify

this   matter,  which  I,  as  a  Member  of   the

Opposition, have raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, if circumstances force the citizens of Singapore to seek their everyday

livelihood   in   this  manner,   the   Federation

Government may impose a border check or  institute

a  visa  system at the Causeway for people wishing

to  enter the Federation of Malaya. What  will  be

our  position then? It will then be necessary  for

Singapore  to issue her own passports. As  I  have

mentioned earlier, we have been separated from the

Federation of Malaya because of colonialism,  with

the  result that we have to face all this hardship

today, but I know that one day we will merge  with

the  Federation of Malaya. Therefore, let  us  not

keep  ourselves further aloof from the  Federation

of   Malaya.  There  are  many  secret  things  in

connection  with  the  maintenance  of  peace   in

Singapore, which do not come to our knowledge, but

we  should  realise  that we  are  still  not  yet

independent.  We  should  not  hit  back  at   the

Federation  of  Malaya because she might  in  turn

retaliate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope the Government will consider this matter with the thoroughness that it

deserves if we are ever to hope for a merger  with

the  Federation  of Malaya on  the  basis  of  the

challenge issued by the Minister for Health.



<br><br>5.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, no one regrets more

than  the Ministers who have had to introduce this

Bill, the necessity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



of  having  to  make  this amendment  in  the  law

against those who have been born in the Federation

and  are seeking Singapore citizenship. It is  our

intention,  which has been declared  consistently,

that if it were left to choice, we would wish that

there  was  no distinction between citizenship  of

the  State  of  Singapore and citizenship  of  the

Federation  of Malaya. Our difficulty arises  from

certain  very painful economic facts.  Citizenship

carries  with  it certain privileges  and  imposes

upon the State serious financial obligations.  The

first is employment. The citizen comes first.  The

second  is  housing. State-subsidised  houses,  or

houses  subsidised by the Housing and  Development

Corporation,  must  go  first  to  citizens.  Then

social welfare relief's, and so on. For the  time

being,   whilst  we  are  distinct  and   separate

entities,  if the Federation laws were  reciprocal

in  that they allow persons from Singapore  to  be

citizens  of the Federation as quickly and  easily

as  we allow Federation citizens to be citizens of

Singapore, then  the number  of  people  who  are

flowing  from  Singapore to the  Federation  would

reasonably  cancel out the numbers who conic  from

the Federation to Singapore. But because there  is

not   this  reciprocity - not  from  any   want   of

political  determination, conviction or resolution

to  bring the two territories together, but purely

from  the  difficulties arising  out  of  economic

facts - we  have had to introduce this amendment  in

order  that  we can avoid some of the difficulties

which  might otherwise come primarily  from  large

numbers  of children who do their schooling  here,

and  who  automatically qualify in  a  very  short

time. So, not only do they come here and learn  in

our schools, but at the end when they graduate, we

have  got  to get them jobs. Then, once  you  say,

"Jobs  first  to Singapore citizens",  you  cannot

discriminate  between the Singapore-born  and  the

naturalised or the registered. Otherwise  you  are

creating two classes of citizens. The very essence

of   citizenship  is  that  it  is  one  and  all-embracing.   He  who  says,  "I  am  a   Singapore

citizen", has got the same rights; whether  he  is

born here, registered or naturalised. All that  we

want to avoid is a situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



where  large  numbers  of our own  students - Senior

Middle  III  Certificate, School  Certificate,  or

Form  VII  now -  are unable to  get  jobs  because

fairly  considerable numbers of students from  the

Federation have come here, passed examinations and

at  the  same time qualified for citizenship.  The

reason - there is no special secret why we  wish  to

hide  this from Members of this Assembly  or  from

the  people of Malaya - is quite simply just to  try

to  lessen the burden, which would otherwise  fall

upon us. We regret it, but it cannot be helped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for the slight apparent

discrepancy  between Federation-born  persons  and

the U.K. and Colonies citizens as to why we do not

require  a  person  to state that  he  intends  to

reside here permanently is that if he was born  in

the  Federation, then we do not have  to  ask  him

that  question.  It does not make any  difference.

But  if  a  man comes from Trinidad, Mauritius  or

South   Africa,  then  unless  we  ask  him   this

question,  it  might wall be that  all  he  really

wants is to qualify for a job.



<br><br>5.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, when I read this Bill, I  thought

of making an amendment with regard to the position

of  the citizens of Singapore. My opinion is  that

in  Singapore there are two types of citizens. But

after  being advised by my colleagues, it  appears

to  me  that this matter could be overcome by  the

Minister   carrying  out  his  powers  under   the

citizenship law. The category I referred  to  just

now  concerns thousands of Singapore citizens  who

today are deemed to be citizens of Singapore. They

have  the franchise to become candidates and stand

for  election. This was because when the electoral

registers were compiled in 1958 they were compiled

according  to the identity cards. If the  identity

card  of  a  person states that  he  was  born  in

Singapore, he automatically becomes registered  as

a voter and is entitled to become a candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a true fact, which I myself know. Many

persons, more than a hundred or so, have  gone  to

the Immigration Department to apply for passports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



and   they  were  asked,  "Are  you  citizens   of

Singapore?"  They  then  produced  their  identity

cards,   which  state  that  they  were  born   in

Singapore. That was not enough from the  point  of

view   of  the  Controller  of  Immigration.   The

applicants were then asked to produce their  birth

certificates.  Mr Deputy Speaker, the  matter  of

birth  certificates to our young  generation  does

not  present difficulty. But in the case of my own

mother, she is without a birth certificate, having

been born 50 years ago. It might be that her birth

certificate could not be traced in the Register of

Births   and  Deaths.  So,  when  asked   by   the

Department   of   Immigration  for   their   birth

certificates,  the majority of the applicants  for

passports  could not produce them.  So  they  were

unable  to  obtain  passports to  go  abroad.  Mr

Deputy Speaker, this means that a person, from the

point  of  view  of the Citizenship Ordinance,  is

deemed to be a citizen, and from the point of view

of  the  election  by-laws,  he  is  considered  a

citizen,  and  he  can  vote  and  can  become   a

candidate.   From  the  point  of  view   of   the

immigration  laws - he  is  not  recognised   as   a

Singapore citizen. That is one point, which I hope

the  Minister  responsible will explain.  I  think

this  is  a  big question, and if the  Immigration

Department  cannot  approve  passports  for  these

citizens  of Singapore from the point of  view  of

the immigration laws, then it is possible that the

Department  of  Social Welfare  would  not  render

assistance  to them, although they are  considered

citizens  of  Singapore but they  do  not  possess

birth certificates.



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

purpose  of introducing the eight-year residential

qualification  for persons born in the  Federation

is to bring Singapore in line with the legislation

of  the Federation of Malaya. It is desirable,  in

view  of our aspiring for an eventual merger  with

the Federation, that laws of this nature should be

similar as far as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Prime Minister, the

amendments  are  also prompted  by  hard  economic

realities. Unlike the Federation, Singapore has no

space  for  expansion  nor  natural  resources  to

sustain  the mounting population. The Government's

prime  concern  is the livelihood of  its  people.

Until    reunification   with    the    Federation

materialises  eventually, it is  the  Government's

aim,  however  regrettably, to provide  employment

and  other social services for Singapore  citizens

first.  We cannot ignore the keen competition  for

employment  from those coming from the Federation.

Over  the  last 10 years there has been  a  steady

flow of persons from the Federation into Singapore

to seek employment and education facilities. There

is   no  sign  of  any  likely  reversal  in   the

population trend in the near future. Until we  can

cope  with the demand for employment and education

of  our  own citizens, those persons born  in  the

Federation who intend to apply for citizenship for

the   purpose  of  enjoying  these  benefits  must

necessarily be restricted. The problem is dictated

by sheer economic facts. There is no choice in the

matter.

"by    birth,    descent,    registration     or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is to make it clear that the

provisions of this clause apply to all categories

of citizens.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Kandasamy, for the same

reason, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 25 and 26, to leave out "If the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 31 to 33, to leave out "the

Minister  may declare such person to have  ceased

to  be  a citizen of Singapore" and insert "shall

cease  to  be  a  citizen of  Singapore.  If  any

question arises as to whether any such person has

ceased  to  be a citizen of Singapore under  this

subsection  the same shall be determined  by  the

Minister whose declaration thereon shall be final

and  shall  not  be  called in  question  in  any

court".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is self-explanatory. It is to

provide, as stated before in my previous  speech,

that in the case of a citizen who has voluntarily

claimed and exercised any rights available to him

under  the  law  of  any foreign  country,  being

rights  accorded exclusively to the nationals  of

that  foreign country, such action  on  his  part

will mean that he shall cease to be a citizen  of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



It  is considered desirable that there should  be

these  provisions  for  loss  of  citizenship  in

respect of such acts in foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(3) If the Minister is satisfied that any

citizen specified in subsection (1) of this

section has at any time after the 6th day of

April, 1960, voluntarily claimed and exercised

any rights available to him under the law of the

United Kingdom or of the Republic of Ireland or

of any other country, other than the State of

Singapore or the Federation of Malaya, for the

time being included in subsection (3) of section

1 of the British Nationality Act, 1948, being

rights not available to other Commonwealth

citizens, the Minister may declare such person

to have ceased to be a citizen of Singapore.";

and'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kandasamy, since clause 4, subsections (1) and (2) have been amended just now, it is also

necessary  to  make a further amendment  to  this

clause   in   order  to  preserve  the   original

intention  that  the Minister may  terminate  the

Singapore citizenship of the citizens of the U.K.

and  Colonies or of the Republic of  Ireland  and

Commonwealth citizenship by way of declaration if

they  exercise the rights of any country  outside

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya  for  the

time  being included in subsection (1) of section

3 of the British Nationality Act, 1948, not being

rights available to all Commonwealth citizens.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I beg to

move the motion* which stands in my name.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly, pursuant to section 36

of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council,

1958,  resolves  that the salary of  the  Speaker

with effect from 1st June, 1960, shall be $2,825  a

month.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that under the Constitution,

for one year from the date of the promulgation of

the  Constitution, the emoluments of the  Speaker

cannot   be   altered  by  this   Assembly.   The

Constitution was promulgated on the 3rd of  June,

1959,  and  on the 3rd of June this year,  if  we

follow the exact letter of the Constitution,  the

office  of  Speaker  will  fall  vacant  and  the

emolument  of the Speaker will then  have  to  be

determined  under  section 36  of  the  Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present emolument of the Speaker is a

sum  of  $3,000. I think Members are  aware  that

some  painful  reductions were  made  from  civil

servants, Ministers and all those who served  the

State.  Since then certain allowances  have  been

awarded to professional officers. The reason  for

the  sum  of $175 being taken off the  $3,000  is

simply  this. If Members will look at the  debate

fixing  the original salary at $3,000, they  will

find  that the sum was arrived at by taking  into

account the variable allowances which were then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



paid  to Judges and other officers of the State.

Therefore,  in that $3,000, there was a  built-in

variable  allowance of $400. As we all  hope  the

next  incumbent  will  be properly  qualified  to

discharge his duties properly, if we are to treat

him with fairness and justice, as we have treated

all  other officers of the State, we have to take

away  the sum of $400 and return the sum of $225,

which  is the professional allowance paid to  all

professional  officers of the  State.  Hence  the

figure of $2,825 arrived at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to section 36 of

the  Singapore (Constitution) Order  in  Council,

1958,  resolves  that the salary of  the  Speaker

with effect from 1st June, 196,0 shall be $2,825  a

month.
