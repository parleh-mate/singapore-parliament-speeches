<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the formation of Malaysia, the Telegraphs

Ordinance,  Chapter 108, of Singapore was  repealed  and

the  Telecommunications Ordinance, 1950, of Malaya,  was

extended  to  Singapore, Sabah  and  Sarawak.  With  the

separation  of Singapore from Malaysia, it is  necessary

to  promulgate  our own Telecommunications  legislation.

The   Telecommunications  Bill  seeks   to   enact   the

provisions of the Telecommunications Ordinance, 1950, of

Malaysia with the necessary amendments consequent on the

attainment of independence by Singapore and its  ceasing

to be a part of Malaysia. The penalties in the Bill have

been  equated  to the penalties set out in the  repealed

Telegraphs  Ordinance, Chapter 108, of Singapore.  These

are   higher   than   those  in  the  Telecommunications

Ordinance, 1950, of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to

say  a few words about external telecommunications which

had  previously been operated by the company of Cable  &

Wireless  Ltd.  The legal position with respect  to  the

operation  of  external  telecommunication  services  in

Singapore is as follows. Licences were granted to  Cable

& Wireless Ltd, as follows - Cable Lending Licence by Deed

dated 9th November,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



1939, Licence for Underground Lending by Deed dated 22nd

November,  1940, and the Wireless Telegraph  Licence  by

Deed  dated  1953. These Licences appear to be  licences

for  definite  periods and were due to  expire  on  31st

December, 1962. On the expiry of these licences, it  was

the  intention of the Singapore Government to take  over

the  services  under  the provisions  of  the  Singapore

Overseas Telecommunications Board Ordinance, 1962, which

was  passed  in the last Singapore Legislative  Assembly

early  in  1962.  However, action on the  Ordinance  was

deferred  because of a written request by  the  Minister

for  Works  and  Telecommunications  and  Posts  of  the

Federation    of   Malaya,   that   the    subject    of

telecommunications should be discussed at meetings of  a

Government Committee set up to deal with the details  on

the   transfer   of  subjects  to  the  future   Central

Government  of Malaysia. Arising out of this request  by

the  Kuala  Lumpur Government, the Singapore  Government

agreed  to  extend the licences of Cable &  Wireless  to

operate for another period of two years from the 1st  of

January,  1963, to the 31st December, 1964. Subsequently

with   Singapore  joining  Malaysia,  telecommunications

became  the responsibility of the Central Government  of

Malaysia,  and  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  by   Order

repealed the Telegraphs Ordinance of Singapore, repealed

the    Singapore   Overseas   Telecommunications   Board

Ordinance,  1962,  and  extended the  Telecommunications

Ordinance,  1950, of Malaysia to Singapore. On  the  1st

January,  1965,  the licences of Cable & Wireless  Ltd.,

having  expired, the Government of Malaysia  decided  to

take  over the assets of the company and to operate  the

service with effect from 1st January, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal position appears to be that the Federal

Government   acted   under   the   provisions   of   the

Telecommunications  Ordinance,  1950,  under  which  the

Government  has the exclusive privilege of  establishing

radio communications stations, and on the expiry of  the

licence  of Cable & Wireless Ltd., took over the running

of  the  services.  Now,  if Singapore  had  not  joined

Malaysia, Singapore would similarly have terminated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



the  licence of Cable & Wireless Ltd, and taken over the

services.  This right comes within the terms  "Property,

Rights,  Liabilities,  and  Obligations"  which,  before

Malaysia Day, belonged to and were the responsibility of

the Government of Singapore and must, under Article 9 of

the  Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act

revert  to  Singapore.  It  is  the  intention  of   the

Singapore  Government  on  the  Telecommunications  Bill

becoming   law  to  take  action  to  operate   external

telecommunications  services which had  previously  been

carried out by Cable & Wireless Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government understands that the Central

Government  of Malaysia had not finalised  an  agreement

with  Cable & Wireless Ltd, on the quantum which had  to

be  paid to the company as a result of the take-over  of

the  assets of the company. However, we believe that  so

far  only  a  sum  of $5 million has been  paid  by  the

Central Government of Malaysia to Cable & Wireless  Ltd.

in  respect  of the take-over of movable assets  of  the

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Singapore Government that,

on  our  taking over the assets of the previous Cable  &

Wireless Ltd., we would reimburse the Central Government

of Malaysia whatever sums they have paid to the company.

I  would like to emphasise that the takeover of external

telecommunications  in Singapore will  not  in  any  way

endanger  the  defence or the security or  the  external

communications of Malaysia. The armed services defending

Malaysia  already have their own circuits at Jurong  for

external communications. Furthermore, Malaysia could use

the  Seacom  circuits  for  external  communications  as

Malaysia herself is a partner to the Seacom project  and

a  member  of the Commonwealth Cable Committee.  And  as

such,  Singapore could not deny Malaysia the  facilities

of Seacom, of which Singapore is also a partner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also want to make this reassurance, that

Singapore, in keeping with the spirit of friendship  and

co-operation  accompanying  the  establishment  of   the

independent and sovereign State of Singapore, will  want

to extend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



all   facilities   provided  by  the  Telecommunications

Department  (External)  to the Malaysian  Government.  I

would  only like to inform the House that Malaysia today

also  has  its  own external communications  station  in

Penang  when  it  took over Cable & Wireless  assets  in

Penang  and ran it as a Government department  after  it

became a sovereign and independent country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have communicated with the Central Government of

Malaysia of our intentions to move the Second and  Third

Readings of the Telecommunications Bill today and  that,

on the Bill becoming law, the Singapore Government would

take  over  all  responsibility  for  the  operation  of

external communications in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.-{Dr Toh Chin Chye}.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 (1) of the Singapore Asian Seamen's Club

Asian   Seamen's   Club  Committee  be   appointed   for

nominations  by  seafarers'  trade  unions  and  by  the

Singapore Shipowners' Association. As there are only two

registered  seafarers' trade unions in  Singapore,  some

difficulty   has  been  experienced  in  obtaining   the

necessary  representation.  The  proposed  amendment  to

section 7 (1) of the Ordinance will bring it in line



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



with  the  Seamen's  Registry Board  Ordinance  and  the

representation need not be confined to seafarers'  trade

unions  only,  but  appointments  can  be  made  by  the

Minister   of   persons  representing   seafarers.   The

amendment  will  also  enable the  Minister  to  appoint

persons  from  shipowners' associations other  than  the

Singapore Shipowners' Association as there is more  than

one ship-owners' association in Singapore.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the record of the People's Association during the

past  five  years, since its incorporation in July  1960

under the People's Association Ordinance, 1960, was  one

of   rapid   expansion  of  its  activities   throughout

Singapore.  Before the P.A.P. Government assumed  office

in  1959,  there were only 28 community  centres  and  3

holiday  camps.  Today  it has,  under  its  control,  a

network  of  180 community centres and 7  holiday  camps

spread  throughout  the island. It has  also  set  up  a

million-dollar   National  Youth   Leadership   Training

Institute at South Buona Vista Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 60 per cent of our population is below 21

years  of  age. The question of channelling the abundant

energies of youths towards constructive ends in national

building and leadership poses a major problem that needs

to be urgently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



tackled. The Government has, therefore, established this

Training  Institute at South Buona Vista Road  and  this

has  marked  a  new  phase  in the  concerted  long-term

efforts of the Government to solve the problem of youths

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, youth is not the only problem that needs to

be  tackled  through organised activities  at  community

centres. Through experience, it has become evident  that

there   is   a  need  for  organised  social,  cultural,

educational  .and athletic activities in  the  community

centres  to  meet the varied demands of  the  other  age

groups.  One outstanding example is the need to  set  up

kindergarten classes and children's clubs for  children,

particularly in the rural areas of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found that anti-national elements in the

Communist  United Front have been making use of  various

kindergarten  classes organised by them,  especially  in

rural areas, as a convenient instrument for carrying out

their   subversive   activities  and  furthering   their

nefarious  political ends. It may puzzle those  innocent

of  the  villainy  of  which  pro-Communist  agents  are

capable,  how  such  innocuous  institutions   such   as

kindergartens  can be used as a channel  of  subversion.

Sir,  this  is done in two ways. The first is  to  teach

infants and toddlers to sing anti-government jingles. In

ancient  China, the chanting of anti-government  jingles

by children usually heralds popular uprising against the

imperial  dynasty. Our modern Marxist-Leninists  do  not

despise  this well-tried and ancient method. The  second

way  of  subversion is provided by access to parents  of

the  children  in  their kindergarten  classes.  In  the

countryside,   where  the  population  is   lacking   in

sophistication, parents believe that their children  are

being   educated   in   these  kindergartens   and   are

accordingly  grateful  to the teachers.  These  teachers

are,  of  course, Communist United Front  operators  who

never  fail  to cash in on such gratitude by propagating

the party line. The Communist United Front kindergartens

are  completely illegal and are conducted  by  untrained

and  unlicensed  teachers. However, summarily  to  close

them down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



without providing replacements would play into the

pro-Communists' hands, as this would only direct towards the

Government  the  wrath of irate parents  whose  children

have  been deprived of kindergartens. Therefore, it  has

become  necessary  to organise kindergarten  classes  in

community centres. Action to organise such classes along

proper lines was taken at the beginning of last year. To

date, there are 129 kindergarten classes carried out  in

community  centres mainly those in the rural areas.  The

number  of  children attending them is in the region  of

3,800.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make more effective the services provided

by  the  community centres, it is an advantage to enlist

the  support and active participation of local community

leaders  in community centre activities. Experience  has

shown  that such support and participation are essential

to the success of a centre in organising a wide range of

activities  to  meet the varied needs of the  community.

The   People's   Association   has   formed   Management

Committees  consisting of local community leadership  so

that  their support and guidance for the benefit of  the

community  could be placed on a regular basis.  However,

the  local leaders forming the Management Committees are

people  who  are residents in the neighbourhood  of  the

respective community centres and they are not members of

the Corporation within the meaning of section 10 (2) (b)

of   the   People's  Association  Ordinance,  1960.   In

considering the great number of centres involved and the

number of members for each Management Committee, ranging

from  seven  to fourteen, it would not be  possible,  in

practice, to appoint only members of the Corporation  to

be  members of Management Committees, as provided  under

that  section. Amendment to the Ordinance is accordingly

necessary.  I may mention, in passing, that a Conference

of  Management Committees will be held on 8th January to

10th January at the Conference Hall in Shenton Way, when

all  aspects  of  community centre  management  will  be

discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have briefly indicated some of the main

developments  of  the Association during  the  last  two

years, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



reflection of the changing dimensions of the  task  that

has  to  be performed by the Association. The  last  two

years   saw   major  steps  and  concerted  efforts   to

strengthen  the organisation of the Association.  It  is

necessary  now  to  amend the objects  of  the  People's

Association  as provided in section 10 of  the  People's

Association  Ordinance,  1960,  so  as  to  enable   the

Association  to engage in tasks that were  not  foreseen

when it was formed in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

of  Singapore for the year 1966 contained in Cmd.  Paper

25  of  1965.  For  the convenience of hon.  Members,  I

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0103 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2009.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basic duty of Members of Parliament is to

represent the voice of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



the people who elected them to this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a good Opposition, the Barisan Sosialis Members of

Parliament   are   responsible   for   giving   concrete

criticisms and suggestions with a view to assisting  the

Government  in discharging its duties. As a  reward  all

Members of Parliament, including the Opposition Members,

are  given  $500  tax-free allowance.  If  there  is  no

parliamentary democracy, there will be no such allowance

for  anybody.  Since  Members  have  the  privilege   of

receiving   such   allowances,   it   is   also    their

responsibility   to   serve  the   people   as   genuine

Parliamentarians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy adopted by the Barisan Sosialis to

boycott  this  Session  of  Parliament  is  utterly  an

insult  as well as a challenge to the whole process  of

parliamentary  democracy. I would like to  substantiate

this  because  what  I have said  is  nothing  but  the

truth.  I would like to quote the organ of the  Barisan

Sosialis,   the  Plebeian  Express  dated  mid-December

1965. Page 5 of the Plebeian Express states here:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the middle of the last century, the House of

Commons  was  a  centre of real political  power  where

important  decisions  on policy  and  legislation  were

made.  Since those days the growth in the power of  the

Cabinet  based  on  development  of  the  modern  party

system  has  brought  about a fundamental  change.  The

House  continues  to  occupy the  centre  of  political

stage  but merely for propaganda purposes. It has  long

ceased to be the centre of political power.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in another paragraph in the same issue of the

Plebeian, at page 8, it is stated:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At the most it is a forum of criticism of the

Government, for ventilation of grievances and for the

extraction of information. This revealed that the

central power does not lie in the House of Commons as

commonly believed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pro-Communist Barisan Sosialis have clearly

stated here that this House is not important at all, and

that  it  is  only a forum for political propaganda  and

nothing much could be done in this House. They have gone

to  the extent of saying that they even do not wish this

House  to exist. Therefore, this speaks for itself - that

the  Barisan  Sosialis  want to turn  Singapore  into  a

Communist State based on the bible of Karl Marx. They do

not want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



a  democratic  system to prevail in  Singapore.  So  the

boycott is one way to attain their political aims. It is

simple logic that once they boycott this Parliament,  it

will  be  more admirable for them to "boycott" the  $500

tax-free allowance too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have claimed time and again that

they  are  the only angels that represent the people  of

Singapore.  But by their boycotting of this Session,  it

has cast a shadow of doubt on whether they are really or

genuinely  representing the people. If  not,  they  must

submit  to  the  fact  that they  are  nothing  but  the

representatives of the poorly butchered  Partai  Komunis

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer again to another paragraph of the

Plebeian, dated December 1965, page 12, which states  as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. hopes to use the parliamentary Session to

confuse  and  deceive  the people with  its  propaganda,

distortions,    lies    and   fabrications.    In    the

circumstances,   attending  the   coming   parliamentary

Session  in  Singapore  would mean  giving  support  and

respectability to the P.A.P. ... and in helping,  wittingly

or  unwittingly, the pro-imperialist P.A.P. to  deceive

the  people with all its deceptive talk of parliamentary

democracy, would have lent credence and support  to  the

phoney independence of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if it is true that the P.A.P. really confuse and

deceive  the  people,  and if the Barisan  Sosialis  are

really  or  genuinely responsible  birds  and  have  the

interest  of the people at heart, then they should  come

forward  and express their views in this House.  Instead

they have chosen to run away from the open argument  and

dare not face the truth. The whole trouble with them  is

that  they  can  never be voted to form  the  Government

because the people know that they are a useless lot  and

have  no  ability  to govern. So perhaps  these  Barisan

birds -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I hope the Member is not referring to

the Barisan Members of this House!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Thank you for your pertinent advice,

Sir.  Perhaps they were voted to be the Opposition,  and

even  then  they  are unable to carry out  their  duties

properly. What a shame, Mr Speaker! They must  remember

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



this  money is coming from the people. By shirking their

responsibility in boycotting this Parliament, I am  sure

we, the people, come not to praise them but to bury them

and we are not obliged to pay them. Sir, I would suggest

that no public funds should be wasted on people who  are

irresponsible,  unscrupulous,  anti-national   and   not

interested in the welfare of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 0103 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2009."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice there is a motion standing in the names of Inche Mahmud Awang and Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0103 be

reduced by $100."



Is the topic which they wish to discuss similar to this?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, it is a different matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  I wish to reply on behalf  of  the  Prime

Minister. It seems that the Member for Changi  has  been

harping on the $500 allowance received by Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis who have been absent from the sittings

of  this  Assembly.  However, in a constitutional  State

where  the  Government  honours its  Constitution,  such

allowances  will  be continued to be paid.  The  special

allowance will continue to be paid to an elected  Member

for  so  long  as  he continues to be  a  Member.  Under

Article  30 (2) (d) of the Constitution of the State  of

Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The seat of a Member ... shall become vacant if during

two  consecutive  months in each of  which  sittings  of

Parliament (or any committee of Parliament to  which  he

has been appointed) are held, he is absent from all such

sittings without having obtained from the Speaker before

the termination of any such sitting permission to be  or

to remain absent therefrom.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the seat of a Member shall become vacant if

he  is  absent from all sittings of Parliament  (or  any

committee of Parliament to which he has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



appointed) held in December 1965 and to he held again in

January  1966,  without  having obtained  the  Speaker's

permission to be or to remain absent therefrom. If  they

absent  themselves for two consecutive months,  then  we

will hold by-elections in many constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliament of the Republic of

Singapore  has been established to control and  maintain

an  orderly society so that the people can lead a  happy

and  peaceful  life, in a spirit of mutual understanding

and  with  a sense of responsibility. This spirit  of  a

plural society - multi-lingual, multi-cultural and

multi-religious should not only he confined to our people  but

should be disseminated to people all over the world.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aims of our Parliament are as I have expounded

just  now,  the  people  must possess  those  qualities.

Members  of  Parliament must debate a  subject  for  the

benefit  of  the  people  as a  whole,  while  you,  Mr

Speaker, act as the guardian of Parliament. The verbatim

reporters in Parliament take down the proceedings; so do

the newspaper reporters in the various language streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, $704,040 has been allocated for the Head

"Parliament". This Parliament should not be  misused  by

people  who  are  inefficient or  unfit  to  report  the

proceedings of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I may be accused - as the Minister for

Law and National Development has accused me

recently - of  making an "allegation". On looking up that  word  in

the dictionary, I came across the word "alligator" which

means "crocodile", if it means "crocodile", so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



be it; it does not matter, so long as all my speeches in

this  Parliament are for the benefit of our multi-racial

people. I quote paragraph 3 of the Utusan Melayu of 16th

December, 1965:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He then mentioned the speech of Tun Razak which

appeared  in  the  Utusan  Melayu  quoted  from   Malaya

Merdeka. Tun Razak considered the policy speech  of  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara as an old film.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it goes on to another paragraph. But in our Official

Report,  Volume 24, No. 3, page 20, line 12,  after  the

words  "old film", the Member for Geylang Serai  said  a

little  more  but  this  did not appear  in  the  Utusan

Melayu. What he said was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But they will realise that with the victory achieved

recently in the by-election in Rahang ----`.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, you, Mr Speaker, called him to order;

this  was  reported  in  tire Utusan  Melayu  correctly.

Perhaps the word "Rahang" is not pleasant to the ears of

certain  parties  with the result that  his  speech  was

belittled.  After you pulled him up,  he  stood  up  and

continued speaking:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This proves that the people of Malaysia are aware

that what the people of Singapore have achieved will  be

good for them...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the speech was not reported in the Utusan

Melayu,  but it does appear in our Official Report.  The

report in Utusan Melayu is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No sooner had Mr Speaker pulled him up than Inche

Rahamat sat down and did not continue his speech.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they wish to indulge in "twists" even

on  proceedings  in the Parliament of  the  Republic  of

Singapore.  If they confine themselves to  "twists",  it

does not matter, but they continue to "shake". If it  is

a  hand-shake,  then we accept it. I am  at  a  loss  to

understand the aims of Utusan Melayu. I hope  they  will

realise  that  peace cannot be endangered.  Let  us  not

discuss Utusan Melayu with its "old film". I will  bring

out  a  "new film" in the issue of the Utusan Melayu  of

21st December, 1965, page 3, column 3. Mr Speaker,  can

I read the whole news item?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Not if it is too long.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It is not long - about 28

words only. Originally I thought the heading in the

Utusan Melayu was for the benefit of "polo", but

actually it is for the facilities for the Southern

Islanders, because the word spelt in Jawi - "pa-wow

lam-wow" - can be pronounced as "polo" as well as "pulau".

The news item in the Utusan Melayu reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Government spent the sum of $232 from

1962  to  1965 to provide facilities for the inhabitants

of  the  Southern Islands. The Government is sincere  in

wanting to raise the standard of living of the people of

the Southern Islands.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot raise the standard of living of the Southern

Islanders  with $232 over a period of four years!  I  am

angry,  because  I personally heard the  speech  of  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  National

Development  on Saturday, 18th December,  1965,  on  the

occasion  of the official opening of the jetty  east  of

Bukom  Kechil  by the Minister of State  for  the  Prime

Minister's  Department,  who  is  also  the  Member  for

Southern  Islands. I heard very well  that  the  sum  of

$99,300  was  spent in 1964 and that  $77,970  has  been

spent  for  1965,  making a total of  $177,270  for  the

period  of two years 1964/1965. This covers a period  of

only two years, because prior to 1964 the votes were not

under  the jurisdiction of the Urban and Rural  Services

Committee.  This  relates to a  news  item  outside  the

Parliament.  But  what  I  am  discussing  here  is  how

proceedings of Parliament should be reported  faithfully

and in a responsible manner to preserve the peace of the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no objection even if the

news were to be blacked out. But we take offence if  the

news  is  "twisted and shakened". If it is a hand-shake,

our country is safe. On that note, I end my speech.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I wish to draw the attention of this House

to the newspaper reporters who are allowed to report the

proceedings  of  Parliament. Standing Orders  must  also

apply to these reporters in the course of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



reporting  of the proceedings of Parliament in order  to

maintain  the decorum of this House, because there  are

reporters  of a certain Malay newspaper who "twist  and

turn"  reports with the object of smearing  Members  as

well  as denigrating this House. The reporters referred

to  are  from  the newspaper, the Utusan  Melayu.  They

quoted  my  speech in this Parliament on 14th December,

1965,  thanking  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  for  his

policy speech at the opening of Parliament held on  8th

December,  1965. I refer to the issue of Utusan  Melayu

of  16th December, 1965, page 3. Mr Speaker, permit me

to  read this news item for the information of Members.

The  headline  on  page  3 was  "Speaking  outside  the

matter  under debate - Speaker pulls up P.A.P.  Member" -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore - 15th December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker, Mr A. P. Rajah, yesterday pulled up the

P.A.P.  Member  for Geylang Serai, Inche Rahamat  Kenap,

for   speaking  outside  the  matter  under  debate   in

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Rahamat Kenap was speaking in support of the motion

of  thanks by the Prime Minister, Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew,

to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the policy speech at the opening

of Parliament recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Rahamat in his speech referred to the question

of  flats  bought by the Singapore National Housing

Co-operative  Society  about  which,  according   to   him,

U.M.N.O. leaders  felt envious of the  success  of  the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then referred to the speech of Tun Razak published

by  the Utusan Melayu and quoted from the Malaya Merdeka

wherein Tun Razak had likened the policy speech  of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to an old film. At  this  stage,

the  Speaker  pulled  him  up  because  his  speech  had

deviated  from  the original motion. No sooner  had  Mr

Speaker  pulled him up than Inche Rahamat sat  down  and

did not continue his speech.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the content in the Utusan Melayu of 16th

December,  1965, on page 3. If we examine  our  Official

Report  of  the  proceedings of this Parliament  on  the

speech which I made on 14th December, we can clearly see

that  a  lot  of  my  speech has been "twisted"  by  the

reporters concerned with a nefarious object.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very sorry because I spoke in Malay and the

reporter himself is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



Malay  from the Utusan Melayu. It is impossible that  he

cannot understand the Malay language that I used,  since

the  non-Malay reporters of the Straits Times, which  is

an  English newspaper, could produce my speech sincerely

in good faith, although brief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that, apart from the Barisan Sosialis who are

anti-nationals and anti-democratic Parliamentarians, and

whose  first  object is to boycott the  Parliament,  the

Utusan  Melayu  also has the same nefarious  objects  to

obstruct  the proceedings of this Parliament by twisting

and turning speeches made by Members of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government does not take positive action against

the  reporter  concerned, I fear that the Utusan  Melayu

will  turn  back to its old line when Singapore  was  in

Malaysia,  a  time in which the Utusan Melayu  played  a

prominent  part in disseminating communalists  views  in

order to disrupt the good harmony that existed among the

various races in Singapore. The people of Singapore have

lived  in  peace and harmony for hundreds of years.  We,

the  people  of  Singapore,  do  not  wish  to  see  the

incidents  of  July  and September  1964  re-enacted  in

Singapore.  Therefore, I hope positive  action  will  be

taken against the Utusan Melayu which has perverted  and

twisted the news.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contacted Zabha, the Manager of the Singapore Utusan

Melayu,  by phone and informed him of the position,  and

he  asked me to put in my complaint in writing  so  that

the  mistake could be rectified. On 16th December, 1965,

I  did send a complete report of my speech, but I regret

to  say  that up to now the full text of it has not  yet

been published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the decorum of this Parliament and to

reflect   the  true  independent  status  of  Singapore,

positive action must be taken against the Utusan  Melayu

which  is fond of twisting the views and proceedings  of

this Parliament.

When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to remind the reporter concerned, or

anyone  who  may  be concerned, that  we  are  bound  by

regulations. Section 30 (h) of the Legislative  Assembly

(Privileges,  Immunities, and Powers)  Ordinance,  1962,

provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) publish wilfully any false or perverted report or

any   writing   containing   a   gross   or   scandalous

Assembly;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reminder to reporters who, cover the

there  has been a contravention of this section  of  the

Ordinance, he may seek recourse, under Standing Order 92

(7) ,  to  move  a  motion complaining  of  a  breach  of

privilege after notice, if the matter complained  of  is

not  raised at the earliest opportunity. If both Members

consider that there has been a breach of privilege, then

they are entitled to seek that recourse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above the provisions of the Standing Orders

which  Members  may  employ, under  section  30  of  the

Act, certain penalties are provided. Now, section 35 (2)

of that Act says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person who attempts to contravene any provision

of this Ordinance or abets the contravention of any such

provision  shall be guilty of an offence  and  shall  be

have  been  liable for a contravention of the  provision

itself.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under section 36 of the Legislative Assembly

(Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No prosecution shall be instituted in any court for

an offence under this Act, unless the matter giving rise

to  that  prosecution  has been referred  to  the  State

of section 21 of this Act.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Speaker of the House, I am the custodian of its

powers  and privileges. If any Member feels that he  has

been  misreported in any Press - be it  Malay,  Chinese,

English,  or Tamil, or Malaya-lam - I am at his disposal

for  a  complaint,  and  I will give  him  all  possible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when Singapore was

booted  out  of Malaysia on the 9th of August,  this  is

what  is  termed a division of what is historically  and

ethnically one people into two separate peoples. Even in

colonial  times,  when  British  interest  required  the

severance of Singapore in order that it should exist  as

a  separate political and constitutional unit  from  the

former  Malayan  Union, which became the  Federation  of

Malaya,  hostel  facilities for  Malayan  and  Singapore

students   studying  abroad  had  always  been   jointly

provided.  Malaysia Hall in London, which  was  formerly

known  as  Malaya  Hall, had not  only  provided  hostel

accommodation  for both Singapore and  Malayan  students

hut  it  was also a meeting place of students both  from

Singapore and Malaya.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students whether from the island of Singapore or

the Malay peninsula have never regarded themselves other

than  as one people. The student associations which they

formed and run had for more than one generation, been on

a  pan-Malayan  basis,  that is to  say,  there  was  no

discrimination in the membership between those who  came

from  Singapore and those from the Malayan  mainland -

everyone  was regarded as a "Malayan". This is  true  of

the  Malayan  Students' Union and the Malayan  Forum  in

London which were formed nearly two decades ago. One  of

the  leaders  of the Malayan Forum happened  to  be  Tun

Razak during his student days. This is also true of  the

Malay  Society of Great Britain which later  became  the

Kesatuan  Melayu United Kingdom (the K.M.U.K.),  one  of

the  founders of which happened to be Tunku Abdul Rahman

himself during his student days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was in these student associations which had

their  meeting place in Malaysia Hall that some  of  the

present leaders of both Singapore and Malaysia had first

met as students. As stated by our Deputy Prime Minister,

Malaysia  Hall held memories for him and his colleagues,

and it was there that political thinking on independence

for Malaya and the reunification of Malaya and Singapore

originated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to remind the House of the news

expressed  by the Prime Minister of Malaysia soon  after

Singapore's separation from Malaysia. He was reported to

have  said that he was happy to note that students  from

Singapore and Malaysia would continue united in  Britain

and  Eire  in  spite of the political changes  at  home.

However  it  is  also significant that the  decision  to

withdraw  hostel  facilities to Singapore  students  was

taken at a top level meeting of the Alliance Council  in

Kuala  Lumpur where, in the same meeting, the  important

decision  to  open  their  Party  membership  direct  to

individuals  who do not belong either to  U.M.N.O.,  the

M.C.A. or  the  M.I.C. was taken. One cannot  therefore

dismiss this latest move as something routine, logically

following on the political separation of Singapore  from

Malaysia. It is certainly a decision with deep political

overtones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can one argue that this is just a matter of hostel

facilities   for   Malaysian   students   abroad   being

inadequate, as the Straits Times editorial puts  it?  If

it  is  only a matter of hostel facilities abroad  being

inadequate, the correct solution should be to expand the

existing  facilities by acquiring  more  hostels.  I  am

quite  sure our Government will be more than willing  to

bear  a fair share of the capital expenditure that  this

will  entail.  As  a matter of fact, our  Government  is

contributing  a  sum  of $150,000 towards  the  cost  of

running Malaysia Hall without even having any say in the

running of it. No such approaches have been made to  our

Government. The fact that our Government is bearing part

of  the  cost of running Malaysia Hall requires, out  of

common  courtesy, that we should be consulted  before  a

decision   is   taken  to  deny  our   students   hostel

facilities.  But  no  such thing  was  done  before  the

unilateral  announcement  was  made  by  the   so-called

Malaysian Alliance Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was further argued by the Straits Times editorial

of  the  22nd  of  December that no doubt  the  Alliance

Council  was influenced in its decision by the Singapore

Government's  action that, as from  next  year  onwards,

Malaysian students in Singapore in primary and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



secondary schools have to pay unsubsidised school  fees.

On  this decision of our Government, I wish to point out

that  it  is based purely on finance and economics,  for

Singapore being a small country cannot and should not be

expected  to pay or subsidise the education of  children

of  citizens  of  her bigger neighbour. Further,  it  is

important to note that our Government by this action  is

not  in  any  way  denying  educational  facilities   to

Malaysian  students  as  in the case  of  the  Malaysian

Alliance  Council decision of denying hostel  facilities

to  our students. As I have stated, our Government  will

be willing to pay for these hostel facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that only the other day, our

Minister  for  Culture and Social  Affairs  spoke  at  a

luncheon  given  by the Lion's Club in  honour  of  five

visiting   Malaysian  students  to  Singapore   on   the

desirability  of  exchange of students between  Malaysia

and  Singapore. He stated that this was one of the  ways

of   promoting   good  relationship  between   the   two

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now refer to some of the views expressed by the

students  who  are directly affected by this  deplorable

move  as it was reported in the Press. Sir, I am quoting

from the Malay Mail dated 21st December:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Reactionary" was the description given to the

decision by an Ipoh woman law student who is an official

of one of the student associations.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue to quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"It's a very unfair move against our students

abroad," she said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"During the past year, we Malaysian and Singapore

students  in  Britain  and Eire  have  tried  to  remain

united.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This decision shatters all our hopes and aspirations

of  maintaining unity and working towards the  formation

of   a  single  Malaysian-Singapore  Students  Union  in

Britain."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another association official, also a Malaysian,

expressed a similar view. He said: "It's a wedge in  the

hearts  of  students who have over the years aspired  to

belong  to  a single family. We deplore the government's

action.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the London Union of Malaysian and

Singapore   students,  Tengku  Noone,   also   expressed

surprise and regret and has this to say: "When Singapore

parted  from Malaysia, the Tengku praised the union  for

saying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



it  would  continue  to promote good  relations  between

Malaysian and Singapore students and that the government

itself  would  endeavour to promote  this  undertaking." [Malay Mail, 21-12-65]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Malaysian Alliance do not think it fit to

seek  the views of our Government on this issue, perhaps

they should consult and listen to the views of their own

Malaysian  students, particularly  the  leaders  of  the

various  student associations abroad, since it has  been

their  constant protestations of being model  democrats.

By  this far-reaching move of theirs, they have not only

arrogated to themselves the right to shape the lives not

only of the present generation but also of the next, for

the   present  student  leaders  are  bound  to  be  the

political leaders of the next generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, one cannot help viewing this move by the

M.A.C. as  one  designed  to close  the  minds  of  the

Malaysian   students   from   any   outside   influence,

particularly  the  ideas of freedom of  thought,

multi-racialism,  multi-lingualism that are  being  encouraged

and  practised  in our country Singapore.  Perhaps  they

fear  the  meeting of minds with the Singapore  students

who  are  being  brought  up in such  an  atmosphere  of

freedom, just as they fear the plague carrier who  might

infect  the  Malaysian  students  in  these  "subversive

ideas"  and end up in destroying the fabric of  Alliance

power in Malaysia. One begins to wonder whether this  is

not  the first step towards the development of a  closed

society  of  one race, one language, one  religion  and,

above all, one idea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore can only view such moves towards

perdition  with  sadness. Perhaps it would  not  be  too

inappropriate  for me to remind them that  however  much

you  can achieve in separating people physically,  ideas

can  never  be  isolated or killed.  We  have  too  many

examples of such determined but unsuccessful attempts in

world  history. We saw the campaign in Hitlerite Germany

of the burning of books; and in more recent history, the

notorious Berlin Wall. Ironically, it was only the other

day that the Tunku was castigating the Opposition in the

Malaysian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



Parliament  by  accusing them of adopting Hitlerite  and

Communist tactics. One wonders where the cap fits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, in the event of our good advice not being

heeded  and if they still persist in denying the use  of

such  facilities  to  our  students  abroad,  will   our

Government immediately set up a Singapore Hall  so  that

our  students can be accorded hostel facilities and  not

be left stranded? Perhaps when we have our own Singapore

Hall,  I  am  positive that the door to such  facilities

will  be  left  wide  open  for  brother  students  from

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed AI-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,   it  seems  that  the  question  of  Singapore

students in London is not only heard in this House,  but

it  is  also  heard in the Dewan Negara as stated  in  a

newspaper  today --- the Utusan Melayu, page  6,  headed

"Students of Singapore in Dewan Raayat at":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister for Lands and Mines said that it is the

responsibility of the Malaysian Government to look after

our students abroad. He said this in reply to a question

in the Dewan Negara asking why a request was made by the

Alliance  that  the  responsibility  for  the  Singapore

students   abroad   be  taken  out  of   the   Malaysian

Government.  Singapore, he said, should look  after  its

own  students and workers overseas. But we, up  to  now,

have been lenient and have given facilities freely.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So according to the Malaysian Minister it is as though

Singapore has been getting things free. I feel  this  is

putting  Singapore  to  shame. Since  it  is  Malaysia's

intention to exclude Singapore students from the use  of

students' halls abroad, Singapore would cease paying its

one-third contribution towards the upkeep of Malaya Hall

as well as the various Malaysian students' clubs as from

9-8-65.  This  item should therefore now be  amended  to

read "Students' Accommodation Overseas".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exploring possibilities of seeking alternative

means  of  accommodating Singapore  students.  The  High

Commissions in London and Canberra will be asked to look

into  this  matter.  Incidentally,  we  have  also  paid

capital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



cost  for the acquisition of a long-term 50 years' lease

of  Malaya Hall in London, and we are now taking  action

to  recover whatever liquidated value may be due  to  us

when the calculations have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Chairman, in regard to our students overseas,

the   Government   is   ready  to  shoulder   its   full

responsibilities towards our citizens wherever they  may

be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in past years, bursaries and other forms

are no special bursaries for Malay students because they

are  to  compete only among themselves in order  to  get

bursaries.  So  I would like to know from  the  Minister

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, I wish to answer the question of the Member for

Kampong Kembangan. The allocation of funds, according to

this   item,   is   only  a  matter  of   administrative

convenience.  Actually, all Malay students  who  qualify

for  assistance  are  automatically eligible  for  these

awards.  So there should not be any doubt regarding  the

competition   between  Malay  students   and   non-Malay

students. There are a number of people who claim  to  be

Malays  in  order to benefit from these  bursaries.  The

word  "Malay" is now defined as "a person of  the  Malay

race  who  professes  the  Muslim  religion,  habitually

speaking the Malay language,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



conforming  to Malay customs, and born in Singapore,  or

is  a  citizen of Singapore, or acquires the citizenship

of  Singapore." It is only these people who are eligible

for  these  bursaries on condition that  they  have  the

necessary academic qualifications.

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 0105 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is observed that there is an

increase  of $5,500 for this expenditure as compared  to

1965.  An  increase  in this amount  may  give  rise  to

vandalism  by  drivers  who  often  take  advantage   of

breakdowns  to  stay idle. There are common  allegations

against  our Government drivers, though these  have  not

been   substantiated,  that  they   deliberately   cause

breakdowns  and  send  their  vehicles  to  the  P.W.D.,

Kallang, for repair, so that they can stay idle.  As  to

why  these drivers intentionally cause these breakdowns.

I  am afraid there is no need for me to mention here the

reasons, which are best known to all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their services are essential and important, we can

hardly afford to go without them in our daily life.  For

example,  the  drivers  of the  Health  Department,  the

P.W.D.,  the  Social Welfare Department, the  Veterinary

Department, etc. provide valuable services to the public

every  day.  Since  our  Government  cannot  afford   to

maintain   many   vehicles,   readily   available,    as

replacements in cases of breakdown, I sincerely urge the

heads of departments concerned to exercise greater  care

by supervising the drivers in order to bring down to the

minimum  the consequential cost of repairs and accidents

involving Government vehicles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law and National Development

(Mr  E. W.  Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first explain

that this  vote  is  to  cover the cost of damages  to  other

vehicles  which have come into collision with Government

vehicles. Government vehicles are not insured,  so  that

this  item  is to provide for all damages  that  may  he

caused  to other vehicles, the damage having been caused

and the accident having arisen due to the negligence  of

our  own  drivers. The increase of $5,500 for this  item

has  come about through the separation of Singapore from

Malaysia.  As a result of the separation, many vehicles,

which  prior  to Malaysia Day belonged to the  Singapore

Government, revert to the Government of Singapore  after

Singapore  Day. So with the increase in  the  number  of

Govern  ment  vehicles  in  Singapore,  this  item   has

increased by $5,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allegations of sabotage, there has been no

evidence  of this. But whenever a Government driver  has

been  grossly  negligent, disciplinary proceedings  have

been  taken against him. In fact, in the past few years,

a  few  drivers  have been dismissed  because  of  gross

negligence. I can assure the hon. Member for Mountbatten

that  this figure has not been increased because  of  an

increase  in  the  number  of accidents  or  more  heavy

sabotage by our own drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, prior to Malaysia when the

Department of Civil Aviation in Singapore was under  the

charge of the Deputy Prime Minister, it functioned  well

without   much   criticism.  There  was   expansion   of

facilities both from an operational and commercial point

of  view.  The  standard of service  was  high  and  the

integrity of the Department of Civil Aviation staff  was

unquestioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Singapore became part of Malaysia in September

1963,  when  the  control  of the  Department  of  Civil

Aviation  was  vested with the Kuala Lumpur  Government,

the amenities provided for passengers and members of the

public  meeting passengers at Singapore Airport leave  a

very great deal to be desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of serious criticisms have been levelled at

the  Airport  Administration, and I feel it  my  bounden

duty  to  voice it here, with the hope that  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister  will  inquire and  take  the  necessary

action to put things right. During the last two years  a

number  of senior officials of the Department  of  Civil

Aviation  have accepted complimentary air trips  offered

by  foreign airlines for their personal pleasure.  These

officials  include the Director of Civil  Aviation,  Mr

Tan  Beng San, the Airport Manager, Mr Devan,  and  the

Airport officer-in-charge of the Police, Ungku Adam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an independent Singapore, the same officials will

be responsible for negotiating traffic rights granted to

foreign  operators,  very possibly  those  same  foreign

operators who have extended hospitality to the officials

concerned in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



the  Department of Civil Aviation. Acceptance  of  these

favours,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, will no doubt weaken  their

negotiating  power  in protecting the  interest  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1964 the new Passenger Terminal Building was

opened. Before it was opened, various airlines operating

through  Singapore  protested to the Director  of  Civil

Aviation,  Mr Tan Beng San, about the manner  in  which

the   restaurant  had  been  run  in  the  old  terminal

building.  These  airlines made  strong  representations

that  the  concession  for the  restaurant  in  the  new

terminal building should not be given to the same person

by  the name of Mr Neo Tai Kim, who exercised the right

in  the  old terminal building, on the grounds  of  very

inferior   service  and  malpractices.  However,   these

representations  were ignored by the Director  of  Civil

Aviation,  Mr  Tan Beng San, and the airline  operators

were most disappointed at this. And to crown it all, the

D.C.A. saw fit to grant a further concession to operate

the  duty-free  liquor and cigarette  shop  at  the  new

terminal  building.  This  new company  called  Sharikat

Malaysia, which was formed to conduct this business, had

no  previous  experience in the handling of  liquor  and

cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch on the Airport restaurant.

This  is let out on the basis of a concession, but after

10  p.m, each  evening it functions as  a  night  club,

remaining  open  until the small hours of  the  morning,

long  after  other such establishments in Singapore  are

closed.  During  the  day  the prices  charged  in  this

restaurant are excessive, particularly for refreshments.

For example, the price of a cup of coffee or a bottle of

coca-cola is 60 cents. For a public place like Singapore

Airport,  where the concession is virtually a  monopoly,

the   charge   of  60  cents  is,  to  say  the   least,

extortionate. Surely it is unthinkable for the D.C.A. to

give  protection  to the concessionaire  to  fleece  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When evening comes and the restaurant is turned into a

night  club,  prices  are  increased  further  and   the

premises are crowded with large numbers of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



youngsters  who are aware that the premises remain  open

until the early hours of the morning. During this period

it  is  very difficult for passengers and persons having

essential business at the Airport to obtain service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to say here that I am

not  against the operation of a night club, but  I  feel

that with the restricted facilities at the Airport where

the  place  is meant as a restaurant for passengers  who

use  the Airport, the night club, if it has got to be  a

night  club, can be operated elsewhere. In this respect,

I   would  also  like  to  quote  the  Prime  Minister's

recommendation that night clubs should be for foreigners

so  that  we  can  earn their money but  our  youngsters

should  go to bed early and have physical jerks  in  the

morning so that they can keep fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the granting of concessions is decided by a

Committee  under the chairmanship of Mr Tan  Beng  San.

Surely  in  an area as important as this, a high-powered

committee  should be established and advice sought  from

airlines  and  other  commercial  concerns  prior  to  a

concession  being  granted. Surely also  some  provision

should be made for persons tendering for concessions  to

guarantee that the price levels at the Airport will  not

exceed general prices in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to review the

composition of the Airport Commercial Committee and have

it  reconstituted, so that there can be  proper  control

over all the various aspects of commercial activities at

Singapore Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various shops at the Airport are let out on

concession,  and the prices charged in these  shops  are

generally  higher than those charged  in  the  city.  In

particular,  transit passengers shopping in the  Transit

Lounge   frequently   complain   about   price   levels,

particularly   those   passengers   who,   on   previous

occasions,  have  actually stopped  over  in  Singapore.

Passengers who regularly transit at Singapore frequently

ask their friends to do their purchasing in the City and

bring the goods to the Airport, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



they  know that the prices charged in the Airport  shops

are excessive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of what I have said and in

the  interest of the public and the country, I urge  the

Deputy  Prime Minister seriously to consider  conducting

an  inquiry into the activities of the Director of Civil

Aviation,  Mr Tan Beng San, and the commercial  aspects

of  the  Department  of  Civil  Aviation,  and  to  take

appropriate  action  against  the  person   or   persons

responsible for the maladministration. It surely must be

the  objective  of  the Government to  ensure  that  the

Singapore  Airport  is  a showpiece  and  an  attractive

gateway  for  tourist  traffic  visiting  the  State  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close, Mr Speaker, Sir, the irons of all

this is that the Airport restaurant concession is run by

a  Mr  Neo  Tai Kim. The duty-free liquor and cigarette

shop  licensee is also a Mr Neo Tai Kim. I believe this

Mr  Neo Tai Kim also operates the Shamrock Hotel  which

is  in  my constituency. It is a bit fishy when  I  find

that  officials of the Department of Civil Aviation have

parties at the Shamrock Hotel.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the

Member for River Valley for drawing my attention to  all

the deficiencies in the administration of the Airport. I

must say that the responsibility for Civil Aviation left

my charge for the last two years when Singapore was part

of Malaysia. It became the responsibility of the Central

Government of Malaysia and it was only recently that the

responsibility   for  administering  the   Airport   has

reverted  back  to me. Being occupied  with  other  more

urgent  matters.  I have been unable to  look  into  the

complaints  which  have  been  registered  against   the

administration  at the Airport. But the allegations  the

Member  has made are quite serious and I will  certainly

look  into  them  and rectify whatever maladministration

has taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify, not only to the Member but also

to the House, that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



so  far  as  the granting of traffic rights  to  airline

operators  is  concerned, ultimately it is the  Minister

who  has the responsibility of signing the agreement and

looking  into the clauses of the agreement.  It  is  not

quite  correct to say that officials at the Airport  are

responsible for negotiating traffic rights. They have no

such responsibility at all. It is the responsibility  of

my  officials,  who  are  in my  Headquarters,  and  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do admit that I have also heard from other transit

passengers,  who  have  passed through  Singapore,  that

shops in the transit lounge leave much to be desired. In

fact,  when  I  was in Moscow, my interpreter,  a  young

Russian,  was on his way back to Moscow from Jakarta - he

was transiting in Singapore - and he visited the shops  in

the  transit lounge and bought a radio, and when he went

back  to  Moscow he found that he could not even receive

Radio  Moscow.  He  sent  his  transistor  radio  to  he

examined  and  it  was found that the insides  were  all

rusty  although the brand was a very famous  brand.  The

man  was evidently very much cut up and I am afraid that

such  oneupsmanship on transit passengers by shopkeepers

in Singapore is going to do themselves no good and do  a

considerable amount of harm to our reputation as  honest

traders and dealers. This is not the only story  I  have

heard.  In  fact, it was heard somewhere else in  Africa

too.  Somebody had bought a watch with a reputable  name

on  the face of tile watch. But after one week the watch

refused  to work. He opened up the watch and found  that

its  mechanism was not what it was supposed  to  be;  it

came  from a cheap company. All in all, I must say  that

this  fraud,  which is perpetrated on  tourists  and  on

people  who  pass  through Singapore,  is  damaging  our

reputation. This fraud, if it exists, must certainly  he

stopped, and I will make it a point to see what is going

on  in the transit lounge. Certainly if it is discovered

that  shopkeepers in the transit lounge  are  trying  to

defraud  transit passengers who are in  a  hurry  to  do

their  purchases, then the licence which has been  given

to  them for opening shops in the transit lounge will be

cancelled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Airport restaurant is concerned, I

find  it  very difficult indeed to see what can be  done

with  regard  to  the prices which are  charged  by  the

Airport  restaurant  for drinks,  Coca  Cola  and  other

foodstuffs.  The restaurant is allowed to operate  on  a

tender  fee,  and there is no condition imposed  to  say

that the operator must fix a certain price for the sales

of  drinks.  Just as much as a licence  is  given  to  a

coffee shop in town to operate an eating shop, I do  not

think  there is any law to say that the owner must  sell

his  soft  drinks at 25 cents a bottle  or  20  cents  a

bottle.  The price of drinks must, of course, be related

to  the  cost of production and the number of  customers

who patronise it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to the Director of Civil Aviation, the

Member for River Valley ought not to blame him as  being

the  evil man who has granted concessions to Neo Tai Kim

and  others,  because  he himself has  admitted  that  a

Committee  studies  all  applications  and  it  is   the

Committee  which makes the decision, although  no  doubt

the  Director of Civil Aviation is the Chairman of  this

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was rather curious indeed when I listened to the

Member  for River Valley saying that he has on occasions

met   officials   of   my   Civil  Aviation   Department

patronising the Shamrock Bar which is also owned by  Neo

Tai   Kim  who  also  operates  the  concession  at  the

Singapore  Airport  Restaurant.  This  is  an  important

point, and if there is reason to believe that there  are

undesirable  dealings  under  the  table  or  under  the

counter,  then  I have no hesitation in  referring  this

matter  to  the  C.P.I.B. which  will  be  qualified  to

investigate any innuendoes or allegations of corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that it is the intention of the

Government to ensure that everybody who makes use of the

Airport  and  the terminal building will  be  given  all

facilities and all courtesy, because we do realise  that

more  people pass through the Airport in Singapore  than

in  any other part of the State. So it is very necessary

indeed  that  the  Airport, as a gateway  to  Singapore,

should  give  all  travellers a good impression  of  our

integrity and honesty, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



if  there are any shortcomings, I will be only too happy

to hear from any Member of the House, or for that matter

any member of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only add now that the Member for River Valley

has  very  usefully raised these points in this  debate,

and I shall certainly look into all the allegations that

he has made this afternoon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0304 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek information

from  the  Deputy  Prime Minister as  to  what  type  of

laundry  service  is being incurred in  respect  of  the

$5,000.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the provision of

$5,600  for 1965 covers the cost of laundering  of  hand

and bath towels used by passengers in transit and in the

V.I.P. lounge daily, the laundering of cushion  covers,

and   the   mending   and   dry-cleaning   of   curtains

periodically.  On the average, a sum of  $330  has  been

expended  monthly this year. As more and more  passenger

traffic lands at Paya Lebar Airport, this expenditure is

expected  to rise. The sum of $5,000 estimated for  1966

shows  a  reduction of $600 on the provision  for  1965.

This  is  due  to the purchase of hand-drying  equipment

which will lessen laundry charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is spending about

half   a  million  dollars  in  expenditure  to  attract

tourists. Yet the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



Airport  Administration has badly neglected  to  provide

proper  identity facilities either at the  land-side  or

the  air-side  to identify our country,  Singapore.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, if you visit the Airport, you will  notice

on  the  porch  of  the new terminal  building  in  bold

lettering  "International  Passenger  Terminal"  without

reference  at  all to Singapore. In an  important  place

like  this,  I  consider  an  identity  most  desirable,

especially  so  now  that Singapore  is  an  independent

country.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will only say, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  before a passenger in an aeroplane lands anywhere,

he  will  know that he is landing somewhere.  There  are

announcements  coming over the intercom,  "Tighten  your

seat belts. We are landing in such and such a place."  I

am  quite  sure  that everybody who lands  at  Singapore

knows  that  he  is  in Singapore and not  in  Timbuktu.

However,  I  would like to inform the Member  for  River

Valley that the Department is considering putting  up  a

neon-sign  with  the name "Singapore  Airport"  at  Paya

Lebar and that this project is now being pursued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a sum of $72,000 is being provided

inform the House whether this item of expenditure is  in

respect of new issues of Singapore passports?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is true, Mr Speaker. The sum

provided  for is for the cost of printing new  passports

which are now being ordered from a firm in London.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0305 he

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask the Deputy Prime

Minister  to inform the House when it is likely  that  a

new  Singapore passport will be issued. As Singapore  is

now  an  independent country, it is most undesirable  to

continue  using  the Malaysian passport longer  than  is

necessary. It is a risky business. As you are aware, the

Alliance  Council has recently announced their intention

to  withdraw facilities to Singapore students  overseas.

There  is no guarantee that the same intention  may  not

apply  in this case. If that happens, very many more  of

our  citizens will be affected. I would ask  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister to hasten the issue of our own  national

passports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another item which I would like to

bring up in regard to the Immigration Department is that

they  are  still  operating on outdated  procedures  and

regulations inherited from our colonial masters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Ex-colonial masters!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Ex-colonial masters. I refer to

the   current   arrangement  whereby  Singapore-destined

passengers are required to clear immigration formalities

at  the first port of entry in Malaysia and, vice versa,

Kuala   Lumpur-destined  passengers  in   transit   from

Singapore  are required to clear immigration formalities

in  Singapore.  This, I understand, is not satisfactory,

more  so  now that Singapore is an independent  country.

Will  the  Deputy Prime Minister please consider  taking

steps to revise the procedure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, another item concerning immigration is

that Singapore is still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



depending  on  Malaysian and British embassies  to

grant visas or entry permits to people wishing  to

enter Singapore. This procedure should be remedied

as  soon  as we open up our own overseas missions.

Complaints  are  being received that  applications

for  approval  for  visas  and  entry  permits  by

intending  tourists and businessmen  to  Singapore

are  unduly  and unnecessarily delayed at  Bangkok

and  Hongkong. In view of the volume of  passenger

traffic  between these two places  and  Singapore,

would  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  consider  the

posting of passport officers at these places?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, at the moment,

we  are  issuing provisional Singapore  passports,

Any  person who holds a Malaysian passport or  any

other  type of passport, provided he is a  citizen

of  Singapore, and he wishes to change over to the

Singapore passport, can do so. The main reason why

we  have  not  urged  every Singapore  citizen  to

acquire a Singapore passport is simply because  of

the suddenness of Singapore being independent.  We

were  caught  flat-footed with regard to  passport

facilities,  and  we,  therefore,  arrived  at  an

agreement with the Central Government of  Malaysia

that   Singapore   citizens  who  hold   Malaysian

passports  could  continue to use these  passports

until  they  expire  or until the  holder  of  the

passport  wishes  to exchange it for  a  Singapore

passport.  I  have  indicated just  now  that  new

passports  are being ordered from abroad,  and  we

have  been  informed that it would take about  six

months or so for them to reach us. So we should be

in a position probably some time in the early part

of next year to issue normal Singapore passports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the second point raised by the

Member  for River Valley on immigration  clearance

at  Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, I agree  with  him

that this is an established procedure. I would not

say  that  all procedures initiated by ex-colonial

masters  are  bad.  Whether  it  will  be  in  the

interest  of both Singapore and Malaysia  to  have

different  arrangements with  regard  to  clearing

passengers  by  air at Kuala Lumpur and  Singapore

has to be discussed, but if it appears



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is necessary that we should review  this

question, then, of course, it shall be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the issuing of visas or entry

permits to those who wish to visit Singapore, I am

afraid   as  far  as  overseas  applications   are

concerned,  we  are  very much  dependent  on  the

Malaysian Embassy and the British Embassy to  help

us out, for the simple reason that, at the moment,

we  just  do  not  have a single  embassy  abroad.

However,  I  have made arrangements to  allow  the

Trade  Commissioner in London to issue  visas  and

passports, and subsequently when we have appointed

a  permanent representative to the United  Nations

in  New York, he also will be empowered to perform

this   function.  When  our  Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs  has  established our embassies  in  those

capitals - this has already been indicated - then

this  problem  will  no longer arise.  However,  I

shall  look  into  the matter of taking  immediate

steps  to  find an agency or an agent in  Hongkong

who  will  be given the power of issuing visas  to

those  who  wish to visit Singapore.  However,  it

must  be  remembered that the issuing of visas  is

not  as  simple as just chopping the stamp  of  an

immigration  passport  on to  a  piece  of  paper,

because many of these applications have to be sent

back to Singapore for examination, and it may turn

out  that  some of the applicants are undesirables

whom we do not wish to allow entry into Singapore.

So  if  there  is some inconvenience  due  to  the

delay, I am afraid it cannot be helped because  we

have  to  consider  the security  aspect  of  such

applications also. Nevertheless, I will look  into

the  matter of expediting the issuing of visas and

entry  permits at Bangkok and Hongkong  to  places

which  the  Member for River Valley has  just  now

mentioned.

Head 0307 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 0307 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1022.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government have provided many

amenities  for  the  people and we have  to  praise  the

Government  for  that. But if we take the  case  of  the

postal  employees,  they  have not  been  provided  with

sufficient quarters, and most of them do not enjoy these

facilities.  I do not think it is fair to criticise  the

Government  for  this. The main reason  for  it  is  the

shortage of houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the quarters for the postal service were built

by  the colonial masters. They were built 40 or 50 years

ago.  They are not fit for use today. I hope the  postal

employees will be given more facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that this should be done. Wilkinson Road,

Geylang, Paya Lebar, Maxwell Road and Choon Guan  Street

are  the  areas  where these quarters are situated.  The

people  living in these quarters use common water-meters

and,  as a result, they are wasting their money.

Water-meters should be fixed to individual houses, so that  it

would  be economical to use water. The Government should

also  look  into the facilities for the postal employees

just  as they look after the facilities for their  other

employees. The authorities have not taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



any  action in this direction so far, but I hope it will

be taken very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962, the Postal Services accepted the policy that

quarters would be provided for postmen. But it  has  not

been implemented, and I do not know the reason for it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  on the subject of quarters for Postal Services

which worries the Member for Anson, the position is that

the Postal Services are not the same as the Police where

the  latter have to provide quarters for their  members.

Members  of the Police Force are provided with quarters.

It  is  not so with the Postal Services whose conditions

of  service  are the same as those for other  Government

employees. However, I will look into the problems of the

postal employees, and wherever possible, action will  be

taken and assistance given to the postal employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): I am happy to hear the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 0307 he reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Postal Services, employees who work more get

more  money.  This  is appreciated, because  the  Postal

Services  are an important service and we have  to  give

overtime  for this purpose. But in certain  places,  the

postmen  do  not  receive any overtime. Certain  postmen

only  receive this. I hope the Minister will  look  into

this and give equal overtime to all postmen.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Aljunied want to

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, overtime paid by

the  Postal  Services  is for work  done  during  public

holidays, Sundays and on festive days. For this  reason,

payment of overtime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



in  the Postal Services is unavoidable. Therefore,  some

postmen  are  paid  overtime  whilst  others  are   not,

depending on the nature of work done by them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

there  are  clerks  who work for  about  50  hours.  The

headquarters clerks also do the same work, but they also

do not get overtime. I have to emphasise on the delivery

postmen  because they are doing outside  work.  If  they

work  four  hours,  they are given  preference  for  two

hours' work. They say that the overtime they receive  is

worthwhile and we want people to investigate whether the

overtime  they receive is worth it or not. The  Minister

should look into this and do the needful.

requirements such as stamps, etc.? In certain  parts  of

offices are very far from their homes. Will the Minister

consider appointing postal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



agencies at or near all community centres?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, postal agencies

are established in order to provide services for people

rural areas which require postal agents, consideration

will be given to appointing such postal agents in close

proximity to community centres, as suggested by the

well   as   protect  their  property.  These   are   the

responsibilities   of  the  entire  Police   Department.

Therefore,  if  I may say so, the Police have  become  a

very  important and integral part of our nation. We  are

living  in a multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual

and multi-religious society. It is, therefore, important

that  in  the case of the Police Force we must bear  all

these  facts  in  mind. In view of this, our  Government

should introduce the policy of multi-racialism into  the

Police  Force, so that it will be organised and  staffed

by people of different races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out today that in the course of

a  nation  which  has  just achieved  independence,  the

people may have some erroneous impression of the Police.

In  this particular case, the impression that our people

may have of our Police is not very good. This impression

was  created particularly during the period when we were

in Malaysia. I noted that during this period the work of

the  Police  had  been  out of  the  normal  trend.  For

example, the people and the Police must get along  well;

in other words, both parties must understand each other,

particularly the Police who must understand the problems

of  our  people, so that they will be able to  discharge

their duties and responsibilities according to the needs

of  the people. But, unfortunately, some members of  the

Police Force tend to forget that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



are  in  uniform  and  that they have  certain  specific

responsibilities to discharge; they do things which they

should  not do. For example, when some of them  on  beat

duty  along  the  streets come across  a  woman  in  an

attractive  dress, they whistle and make wolf-calls.  So

if a foreign female tourist finds this sort of behaviour

of  members of the Police Force, then it will damage the

reputation  of Singapore and will show up the  stupidity

of such people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to say is that Members of the Police

Force must be well behaved in public, particularly so in

a   multi-racial,   multi-cultural  and  multi-religious

society.  This  is very important, because,  in  certain

cases,    language   barriers   may   give    rise    to

misunderstanding between members of the Police Force and

members  of  the public. I remember that when  Singapore

was  a  State of Malaysia, we had two civil disturbances

in  Singapore  and  the  work of  the  Police  was  very

important  and difficult. We, of course, could  not  put

too  much blame on them. The important point is language

difficulty. Some members of the public had reasons to go

outdoors  during curfew hours. For example, in emergency

cases  of  women  who  wanted to  go  to  the  maternity

hospital,  their  husbands had to go  out  of  doors  to

summon  ambulance or other forms of vehicles  to  convey

their  wives  to the hospital, and thus they  broke  the

curfew.  But  some members of the Police Force  did  not

seem  to  understand their difficulties. For example,  a

man  who  went  out  of doors to summon  a  taxi  or  an

ambulance  was  unable  to put his  point  across  to  a

policeman who did not understand his language and so  he

was taken to a police station and all the while his wife

waited for the ambulance or some car to take her to  the

hospital.  Because  of  such  misunderstandings,  a  bad

impression  has been created in the minds of the  people

against  the  Police.  And to  some  extent,  some

ill-feelings  have  been  created. It  is,  therefore,  very

important for us to note that the duties of the  Police

Force in independent Singapore are more onerous and more

important than at any time in our history.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge therefore that, apart from the basic

training  that a policeman must have, say, in  training,

parade and other matters of responsibility, we must also

inculcate  into  their  minds  a  feeling  of  national

consciousness,  so that they will be able  to  discharge

their  duties more efficiently and with a greater  sense

of responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to emphasise is that our

multi-racial country is made up of women who constitute  about

half  our  population.  It  is therefore  important  and

necessary  that this sex ratio in the population  should

be maintained when employing people in the Police Force.

In  other  words, we must have more policewomen  in  the

Police  Force.  I  understand that, although  there  are

policewomen in the Police Force, further recruitment  of

women police constables has been suspended. I feel  that

this is not proper, because women P.C.s have done a good

job,  and they have shown that they are able to  do  the

jobs  that a policeman normally does. They have played

their  part in the defence and maintenance of our social

order,  and so they should not be a minority section  in

the Police Force. As befitting our independent status, I

urge  the Minister concerned to give further thought  to

this matter and recruit more women police constables  so

that  the  other half of our population  is  also  well

represented in our Police Force and they will be able to

do their share and play their part in the maintenance of

social order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, since our Party came to  power,  the

Singapore Police Force, which is an important arm of the

Government,  has been re-moulded from a colonial  Police

Force  into  a people's Police Force. It is  well  known

that  the  Police Force is a friend, helper and guardian

of  the public. Unfortunately, during the last two years

when  we  were  in Malaysia, the Police  Department  was

taken  over  by  the Central Government from  our  State

Government.  Therefore,  during  those  two  years,  the

Police Force was not under our control and some officers

and even the rank and file from the Federation came down

here to serve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



in  our Police Force. In those circumstances, we believe

that the good image of the Police Force we had built  up

during the pre-Malaysia days was erased and that  a  bad

image was created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, we are now an independent

country and the Police Force is again controlled by  us.

Every  step  is being taken to erase the bad image  that

was  created  during the period when  Singapore  was  in

Malaysia.  I  can assure the Member for Delta  that  our

Police Force now has gone hack to the pre-Malaysia  days

when they gave a good impression to the people that they

were not colonial tools used to oppress and suppress the

people; they are law officers going about their duty  to

help protect the people of Singapore.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Delta has cited a few

instances  that  occurred  during  Malaysia  days.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am afraid that that  was  beyond  our

control.  However,  if  any police  officer  misconducts

himself  now,  he  will,  of  course,  be  subjected  to

disciplinary  action. And if anyone  is  aware  of  such

misconduct,  he can report it to the police  or  to  the

Ministry concerned, and immediate action will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of women police

constables, at present we have enough to cope  with  the

present  situation.  Therefore,  there  is  no  need  to

augment   the  present  strength.  However,  there   are

vacancies  in  the  present  strength  of  women  police

constables,  and  these vacancies will,  of  course,  be

filled in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that there is a provision

of  $1,500,00 set aside for Staff for Singapore Missions

Overseas.  What I would like our Minister to  do  is  to

inform us whether this sum of $1�



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



million  actually includes the remuneration of Singapore

diplomats to he assigned to foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is considered that we should set

up  trade  commissions in foreign countries  instead  of

setting up embassies, so as to minimise our expenditure.

The  primary  aim  of  our  Government  in  setting   up

embassies  in  foreign  countries  is  to  foster   good

relations with these countries, and by doing so, we will

ultimately  gain  their confidence and eventually  trade

with   them.  Therefore,  it  is  more  economical   and

practical  that, for the time being, we establish  trade

commissions in those countries which are likely to trade

with us. Later on we can set up embassies, because it is

considered  that  our resources are  rather  limited  at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs can enlighten

hon. Members of this House with his comments.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  yes,  this sum of  $1�  million  includes

remuneration of diplomats, High Commissioners, and other

members  of the staff who might fill these missions.  As

you  know,  Sir,  we have decided to  set  up  some  ten

missions during the coming year, and these missions,  or

embassies, will, in some cases, be concentrating more on

promoting  better trade relations between Singapore  and

other countries. In other instances, it may be necessary

to promote our political interests in certain countries,

because in these countries we may not have much prospect

of having a large volume of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not a question of only setting up a trade

mission. It costs just as much to set up a trade mission

at it does to set up an embassy or a high commission. So

the  Member  can  rest assured that  all  our  missions,

whether they be embassies or high commissions, will  try

to  promote both the political interests of Singapore as

well as the trade interests of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, I am very glad that the

Government  has constructed many schools  to  cater  for

children   of   various   communities.   Although   many

difficulties  are encountered, I suggest  that  children

should be admitted to schools in their respective areas.

Certain  difficulties may be encountered by the Ministry

in  making  these arrangements, especially in regard  to

transport   facilities,  but,  as   far   as   possible,

arrangements  should be made for children  to  enrol  in

schools  in  their  own areas. Parents  should  also  be

privileged to enrol their children in schools  of  their

preference and such requests should not be refused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding School inspectors. In schools of all

language   streams,   proper   supervision   should   be

maintained.  School Inspectors should visit  schools  to

see  for themselves how they function and make out their

reports.  Experienced teachers should he transferred  to

the higher classes according to their merits, as this is

the  way  in  which  we  will be  able  to  improve  our

education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, while beating of students should be barred. I

feel   that  students  should  respect  and  fear  their

principals.  Teachers, however, should behave  with  due

consideration.  They should not adopt  modern  ways  and

modern  styles of dress. They should remember that  they

are Asians at all times.

the second amendment.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the points the Member

for  Anson  has raised is the question of  children  who

pass   the  Secondary  Entrance  Examination   and   are

transferred to schools which are a little too  far  away

from  their houses. Although this situation exists,  the

fact  is that it is actually a problem which concerns  a

very  small minority from among 40,000 pupils  who  have

been  transferred from primary to secondary  schools  in

the  last examination. This has been a recurring problem

simply  because  when parents have been  asked  to  make

first,  second and third choices - as was the  case  the

year  before last, and two choices this year - they have

made their choices, and in a very small number of cases,

their  children  have not been allotted the  schools  of

their choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals of primary schools which presented

candidates  for  the Primary School Leaving  Examination

were  actually  instructed on the 7th of  December  this

year  to inform their pupils, who request for transfers,

to  submit their applications to the Principals  of  the

secondary  schools  where they have  been  posted.  This

applies  to cases where parents have not been satisfied,

and  invariably they have not been satisfied because the

schools are too far away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application forms may be obtained from principals of

the  secondary schools concerned from the 3rd of January

to the 7th of January, 1966, that is five days after the

schools reopen for the New Year.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to add

that  parents naturally are anxious to know whether they

have  to buy textbooks for their children who have  been

so  promoted to Secondary 1. Well, in cases  where  they

are  not satisfied with the schools where their children

have been sent to, they need not buy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



textbooks  until they have made fresh appeals for  their

children  to  be  transferred to  schools  nearer  their

homes. Also they need not make school uniforms for their

children  because of the uncertainty of  their  children

being  transferred to some other school or back to their

old school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson was worried about school teachers

wearing  modern dress. I did not hear him  actually  say

wearing  drainpipe trousers. I do not exactly know  what

he meant by the word "modern" - whether the clothes are

of  the  transparent type - very "flimsy voile" a  term

used  by  textile merchants - or with very  low-plunging

necklines.  Also I do not know whether he was  referring

to  men or women teachers in the schools. At any rate  a

few  years ago, I read complaints along these  lines  in

the  Utusan Melayu (that is before it became an U.M.N.O.

newspaper)  from  readers, parents  and  others  against

Malay  school  teachers who were fond  of  wearing  Baju

Kebaya   which   is  very  transparent.   However,   in

Singapore,  I  think  the  complaint  is  not  all  that

widespread. As a matter of fact, this is the first  time

that I have heard of such a complaint, Mr Speaker, Sir.

However,  if  complaints are made to  the  Ministry,  we

shall deal with them. But I have full confidence in  our

teachers.  Probably the Member for  Anson  saw  them  in

their  off-duty hours along Changi Beach. He might  have

recognised them as teachers in Singapore, but  I  should

think  that  in their classrooms, in their work  places,

they wear very appropriate and very decent clothes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Perhaps the Minister did

not  quite  understand what I meant. When I referred  to

very  modern  dress. I think most people would  realise,

including  Members  in  this  House,  what  I  meant.  I

referred to what is called "Yankee" dress. If a  teacher

wears this type of dress, we can imagine the effect this

will  have  on his pupils. He has to set an example  and

then only will his pupils dress correctly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, some inconvenience may be caused to teachers in

this   respect,   but  they  must  fully   realise   the

implications



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



of  living  in  a democratic society: they  must  behave

according to the circumstances. As school teachers, they

have  a  special  responsibility.  All  of  us  in  this

Assembly are here today because we were educated by  our

teachers.  It is through their exemplary behaviour  that

we achieve what we have achieved. It was in this respect

that I spoke. I am afraid the Minister has misunderstood

me. I did not refer to women teachers. I doubt very much

that  women will behave in this manner. I was  referring

to  men  teachers. Women teachers are hardly  likely  to

behave in such a manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am glad to note what the Minister has said,

and I hope he will look into the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are school children who are

posted  to  schools far away from their houses.  Parents

with  small incomes find it very difficult to meet their

transport  expenses. In view of this, will the  Minister

for  Education consider giving a transport allowance  to

students?  I also wish to know whether these  facilities

are extended to students whose parents are unemployed or

receiving  social  welfare allowance and  whether  these

facilities are known to the public.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, transport

residential  areas. However, the question  of  transport

bursaries  has  never  arisen  in  connection  with  the

primary to secondary school postings of children.  If  I

am not mistaken, the Member for Aljunied referred to the

recent complaints and requests by parents because  their

children have been posted to schools far away from their

homes.  But each and every case, as it arises,  will  be

taken into consideration for transport bursaries and, to

that extent, the allocation for transport bursaries  not

only in the main island but in the Southern Islands will

take into consideration every single case which comes to

our attention.

Since   the   Lembaga  Gerakan  Pelajaran   Dewasa   was

constituted in April 1960, adult education in the State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



has  taken  on a new meaning and new purpose in  keeping

with  the  Government's overall education policy.  While

helping   the  State  to  eradicate  illiteracy,   other

activities have been engaged in to link adult  education

with  the State's national aspirations, i.e. helping  to

raise  the level of living so that all its citizens  can

have  a  better life. It is in this context  that  adult

education   has  come  to  be  regarded  as   continuing

education  to meet the urgent needs of adults  to  forge

links between the multi-racial heritage of the past  and

new  knowledge, techniques and those of the present  and

future.  However, it is noted that the  adult  education

programme  of the Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran  Dewasa  has

been  somewhat  limited by lack of funds. Perhaps,  Sir,

the  following  grants made by the Government  for  last

year  and this year will help to explain. In 1964,  only

$900,000  was  provided  in  the  Estimates  for   Adult

Education.  In  the  course of the year,  it  took  much

convincing  to  get  a  further supplementary  grant  of

$300,000 to help the Board meet its commitments for  the

year. Again for this year only $1.2 million was provided

for in the year's Estimates and further efforts have  to

be made to get a supplementary grant of $435,000 to meet

all  the  financial commitments of the  Board  for  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Board applied for $2 million for

1966 but only $1.8 million has been put down in the 1966

Estimates.   It  is  apparent  that  the  Board's   past

submissions  for  annual  grants  have  not  been  fully

accepted,  despite  the fact that  for  1964  and  1965,

Government had to provide later supplementary grants  to

enable  the Board to meet its commitments for these  two

years.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would interest the House to note the yearly

increases  in  the number of persons attending  all  the

Board's classes and courses for the years 1961 to  1965.

I  hope  the  House will bear with me  if  I  give  some

figures. The following figures speak for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On literacy and language classes -



in 1961 there were 11,749 students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



In  1962  it  was increased to 12,670. In 1963,  it  was

20,491; in 1964, 27,353; and in 1965, 34,633.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the secondary evening classes, in 1961 there

were 4,394 students. In 1962, there were 5,712 students;

in 1963, 6,934 students; in 1964, 9,854 students; and in

1965, 10,826 students. In the other classes and courses,

that is, commercial, vocational, recreational, local and

foreign  languages; in 1962, we had 7,357  students;  in

1963,  there were 10,524 students; in 1964,  there  were

14,858  students; and in 1965, 15,026 students.  So  you

can see, Sir, that every year there is a big increase in

the  student population in the classes conducted by  the

Education Board. In 1961 the two main activities of  the

Board  were literacy and language, and secondary evening

classes.  In  1962 it extended its activities  to  other

fields. The increase in the number of persons the  Board

catered for was very marked last year and this year.  In

the  last  five years the Board has nearly  trebled  the

enrolment  in its literacy and language classes.  It  is

expected  that  given more grants the  Board  can  still

expand  its  activities  in the other  fields  of  adult

education. Sir, I hope I have painted a clear picture of

the  activities  of  the  Adult Education  Board  and  I

sincerely hope our Minister for Education will look into

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the

Member for Punggol for the very long compliment he  gave

to   the  Ministry  of  Education  in  regard  to  adult

education  in  Singapore.  He  not  only  mentioned  the

consistent   increases  in  enrolment  in  the   various

classes,  language, literacy, secondary  and  the  other

kinds   of  classes,  but  he  also  thought  that   the

allocation was not enough and that it should  get  more.

Those are very kind words indeed. It is a fact that  for

1966  we  have asked for more; almost 40 per  cent  more

than  for 1965. The contribution to the Lembaga  Gerakan

Pelajaran  Dewasa is expended mainly on the  running  of

language,  literacy and secondary evening  classes.  The

administrative  cost, including personnel  -  emoluments

for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



permanent  staff - has remained  relatively  stable

over  the past few years since the formation  of  the

Board  in  1960.  The  demand  for  adult  education,

however, has been increasing year by year, so much so

that  the annual provision in recent years has always

had  to  be supplemented. That fact alone shows  that

for  1966 we cannot go purely by previous figures and

that   should   there  be  any   need   for   further

expenditure,  then  supplementary provision  will  be

sought for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already 10,000 students in 340 secondary

classes,  and the 1966 provision is for 355 secondary

classes - a further increase - with an estimated

enrolment  of  12,000  students.  In  the  field   of

literacy  and language education, the 1966  provision

is  for  355  literacy  and language  classes  up  to

Standard 3 level for 33,000 students. Fifteen Primary

6  classes catering for 450 students are also planned

for  1966.  The Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran  Dewasa  is

also conducting extra-mural courses to cater for  the

vocational,  civic and recreational interest  of  the

public,  all  of  which  are run  without  Government

subsidy. I do not know if the Member for Punggol  was

thinking  of these classes. But if he was,  then,  of

course,  as I said a minute ago, they are  being  run

without   Government  subsidy,  despite   the

ever-expanding  activities  of these extra-mural  classes.

Every so often, Sir, you will hear of Japanese flower

arrangement   classes,  photography  classes,   motor

mechanic  classes,  classes  on  radio  repair,   T.V

repair. They will probably soon go into other courses

on electronics. Besides that, the extra-mural section

of  the  Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa also caters

for  the more intellectual type of courses with which

you  are familiar, Sir, like Hindu philosophy,  Islam

and so on, given by very prominent people well versed

in these subjects.

think the extra-mural study department of the Lembaga

Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa might consider bird

watching. The Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa asked

for the amount of $1.8 million more in the general

interest of economy of our State. If the provision of

$ 1.8 million to meet the 1966 expenditure is not

adequate, as I said earlier, then we shall seek

supplementary provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that all schools receive aid, but

certain schools find it difficult to get aid in time.

Certain schools might have land given to them by some

benefactors, but if they do not have a proper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



title  to it, action is taken against them. This  should

be looked into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know whether the

Minister  has  received  an application  from  Yun  Fong

School at Potong Pasir, which is in my constituency, for

grant-in-aid? I believe that this application  was  made

some time ago. May I know what is the position? And will

the Minister expedite this application?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the

complaint  raised  by  the Member for  Anson  about  the

slowness  in giving grant-in-aid to schools -  I  presume

he  means  new schools - I do not think there has  been

such  a  complaint  for  a long  time,  except  for  new

schools.  As for the new schools, there are a number  of

problems  which arise, and quite often the  Ministry  of

Education alone is not responsible. There are the health

and   other   requirements  with  which   the   Planning

Department, the Chief Building Surveyor's Department and

a  host  of  other  departments are connected,  and  the

problems  are  finally issued to the  School  Management

Committee  before  the  Ministry of  Education  actually

dishes out the grant-in-aid. As far as possible, we have

managed to get things done, and I can assure the  Member

for  Anson  that there have not been many complaints  of

such type of cases. If he can bring to our attention any

particular  case of grant-in-aid coming too slowly,  the

Minister for Education will take it up



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the remark made by the Member for

Aljunied  regarding a particular school, I  am  able  to

answer  in specific terms. He mentioned Yun Fong School.

It is a Government-aided school and, therefore, receives

grant-in-aid to enable it to pay the staff  as  well  as

for  the  cost of administration of the school. I  think

what  he  wants  to  know  comes under  the  Development

Estimates  -     Head D 03 Subhead 004. I  shall  however

answer  the question though it is a little out of  place

at  this  time. Yun Fong School in Potong Pasir  applied

for  a 1965 Capital Grant on the 25th of November, 1964,

in respect of furniture and equipment under that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



head  - 200 sets of pupils' desks and chairs at $20  per

set, costing a total of $4,000. It also applied, at  the

same time, for a grant for minor works to cover repairs,

colour wash to the school building, painting, altogether

costing $1,000. Incidentally, Yun Fong School is  not  a

new Government aided school.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the first application for furniture and

equipment, the Ministry has already processed it  and  a

decision will be given soon. It must be pointed out that

replacement  of furniture of old schools should  not  be

undertaken  all  at once, but should be done  in  stages

over  a  period of time, in order to enable the Ministry

to  provide funds for other schools as well, whose needs

are  equally as urgent as Yun Fong's if not more  so  in

some cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second application which is for

minor  works,  the Ministry does not as a  rule  approve

grants of projects which have already been initiated  or

completed. It is, therefore, unlikely that consideration

will be given to this request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, under this subhead 2118 relating to grants  for

higher education, the sum allocated is $15,488,000 which

is  about  $2.7 million more than that of  the  previous

year.  From  this  we  can see how much  importance  the

Government attaches to higher education. I would like to

mention   one   thing   in  passing,   namely,   Nanyang

University.  When  it was first initiated,  it  received

donations from members of the public. Now I want to talk

about the problems relating thereto. Ten years ago  when

Nanyang  University was about to be  set  up,  different

classes   of  the  people,  including  trishaw   riders,

merchants,  traders, workers, all responded  keenly  and

donated  generously  to  the  Nanyang  University  Fund,

amounting to tens of millions of dollars, but  10  years

hence  - today - we find that about $6.13 million  of

such  donations  has not been received  by  the  Nanyang

University  authorities. I would like to mention  a  few

points in regard to this sum. For instance, Mr Tan Lark

Sye  was  one  of  the sponsors or founders  of  Nanyang

University,  and  he was the Chairman of  the  Board  of

Directors  of Nanyang University until 1963. He  donated

$5  million. From 1954 to 1959 he paid $2.5 million.  He

is  still in debt to the Nanyang authorities to the tune

of  $2.5  million.  The  Nanyang Siang  Pao  donated  $1

million, but it has paid only $99,662.50 and is still in

debt  to  the tune of $900,337. Another example is  Shaw

Brothers  Co. Ltd. They donated $250,000, but  they  are

still in debt to the amount of $0.2 million. It has only

paid  $50,000. So from these examples, you can see  that

such  people  have won general acclaim  from  all  sides

through   the  newspapers  because  their   names   were

publicised. But up till now, in the course of 10  years,

large  sums from them are still not yet paid. There  are

other  minor  examples I would not like to enumerate.  I

only  hope that the Ministry of Education can  urge  the

present Nanyang University Council quickly to claim such

outstanding donations from these people and collect the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



sums quickly so as to satisfy the general members of the

public.  At the same time, Nanyang University is  almost

bankrupt. If such sums can be collected, then I  believe

it   will  he  a  great  help  to  Nanyang  University's

development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Member for Anson has  mentioned  the

revision  of  school fees just now. I think  it  is  not

necessary  for  me  to  go into  the  reasons  for  this

revision of school fees for non-citizens. I have already

explained  this  in great detail when  I  spoke  on  the

motion  thanking  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  for  his

Speech.  The revision of school fees really only applies

to  non-citizens; in other words, children who were  not

born  in  Singapore, or whose parents were not Singapore

citizens. So all the other cases will not be affected by

this ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the contributions promised by certain members

of  the  public  towards  the establishment  of  Nanyang

University,  I think legally I would say the  Government

has  no  power  to  compel them to  contribute  if  they

refuse.  At best what the Government can do is to  exert

some  moral pressure, but beyond that I do not see  what

we  can do. But, of course, I agree completely with  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  National

Development that these well-wishers who have already got

all  the  publicity  they  received  should  keep  their

promises. That is all we can hope for.
