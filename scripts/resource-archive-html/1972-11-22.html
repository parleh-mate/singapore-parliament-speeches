whether  it  is  sufficient  for  current  traffic

<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Communications):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, a total strength of  80  men  is

provided  for  the  Enforcement  Squad  for   this

financial  year  (1972-73).  At  the  moment,  the

Enforcement  Squad  is functioning  with  32  men.

Details   of   the  number  of  authorised   posts

available  for this year and the number  of  posts

filled so far are as follows:



<pre>

    Post                 Number of        Posts filled

</pre>





<br><br>Many of the posts are vacant due to

difficulty in recruitment faced by the

Police Force. The posts of Staff Sergeants

and Corporals are to be regarded

in line with the recommendations of

the Lee Soo Ann Report on the Police

Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ROV Enforcement Squad has a fleet of 40 motor-cycles, which is the number authorised for this

financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ROV Enforcement Squad is a supplementary

force  to the Mobile Squad of the Traffic  Police.

It was established primarily to deal with offences

relating to the duties and responsibilities of the ROV.

These  include monitoring  the  conduct  and

behaviour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



of  operators of public service vehicles,  dealing

with  road  tax  offences  and  other  enforcement

action  as well as assisting in the implementation

of certain policies recommended in the White Paper

on  "Reorganisation of the Motor Transport Service

of Singapore" (Command Paper 21 of 1970).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all the vacant posts could be filled, the

force  of  80  men  and 40 motor-cycles  would  be

sufficient.  However, in spite of the shortage  of

manpower, every effort is being made to  see  that

the Squad functions as efficiently as possible. In

the  month of September, for instance, a total  of

765  vehicles were interdicted by the ROV for  the

following offences:

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, will the

Minister of State for Communications consider  the

staggering   of  office  hours  to  ease   traffic

congestion in the city area?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, to some extent, office

hours   in   the  city  area  have  already   been

staggered. Perhaps a greater measure of  it  would

help to ease the traffic.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

would  the  Minister of State not agree  that,  in

respect of monitoring the conduct and behaviour of

operators   of   public   service   vehicles,   an

expeditious increase in the present corps  of  ROV

personnel  would  serve to act as  a  disciplinary

measure  against the behaviour of  bus  operators,

especially along public roads?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Since the Member for Katong has

mentioned  the behaviour of public bus  operators,

which  leaves much to be desired, let me say  that

we  have  been  trying  our  best  to  solve  this

problem, and a certain amount of measure has  been

taken.  Recently we have introduced a  nation-wide

campaign to encourage road courtesy, with  greater

emphasis on road safety.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask  the Minister of State if he would  inform

this  House  as  to the criterion adopted  by  the

Ministry   in  judging  the  efficiency   of   the

personnel  attached to the ROV. I hope it  is  not

based just on the number of summonses issued!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> As I have pointed out in my

answer, we are actually operating with 32 men  out

of  an authorised strength of 80, from the efforts

put  in  by these 32 men in keeping order  on  our

roads, one could grant that there is efficiency in

this Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> In view of the sterling efforts

that  have been shown by the 32 men, would it  not

be  better if we have the full complement of  this

Enforcement Squad as early as possible,  and  will

the  Ministry  make all efforts to see  that  this

complement is reached?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> The difficulty of recruitment

into  this Enforcement Squad is something that  is

beyond our control. This problem is also faced  by

the  Police  Force as a whole. It is,  of  course,

desirable  that  we  get our  full  complement  of

officers as soon as possible.

taken  to  increase the number  of  personnel  and

machines  to  the  authorised  strength   of   184

officers and 164 motor-cycles. The Mobile Squad at

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> May I ask a rather hoary question

as to when the full strength will be achieved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Vacancies with regard to

personnel   are   mainly  due  to  retirement   or

resignation of officers. Recruitment exercises are

now being carried out to fill them.

and   Home  Affairs  if  he  will  look  into  the

cultivation  of proper attitudes of the  staff  of

the  Immigration Department in their dealings with

the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all

Immigration staff on recruitment undergo  training

for a period ranging from one to four weeks before

they are deployed at the various offices and check-points.  During  the training they are  instructed

among other things to be courteous and helpful  to

members  of the public, as they are working  in  a

department  which has constant dealings  with  the

public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving members of the Immigration staff are

regularly  reminded to be courteous and polite  in

dealing with the public. Departmental circulars on

courtesy  and correct attitude towards the  public

have  been  issued from time to time.  Since  June

last  year,  seven such circulars were issued  and

the  latest  one was issued on the  18th  October,

1972.  Further, senior officers of the  Department

from  time to time give lectures and briefings  to

the  staff that their rudeness to the public  will

not   be  tolerated.  There  were  occasions  when

disciplinary action was taken against  members  of

the staff for being discourteous to the public.  A

Deputy  Assistant  Controller  of  Immigration,  a

Division  II  officer, was dismissed in  1969  for

being rude to a member of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public who know of specific

instances of discourtesy or rudeness by any of the

Immigration  staff  are invited  to  write  to  my

Ministry, giving details. Immediate investigations

will  be instituted and appropriate action  taken,

including  dismissal wherever necessary.  However,

general allegations of discourtesy without  giving

specific details will not be helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recall that a 13th month

salary  was  paid to civil servants in March  this

year.  In  fact, for reasons which I have  already

stated  in this House, a second 13th month salary,

which  will otherwise be paid in March next  year,

will  be  paid  in December of this year  instead.

This  payment  is intended to be  an  annual  non-pensionable  allowance, an allowance  which  would

attract  a Central Provident Fund contribution  at

the revised rate of 12 per cent. At the same time,

because  of the increase in the CPF rate  from  10

per cent to 12 per cent, all pensionable employees

in the Government service were required to make  a

two  per  cent CPF contribution with  effect  from

April  1972  on their monthly emoluments,  with  a

matching  contribution from the Government.  These

contributions   to  the  CPF   are   intended   as

additional  benefits `over and above  the  pension

benefits.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Pensions Act stands, any period of service

during which a Government employee was a member of

the  Central Provident Fund cannot be reckoned for

benefits  under the Pensions Act, unless he  first

pays  back to the Government any CPF contributions

made  by the Government on his behalf. This  is  a

requirement  under section 60 (I) of the  Act.  In

view  of  the  changed circumstances  since  April

1972, when pensionable employees were required  to

contribute two per cent of their emoluments to the

Central   Provident  Fund  in  respect  of   their

pensionable  service,  it is  necessary  to  amend

section 6 of the Pensions Act. This amendment will

allow a pensionable employee to retain the two per

cent  CPF contribution paid by Government  on  his

account  when  he  eventually  retires  from   the

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 16 of the Act is also similarly affected,

and  a  consequential amendment is required.  This

section  provides  for  the  payment  of  a  death

gratuity  when  an  officer dies  in  service,  or

within  one  year of his retirement. The  amending

Bill, when passed, is to be made retroactive  from

1st  April,  1972,  which is  the  date  on  which

contributions to the Central Provident  Fund  were

made for pensionable Government employees.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959 when the Government embarked on

transferring   Singapore's  economy   on   to   an

industrial  base,  we determined  that  the  large

proportion of the workforce would in due course be

industrially   employed.  This  meant   that   the

development  of  a  skilled  industrial  workforce

would  assume  growing importance, as  Singapore's

national  income became increasingly dependent  on

the   output   and   productivity   of   industry.

Industrial  training has therefore been recognised

as a major instrument of economic policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as a matter of national urgency, the

National    Industrial   Training   Council    was

established  in  April  1968  to  deal  with   the

immediate  problem of developing and co-ordinating

technical  education  and industrial  training  to

meet  this  need. Two months later  the  Technical

Education  Department was specially formed  within

the  Ministry of Education to execute the  targets

established by the Council. In the short space  of

four years, the Technical Education Department has

substantially achieved the initial targets set out

and laid a firm foundation for the development  of

a skilled industrial workforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like, at this juncture, to correct

certain   mis-impressions  about  our   vocational

institute graduates and the value of the  training

they   have   received,  which   would   otherwise

undermine what has so far been accomplished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the new vocational institutes were

established, the main supply of workers  with  any

vocational   training  at  all   came   from   the

vocational  schools. Because of the similar  name,

vocational  institutes have  often  been  confused

with  vocational  schools,  which  now  no  longer

exist.   This   confusion  is  most   unfortunate.

Admittedly, many former vocational school students

were   drop-outs  from  the  school  system.   The

vocational  institutes, on the other  hand,  cater

for   those  with  a  reasonably  high  level   of

education  who  wish to learn a  practical  skill.

Industries  show a distinct preference  for  these

graduates. The value of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



training  has also been recognised by  the  Public

Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vocational institute graduates have been

trained  at  heavy  public  subsidy  specially  to

undertake   industrial  employment   and   I   am,

therefore,  naturally perturbed lest doubts  about

their  value should take hold. No effort has  been

spared to explain to the public, through the  mass

media and other means, the many developments which

have  taken  place  in industrial  training  since

1968.  Any  misconceptions  and  prejudices  which

still  persist, even among a small sector  of  the

population, could be very damaging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to stamp out these unfavourable

attitudes  and to ensure that training  programmes

receive the fullest acceptance and recognition  is

to   develop   close  co-operation   between   the

Government,  industry and labour.  The  growth  of

such   co-operation   will   become   increasingly

necessary   in   the  next  stage  of   industrial

training,  as  it  is envisaged that  the  further

skill-development of the basic-trained worker  can

most  effectively  be  undertaken  by  and  within

industry.  It  is  for  these  reasons   that   an

Industrial  Training Board is  being  proposed  to

centralise,  co-ordinate and intensify  industrial

training.  A statutory board will enable  industry

and  labour  to  participate  more  fully  towards

common goals. It will have more flexibility in  an

area   where  slowness  to  respond  to   changing

conditions can result in high training wastage  on

the  one hand and critical skill shortages on  the

other.  A board will also be better able  to  deal

with  the problems of disseminating the right kind

of conceptions about industrial training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the responsibility for industrial training

becomes  vested in the Board, technical  education

in  schools will remain the responsibility of  the

Ministry. The Technical Education Department, with

all  its  functions  taken  over,  will  then   be

dissolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is essentially a

straightforward Bill. Its main purpose has already

been outlined in the Explanatory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



Statement, and I do not wish to go  into

the details again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While industrial training is primarily the

responsibility  of industry, it is  imperative  to

ensure that national interests are served. A major

function   of  the  Board  will  be  to  encourage

industry  to play its proper role in the  national

industrial training effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that the future pattern of

industrial   training  to  be  promoted   by   the

Industrial Training Board will be as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The training of operatives and artisans will

gradually be transferred back to industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On the other hand, the further development of

the  necessary training capacity for the  required

output  of  skilled manpower, both institutionally

and within industry, will be a major preoccupation

of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Board will increase the supply of persons

institutionally  trained up to  Trade  Certificate

and Industrial Technician Certificate levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The further skill-development of the basic-trained worker will be accomplished by the

employer with the help of the Board through on-the-job  training and, wherever possible,  within  the

framework of an apprenticeship training scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The emphasis in industrial training will be

placed  on the attainment of recognised standards.

The   Government  envisages  that  the  Industrial

Training  Board will develop a national system  of

trade  testing.  This will not  only  improve  the

quality  of training but also establish uniformity

of standards within the work-force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The upgrading of adult skilled workers will

be  progressively achieved through  programmes  of

off-the-job Industrial Training (OJIT),  based  on

the module system already introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) To cater for the smaller industries, group

training schemes, encompassing both apprenticeship

training  and  OJIT,  will be  developed  for  the

upgrading of key personnel, and finally,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The promotion of apprenticeship training

itself will be a primary concern of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be apparent, from what I have just

outlined, that apprenticeship schemes will feature

increasingly    in   industrial   training.    The

Government  is giving consideration to introducing

legislation to promote and regulate apprenticeship

training at some future date. The Government  will

look  forward to the views and recommendations  of

the Industrial Training Board, when formed, on the

detailed provisions that will be necessary. It  is

anticipated  that the legislation will  cover  the

definition of apprenticeable trades, the forms and

conduct of the training to be undertaken, and  the

responsibilities of both employer and  apprentice,

including  the period of indenture. The Industrial

Training  Board will then become the chief  agency

for the implementation of apprenticeship training.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to inquire from the Minister for Education as

to  when  will  the Industrial Training  Board  be

educational institutions that will be  taken  over

by  the  Industrial Training Board? Will  they  be

only  the vocational institutes? Will they include

the  technical schools, the centralised workshops,

and  so  on? What categories of teachers  will  be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



out.  Will  this affect the training programme  of

the  educational  institutions? There  is  also  a

provision  in clause 39 which makes it  compulsory

for   apprentices  who  undergo  training  to   be

insured.   I   would   like   to   know    whether

consideration  is  also given to  teachers  to  be

insured also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision for teachers to exercise the

option as to whether or not they want to remain in

the  Government service or to be opted in  to  the

Industrial Training Board. In this respect can the

Minister  for  Education ensure that a  reasonable

period  will be given to the teachers to  exercise

the  option,  so  that they  can  have  a  clearer

picture  of  what their future will be  when  they

opt?  As  at  present, they are still vague  about

their working conditions.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  heartily  commend the  Government  on  the

introduction of this Bill. I have no  doubts  that

the  effect  of  the establishment of  a  properly

administered Industrial Training Board will  be  a

vastly  improved co-ordination of  all  industrial

training  which  at  present  seems  to  be  in  a

relatively  fragmented  state.  It  can  also   be

expected that industrial training facilities  will

be  improved and extended. It is significant  that

research  and assistance in research will  feature

as  a  function of the Industrial Training  Board.

Thus,  Sir,  we  can expect a more systematic  and

rational  relationship between  training  and  the

industrial training needs that can result  from  a

better understanding of training problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that there will be a

determination of common standards to  be  attained

in different industrial skills and a common method

of   ascertaining  whether  these  standards  have

indeed  been attained. The problem that arises  is

how  to encourage industries, especially the small

ones  to  which  the  Minister  has  already  made

reference,  to  organise training  for  their  own

apprentices  up  to  the  standard  set   by   the

Industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



Training Board, or to see to the building  of  the

skills   of   employees   in   small   industries.

Obviously, incentives will have to be provided. It

is   only   realistic   to  conclude   that   many

enterprises  will  have  to  be  induced  to  take

advantage    of   the   apprenticeship    training

provisions, although the better the skills of  the

workers,  the better the chances of an  enterprise

succeeding. Of course, the beneficiary will be the

industry itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of the problem that we are having

over  quality  control. It is no use pointing  out

that  quality  control  makes  for  profitability.

There has to be a demonstration effect. Incentives

have  to be offered. In the case of the Industrial

Training Board, in as much as there has been  talk

of    payroll   tax   being   used   to    support

apprenticeship  and industrial training,  I  would

support   such  a  measure.  Indeed,  perhaps   an

additional  eventual  measure  will  have  to   be

provided,   as  what  the  Minister  has   already

referred   to,   namely,   the   passage   of   an

apprenticeship  training act which  will  make  it

compulsory  for  industries  to  provide  training

according  to  schedules, schemes  and  conditions

laid down by the Industrial Training Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, the Industrial Training Board will

have  to  work  out  the  manner  in  which  those

industries which already have general training may

be  able  to contribute to industrial training.  A

careful  judicious blend of a joint effort between

the  Government and industry will result  both  in

the  industries themselves benefiting, as well  as

our  industrial growth receiving the good  effects

of such co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two other matters in the Bill

which  I would like to refer to, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

One  of them is the composition of the members  of

the  Board. I wonder what sort of people  will  be

appointed  to the Board. I would like to recommend

that  there  should be one adult educator  on  the

Board.   The   Ministry  of  Education   is   well

acquainted with the people within its own ranks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I am rather curious about

is the hint in clause 5, which says that:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be paid to the Chairman, Deputy

Chairman and other members of the Board out of the

funds  of  the  Board  such  salaries,  fees   and

allowances as the Minister may, from time to time,

determine.'





<br><br>There seems to be a precedent  already

where  this is concerned where a member of a Board

is  given a full salary. I would imagine that  one

has  to  determine that the job he  does  will  be

commensurate   with  the  full  salary   that   he

receives.  After all, there is already a  Director

on  this  Board, and it is stated that he  is  the

Chief  Executive  Officer, so  we  would  like  to

ensure  that there is no duplication of  authority

and, of course, of salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to refer to

relates to clause 19 which, I think the Member for

Moulmein  has  already referred to,  concerns  the

carrying on of trade or business by the Industrial

Training  Board. Presumably it is  something  like

what  is  being  done in the Catering  School,  in

which case there is, at the same time, business as

well  as  training. I find it difficult to imagine

that  this  can be applied in any other  instance.

But  I  would  like  some clarification  from  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 34 (1), Sir, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister shall nominate in each year the

Auditor-General or a company auditorto  audit  the

accounts of the Board.'



<br><br>I  would strongly urge that if the Auditor-General

is  not  nominated,  a company auditor  should  be

nominated  on  the  advice of the Auditor-General,

who  should also give the terms and conditions  on

the  basis  of which the audit should  be  carried

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask a question in

relation to a point which has already been brought

up,  which is that the Board will require  persons

who  attend courses to be insured against personal

injury  and loss of life. Who is going to pay  for

this insurance, Mr Speaker, Sir?



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the

first  question raised by the Member for Moulmein,

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



would  like  to establish the Industrial  Training

Board  as soon as possible after the Bill  becomes

an  Act. Much depends on the various processes  we

have  to  go through. The Member also asked  which

institutions  will come under the jurisdiction  of

the   Board.  The  institutions  which   will   be

transferred to the Board will include mainly those

which are involved with industrial training. These

are  all  the vocational institutes, the Singapore

Technical   Institute,  the  Hotel  and   Catering

Training School. The Centralised Workshop and  the

technical schools, as I said earlier, will  remain

the responsibility of the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the staff of the institutions,

they will be given the option whether to remain in

Government  service or to join the  Board,  and  a

reasonable  period will be given to them  to  make

their options.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rather interesting query about carrying on

of  trade  or  business, I think  the  Member  for

Katong  has already answered the question  partly.

In   carrying  out  training,  there  are  certain

products which are marketable and certain services

which   are   also  marketable.  It  is  therefore

necessary  for  the Board to engage  in  trade  or

business  so  as  to dispose of  these  marketable

products and services to bring in revenue. At  the

same  time it serves as a sales promotion  of  the

skills of our graduates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not the practice of a statutory board

to  have their staff insured. I guess the best way

is  for  the  staff  - I believe  the  Member  for

Moulmein  will  expect this from me  -to  take  up

INCOME policies themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong touched on the question of

encouraging  small  industries to  participate  in

group  training schemes. We have some  measure  of

success  with the SASAR group, i.e, the  Singapore

Association  of  Shipbuilders and  Repairers.  For

these industries, we provide further education. We

organise the courses to provide a uniform training

syllabus and curriculum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



for  the  workers. We provide the  facilities  and

teaching staff for the further education component

and the industries provide on-the-job training. We

also provide expert advice on what training should

be  done in their industries. We also give certain

incentives   to  encourage  people  to   take   on

apprenticeship   training.   There   are   certain

financial  allowances to be given to any  industry

which  takes  on demobbed national servicemen  for

training  in  certain critical trades,  especially

the precision trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong also raised a very

interesting  point  about  appointing   an   adult

educator on the Board. Let me assure him that only

the  best people who can make a contribution  will

be appointed to the Board. It is with this purpose

in  mind that we have made a provision in the Bill

to  pay an allowance to the Chairman and the other

members of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him entirely that if the Auditor-General is not nominated to audit the accounts of

the  Board,  then we will take the advice  of  the

Auditor-General on who should be the best to carry

out that function.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL CADET CORPS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Cadet Corps movement in Singapore was

founded  in  1902 when the first Army Cadet  Corps

units were formed in Raffles Institution. It was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>





only  after the Second World War that the movement

gained  momentum. In 1947, Army Cadet Corps  units

were resuscitated; in 1948 the Sea Cadet Corps was

formed, followed in 1949 by the formation  of  the

Air  Training  Corps. Each of these  organisations

functioned   independently  of  the  other.   With

independence  in 1965, the need to  inculcate  the

youth  of  the Republic with a sense of patriotism

and to develop in them ruggedness of mind and body

and leadership qualities became imperative. It was

considered that an effective way of bringing  this

about   lay  in  the  training  provided  by   the

uniformed  movement in the schools.  An  expansion

programme   of   the  Cadet  Corps  movement   was

therefore  embarked  upon in  1965.  The  combined

membership of the three Cadet Corps then stood  at

just  over  1,500  with 24 schools  participating.

Today,  the strength of the Cadet Corps has  risen

to  over  14,000  members (9,000  boys  and  5,000

girls)  with  102  out  of 113  secondary  schools

participating.   Next  year,   the   Cadet   Corps

membership is expected to reach 18,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership in the Cadet Corps extends from

Secondary I to Pre-University I students. It is no

exaggeration to say that many of our top Singapore

Armed Forces personnel once served as cadets  when

they were in school. I am informed that cadets, on

becoming   national  servicemen,  have   acquitted

themselves   well,  setting  high   standards   in

discipline,  bearing,  turnout  and  performances.

That  the  Cadet Corps provides sound pre-national

service training is no modest claim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing numbers of students wishing to

join the Cadet Corps, at one time the movement was

faced  with  the difficulty of training sufficient

numbers  of  officers to meet new demands  and  to

replace  those  leaving the  Corps  on  promotion,

transfers,    secondment,    study    leave    and

resignations.  However, the problem  is  gradually

being  overcome  with  the introduction  of  cadet

training  at  the Teachers Training College.  Last

June,  36  TTC  trainees  graduated  as  qualified

teachers as well as trained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



cadet officers. Currently, there are 99 final year

TTC  students undergoing cadet training. Steps are

being taken to relieve the shortage of officers in

the  Cadet Corps through the appointments  of  SAF

reservists who are teachers. Attention is paid  to

Pre-U  I  students who are given advanced training

for appointment as Cadet Lieutenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the Cadet Corps movement

necessitated a complete review of the Cadet  Corps

organisation  as  a whole. Hence on  1st  January,

1969,  the National Cadet Corps was formed by  the

integration  of the Army, Sea and Air Cadet  Corps

to  strengthen  the administration  of  the  Cadet

Corps  movement and to raise the level of training

of  all cadets in schools. This move ensures  that

the  best  use  is  made  of manpower,  buildings,

training   areas  and  facilities  and  of   other

logistical  requirements,  resulting  in   maximum

utilisation  of  available  resources.  With  this

integration, new legislation has to be promulgated

to replace the existing Acts and Regulations which

govern   the   Army,  Sea  and  Air  Cadet   Corps

separately. Hence the introduction of the National

Cadet  Corps  Bill. In passing, I  would  like  to

mention that the Police Cadet Corps does not  form

part of the National Cadet Corps. It remains under

the  control  of  the Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.

However,  steps  are  being taken  to  update  the

Police Cadet Corps Act and the Police Cadet  Corps

Regulations  to bring them in line with  the  main

provisions  of  the National Cadet Corps  Act  and

Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the National Cadet Corps

Bill,  the Cadet Corps will be accorded the status

befitting  the role it is playing in training  our

youth to become loyal and responsible citizens  as

part  of  our  effort to build  an  organised  and

disciplined society.

wishes  to  ask  a  question  without  notice,  as

provided for under Standing Order No. 19.  I  have

considered it and am of the opinion that it is  of

an  urgent  character. I have therefore given  him

permission to ask the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  today  we all know of the tragic fire  which

broke  out at the Robinson departmental  store  at

Raffles  Place.  In view of the magnitude  of  the

fire  and  the number of lives it has  claimed,  I

regard  this as a matter of public importance  and

sufficiently  urgent  to merit  a  voice  in  this

House, for which I am grateful to you, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is simply to ask the Minister for

Social  Affairs if he would inform this  House  of

(i) the tragic outcome of the fire which broke out

yesterday in the Robinson departmental store,  and

(ii)  any other details which he may now  have  in

his possession.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at 1006 hours yesterday,

the Fire Brigade Control Room received a telephone

call that an electrical short circuit had occurred

in  the  Robinson  departmental store  at  Raffles

Place. This was followed by a series of calls from

members   of   the   public.  The   Fire   Brigade

immediately  responded  to  the  fire  call.   The

officer,  on  arrival at 1013  hours,  immediately

radioed the Fire Control Room that Robinson's  was

smoke-lodged and requested for an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



additional  pump.  The fire, fanned  by  a  steady

breeze,   rapidly  worsened  due  to  the   highly

combustible stocks and structures of the building.

Reinforcements of men and fire engines  were  sent

to  the scene immediately. The fire at this  stage

had already obtained a very strong hold and spread

rapidly  throughout the entire  building.  At  the

height  of the fire, 14 fire engines and  some  90

officers  and men were engaged in fire operations.

A total of nine hand-controlled branches and three

twin  branches were brought to bear on  the  fire.

The  Brigade  is  still  engaged  in  damping-down

operations at this very moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the fire the building and contents

of  Robinson's were completely destroyed, and  the

upper floor of adjoining and adjacent premises was

affected  by  the heat and flames.  The  Assistant

Director, Building Control Division, was contacted

and was requested to inspect the beams and columns

and  to  advise  the Brigade of  their  stability.

Following a preliminary inspection and assessment,

the  Brigade was advised that the structures  were

not  stable,  and it was therefore inadvisable  to

begin digging operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lift-car nearest Messrs Bengold was forced

open last night, but no one was found inside.  The

passenger  lift-cars located at the  rear  of  the

premises  had collapsed during the fire.  However,

Sir,  I have just been informed that at 2.00  p.m.

this  afternoon four skeletons were found  at  the

fire  site.  There  was another  lift-car  in  the

basement,  which  is  still unopened  because  the

basement is flooded with water. We do not  as  yet

know whether it is empty or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA Fire Brigade assisted the Singapore Fire

Brigade  with  manpower and pumping units  at  the

height  of this blaze. I would like to inform  the

House,  Sir,  that members of the  Singapore  Fire

Brigade and members of the PSA Fire Brigade did  a

splendid job in not only controlling the fire  but

also  in  preventing  it  from  spreading  to  the

adjacent buildings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, without making

any attempt to prejudge the cause of the fire,  at

this  juncture there are two suggestions  I  would

like to put forward to the Minister. (1) Will  the

Minister  consider  requiring all  owners  of  old

buildings, frequented by members of the public, to

be  regularly  inspected by  competent  electrical

engineers   with  particular  attention   to   the

electrical wiring? (2) At present there  does  not

seem  to be much control over the manner in  which

old buildings can be renovated. In many instances,

the  interior has been renovated to an extent that

no adequate fire exits are provided. Therefore,  I

do  not  know  whether the Fire Brigade  can  make

rules requiring owners of old buildings wishing to

renovate  to apply for their permission,  so  that

the  Fire Brigade could ensure that adequate  fire

exits  are  provided.  This is  one  aspect  worth

looking into.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, in fact, this matter

was   immediately   discussed   by   my   officers

yesterday. The outcome of the discussion  will  be

made known soon.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

some  co-ordination between the Fire  Brigade  and

the  PUB,  for example, to ensure that  sufficient

water pressure is given in all outbreaks of fire?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, there is always co-ordination between the Fire Brigade and the PUB.
