<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Health if

he is able to state (a) how many Singapore doctors in

both Government service and private practice have

registered themselves in various foreign countries to

enable them to practise there; (b) what are those

countries; and (c) what are the reasons for those

doctors getting themselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



registered  outside the country even though  they  are

enjoying  a  better status here than in those  foreign

countries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  only way of  ascertaining  the

number  of Singapore doctors registered in  foreign

countries  is  to  obtain  the  registers  of  such

countries  and  to  check them  against  the  local

register.  This is a formidable task; nevertheless,

my  Ministry is obtaining the information. However,

this  information will not indicate  whether  those

who have registered themselves in a foreign country

have already migrated or would be migrating to that

country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An indication of how many Singapore doctors have

sought   registration  overseas  is  the   number   of

applications  for Certificates of Good Standing  which

are  required  for registration in a foreign  country.

Similar  certificates are required for doctors wishing

to do postgraduate studies abroad. The total number of

Certificates of Good Standing which have  been  issued

from  1973 to date is 496, of which 211 are for  those

in  Government Service, 31 for those in the University

of   Singapore  and  254  for  private  practitioners.

Singapore  citizens constitute 80.4% of  those  issued

with such Certificates of Good Standing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given the Clerk of the House a list of tables

which  set down the analysis of the number of  doctors

who  have obtained these Certificates of Standing, and

they  will be made available to Members of the  House.

However,  I  would like to comment that  in  1973  the

total  number of doctors to whom Certificates of  Good

Standing  were  issued was 45; in 1974  it  more  than

doubled  to 114; in 1975 it was 151 and in  the  first

five months of 1976 it was 186.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For additional information (See Appendices A and B, cols 1001-2)

with regard to  dentists,in  1  973 the number

of Certificates of Good Standing issued to dental

surgeons was zero; 11 in 1974; 11  in 1975  and  14

for  the  first five  months  of  1976.

Singapore citizens constituted 78% of persons to  whom

these certificates were issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Delta that my

Ministry  is  processing  registers  which   we   have

obtained from overseas, and we are now in the  process

of  counting  heads. I think it is useful  information

that the Ministry should acquire, just in case.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>

Ministry  of  Social Affairs regularly  checks  public

places  for  the  presence  of  beggars.  Patrols  are

carried  out  twice a day by Social Welfare  officers.

This  has been done since 1965. For the 10-year period

from 1965 to 1974, an average of about 300 beggars per

year  were contacted by the Social Welfare Department.

However,  in  1975  the  number of  beggars  contacted

dropped  to  202. In the first quarter of  1976  there

were  only  43. These figures indicate that  far  from

there  being an increase in the number of  beggars  in

public places, there has been a drop in number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggars who are found to be destitutes are admitted

into the Department's Homes for the Destitutes if they

need  shelter  and care. The aim of admitting  beggars

into  such homes is not just to accommodate them.  The

real  objective is to provide them with some  training

for  those who can be trained and thus enable them  to

take up employment and return to independent living in

the  society.  Unfortunately, the number  who  can  be

helped in this way is hopelessly small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also point out that a number of beggars or

apparently destitute persons do have families who, for

one  reason  or  another, do not wish  to  assume  the

responsibility  for  their care. The  biggest  problem

that  the  Social  Welfare  Department  faces  is   in

motivating  their families to take care of  them.  The

policy  has  been that, wherever it is possible,  such

destitute  persons will be discharged to the  care  of

their families.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



smoking  is considered dangerous to health  and  anti-social, if he will consider introducing legislation to

prohibit  the smoking of cigarette by youths  below  a

certain age.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to discourage smoking and

minimise nuisance to non-smokers in public places, the

Government  has  banned smoking in cinemas,  theatres,

lifts  and  buses. The advertisement and promotion  of

the  sale  of  tobacco and cigarettes over television.

newspapers,  magazines and in public places  has  also

been banned. Television Singapore frequently warns the

old  and  the young not to smoke away their lives  and

their money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I appreciate the Member's concern for our

youth,  it  is not considered appropriate to introduce

legislation to prohibit smoking by the young  under  a

certain age. Apart from the practical difficulties  of

enforcement, legislation  by  itself  would  not   be

sufficient  to  discourage the  habit.  Public  health

education on the health hazards of smoking and  proper

parental guidance would be more effective in the  long

run.

those professionals have gone to; and (c) whether some

return to Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, persons who emigrate

generally do not declare their true intention  to  the

Immigration Department. The Department comes  to  know

that  a  person  is emigrating or has emigrated  to  a

foreign country when:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) he informs the Department, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) he has withdrawn all his money from the CPF, or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) he applies from a foreign country for renewal

of  Singapore travel documents after having stayed

in that country for several years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department therefore does not have

statistics  of persons who have emigrated but  do  not

fall  under  any of the categories I have  enumerated.

However,   on  the  basis  of  whatever   record   the

Immigration   Department  has,  it   shows   that   55

professionals  emigrated during 1  97275.  Of  the  55

professionals, there were 21 management personnel. 1 6

technicians,   six  teachers,  five  engineers,   four

mathematicians,  two  nurses and  one  accountant.  An

obvious omission in these statistics is the number  of

doctors  who  have  emigrated.  This  shows  that  the

doctors   who  have  emigrated  did  not  inform   the

Immigration Department, did not have a CPF account, or

did not need to renew their Singapore travel papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department will have more comprehensive figures

when  Exit  Control is introduced. This will  be  done

when the new Checkpoint at Woodlands is completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the 55 professionals emigrated to

Australia. The breakdown by country is as follows:-



<pre>

      (1) Australia       41

      (2) Canada           8

      (5) India            1

will take action against the operators.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, "Tikam Tikam" is a

relatively minor offence of gaming in public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



Nevertheless, operators of "Tikam  Tikam"  are  dealt

with  under  Section 7(4) of the Common Gaming  Houses

Act  (Chapter 96). A person found guilty  of  such  an

offence  is  liable,  on conviction, to  a  fine  not

exceeding  $6,000 or to imprisonment for  a  term  not

exceeding three years, or both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Department is aware that "Tikam Tikam"

still exists in Singapore after its intensified action

against  the operators had brought down the number  of

such  conviction to an all-time low of  two  cases  in

1972. The  illegal activity has picked up again.  The

Police has been taking action against the operators to

prevent it from mushrooming to the same scale as prior

to  1967 when complaints were received from almost all

school authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, 28 persons were prosecuted for "Tikam

Tikam" offence, of which 27 were convicted with  fines

imposed totalling $4,287. During the first four months

of  this  year, seven persons out of eight  prosecuted

were  convicted. Six of them were fined  for  a  total

amount of $3,900 and the other person was sentenced to

1   8   months'  imprisonment, without  a  fine,  for

committing the offence a second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty provided under Section 7(4) of the

Common  Gaming  Houses Act (Chapter  96)  is  adequate

deterrence   for  would-be  "Tikam  Tikam"  operators.

Police  action  against "Tikam Tikam"  operators  will

continue.

certificate to be issued to a child born in  Singapore

shall  ordinarily be the surname of the father of  the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



the child is legitimate. If the child is illegitimate.

then  either  the surname of the mother  or  both  the

citizenship  status  of  an illegitimate  child  shall

follow  that  of the mother. If illegitimate  children

are  registered  at birth bearing the surname  of  the

purported father there can be abuse in cases where the

mothers  are  not Singapore citizens. In  such  cases.

citizenship  can  be  acquired  for  the  illegitimate

children by arranging for Singapore citizens to  claim

fatherhood for these children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where the mother of the illegitimate child

10  of 1976. The Government has decided to accept  the

13,000

to   20,000  electors.  Also  in  re-delineating   the

the  following six constituencies, whose electorates

are  very  unlikely to increase substantially, have

been eliminated:-

   2    Crawford

<br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, as the total electorate for the next

  1  Ang Mo Kio

  2  Bedok

will   therefore  increase  the  number  of  electoral

divisions from 65 to 69. This increase will come  into

effect only at the next general elections, which means

the  status  quo in this House remains. Consequent  to

the  increase of the electoral divisions to 69, it  is

necessary   again   to  introduce  the   Parliamentary

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee's Report on this Bill was

presented to Parliament on 24th June,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



1976, as Paper Parl. 4 of 1976 and the Bill as set out

in  the  Report  and  now  tabled  before  this  House

embodies the recommendations of the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vital clause in the Bill and the one which

attracted  the  greatest interest is  clause  5  which

seeks to do away with the legal requirement to caution

a  person  under arrest and to restrict the  right  of

silence  of  the accused. From its provisions  flow  a

number  of  other  important provisions  which  enable

inferences  to be drawn from the accused's failure  to

mention  relevant  facts when  charged  and  from  his

failure to give evidence when or should his defence be

called upon. The Law Society of Singapore, noting that

the  abovementioned provisions introduced a completely

new  concept  in the administration of justice,  added

that  in  principle  it  supported  this  concept  but

recommended   certain   safeguards.   Some   of    the

recommendations of the Law Society were  accepted  and

the  original  Bill has been amended accordingly.  For

instance, the proviso to subsection (5) of section 121

of  the Criminal Procedure Code appearing in clause  5

of  the Bill has been amended to remove the discretion

given  to  the  court to refuse to admit  a  statement

obtained by inducement, threat or promise. The  Select

Committee also deleted from clause 6 of the  Bill  the

provision enabling adverse inferences to be drawn from

the  accused's  failure to state relevant  facts  when

questioned  by a police officer before he  is  charged

with an offence or officially informed that he may  be

prosecuted for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting on the recommendation of the Law Society the

Select Committee amended the original Bill to make

inadmissible hearsay statements made after the

commencement of investigations to prevent people

fabricating evidence. Another amendment made extended

the safeguards contained in subsection (2) of the

proposed new section 371 D to trials in the

Subordinate Courts so that, without the leave of the

court, hearsay statements may not be given in evidence

at trials before the High Court as well as before the

Subordinate Courts unless a notice containing the

required information has been

representation received and if any recommendation  was

not  accepted, the Select Committee had  good  reasons

for rejecting it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Evidence (Amendment) Bill was committed to

a  Select Committee on the 19th August last year.  The

Committee  received  four written representations  and

Workers'  Party  and  those  of  the  Law  Society  of

Singapore.  The Report of the Committee was  published

and presented to this House on 24th June, 1976 as Paper

ParI. 5 of 1976. The Bill as set out in the Report and

now  tabled before this House contains amendments made

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill was committed to a Select Committee on the

written  representations and heard oral evidence  from

Parliament  on 24th June, 1976, as Paper  ParI.  6  of

1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the written representations pointed out

certain  inconsistencies in clause 2 of the  Bill  and

the  Select  Committee  has  made  amendments  to  the

clause. The proviso to subsection (1) of section 14 of

the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act  proposed

by  clause 2 Of the original Bill has been deleted, as

Government  does  riot  desire to  extend  the  powers

officers below the rank of sergeant.

reclamation  by  Government  of  approximately  242.82

hectares  (600 acres) of the foreshore and sea-bed  at

Pulau  Sudong, as shown coloured in pink on  the  plan

marked  "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/76"  which

is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to reclaim about 242.82 hectares

(600  acres)  of  the foreshore and  seabed  at  Pulau

Sudong. I have a copy of the relevant plan and another

copy is displayed in the Library of this House for the

information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island will initially be utilised by the Sentosa

Development   Corporation  to   provide   recreational

facilities  which will include swimming  lagoons.  The

island  will  eventually  be required  for  industrial

purposes  and  then  transferred to  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation on terms and conditions to be agreed  with

the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation will be undertaken by the Port of

Singapore Authority as agent of the Government. It  is

expected to take about three years to complete, and to

cost about S$64 million. Fill for the reclamation will

be  obtained by dredging the navigational channels  of

the Main Strait Shoal and Sawa Pemalang Shoal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to 1972, the Department of Chemistry was

primarily  concerned  with the provision  of  routine

chemical services to Government departments  and  was

staffed entirely with Chemists. In recent years, the

scope   of   its  activities  has  been  considerably

expanded  into other fields such as food  technology,

radiation  protection and chemical  engineering.  The

staff of the Department now includes Microbiologists,

Chemical Engineers and Physicists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cater for the wider range of its

activities,   the   Department   was   re-named   the

Department  of Scientific Services and  a  scheme  of

service entitled Scientific Services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



Scheme  was introduced on 1st April, 1976. Consequent

upon  these  changes, it is necessary  to  alter  the

titles  in  the  Department in  accordance  with  the

provisions  in  Section 3 of the Departmental  Titles

(Alteration)  Ordinance (Chapter 55  of  the  Revised

Edition).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement of this House is therefore sought to

amend  the  schedule  to the said  Ordinance  and  to

substitute the new titles or names of office for  the

old  titles  or names of office as indicated  in  the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<pre>

  That this Parliament pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles

  (Alteration) Act (Chapter 53), resolves that the Schedule to the said

  Act be amended by the addition under the headings of 'Old Title or Name of Office'
