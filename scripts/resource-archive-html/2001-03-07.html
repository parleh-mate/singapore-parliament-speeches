<div align="center"><b>TRANSFER OF PRESIDENCY IN THE PHILIPPINES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Senior Minister if he

will  explain his recent statement that the transfer  of  the

presidency in the Philippines is not a plus for democracy and

whether he was speaking for the Government of Singapore  when

he made the statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Question

No.  1, Sir.  May I apologise that at the last sitting, I did

not rise from my seat.  I offer you my apologies.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock) (for the Senior Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Senior

Minister, in an interview with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>

Associated Press on 22nd January 2001, expressed his personal

opinion  that  it would have been better for the  Philippines

had President Estrada been removed in a constitutional way by

conviction in the Senate.  The fact that Estrada was  not  so

removed, did not resign, and the Supreme Court had to declare

the  presidency  vacant  in  order  to  swear  in  the  Vice-President, did not strengthen the democratic institutions  of

the Philippines.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first of all

express  my  disappointment that the Senior Minister  is  not

here  to  answer  the Question.  After all, he  is  asked  to

explain, not simply to say that he made the statement.  May I

ask:   did  he  make  it clear that he was  speaking  in  his

personal  capacity  and  not speaking  as  a  member  of  the

Government, disassociating the Government from his view?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I have

answered  the  question.  I said, "Senior Minister  expressed

his personal opinion".

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, the question was: did the Senior

Minister,  when  he did express these views,  make  it  quite

clear that he was not speaking on behalf of the Government of

Singapore, but that it was his own personal view?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock:</b> Sir, if Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam reads

carefully what Senior Minister had said in the interview,  at

no point did Senior Minister profess to be putting across the

views of the Singapore Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that he still

does  not answer my question.  The question is:  did he  make

it clear that he was not?  If I am not going to get an answer

to it, may I move on to the next question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, by all means. Move on to the next

Question, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, the next question I am moving to is

not  Question No. 2 but another question for the Minister  of

State.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Has the Senior Minister now explained

why, giving his reasons for saying that it was not a plus  or

boost for democracy?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock:</b> Sir, I have explained in my reply to

his  main  Question  that the fact that Mr  Estrada  was  not

removed  in a constitutional way is therefore not a  plus  or

did   not  strengthen  the  democratic  institutions  of  the

Philippines.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> This is ex post facto. But is the

Senior  Minister now aware that the Supreme Court  has  ruled

that  he  was constitutionally removed, and that it  was  not

against the Constitution?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock:</b> Sir, I am not an expert on the

Constitution, but I am aware that the Supreme Court's  ruling

is different from Mr Estrada being impeached and convicted in

the Senate.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

stored in Singapore; (b) what facilities have been granted to

the United States Armed Forces in Singapore; and (c) what are

the  terms of the agreement between Singapore and the  United

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T. E. Lim) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Sir, there are no nuclear weapons stored in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), US

forces are allowed access to facilities at Paya Lebar Airbase

and  Sembawang  Wharves, as well as a small office  space  at

Clifford  Pier.  In 1998, we signed an addendum to  the  1990

MOU  which  allows  US Deep Draft Vessels, such  as  aircraft

carriers, to berth at Changi

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>

Naval  Base.  The following principles are enshrined  in  the

<br><br>1990&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOU.  The US recognises and respects the sovereignty  of

Singapore,  the laws of Singapore including our Constitution,

and accepts that our judicial process must not be impaired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US forces pay for housing and supplies and services

which they request. The MOU also states clearly that the  SAF

has priority for the use of the facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, will the Ministry make public the

MOU  or  whatever  agreements it has with the  United  States

government?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the salient

facts of that MOU have already been made public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have an answer to

the  question?  Is the Ministry prepared to make  it  public?

Why  can  the public not know exactly and read for themselves

what  is  the agreement between the Singapore Government  and

the United States government?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the

salient facts of the agreement have already been made public.

I do not know what Mr Jeyaretnam is pressing for.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, we have been told that they respect

the  sovereignty  and the judicial process in  this  country.

May  I  know  the  answer  to a specific  question?   Are  US

personnel stationed in Singapore subject, for any conduct  of

theirs,  criminal or civil, to the civil and criminal  courts

in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, if I understand Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam

correctly, he is asking whether our personnel in the  US  are

subject to the laws in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Subject to the jurisdiction of the

Singapore courts.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, this depends on whether our personnel

who are stationed overseas are conducting military exercises.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am asking about US personnel in

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Are they subject to our laws?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are they to be prosecuted in the

Singapore courts?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> If they break our laws, yes. If the US

personnel  in Singapore break Singapore laws, then  they  are

subject  to  our  laws  and they may  be  prosecuted  if  the

Attorney-General decides that there is a case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I just ask

the  Minister of State to clarify that he is assuring us that

the  MOU  with  America  is  in accordance  with  Singapore's

obligations  under  the Southeast Asian Nuclear  Weapon  Free

Zone Treaty?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, the presence of US Armed Forces in

this region contributes to the stability and security of  the

region.  I think this is something that is welcomed not  just

by Singapore but also by the other Southeast Asian countries.

about  what shape of recovery in terms of alphabets.  Let  me

continue with this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fear the U-shape recovery because that will mean that

we  spend  too long at the bottom.  What we seem to have,  in

Singapore's case, is very much a V-shape recovery,  last  one

in and first one out.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>

increasingly, the present scenario seems to be more of  a  W,

up and down, much depending on what happens in the US market.

My own view, however, is that beyond U, V, W, we have to look

at  the next alphabet, which is the X.  The X-shape seems  to

apply  not only for Singapore but for Asia, and this is  that

some will be going down and are likely to stay down, and this

would not just be countries but also companies and sectors of

society.   In  contrast,  others  would  be  going  up  quite

rapidly.  In Asia X or Singapore X, we will actually need  to

deal  with  a  whole new way of trying to help those  at  the

bottom  improve and hold the society together when  we  would

have quite different levels of results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget has been welcomed as the most generous

Budget. There are suggestions that this is an election Budget

and that, in that sense, it would not likely be repeated.   I

join  those  who welcome the Budget.  However,  I  hope  that

there  would not be a one-off.  Some of the features of  this

Budget should endure and, indeed, be strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget policy has the makings of a new and very

welcome  approach  for this new age of globalisation  and  of

this X-feature in our society.  There are special efforts  to

target  assistance to the less well-off.   The  Minister  has

proposed  lessening  the tax burden, especially  for  smaller

businesses and the lower-income and middle income earners.  I

welcome  these but more, of course, can be done.   Some  have

thought  of a social safety net. There are, however,  dangers

in  elaborate  systems of welfare.  They are costly  for  the

State and for the taxpayers.  Even for the recipients of  the

welfare,  there  is  a danger of creating dependency  and  of

damaging  self-worth and motivation.  The better approach  is

one that can both save but avoid ensnaring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I think we are at a bit of crossroads in

thinking  about  the  future  of  our  society.   It  was  my

privilege  recently  to  chair  two  talks  at  the  National

University of Singapore where I teach.  One was by  DPM  Tony

Tan and the other by the Member for Potong Pasir, Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>

Chiam  See Tong.  Mr Chiam, in his talk, emphasised the  need

for  welfarism, to think about how to take care of the  poor.

DPM  Tony  Tan  emphasised the new  and  dynamic  changes  in

education  -  the only way to help give people the skills  to

meet  the challenges of the new economy.  Mr Chiam, I  think,

touched a sympathetic vein among some of the students.  But I

think DPM Tony Tan challenged them to look at the way forward

and  how  to bring the whole society up, and this is  what  I

mean by the challenges facing us as we go forward.  We should

not, in that sense, be thinking about a social safety net  or

an elaborate welfare system.  We should instead be seeking to

develop  a  trampoline that would help save people when  they

fall, but help them bounce quickly back up.  How can this  be

constructed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think we should focus on the individual. It is

good   that  the  Minister  proposes  doubling  the  Lifelong

Learning Endowment Fund, but the questions of how it will  be

used  are still to be answered in full.  I think there  is  a

danger  that  this Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  will  be

overly  bureaucratic and will favour those who  know  how  to

fill up the forms properly and, in the first place, know what

they  want.  I think there has to be much more leeway in this

Fund,  so  that they can target people who truly  need  help.

There  should  be education bursaries specially targeted  for

mature  students,  those  who  take  the  Government's   call

seriously to go back and improve themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, the Government should also consider

special  counselling for those who wish to upgrade themselves

or  those who may be working in sectors that may, in  future,

prove  vulnerable.  Because, how else will people  know  that

they  need  to take upgrading and what precisely should  they

do.   Studying,  say,  the arts may be of  interest  to  some

people,  but  they  may  not be   helpful  for  them  in  the

particular sector that will emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should also increase match-making services

for  employment.  I think, in this way, the counselling,  the

match-making  and  the special grants for  mature  and  other

special students will need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>

cooperation,   not  just  with  the  economic   agencies   of

Government but those in charge of community.  In this  sense,

I  hope we will see the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry

of Community Development work much more closely together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of this need for counselling and the need

for  community  development, because of a taxi  ride  I  took

recently  back from the airport.  It was a late night  flight

and  when  I  got  in, I was surprised to see  a  woman  taxi

driver.  After a while, we spoke and I found out that she was

a former assembly line supervisor.  The factory was upgrading

and  she  had actually been offered retraining at  the  going

rate of partial pay during the period of retraining, but  yet

she  chose to quit and to be a taxi driver.  There is nothing

wrong  with being a taxi driver.  But, obviously, this  is  a

job with  both independence and yet insecurity and one which,

in her case, forced her to drive even later into the night to

earn more money, and this despite the fact that she has young

children.  Of course, everyone has the right to make his  own

decisions about his own life.  But I had to ask whether  this

was  actually wise, not just for her and her career  but  for

the  family  and  for the society.  And I hope  this  is  one

example  the Ministry will consider about needing to  counsel

our  people  when it comes to thinking about rather  abstract

thoughts  such as upgrading.  In the Singapore  of  tomorrow,

there  must be a place for everyone, but to help the process,

we  will  need  ushers  to  help  people  find  their  place.

Otherwise,  people will tend to bunch up at the back  and  no

one will sit in the front row.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in this sense, limits to centrally held funds

and  Government initiatives, and I would urge the  Government

to  go  beyond the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to  allow

individuals  to  take  ownership  over  their  own   lifelong

learning.  Government must neither pity nor pander to people.

It  must  empower them.  Measures that can help this  include

tax  write offs or even the use of their CPF when individuals

invest in their own upgrading, training and education.   When

the Lifelong Learning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>

Endowment  Fund  cannot reach everyone, they can  reach  into

their own resources and should be encouraged to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, beyond the individual, I join the call of many

MPs  that Government can and should do more to help small and

medium enterprises.  Government agencies that deal with  SMEs

should be strengthened and, in some ways, be retooled.   Many

of  the Government agencies, such as the Economic Development

Board,   are   very  used  to  working  with   multi-national

corporations  and big companies.  They are good  at  it,  but

this  is  what they are used to and there is a temptation  to

measure their success by the number of big deals they do with

even bigger figures.  It must be, however, more difficult and

every bit as important to help smaller companies even if  the

figures are not so impressive.  In this, specifically, I want

to  mention the super business Chamber that the Government is

promoting.   I  believe that when this is set up,  this  must

have  a  due  place for SMEs and local non-Government  linked

companies.   Otherwise, this super Chamber will  risk  simply

reinforcing some of the concerns that people have about  SMEs

and private businesses in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my third point, Sir. The perception

continues  that multi-nationals and GLCs unfairly  crowd  out

Singapore  businesses.  These perceptions should be addressed

if untrue, as the Minister for Trade and Industry has said in

a  recent sitting of Parliament.  If there is any element  of

truth in some sectors or in particular cases, this should  be

redressed.  We have to ensure a playing field for  small  and

medium  enterprises that is level and fair and that, in  some

ways,   understands  their  limitations  and  accepts   their

potential as their entry point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also important because we are increasingly

moving   away  from  Government  regulation  to  Government's

dependence  on markets.  After this sitting, we will  have  a

large  debate about the deregulation of power and, of course,

that,  until  very recently, was thought to be  a  Government

natural monopoly.  Markets are fine things, but markets  need

to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>

designed.   Markets depend on free and fair competition  with

sufficient  players.  Unless Government ensures that  markets

are  open  and that the thresholds to entry are not too  high

and  do  not block out SMEs, we will create not markets  that

are  free  and fair but, unwittingly, we may create  cartels.

The  stickiness of fuel prices in the present climate  is  an

example  of  this that consumers feel every  day.   There  is

supposed  to  be fair competition in this area  but  we  have

trouble if we try to actually find fair prices to reflect the

lessening of fuel prices world wide.  Government, as a  major

shareholder, should rein in GLCs who compete in  areas  where

SMEs  and  start-ups are coming up.  These GLCs  should  stay

within  their  key  focus areas, assuming they  have  thought

about these areas, and they should think long term and big.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One additional point, Sir, this time about larger

companies.   The  Minister's Budget Statement has  emphasised

the  growing  diversification of the  Singapore  market.   In

terms  of  its markets and products, the USA and disk  drives

remain  important to Singapore, but now less so in proportion

to other markets and other products.  Such diversification is

very  much  needed.  Europe, including Eastern Europe,  Latin

America  and  Asia,  especially  Korea  and  Japan,  will  be

important to emphasise on the way ahead.  The way ahead  will

be  paved by Government, as we negotiate bilateral trade  and

other  economic treaties, but the risks remain, and the risks

will  remain for the private sector to take.  Companies  that

go  out will have to take these risks.  Many were hit by  the

crisis  and they will be hit by future ones, as they  go  out

again to the region and the wider world.  Given this, I would

ask  the  Government to consider underwriting  part  of  that

risk.   Government should allow companies that go out to  set

off overseas losses, if any, against Singapore-based profits.

This,  I  understand, is already allowed in some cases  where

there  is  a  double  taxation  agreement,  but  not  in  all

countries and, certainly, not enough of them for Singapore to

go  global and truly regional.  If certain conditions set  in

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>

ensure the validity of these losses, the principle should  be

carried  out  to more overseas ventures in new countries  and

perhaps  these  can  be  linked to the  bilateral  trade  and

economic agreements that we are negotiating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are entering a world of greater risk and

diversity.  The Government's role is no longer to  drive  the

engine, fuel the tanks as well as steer the ship.  It is more

a  matter now of stewardship and of empowering others to take

the  lead.  The Government is wise in saying we can no longer

ensure that we pick all the right winners.  The question  now

is how we enable our people, our SMEs, our private sector and

how  we  enable  and create an environment that  can  support

change, their striving and their thriving.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget, as the

last  speaker has said, has been termed in some quarters,  as

an election Budget and being very generous.  Of course, it is

generous.  One can see that.  But the question that has to be

asked  is:  is this generosity spread to all our people?   Is

it  even  handedly spread or is there any neglect or uncaring

attitude towards some sectors of the population?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, at the outset, reject completely the idea that it

is  welfarism to take care of and to attend to the  needs  of

those   in  society  who  are  unable  to  afford  the  needs

themselves.  It is not welfarism.  It is to see that all  our

people,   regardless  of  their  wealth  or  their   poverty,

regardless  of the level of their income, do not  go  without

the  basic  needs and necessities they need for  human  life.

For  that reason, Sir, I find the Budget lacking very  badly.

I  have  no  quarrel with the tax cuts, with the rebates  and

what  is being done to help the business sector.  But,  if  I

may  say  so, this Budget shows a callous disregard  for  the

plight of at least 20%, or it may be even 30%, of our people,

and it reflects the lack of any political will on the part of

this  Government to do anything for them.  I am,  of  course,

referring to the widening gap in our society between the rich

and  the poor.  I do not think I need to tell the Members  of

this  House  that  if this widening gap is  not  checked  and

something is done to rectify the widening gap,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>

the results for this society will be disastrous.  I hope such

a  thing  may  not  come to pass, but that there  will  be  a

greater  bonding, as the calls have been from the  Government

-   we hear this again and again  -  a greater bonding of the

people together, a caring for all of them, not that some  are

left out and only some are cared for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Statistics released an occasional

paper   in  May  of  last  year  drawing  attention  to   the

accelerated widening of the gap between the rich and the poor

in  Singapore.  I spoke on this in this House  in  August  of

last  year  when  I  proposed a number of measures  that  the

Government  could take - not welfarism; I was  not  proposing

handouts  -  to remedy and to halt this widening gap  between

the rich and the poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech

referred to this release by the Statistics Department of  the

widening  gap.  He seemed very upset by a photograph  in  the

Straits  Times showing a cleaner with a quote: "I survive  on

$133  a  month."  I hope the editor was suitably rebuked  and

told  not  to  write such nonsense.  But that  was  what  the

Department  of  Statistics reported -  that  persons  in  the

bottom 10% of our society were only earning that amount.  The

Prime  Minister says that it is misleading, and he says  that

no  cleaner  earns only $133 a month.  But when I spoke  last

year,  I referred to the statistics on wages and I said  that

for 1999, there were 14,700 workers earning less than $200  a

month  and there were 33,700 earning less than $400 a  month.

Is  the  Prime  Minister not aware of these statistics?   And

then  he  takes  up  what  has been  attempted  by  even  the

Department  of Statistics, that the fact is that  the  bottom

10%,  he  says, have a reasonable standard of living  -  they

have  their TV sets, they own their houses - so what  are  we

complaining  about?  And he attributes the  widening  gap  to

globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make it quite clear here that I do accept that in

all  societies,  there must be a gap.  But the responsibility

of  government is to see that the people at the  very  bottom

level  are  not thereby left out completely.   Again,  may  I

repeat, that is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>

not  welfarism,  that  is acting as a responsible  government

with  a  conscience.  The Prime Minister speaking then quoted

President  Zedillo of Mexico.  And if I may  give  the  quote

here.   President  Zedillo  was replying  to  whether  wealth

should be spread more evenly and his reply apparently was:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are confused. You don't get better income

distribution  by taking from one and giving to another.   You

get  better income distribution by empowering people to  have

the  capacity  to  share the benefits  of  development.   The

wealth  will  be  better  distributed  as  long  as  we   are

successful  and  continue  to invest  heavily  in  education,

health and programmes against extreme poverty."



The most important part of his observation, may I say, is the

last sentence: "The wealth will be better distributed as long

as  we  are  successful  and continue to  invest  heavily  in

education,  health  and programmes against extreme  poverty."

The  Prime  Minister  quoted him with approval,  but  stopped

short of that.  Is his Government adopting that advice, given

by President Zedillo of Mexico?  It does not appear from this

Budget  that  the  Government is indeed taking  that  bit  of

advice to heart - investing heavily in education, health  and

programmes against extreme poverty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking about the figures given in the May

release.  If one looks at the latest figures released by  the

Department of Statistics before the census report is out,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, you find that for the lowest 10%, the  average

household  income has dropped again to $61  per  month.   And

this, we are told, includes households where no member of the

family is earning income.  But what are we to do about  these

people who are not earning any income?  The table goes on  to

give  the average income for households with income at  $459.

That is by no stretch of imagination enough to cater for  the

needs of these families.  We have to recognise - I have  said

this  time and time again - that Singapore is one of the most

expensive cities in the world now.  It ranks very high on the

list  of expensive countries or cities.  In the face of  this

growing  cost of living, the lowest 10% are only  earning  an

average of $459 in household income per month.  I asked in my

August

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>

speech: has the Government made a study of how much a  family

of four will need?  I had tried to give my figures and I said

it  would  appear that at least $1,800 would be needed  by  a

family of four.  But I am told by several people that is very

low, very conservative.  They need a lot more than that.  But

if  you look at the latest figures released by the Department

of  Statistics,  there are 30% of our people in  our  society

having a household income of only $1,862 or less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is steadily slipping into a

country of two nations, unless steps are taken to check this.

This  was  a term coined by a British Prime Minister  at  the

beginning  of the last century.  And Singapore today  in  the

21st  century  is  beginning to slip into a  country  of  two

nations.   So  in the face of this grim reality presented  by

the statistics gathered by the Department of Statistics, what

do  we  have?   What  Budget  is  the  Minister  for  Finance

proposing - a Budget that gives to those who already have and

precious little for the have-nots.  It would appear that  the

motto  or  object is to give to those who have  and  to  deny

those who have not anything, to deny them anything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance headlines in Part II or

somewhere in his Budget speech says, "A place for everyone in

Singapore".  And he ends his Budget Statement with that  same

phrase that, "There is a place for everyone in Singapore . ."

When I saw that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I was reminded of two lines

in a Christian hymn: "The rich man in his castle and the poor

man  at the gate.  The good Lord make them all."  So the poor

man  has his place at the gate or somewhere down in the  cold

whereas  the rich man has a place in the sun.  They all  have

their  respective  places, and that has  to  be  accepted  by

society.  Do we?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would now propose to turn, knowing that I only have

half  an  hour, to what the Budget does.  I see that we  have

again  managed to exceed the estimated surplus for  the  year

2000.   We have managed to increase or put together a surplus

of at least $1 billion more than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>

what  was  estimated.  Great!  And for the year to come,  the

estimated surplus is $4.37 billion.  May I ask, as I did ask,

what comfort is this?  To the people in the 50% bottom of our

society.  If you look at the provisions in the budget, and  I

am looking only at the Main Estimates provisions provided for

operating expenditure, what does one find?  That for  Health,

we are only spending $1.5 billion of our monies on health and

that   works  out  to  a  percentage  of  5.6  of  the  total

expenditure.   For  Education,  we  are  only  spending  $4.9

billion  working out to a proportion of 22.3%  of  the  total

expenditure.   But when one looks at the Defence expenditure,

one  finds  that we are spending $7.1 billion on Defence,  $2

billion   over  Education  and  $5.5  billion   over   Health

provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this say about our priorities? That health

ranks  way  down  below  defence  of  the  country.   Is  not

providing that our people are healthy and well enough, also a

defence?   Is  it not necessary to defend our people  against

attacks  of  ill  health, sickness, just as  much  as  it  is

necessary to defend the country against attacks from overseas

or  abroad?   I  have questioned year in  and  year  out  the

expenditure on defence, and I am afraid I have not been given

a  satisfactory answer, and that view is not only mine, it is

shared by several people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Minister for Defence goes to Europe, meets the

American   Defence   Secretary   and   talks   about    great

understanding  and  cooperation  between  the  US   and   the

Government  on  defence  matters.   If  you  are  relying  on

American military might and we give them facilities, are they

going to run away if there is any attack on this country?  So

why  are  we at the same time increasing our defence spending

year by year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say a few words on health? Mr Speaker, Sir,

healthcare is crippling for our people and I have asked  time

and  time  again for a public health service in this country.

Again,  may  I  repeat that is not welfarism.   That  is,  as

President Zedillo says, investing in our people.  It  is  not

welfarism.   There was a letter in the Straits Times  of  1st

March from someone who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>

asked  why  is it that the same medicine costs much  more  in

Singapore  than  in Johor Baru and that they have  to  travel

there to get their medicine at almost a little over half  the

price.  Why is it that we cannot afford, from the monies that

we  have,  to see that those who are in need of medical  care

get  the  proper medical care at a cost that they can  afford

without having to go abroad to get medical care?  Is that not

demeaning ourselves if our citizens have to go abroad to  get

cheaper   medical   care?   Is  that   not   abdicating   our

responsibility to them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked in this House that the Ministry of Health

provides a costing, why it costs the Government to charge the

fees  that  it  now charges.  That question was misunderstood

and I was given an answer that all bills have a breakdown  of

what  the costs are for.  It is time the Government presented

a  White Paper on Health and tell the people exactly how much

it  costs  them  to  keep a patient in hospital.   I  am  not

talking  about  the first class, or the A  class  wards,  but

about the people in the C class.  Why is it necessary for the

Government  to charge $30 or more for a bed in the  C  class?

Why  is  it necessary for the Government to charge extra  for

every  other service given to the patient?  That is the  sort

of  costing one should provide so that people may understand.

But nothing is done to explain the cost to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am very disappointed that health does not rank as a

priority  with  this  Government.  I  am  aware,  as  I  said

previously,  that  there can be abuse.   I  have  proposed  a

social security card system for people earning below $2,000 a

month  so that their health is taken care of.  What is  wrong

with  that?  Why cannot the Government provide the funds  for

that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may turn to Education. Yes, Education

provision has increased.  But it is still by no means enough.

It  does not match anywhere near the Defence provision.   Why

is  it not possible, I have asked before and I ask again,  to

see that children from families earning below $2,000 can have

their children educated without any cost to them, without any

fees under whatever name it is called?  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>

should  not  have  to  pay anything to  have  their  children

educated.   That  way, we will be investing in  this  country

because we have been told again and again that our people are

the only resources here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up 30

minutes.  Dr Wang.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Singaporeans reacted very favourably to the generous tax cuts

and other social transfers provided in the FY2001 budget.  In

so far as providing tax relief is concerned, it is indeed the

most  generous  budget ever.  Enough has been said  regarding

the  plight  of  the  unemployed, the lower  income  and  the

struggling small businesses by Members preceding me and I  do

not intend to repeat their points.  However, Sir, I think  we

will  miss  the impetus of the Budget if we do not appreciate

the  two key objectives of the Government in presenting  this

Budget.   Firstly, to position Singapore for the new  era  of

growth   by  increasing  our  attractiveness  not   only   to

businesses but also to individuals as a place to live and  to

work  in.   Secondly,  to  give every individual  worker  the

wherewithal  to weather this difficult period of  transition,

to   assist   promising  business  enterprises   in   getting

established and to help businesses in dying trades shift  out

to other industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Sir, it is important to measure the

budget  against these stated objectives and to determine  how

far this budget goes towards achieving these objectives.   As

I  was  listening  to  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam,  I  was  wondering

whether    he    ever   takes   this   into    consideration.

Unfortunately, he has stepped out of the House.  So even if I

want  to address some of his points, he is not here to listen

to  them.   But, nonetheless, let me touch on two  points  he

brought  up.   Mr  Jeyaretnam mentioned  about  the  widening

income gap and he said that the Prime Minister had attributed

it to globalisation.  My question to him is whether he accept

this particular reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in the forefront of the IT

industry  and  I  can give a very good example  of  why  this

income gap widening is a universal phenomenon, and not just a

phenomenon

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>

within Singapore.  For instance, the United States government

at  the behest of their IT industry had issued a new category

of  visa called H1B Visas and it provided a quota of close to

200,000   visas  per  year.   In  other  words,   since   its

implementation till five years hence, it will be able to suck

in  close to one million IT professionals from throughout the

world.  Now, where do these people come from?  They are going

to  come in from developing countries, such as India,  China,

Eastern European countries and even a few from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, if we had adopted policies that prevent our IT

professionals  from  having better pay to  make  Singapore  a

better  place for them to stay behind, then I think we  would

even  face greater migration of our talented and young people

to  magnets, like Silicon Valley.  Sir, a widening income gap

is  a  global phenomenon, and Singapore is already in a  very

good  position  to  address  this problem,  compared  to  the

countries I have mentioned.  So the key issue is actually not

to  look  at how we can prevent the widening income gap,  but

how  to  address  the  social and economic  structure  within

Singapore as a result of the widening income gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mr Jeyaretnam did mention that, quoting from the

President of Mexico, there are several factors that we should

address  in so doing:  firstly, education;  secondly, health;

and,  thirdly, to address extreme poverty in a  society.   In

addressing  education, he has always compared its expenditure

with that for defence, that defence expenditure is pegged  at

5%,  whereas education is only 3.7%.  But however it may  be,

Mr  Jeyaretnam  does not realise that defence is  a  capital-intensive expenditure - weaponry, arms, equipment and so on - whereas education is a labour-intensive expenditure.   As  we

stand today, our education expenditure stands at 3.7% of  the

GDP,  and  the  Prime  Minister has  already  stated  in  his

National  Day Rally speech that it is his target to  increase

this expenditure to 4.5% of the GDP.  And, as Chairman of the

GPC for Education, I can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>

say that the Ministry is trying its very best to achieve this

target and, I think, if we want to spend more money, the  MOE

might have indigestion on how to properly bring value to  the

expenditures.  Nonetheless, in the budget for the year  2001,

there  is  an  increase  of close  to  $500  million  in  MOE

expenditures.  So, Mr Jeyaretnam should consider  this  point

before  he  keeps on repeating how to address the problem  of

low-income  citizens in Singapore, how do we help  the  lower

30% in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the budget surpluses in our

Budget.   For  many  years  now, I  have  observed  that  the

Ministry  has  under  estimated  revenue  and  actually  over

estimated expenditure.  I wonder whether this is a result  of

poor  modelling or the result of very conservative behaviour,

or  both.   Again, in the FY 2000 Budget, the revised  budget

surplus is $3.54 billion while the estimated surplus is $2.45

billion, a variation of close to $1.1 billion or 44.5%.   And

this   is   after   an   unplanned  $1.94  billion   one-time

compensation payment to the two telephone companies.   In  my

opinion, Sir, this compensation should be treated in the same

category  as  long-term capital transactions,  like  proceeds

from  land  sales, and should have come out from a  long-term

fund  rather than from our operating expenditures.  Thus,  if

we  take that into consideration, we should be looking  at  a

budget  surplus of close to $4.48 billion or a  variation  of

120%.  This is, of course, already a big improvement from the

FY99  budget,  when there was a variation of close  to  $9.98

billion  when the budget swung from a deficit of $5.1 billion

to  a  surplus  of  $4.88 billion.  Sir,  I  understand  that

predicting budget surplus or presenting budgets to Parliament

is  a very tricky matter because so much of this is dependent

on  the GDP growth rate.  But the projections are so far  off

that it begs the question of how good we are in forecasting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, at a time when the Singapore Stock Exchange

has  been  urging public-listed companies to  disclose  their

results on a quarterly basis and these disclosures should  be

as accurate as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>

possible, should Parliament expect less of the Government  in

this  climate?   Maybe  we do not need quarterly  reports  on

revenue  and expenditure but, perhaps, it is not too much  to

ask for a more accurate budget forecast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that some of these variations in

expenditure  and  revenue result from the  under-spending  of

development expenditure.  I also note, in the Report  of  the

Estimates Committee, Parliament Paper No. 1 of 2001, that the

Ministry has indeed imposed a reservation fee of close to  3%

to  prevent  under-spending of development  expenditures.   I

would like to find out from the Minister whether this measure

is  necessary and what is its effectiveness, and  whether  we

are   promoting  undesirable  behaviour  within  the  various

Ministries by forcing them to spend money when they could not

spend  the money.  So, are we, in fact, forcing them to incur

some waste unnecessarily?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to have budget surpluses, and I am not

against  budget  surpluses.  In  fact,  in  my  own  personal

finance,  my first principle is prudence, in other words,  to

always make sure that I have surpluses.  However, in managing

a  nation's  budget,  I  think we  should  delve  further  to

understand  the  impact of budget surpluses on  the  nation's

economy.   Like  a  large vacuum cleaner, taxation  sucks  up

liquidity  from the economy.  Mr Chay Wai Chuen  has  already

touched  upon  the  lack of growth in many  economic  sectors

while  our  national GDP grew by 9.9% in the year  2000.   He

also  pointed out that the money supply did not seem to  grow

very  much  either.  I believe he had touched on a  very  key

point.   Perhaps the Minister should tell us the  correlation

between budget surpluses and consumption by our citizens,  as

every dollar taxed is one dollar less in the pocket to spend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, if we just look at the budget surplus item

in  the  Budget Book, we see the figures of $4.88 billion  in

1999,  $3.54 billion in the year 2000, and $4.37  billion  in

the  year  2001.  But, Sir, these are actually the surpluses,

after provisions for Special Transfers.  And we must remember

that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>

the money in these various endowment funds, including the CPF

Top-Up  Scheme,  is  still removed from  circulation  in  the

economy,  as  the  principal sums remain  illiquid.   So,  to

actually determine the impact on liquidity, we should look at

the  surplus  before Special Transfers.  And the numbers  now

stand  at  $5.57 billion, $5.38 billion and $6.22 billion  in

the three years I have mentioned.  So, in three years, if  we

add  up  all  these  sums,  $17.17 billion  is  removed  from

circulation  in the local economy as, presumably,  these  are

transferred  to the Government Investment Corporation  (GIC),

which in turn invests most of these surpluses overseas.  With

these surpluses hovering close to 3% of GDP year in and  year

out,  it  begs the question whether we are locking  away  too

much  money and, thereby, starving domestic demand.  Well,  I

do  not  have  the  answer,  but  perhaps  the  Minister  can

enlighten this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of looking at it is this: is the nation

saddled  with  too  heavy  a tax burden  through  direct  and

indirect taxes?  I suspect the Minister must, in one  way  or

another, think likewise, as he is introducing structural  and

long-term  reductions in both income tax as well as corporate

tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on corporate tax, Sir, as in previous years,

the Feedback Unit had conducted a series of dialogue sessions

in  mid-January  2001  with the business  community  and  the

general  public as a preview to the Budget.   I  chaired  the

English  language sessions on business.  The participants  of

the  sessions include various chambers of commerce, small and

medium enterprises, as well as selected corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unlike the previous year, the feedback

from  the  business community is a bit lacklustre this  year.

Presumably,  people are holding their breath for the  details

of  the  Budget, after the Minister had dropped strong  hints

about   the   goodies  he  would  provide  in   the   Budget.

Furthermore,  many ideas were proposed in past  sessions  and

they  were yet to be implemented.  Nonetheless, we  can  draw

some general conclusions.  One

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>

is  that the corporate tax in Singapore is already reasonable

in  comparison with the regional countries.  So,  instead  of

blanket  tax  reductions, the business community  would  have

been  looking  towards  specific tax  incentives  to  promote

industries targeted by the Government.  In this respect, Sir,

it is interesting to note that the Minister has desisted from

so doing this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reduction of corporate tax from

25.5%  to  24.5%  is  a  surprise  since  we  had  been  told

repeatedly  that our long-term corporate tax target  is  25%.

Bearing  in  mind  that it was 26% only two  years  ago,  the

reduction  is,  indeed, rather aggressive.  The  question  is

whether   the  "tax  haven"  provisions  in  many   developed

countries  would  be triggered by this reduction.   And  this

has,  indeed, been touched upon by Mr Iswaran earlier.  So  I

would  like  to join him by asking the Minister what  is  the

impact  on  multinational companies (MNCs) in Singapore  that

would  be affected by this tax haven provision in their  home

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the persistent requests from the business

community is the suggestion to tax, at a lower rate,  smaller

companies  or  start-up companies to  help  them  find  their

footing.  We were reminded repeatedly that Britain has such a

tax  incentive for small companies.  I am very glad  to  note

that  the Minister has finally responded favourably  to  this

suggestion  and, not only that, he has gone one  step  beyond

the  expectation of the business community by  introducing  a

progressive  scale into the corporate tax structure,  thereby

benefiting all companies, large and small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on personal income tax, I would say that the

measures  taken  by the Minister in reducing personal  income

tax  rate across all brackets are very generous.  I hope that

this  is  not a one-off measure but is the start of  a  trend

towards  lower  personal income tax rates.   Hopefully,  this

will  remove whatever disincentive to the individual to exert

greater effort.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general comment received in the dialogue sessions

organised by the Feedback Unit is that the direct tax  burden

in  Singapore is actually relatively low, but there are  many

indirect taxes based on consumption.  These include GST, COE,

vehicle  import duties, ARF, property tax and so on.   As  an

end result, for the high-income earners desirous of a certain

lifestyle,  such  as  car  ownership  and  living  in  landed

properties, the total tax burden is, indeed, rather high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister has made appropriate

adjustments  to the income tax structure so as not  to  deter

strive and enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in good years with healthy budget

surpluses,  the  Minister  has been consistent  in  providing

provisions  into  the  various  endowment  funds,   such   as

ElderCare,  Medicare,  as  well  as  the  Lifelong   Learning

Endowment Fund.  This year, he has done the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like at this point to touch

upon  the  survival  of  these  endowment  funds  after   the

dissolution   of   Parliament.   Under   the   Constitutional

amendment  to  preserve  past reserves,  once  Parliament  is

dissolved, the net budget surpluses of the present Government

over its tenure would have gone into past reserves and, thus,

locked  away  from the reach of the next incoming government.

On   the   other  hand,  the  endowment  funds  survive   the

dissolution of Parliament and remain accessible to  the  next

incoming government, at least the interest generated by these

endowment  funds.   I understand that the  principal  sum  is

still  under  the stewardship of the Ministry of Finance  and

it, thus, forms part of the past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have is: would there be a proliferation

of  such  endowment funds, as additional specific  needs  are

identified by the Government?  Furthermore, since we only use

the  interest  of  these endowment funds  to  meet  operating

expenditures,  the  principal sums of these  endowment  funds

would have to be quite substantial.  Take, for instance,  the

Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.  The principal sum has been

increased to $1 billion in order to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>

generate  $40 million to fund the activities of the  lifelong

learning programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting to observe is that these

disbursements from the funds are actually off-Budget, as they

do  not show up in the line items of the Ministries involved.

At  this  point  in  time, these items are  still  relatively

small,  and do not distort the total Government expenditures.

Nonetheless, they are not pittance and should, in  principle,

be  subject to parliamentary scrutiny.  For instance, Members

of  this House do not know the amount actually paid out  from

each  endowment fund over the years even though we have close

to  $32 million and $30 million in the Medical Endowment Fund

and  the  ElderCare  Endowment Fund  respectively.   I  would

suggest  that the Minister provide a table somewhere  in  the

Budget Book showing the actual disbursements of each of these

endowment  funds.  The other question I have is  whether  the

amounts  yielded by the various endowment funds count towards

the  limit  of  not more than 50% of the NII  that  could  be

allocated towards the operating revenue of the Government.  I

hope the Minister could enlighten the House in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I sit down, I would like to make some

comments  on  NII,  one of my favourite subjects.   With  the

Constitutional amendment clearly defining part of the NII  as

operating revenue, the NII contribution, a new item, which is

the spendable part of the NII, is now moved above the line in

our  budget  presentation.  In the  previous  year,  NII  was

placed below the line.  Then, new money from tax revenue  was

spent before there was a need to tap more money from the  NII

and  therefore,  the so-called new money was segregated  from

the  old  money.  However, in this new presentation, the  new

money  and  old money got mixed together.  Like  a  glass  of

water,  once  mixed, it is one and the same.  In effect,  NII

contribution  now  forms part of the Government  revenue  and

becomes  indistinguishable from other sources of income.   Of

course,  as long as the budget surplus at the bottom line  is

still  greater than the NII contribution, we really have  not

tapped  into the NII yet.  Nonetheless, this is more  than  a

change in presentation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>

It  is a change in mindset.  So by mixing the old money  with

the  new,  the  Government seems to have  overcome  a  mental

hurdle  to  tap into the investment income generated  by  our

past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having set that aside, I have several questions

regarding  the  NII numbers shown in Table 1  of  the  Budget

Book.   The  revised NII for the year 2000 is  $1.55  billion

while  the  estimated NII contribution for  FY2001  is  $0.86

billion,  a decrease of 44.7%.  I am interested to  find  out

what accounts for the decrease.  Are we foreseeing a dramatic

decrease in NII as a result of some poor performance  of  the

Government  Investment  Corporation  which  is  tasked   with

investing  our reserves?  The Minister also did not  disclose

what percentage these numbers represent.  In other words, how

much  is $1.55 billion out of the total NII, and how much  is

$0.86 billion out of the NII for the coming year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the Constitution stipulates that the

Government should set aside at least 50% of the NII  as  part

of  the past reserves.  The Finance Minister has disclosed in

this  House that NII for year 2000 was 3.5% of our GDP.  That

would  translate to $5.94 billion in that year, using figures

in  the public domain.  Thus, by our own computation, the NII

contribution in FY2000 was only 26%.  Assuming that  the  NII

remains  at about $6 billion, then $0.86 billion in the  next

year,  FY2001,  would only come to 14%, much  less  than  the

mandatory requirements.  My question to the Minister is:   on

what basis does the Government decide how many percent of the

NII is transferred to the operating expenditure each year?  I

actually  would  like to understand the  basis  they  use  to

decide on these numbers.  I think it will help this House  to

gain   a  better  grasp  of  the  budget,  which  is  already

complicated.   To  me, as it stands, the NII contribution  in

the  Budget  Book seems like a book-keeping entry,  balancing

the  various figures so that the annual surplus does not look

so  high  and attract undue attention.  Perhaps, the Minister

can correct my impression on this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have done well as an economy. This is not by

accident but is the outcome

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

of   a   strong  partnership  between  the  people  and   the

Government.   The  Government  contributes  by   implementing

farsighted and consistent policies. The people responded with

commitments to their jobs and to the nation.  I believe  with

the   new  Budget  philosophy  outlined  by  the  Government,

Singapore will continue to prosper for many years to come.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing

me  to  join in the debate.  I shall be precise in  terms  of

what I have to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, listening to what my parliamentary colleagues have

to  say over two days, I must say that many of them have made

suggestions to improve the budget, and some of them have,  in

fact,  asked  for additional provisions for the budget.   All

this  seems  very  interesting.  I would also  join  them  to

suggest some improvements to the budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is possible because we are making a

surplus and we are able to improve the provisions.  But then,

I  was  thinking  aloud  that if we  are  not  able  to  have

additional surpluses, what should we all be talking about?  I

think that is equally important because we may not be able to

ask for all these provisions which we have articulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that this is the first time that I am hearing the

NCMP  was  not asking for welfarism because all the time,  he

has  been  asking for welfarism, but now he has  changed  his

tune.   He is not here.  I think we have to understand  basic

economics  in the sense that unless we are able  to  generate

wealth,  there is nothing to distribute, there is nothing  to

give  away.   And in many governments, they are not  able  to

generate wealth and one would be lucky if they do not ask you

to  come up with more money and empty your pockets.   And  in

many  places,  this  has happened and  we  should  thank  the

Minister  for  Finance for having maintained a very  positive

budget, a very sound economic policy over the last number  of

years  that I know of.  He has, in fact, presented very sound

budget policies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>

It is a fundamental fact that we cannot detract from.  Unless

we  are  able to generate a surplus, then all the suggestions

and what we have will come to nought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to commend the Minister for Finance,

Dr  Richard Hu, for the pro-active Budget for year  2001.   I

have heard him since I was a parliamentarian in this House in

1984  and  since then, he has presented very sound  financial

policies which have helped Singapore to weather some  of  the

turbulent economic storms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say this year's Budget is both pro-people

and  pro-business.   Many Singaporeans and  small  businesses

have benefited in big and small ways from the tax changes and

other  provisions.  I hope the Minister would have been  more

generous towards the low-income families and the elderly  who

are   and  still  will  be  most  affected  by  the  economic

restructuring   and  transition.   As  can  be   noted,   the

unemployment rate last year has increased from 1.5%  to  3.5%

and  retrenchments,  although lower by  about  1,700  in  the

second quarter of the year 2000, are still looming.  As  more

labour-intensive industries are expected to  relocate,  there

would  be more job losses and because of relocation, I expect

the  semi-skilled  and  unskilled  workers  would  likely  be

affected most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not too late for the Minister to consider further

reliefs and rebates for them.  I would urge him to look  into

a  number  of  areas  seriously.   First,  in  terms  of  the

monitoring  and control mechanism for increase of charges  of

public  services.  There have been increases  in  charges  of

public services, such as healthcare, education, transport and

utilities.  Some  of  these  increases  are  necessary.   But

because most of the public services have been restructured or

corporatised, there is a potential danger that profit motives

can become an overriding factor and this, I think, we have to

be  on  the  watch out.  We have to monitor and look  at  the

impact, particularly on the average working class families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences would be that these services can become

less affordable and accessible to the ordinary working class

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>

families.  It is now more urgent for the Ministry of  Finance

to  examine  the  cost-effectiveness of the  public  services

provided  and to monitor the overcharging for public services

delivered by restructured Government organisations.  I  would

like  to  find  out  if  there is a  monitoring  and  control

mechanism  put in place by the Ministry of Finance  or  other

related  Ministries.  Such a monitoring  and  control  system

can,  when  necessary,  apply  brakes  on  runaway  increases

imposed  by restructured Government agencies and I feel  that

it  is  time that we looked at this issue more seriously  and

that  there  should be a control board to examine  the  cost-effectiveness  of  these services.   Are  they  really  cost-effective or are they spending in areas which do not  produce

any  direct  benefit to the consumers, or are  the  consumers

themselves  getting  their dollars  worth  in  terms  of  the

services  which are provided by these corporatised Government

agencies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue of concern is inflation. With the

recent  price  increases in goods and services, is  inflation

kept under control?  Would there be an inflationary trend  in

the  near future?  All these price inflations can affect  the

purchasing  power of our working class.  I want to  find  out

from  the Minister if he would be able to let us know whether

inflation would be expected this year and by how much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on higher transfer of Utilities Save

and  rebates  for low-income families.  There  is  a  concern

about  widening income gap.  This has been addressed  through

education and skills training of young Singaporeans and older

workers.  With  better educational support and opportunities,

it  is  envisaged  that, in future, the  income  gap  can  be

mediated or reduced.  There is always an income gap  but  the

question  is  how wide that gap is going to be,  and  various

efforts  need  to be made to intervene, re-distribute  or  to

make  transfers  so that the less better off  would  have  an

equal  opportunity to be in the race and to be able  to  make

it.   However,  in the meanwhile, we should  be  a  bit  more

generous by way of transfers and rebates to help the  36%  of

HDB families living in 1-, 2- and 3-room

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>

flats.   These  families, whose incomes  have  not  increased

significantly because of economic restructuring and  economic

slowdown  in the past, have an increased burden to cope  with

their  livelihood.   The  Utilities Save  of  $350  could  be

increased to $480 as the power bill has gone up by about  70-90% since its revision.  The SC&CC charges and rental rebates

could  be revised and increased between $10-$25 for 3- to  1-room  HDB households.  For the elderly who are more concerned

for  healthcare,  a higher top-up of their  Medisave  account

with  a wider range of usage other than hospitalisation cost,

would  be  helpful.   I think there is  a  need  to  look  at

Medisave  usage and whether this usage could be applied  more

flexibly.  This would be most helpful to the elderly who  are

retired and who have less savings in their CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for CPF top-ups, we should find ways to reach out to

the  210,000  persons who did not top up for  one  reason  or

another,  and  help them to benefit from  the  share  of  our

nation's progress.  Community groups can help to provide them

with  assistance for the top-up and perhaps CPF can work with

community  organisations to see how we  could  reach  out  to

these people who have not benefitted from such a scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to talk about low-income

pensioners, because I have been discussing this issue year in

and  year  out,  and I hope that this year the  Minister  for

Finance  will  be able to hear me out this time  again.   The

increase  of  the  Singapore allowance by $10  is  really  so

meagre,  and  I  would  say that it is  paltry.   Surely  the

Government  can  be bigger-hearted by demonstrating  that  it

still  cares for the pensioners.  I know Government cares for

the  pensioners.   It can care a bit more,  by  demonstrating

that  it  can  make  the adjustment by  more  than  $10.   An

increase is deserving, Sir.  Perhaps a $30 increase would  be

a more positive gesture.  More particularly, those low-income

pensioners, who get less than the public assistance  rate  of

$200  per month, should deserve attention, as they have given

sterling  services  to our society.  They cannot  be  treated

worse  off  than  our  public  assistance  recipients.    The

Minister should redress this anomaly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter that I would like to bring up is

that I was listening to Mr Chng Hee Kok who talked about  the

Ministry  of Manpower's website, and the need for  people  to

check  on  the status or the validity of the work  permit  of

workers.   I was quite interested in this issue and I  wanted

to know whether the Ministry is keeping an update on this.  I

went  to the website and I was able to see that we can  check

not  only  on the validity of the work permits but all  other

information which are required can be obtained.  I think good

progress  has been made, because now people who are concerned

about  illegal workers will be able to do this check  through

the Ministry's website itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last issue that I would like to raise is that aside

from  the status of pensioners, there have been recent  views

to  compare  the position of MPs with board of  directors  of

private companies.  Such a comparison and viewpoint,  to  me,

is  not  only  erroneous  but misplaced.   It  is  just  like

comparing   apples  with  oranges.   Would  my  parliamentary

colleagues  want to equate their public office  with  company

directors?   Surely not.  I am sure Members do  not  want  to

demean  their MP's office by comparing themselves to a  board

of  directors.   I am sure Members agree with me that they do

not  want  their MP's office to be associated with  board  of

directors,  would they?   On their behalf, I will say  surely

not.   MPs are elected lawmakers to public office by  popular

mandate  and  in  the  case of board of directors,  they  are

appointed by a group of shareholders to private office.   MPs

are  elected  to  public office and a board of  directors  is

elected to private office.  There is a mile of difference  on

this  issue.  Sir, I am sure you will agree with me  that  we

should  not allow anyone to demean the status of MPs and  the

public  office should be held in high esteem.  And I am  sure

all  my parliamentary colleagues would agree with me on  this

viewpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the penultimate paragraph of Dr Richard Hu's

Statement describes succinctly the intent of his Budget and I

quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is a place for everyone in Singapore, and

everyone  will benefit from good governance.   It  will  take

effort  and  even a fair amount of difficulty to reach  where

we,  as  a  nation,  want to get to.  This Budget  serves  to

encourage everyone to stay united and succeed together.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certainly, Dr Hu's Budget has been well received

and  certainly  they  have seen that good  governance  indeed

means  greater  surplus, and greater surplus  is  shared  and

distributed  amongst all Singaporeans.  But,  certainly,  the

Government  must  take  much  greater  effort  to  bring  all

Singaporeans to reach where we want to achieve as  a  nation.

I will touch on this later in my speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu's Budget can really be divided into two

categories:   one,  a  group  of  tax  measures   that   will

fundamentally  restructure the approach to  the  tax  regime;

the  other is a group of measures that are one-off in  nature

that  benefit a wide cross-section of Singaporeans.   On  the

first  category, significant changes have been  made  to  the

personal  income  tax, corporate tax and the  employee  stock

option  scheme.   The changes in personal income  tax  are  a

recognition by the Government to reward individual effort and

sacrifice, and sacrifice during the economic crisis where CPF

contribution had been reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite a sterling 9.9% growth last year, many in the

private sector feel that the recovery is patchy and therefore

the  CPF  restoration should be more gradual.  On  the  other

hand, workers cannot understand why the Government is slow to

restore   the  CPF.   Therefore,  the  personal  income   tax

reduction,  the rebates and other goodies announced  in  this

Budget  are the best ways for the Government to satisfy  both

employers   and   workers.   While  the  2%  across-the-board

reduction  in income tax is most welcome, there are  concerns

in many quarters as to whether this 2% reduction is a prelude

to  an increase in GST of, say, 2% perhaps by the end of next

year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the corporate tax reduction, coupled with the tax

exemption,  will help SMEs who are marginally  profitable  to

thrive  and  to help them expand their businesses.   This  is

certainly  welcome  as, in the past, many  foreign  companies

were  indeed  the  beneficiaries  of  tax  holidays  and  tax

exemptions, and only a select few local companies benefitted.

These  changes will help many SMEs who would find that  their

effective tax rates would be significantly lower. Sir, at the

same time, it is possible that the tax exemption scheme would

lead  to  more  associate companies being  set  up  to  split

incomes.   Is  there  a concern for the  Government,  as  the

Budget Statement has been  quite silent on this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's robust 1% corporate tax reduction

comes  at  a time when many of our regional competitors  have

also  been  reducing  their tax rates  in  order  to  attract

foreign  direct  investments.  This reduction  by  Government

seems to signal a change in the Government's past thinking of

not  making Singapore a tax haven.  In this regard,  I  would

like  to ask the Finance Minister what is Singapore's  medium

term target at which the corporate tax will be set at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second group of measures, the one-off goodies

that  have  been  given  this year,  have  indeed  been  most

generous.   Many Singaporeans have expressed their  happiness

in  this  regard.   These are like a  little  bonus  to  many

households,  as it will help in some measure to reduce  their

household expenditure.  But beyond that, their happiness will

wane  soon,  as their worries of a long-term livelihood  will

take root.  Families whose household income is between $2,000-$3,000  or  less comprise many unskilled workers  working  in

MNCs  or SMEs, many shopowners, hawkers, sole proprietors  of

small service companies, small contractors and so on.  With a

stronger dollar and higher wage cost, more and more MNCs  are

going to move their manufacturing plants to other lower  cost

countries  in  the  region.  As Dr  Vasoo  has  pointed  out,

retrenchments  are becoming a regular feature for  the  lower

skilled  workers,  especially  those  working  in  the  MNCs.

Nearly half of our workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>

work  in the SMEs.  Many of them work for companies with less

than  10 people.  A lot of them work for 2-men, 3-men or  4-5

men companies.  These workers are largely unskilled and often

do  not  have  the opportunity or the urge to go  for  skills

training  or retraining.  Many such companies have  not  been

doing well in the past few years since the economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members of this House have spoken about the plight

of the HDB shop retailers.  But what about the many provision

shopkeepers in non-HDB shophouses?  What about the many  sole

proprietors  owning small service outlets?   What  about  the

hawkers,  the  market stallholders and the small contractors?

These   people's  livelihood  are  at  stake  too.   A  small

contractor told me at the meet-the-people session  this  week

that the construction industry is indeed in a bad shape.   He

said  that  last week he went for a show around for  a  small

contract  tender  and  found that there  were  more  than  40

contractors who had turned up just for a contract that is not

worth  more  than $40,000-$50,000, and there  were  many  big

players  there as well.  He said that this is  indeed  a  bad

sign for the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu had said that the construction industry will turn

around this year, but many in the industry that members of my

GPC  spoke  to are sceptical of a turn around, and  are  very

concerned   that  the  Ministry  of  National   Development's

expenditure has been reduced and this is going to  hurt  them

even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plight of our small enterprises is indeed very

worrying.   On  its  part, the Government has  done  well  to

allocate significant amounts of money for skills training and

lifelong learning.  The Ministry of Manpower has done well to

unveil a comprehensive Manpower 21 Vision.  Many workers have

been  reached  through  these schemes.   Many  more  workers,

especially  vulnerable  workers,  need  to  be  reached   and

retrained  and  reskilled  for  them  to  remain  employable.

Often,  the  problem is that the most vulnerable workers  are

often  the last ones to be reached and, more often,  are  the

ones who refuse to be trained.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have more than 500,000 Singaporean workers in

our  workforce  who  do not have a secondary  education.   Of

these,  approximately 180,000-200,000 do not have  a  primary

education  and  they  are  largely aged  between  30-49,  and

therefore they will have to make a living for themselves  and

their families for many more years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Hu has said, it will take effort and even a fair

amount  of difficulty to reach that we, as a nation, want  to

get  to.   The Government must go beyond providing money  for

training  and  giving one-off Budget goodies.  It  must  have

greater  compassion and greater commitment to  level  up  the

lower  strata of our society.  Like the call by Mrs Lim  Hwee

Hua, it must do much more on public education on what we want

to  achieve as a nation.  It must rally our citizens to  help

them  cope  with the impending changes of our economy.   Only

then  can  we stay united as one nation and face the external

challenges confronting us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the 2001 Budget is a very generous  one.   The

headline on the Lianhe Wanbao of 24th February mentioned that

the  Government  was giving away 12 angpows:  six  pro-people

angpows, three pro-business angpows and three others, in  the

form of Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, Eldercare Fund  and

Medifund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt this Budget is generous, but when I spoke to my

constituents, they have still some comments to  make,  and  I

would  like  to feed back these comments to the Minister  for

Finance for his consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with the Utilities Save scheme, the

three-tier family and the CPF Top-up Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utilities Save scheme is very popular among the

people,  but  there is a general feeling  that  this  is  not

extensive  enough  to cover everybody.   The  Utilities  Save

rebates  are  only confined to the 1- to 5-room families  and

exclude those living

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>

in  executive  flats,  private apartments,  condominiums  and

landed property.  Because of the increase in utilities rates,

people  have  to pay more for water and electricity.   So  to

lighten  the burden of the people, rebates are given to  some

citizens.   To  some  extent,  this  would  indeed  help  the

residents in the HDB housing estates.  But those residing  in

private   property  are  excluded  from  this  scheme.    The

Government  may  think that those living in private  property

would benefit from the tax rebates or tax cuts.  But not  all

residents   in  private  estates  are  high-income   earners.

Similarly,  not  all  people living  in  the  public  housing

estates  are  low-income earners.  Our  utilities  are  on  a

standard  rate.  Irrespective of private or HDB estates,  the

electricity  and water tariffs are the same.  Therefore,  you

cannot  distinguish people by the type of property they  live

in.    The  Government should apply the principle  of  "equal

misery  and  equal  prosperity", so that  all  families  will

proportionately enjoy some utilities rebates.  The amount  of

rebates may not be large, but at least all the residents  can

get  some  benefit and be appreciative to the Government  for

sharing  the  budget surplus with them.  I  believe  the  end

benefit to the Government will far surpass the cost incurred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people first heard about the rebates on

utilities, they were all smiles.   But when they received the

utilities bill later on, the smiles disappeared, because  all

the utilities rates were increased.  Recently, when I visited

my  constituents, I came across a young couple living in a 4-room  flat.  They told me that they used to pay     only  $50

to  $60 per month for utilities but now it has been increased

to about $80 or $90 -- an increase of about 40%.  I explained

to  them that after July, a $30 rebate will be given  to  the

family  for  a  period of 10 months and it will  be  able  to

offset the increases.   They were so happy about it and  they

thanked  the  Government for helping to reduce their  burden.

But  the  family  living opposite was not so fortunate.   The

residents told me that they used to pay between $100 and $150

per  month  in utilities bill.  Now it has jumped  to  around

$220,  and  the last bill was a hefty $311.  For a family  of

three to pay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>

more than  $300 for utilities seems to be on the high side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be something wrong with the new

software  used by Power Supply last year.  I would appeal  to

the  Government  to make a thorough study into the matter and

compensate  the  consumers for all the  amounts  overcharged.

The  problem should be tackled at its roots and not  just  on

the  surface.   Otherwise, all these  rebates  given  by  the

Government  to  the residents will be nothing more  than  the

Tokuhon  (Japanese medical plaster) applied on  the  skin  to

provide  temporary relief to the trauma within.  It will  not

eradicate the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will deal with the 3-tier family bonus. In this

Budget,  there  are  different packages for  the  benefit  of

different  categories of people, much to the delight  of  the

people.   Taxpayers should be happy with the 10% tax  rebate.

However,  there  seems to be no goodies for  those  who  have

responded  to  the  Government's  appeal  to  forming  3-tier

families.  With our population ageing more rapidly,  quite  a

lot  of problems have arisen. These problems must be resolved

early.   Many  young  Singaporeans  have  responded  to   the

Government's call to set up 3-tier family so that the old and

the  young  could  be looked after.  On the other  hand,  the

Government must give some clear incentives to reward them.  I

would  suggest  the Government consider giving the  following

incentives to encourage the formation of 3-tier families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying, "An elder in a family is like

a treasure at home".  If the young people can live with their

parents, the old folks can look after their children, and the

young  couple  can then be encouraged to have  more  children

without  having to worry that there would be nobody  to  look

after their children.  In the meantime, the old folks can  be

cared   for  and  looked  after  by  their  family   members.

Moreover,  the  grandparents can  inculcate  the  traditional

moral values in the young children so that they would grow up

to become useful citizens of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3-tier family will also contribute to the

enhancement of family and social

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>

cohesion,  as  it  is  often said  that  the  family  is  the

foundation  of society. Perhaps, the Government can  consider

giving  a  once-off  $1,000 3-tier family bonus to the  young

couples.   I  hope the Government can consider this  proposal

seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the CPF Top-up Scheme. The Minister for Manpower,

Dr  Lee Boon Yang, told us that about 190,000 people did  not

make  contribution of $100 each into their CPF  accounts  and

hence did not qualify for the top-ups of $500 to $1,700  into

their accounts.  Among the 190,000 people, about 23% are aged

65  and  above, and 33% live in 1 to 3 room flats.   I  would

like to urge MOM to conduct a thorough investigation into the

matter.   Like Dr Vasoo, I would also be grateful if the  CPF

Board could provide me with the following information:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Of the 190,000 people, how many are singles with no

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) How many are jobless and have no income at all;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) How many are physically handicapped, such as mentally

retarded, senile, dementia, non-ambulant; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) How many are living in old folks' homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that these people could also enjoy the fruits

of  our  economic  success,  the Government  should  consider

depositing the top-ups of $500 to $1,700 into the accounts of

these  people  who  have,  in the past,  contributed  to  the

country,  particularly those who live  in  1-room  to  3-room

flats, and then later, at the time of withdrawal, deduct  the

basic $100 as a pre-qualification for the top-up at the  next

top-up scheme.  This is killing two birds with one stone.   I

hope  the  Minister  for Finance can help  these  people  who

really need our help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, among the 190,000 people, there may be

some who are quite financially well-off  and do not need  the

CPF top-up.  Can we ask these people to indicate whether they

could donate the top-up amounts, which they would have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>

been entitled to, to the grassroots activities fund or some

charity funds.  If among the 190,000 people, 10% of the

people are willing to donate their CPF top-up money, then we

would have $10 million for our grassroots activities fund or

charity fund.  This will be much better than the $8.3 million

as proposed by Mr Leong Horn Kee  for the grassroots

activities fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can consider my proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the Minister introduced a measured Budget

using  measured  fiscal responses to address  the  millennium

challenges.  We have just emerged from a recession  the  year

before and there was a need to remain circumspect and yet  be

bold  enough to seize the new opportunities in our knowledge-based  economy.  Hence, in last year's budget, the withdrawal

of  each rebate appeared to be followed by a concomitant  new

tax initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Christmas seems to have come early. With the

advent of greater uncertainty over the economic situation for

the  rest of the year, many are pleasantly surprised  by  the

Minister's  generosity.  It is therefore not surprising  that

many  people  are lauding this year's Budget as an  "Election

Year  Budget"  because  it  is  very  pro-business  and  pro-individual.  Political overtones aside, I think  that  it  is

more  appropriate to term this year's Budget as a  "Pay  Back

Budget" in view of the concessions that Singaporeans have  to

bear with during the recession period.

<br><br><i>A Different Scenario</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like the Minister to consider other

possibilities  that  require an even bolder  fiscal  approach

this  year.   Sir,  what if the economy  becomes  less  rosy,

thereby requiring a stronger fiscal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>

response?    What  other  tax  initiatives   can   help   our

regionalisation drive?  What other tax measures can encourage

our  promising local enterprises to think bigger, enter  into

new  markets and invest more boldly?  What other  tax  boosts

can  we  give  to our SMEs to ride over the current  economic

uncertainty?   How  else  can we help  individuals  face  the

economic uncertainties ahead?  We ought to visit these issues

and attempt to answer these questions.

<br><br><i>Small and medium-sized Enterprises</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on our SMEs. Many of them have not overcome

the  effects of last year's recession.  Before they can  come

out  of  the woods, they are already greeted by the  news  of

possibly  another slowdown.  I am glad that the Minister  has

considered  their plight in this year's Budget.   I  am  glad

that  PSB  is  helping  to  raise the  performance  of  local

enterprises,  and I look earnestly forward to  learning  more

regarding Retail 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that we adopt further fiscal measures to

help our SMEs.  If we want to grow our local SMEs into world-class  corporations,  we need to create  a  conducive  fiscal

environment  to  nurture them.  Instead of a  flat  corporate

income tax rates for all companies and partial exemption  for

income   of  up  to  a  certain  level,  we  might   consider

implementing a lower rate of income tax for local SMEs.   The

Budget's measure of introducing a tiered rate system for  the

first  $100,000 of chargeable income is a step in  the  right

direction.   However, this can be improved upon.   SMEs  that

are  wholly owned by Singaporeans and whose turnover or total

assets do not exceed a certain amount could be subject  to  a

lower  rate  of  tax, say, 16% on the first  half  a  million

dollars  worth  of  income which is ploughed  back  into  the

business,  and not distributed as dividends.  Low rate  would

act  as  an  incentive to allow the SMEs to  build  up  their

reserves  to  better weather economic downturn.  Furthermore,

reduction  of tax rates would only be of benefit to companies

which make profits.  But what if they make losses?  As a  tax

rule for SMEs,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>

we should allow SMEs to use losses incurred during a downturn

against  income earned in, say, of the preceding  two  years.

If  taxes  were paid in the preceding two years,  such  taxes

could be refunded to the company.  This ability to carry back

losses  would generally benefit SMEs facing cashflow  problem

and  financial difficulties now.   The current tax  rules  on

the carrying forward of losses benefit companies that survive

a  recession.   But  the ability to carry back  losses  would

assist  companies  to  ride  out rough  patches  where  their

fundamental business proposition is sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to this, I would like to also raise the issue of

corporate  group  relief  for  losses.   Businesses  may   be

organised  in  separate companies for various reasons.   This

corporate  separation,  while real in  the  legal  sense,  is

artificial   in   the  business  sense   from   the   owner's

perspective.  But our tax rules do not permit losses  in  one

company to be offset against profits in another company, even

if  one person owns both.  If the two businesses were run out

of  the  same  company, the losses would implicitly  be  used

against  the  profits resulting in less tax.  In  effect,  by

disallowing inter-corporate losses, the effective tax rate is

higher  than  24.5% for the above companies  taken  together.

This  should not be the case.  We should seriously look  into

the concept of group loss relief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where local companies are seeking to expand into other

jurisdictions  that permit group relief, our companies  would

be  at  a  disadvantage compared to companies that  can  take

advantage of group relief.  In fact, the effective  tax  rate

on  such  companies  can actually be lower  than  Singapore's

statutory rates, notwithstanding that our rate is amongst the

lowest of all developed countries.

<br><br><i>Globalisation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now consider the tax measures to boost our

regionalisation drive.  Sir, we should provide incentives  to

local  companies to go regional by helping them to  build  up

their  reserves.   But the current tax  rules  do  not  allow

funding cost to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>

deducted if investments do not produce income.  This acts  as

a  disincentive  to  local companies  from  seeking  regional

expansion   opportunities.   They  should   be   allowed   to

accumulate  expenses in periods when no income is earned  and

deduct  expenses  when  their investments  start  to  produce

income.  Such expenses can be restricted to cost incurred  in

regional  expansion  activities, such as  funding  and  legal

costs.  Such an incentive would merely be an extension of the

Inland   Revenue's  current  liberal  treatment  of  expenses

incurred  which  have generated foreign  income.   Presently,

expenses incurred which generate foreign income that are  not

repatriated can be accumulated and carried forward to be used

to offset such foreign income when repatriated in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also help successful local enterprises to

reinvest  their  overseas profit.  Currently,  foreign  taxes

paid   by  second  or  third-tier  foreign  company  is   not

recognised  in  Singapore  when  the  local  parent   company

receives dividends from its overseas subsidiaries through  an

offshore intermediate holding company.  Since credit  is  not

given for such foreign taxes suffered at the second and third-tier levels, the overseas income brought back to Singapore is

effectively  taxed  twice,  by the  foreign  country  and  by

Singapore.   This acts as a disincentive to local enterprises

from  reinvesting in Singapore even if the best opportunities

are  available  at  home.  Instead,  we  should  allow  local

companies  to look through intermediate holding companies  in

foreign countries and receive credit for foreign taxes paid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to issues affecting individuals.

<br><br><i>Speculative tax on capital gains on properties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tax on speculative gains on sale of real

estates  was introduced at a time when the Government  deemed

it  necessary to prevent a speculative bubble from forming in

Singapore's property market.  Aside from the common  argument

that  the  current market does not require such  measures,  I

would also like to raise a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>

more  fundamental  albeit technical issue.   Singapore's  tax

system  does  not  tax  capital  gains,  only  income.    The

imposition  of  tax on the gain, that is in all  respect  the

capital  gain, merely because the subject matter of the  gain

is  real property, would appear to be contrary to Singapore's

fundamental  tax policy.  For this reason, I would  encourage

the  Government to reconsider the rationale for the  property

speculation tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore's population ageing, an issue is whether

retiring persons would have enough to see them through  their

retirement  years, I would suggest that retirement gratuities

not  be  taxed.   The  taxation of  such  amounts  inherently

imposes  a  larger  than usual tax burden as  the  amount  is

typically  received  in  one lump  sum  at  the  end  of  the

individual's career.  Therefore, the individual may be pushed

into  a  higher tax bracket than usual due to the receipt  of

such  an amount, notwithstanding that such amount is intended

to provide for his future years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that retirement gratuities

were  exempt  from  tax before 1st January  1993.   But  with

concerns that CPF savings may not be adequate for retirees in

today's  environment, the reinstatement of such an  exemption

may  be opportune.  I would like to take this opportunity  to

applaud  the  Government's introduction of  the  CSOP  scheme

which  I believe will benefit employees and employers  alike.

However, I also like to draw attention to the fact that  free

share awards should also be given the same treatment provided

similar  parameters are met.  For instance,  there  does  not

appear to be any reason why share awards that are granted  to

more  than 50% of a company's employees should not be covered

by the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of stock options, I would however like to

draw  attention to the manner in which stock options obtained

by  expatriate  employees before they came to Singapore,  but

which are exercised while they are employed in Singapore, are

taxed.   The  exercise of such stock options  is  subject  to

Singapore's tax notwithstanding that they were granted and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>

earned  during  their  expatriate years  of  service  outside

Singapore.    If Singapore is to attract top foreign  talent,

we  need to relook at this issue to ensure that there are  no

undue  issues  that  may  act  as  a  disincentive  to   such

individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would also like to very briefly comment

on  a  few  other  tax issues, some of which  I  have  raised

previously.   The first is the need to review  the  threshold

parameters for estate duty, in particular the use of $600,000

as  the  threshold for non-property exemption is  inadequate.

The $600,000 is inclusive of CPF which is nowadays easier  to

achieve.   The  current exemption scheme  appears  to  favour

those with significant property ownership in their investment

portfolio.    We  should  revise  upwards  the   non-property

exemption  allowed, or even abolish estate duty on  all  non-property  assets and allow for estate duty to be levied  only

on real property passing in excess of the present $9 million.

This would encourage Singaporeans to adopt a wider investment

strategy  rather than to be overly tied down and  exposed  in

the property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern deals with the personal reliefs

generally.  Such reliefs do not appear to have kept  up  with

the  time.   For instance, the personal income  threshold  of

$2,000  for  the wife relief does not appear realistic  given

the  financial pattern of today's family.  I suggest we  look

closely  at  the  current programme of  personal  reliefs  to

determine  where  improvements can  be  made.   One  area  of

concern among the growing number of Singaporeans is the  cost

of  medical  treatment for the ageing parents.  To  encourage

three  generation  households and  to  ensure  that  retirees

continue  to  enjoy a certain quality of life, medical  costs

incurred  for  geriatric  treatment  and  for  other  serious

illnesses  should  be given relief up to a  certain  monetary

capping.   Perhaps, the personal tax system can  be  used  to

help alleviate some of these concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to propose a topping up of the

student's  Edusave  account to encourage  PC  ownership.   We

should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>

encourage  our students to be more IT-savvy.  But  not  every

student can afford a PC.  While there are PCs in the schools,

the  IT exposure of students without PCs at home is very much

restricted.  For this purpose, we should consider topping  up

the  student's Edusave account to subsidise or  pay  for  the

purchase  of  a PC or IT-related accessory or software.   The

top-up  can be renewed five years later to keep up  with  the

changes in computer technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-Budget wish-list that I have just described

should not taint the bold and positive aspects of the Budget,

as  announced by the Minister.  But who knows Santa Claus may

still be accepting late orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I thank you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  for allowing me to join in the debate  today.

Whilst  I  agree with Members of this House who  have  spoken

earlier  that the Budget for this year is a generous  one,  I

feel  that  it  has inadequately addressed  our  concerns  in

preparing for the future needs of a fast-ageing population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is indeed facing a fast-ageing population

with  the "older dependency ratio" decreasing from 10 now  to

over  30  by 2030.  This is worrying.  But even more worrying

and  dramatic will be the increasing number of the  very  old

(those  aged 75 and above).  This group represents the  frail

elderly  with physical, mental and social limitations.   This

is  the  group that is most likely to depend on and  tax  our

health  and social services.  There will be an almost  three-fold  increase  of this group from just over  90,000  now  to

about 250,000 by 2030, when it will comprise about 7% of  our

total  population.   Sir, we need good  planning  and  astute

allocation of immediate resources for a smooth transition  to

the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older people are more likely to have disabilities; the

challenge  is to attain a position where we can provide  care

that  allows  them  to  live independently  for  as  long  as

possible  and,  preferably, in their  own  homes  with  their

families.  In order to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>

achieve  this,  I  would  like to suggest  that,  henceforth,

certain incentive grants be set aside for relevant Ministries

to  plan  and act on innovative ideas that will save us  from

challenging burdens later on.  Incentives should be given for

proactive  measures that can improve the care  of  the  older

generation in future.  In view of the daunting task of caring

for  so  many older people in the not too distant future,  we

have  to  start  working on this potential problem  now.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, our priority is to have in place a system  that

strengthens  our  foundation  and  taps  and  maximises   our

voluntary and private sectors.  I would like the Minister for

Finance  to  consider the importance in laying the foundation

and  the  infrastructure immediately.  Additionally, I  would

like  the  different  Ministries, such  as  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development and Sports (MCDS), Ministry of  Health

(MOH),  Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry  of  National

Development (MND) to appropriate proactive measures  to  make

some significant impact over this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For MCDS, I would like to suggest that since our primary

objective  in  the care of the elderly is to enable  them  to

maintain  independent  lives in the community  and  in  their

homes  for as long as possible, maintaining the social status

quo  in those elderly who are well and those elderly who  are

not   totally  dependent,  should  be  one  of  its   primary

objectives.  Thus, by postponing or retarding the  functional

deterioration  in  these older persons, MCDS  can  help  them

reduce  avoidable hospital admissions and minimize  premature

dependence on long-term care in institutional settings.  Sir,

the  aim  must  be to help the older persons  do  things  for

themselves;  not do things for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to happen, there must be effective support from

primary healthcare, community healthcare, social services and

modified  housing.  There must be ample community  volunteers

and  home help for families to care for the dependent elderly

in  their  homes.  As a matter of urgency, MCDS  should  have

homecare-cum-domiciliary services, daycare and rehabilitation

services, occupational therapy services

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>

with  equipment  and  adaptations  at  homes  developed   and

established.  Easy access to these community care facilities,

vis-a-vis centres of activity, centres for rehabilitation and

daycare  centres,  is  essential.  There  must  be  unstinted

availability  of support and advice.  MCDS should  facilitate

this  area  by  involving community bodies such as  voluntary

welfare  organisations, grassroots organisations,  and  other

groups  in  the  private  sector.   Such  facilitation   will

translate  into  lower costs and convenience  for  a  happier

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, volunteer opportunities should be made available

and  seniors  should  be  made aware that  their  skills  are

valued.  We have a large and increasing pool of volunteers to

tap  from among the older Singaporeans.  Training them to  be

competent in the different areas of our needs will give  them

recognition and worth.  For example, as we are lacking in the

community services to support and care for the frail and semi-dependent  in  the society, we may perhaps  equip  and  train

these  volunteers to provide them.  Perhaps,  a  well-managed

register  of  volunteers  and matching  services  can  ensure

successful  implementation  of  this  type  of  volunteerism.

Volunteers should be recognised for their work, and it  would

be  good if they can get some privileged and subsidised  care

when, in turn, they themselves need community services.  They

should  be  reimbursed  transportation  and  minor  costs  of

incidentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS should also look into another important area.

There  is  a  need  to  facilitate adaptations,  either  with

structural  modifications to the homes, or with provision  of

appropriate equipment to ease the inadequacies of  the  frail

or semi-dependent elderly.  This will enable them to continue

living in their own homes for as long as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we figure out how to best prepare

for our aging population, half the battle would have been won

if  we  could influence Singaporeans with the correct mindset

concerning  older persons and retirement.  A  mindset  change

needs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>

time and a lot of effort to nurture, and I would like MCDS to

prioritise  it and enable us to achieve the desired  outcome.

Sir,  older  persons  should be regarded as  useful  citizens

whose wisdom, skills and talents are valuable resources  that

must  be  tapped for as long as possible to benefit  society.

The  mindset on retirement should be: "A time to begin a  new

chapter  in  life by being active and involved; starting  new

activities and setting new goals."  Indeed, Sir, older people

can  approach aging and retirement in new and exciting  ways,

and MCDS can do much to help them realise such a goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new survey of 803 American men and women aged 50 to 75

has  found that 40% of them are working or plan to work after

they  retire, while an equal percentage plans to do volunteer

work.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Ministry  of  Manpower  should

encourage  and facilitate this type of attitudes by providing

avenues  for  Singaporeans  to  remain  at  work  and  to  do

volunteer work.  Matching the seniors to further training  or

job placements should also be enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older people should be given training opportunities

irrespective of age.  This will enable them to receive skills

upgrading  and help them stay relevant in the economy.   Sir,

people are healthier and are living longer.  A skilled labour

force  of  "seniors"  can, therefore, be  a  valuable  asset.

Companies  wishing  to  retain their  older  workers  through

workplace re-engineering should be encouraged and facilitated

in  this  respect.  As we plan ahead, we need  to  turn  full

circle, and adopt policies and programmes, provide retraining

opportunities, offer flexible work hours and encourage  those

who  want  to stay on the job to do so.  Sir, it  is  prudent

that MOM is continuing to review the retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many older people can stay longer in the community with

structural adaptations made to their own homes.  The Ministry

of  National  Development should facilitate  this  by  having

modifications done to older flats, occupied mainly  by  older

folk,  in  similar fashion to those modified for some  rental

HDB blocks.  Mr Speaker, Sir, having

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>

seen  those  modified rental HDB homes, we know what  can  be

done. The more elderly-friendly features inside the flats and

the  access or surrounding areas are, indeed, a boon  to  the

older persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND should also facilitate owners of HDB flats in the

existing and new HDB flats to modify their homes, if they  so

wish.   Furthermore,  MND should also have  sheltered  homes,

studio apartments and retirement villages built in increasing

numbers  to  meet increasing demand through  time.   Sir,  it

would  be  good  if  MND has schemes in  place  to  encourage

private organisations to build such homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has said that,

as  our  population ages, the healthcare costs for the  older

generation of our people will rapidly increase.  This is  the

reason  why  allowances  were  made  to  meet  the  projected

healthcare costs in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge now is to ensure that we can continue to

spend  wisely and efficiently in the future.  The current  8%

of   older   persons  account  for  20%  of  all   outpatient

attendances and 18% of all hospital admissions.   Sir,  going

forward  along such a trend, we will be putting a  tremendous

burden upon our healthcare resources.  We must help the older

people  maintain  independent lives in the community  for  as

long  as possible, being aided predominantly by the community

healthcare  services.   As  people get  older,  the  emphasis

should shift from the extension of life to the improvement of

health-related quality of life.  In other words, the emphasis

should be on "adding life to years and not years to life".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like each one of us here

present to consider the scenario of having to care for one of

our  very own elderly parents who should fall ill.   This  is

not  an  unlikely  scenario as many of  us  do  have  elderly

parents  and  one  in four in our population  will  face  the

situation  in the not-too-distant future.  It is a matter  of

time when we would have to meet that call.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If faced with that situation now, you may be wondering

where  to look for help.  Must you seek specialist help  and,

if so,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>

which  and  how many specialists will you need to  send  your

parent  for  proper diagnosis and treatment of the  different

illnesses, which older people can have?  How are you going to

provide  the  care  if  he or she is semi-dependent  and  you

needed to be at work?  Do you have the know-how to care for a

totally  dependent elderly?  If he or she insists on  staying

at  home and rejects the idea of care in a nursing home,  how

do  you  then  cope with all the daily medical  requirements?

Sir,  what I am getting at is to illustrate our need to  have

in  place a healthcare system that provides a one-stop centre

which  you  can  call  upon  to  handle  such  a  distressing

scenario.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should plan a system that promotes independence

by   supporting  people  to  achieve  their  potential,   and

strengthen  families  by supporting family  responsibilities.

We  must  have  the  personnel, in ample numbers,  to  assist

people with appropriate support to assess medical conditions,

advise  nursing care, provide home-help courses, and  suggest

necessary  home  adaptations  and  so  on.   This   means   a

standardised  and holistic management of the  needs  of  each

family, and an assurance of appropriate care that spares them

lots of worry, time and effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have this, we have to start training more medical

personnel   in   various   fields.    We   must   have   more

geriatricians, physiotherapists, community nurses,  home-care

nurses  and  home-care  helpers.  We need  "new  courses"  to

impart  ideas  and experiences of experts in other  countries

that  have gone through this predicament long before us.   We

can   certainly  benefit  by  looking  at  others  in   their

management  of workable systems.  A centre or bureau  with  a

dedicated  team may be set up for this.  It will  augur  well

for  us if the Ministry of Health looks into this immediately

and the Ministry of Finance funds for this generously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the task in the ensuing years may seem

insurmountable  due to foreseeable increased demands  on  our

healthcare  system as a result of greater  needs  of  elderly

folk,  expectations of affluent citizens, and  costs  of  new

medical advances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>

Whilst we cannot arrest the rising demands and costs, we  can

challenge ourselves to find and implement the ways to  lessen

the  burden.   Promoting  "preventive  care"  to  maintain  a

healthy population for as long as possible will be the  basic

tenets  of  our endeavour.  The target is to help  the  older

people  to  live as independently as possible,  deliver  good

medical care at affordable costs, ensure appropriate  use  of

medical  resources without wastage, emphasise self-help,  and

stress  responsibility for one's own good  health.   Spending

now  to  meet this challenge will save us millions of dollars

in  the  future.   I  am glad that the Minister  for  Finance

recognises  this  and  has started to address  the  issue  by

providing  substantially more funds for healthcare.   I  hope

the  funds  will be used to establish the foundations  for  a

sound "Healthcare 21".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish to reiterate that it requires

the  concerted  effort, through close networking  and  smooth

implementation of policies by various Ministries, that  would

ensure us our success in this issue.  Therefore, I would urge

the  relevant  Ministries to garner all their  resources  and

work as one entity for the better of our aging nation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I welcome this generous Budget as presented  by

Minister Hu, and as mentioned in a local newspaper,  The  New

Paper,  it  would certainly bring happiness  to  the  people.

There  is  much  to  be  said about  the  Budget  this  year.

However,  I  would  mention only three issues.   Firstly,  on

alcohol.   I  welcome the measures taken by the Minister  for

Finance,  in increasing the tax on tobacco by $30 a kilogram,

but  it  is a wonder how the tax on alcohol was not increased

in  tandem.   Although I do not question the tax increase,  I

would  like  to  say about the consequences of alcohol  which

bring about problems to the family and our youths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sympathise with Mr Tan Boon Hui and Miss Ng Shen

Ching who died in a road accident when they were preparing to

set up a family.  It was reported in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>

Straits Times on 27th February 2001.  Both of them died  when

their motorcycles went out of control on the PIE on 13th  May

last  year.  Late last month, the Coroner's Court found  that

the  blood  and  urine  sample of Mr Tan contained  excessive

amounts of alcohol.  We also read early last month about a 7-Eleven  branch in Hastings Road in Little India which stopped

selling  alcohol  because there were  a  lot  of  fights  and

clashes by the customers who purchased alcohol there and from

several  other shops.  Please refer to the New Paper  on  3rd

February  2001.  In fact, according to one of  the  residents

there,  they  would  drink  until they  were  drunk  and  got

themselves  into scuffles.  Another resident also  said  that

they  are not prepared to allow their children to go  out  on

late nights in the weekend, for fear of being involved in the

scuffle.   We were also told that one in every four  husbands

who is involved in wife battering cases is an alcoholic. This

is reported in the New Paper on 20th February 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one expert, Dr Joseph Ozawa, Director of

Physiological Services for the Criminal, Family and  Juvenile

Justice  Centre, said that problems of the family are  mainly

caused  by  the  husbands who are alcoholics  and  not  those

husbands who are drug addicts.  He said that this is  because

it is easier to purchase alcohol than drugs.  While I welcome

the  Subordinates Courts' Family Justice Centre to  launch  a

programme  to  assist the heads of family who are  alcoholics

next  month in April, I think other measures should be  taken

and  one of them is to increase the duty for alcohol as  much

as  it  can  so  that it is no longer cheap to purchase.   In

fact,  I  am  the  only one who asked it to be  increased  as

compared to the others who did not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the Government's measure to top up $500

million  into the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund this  year

to  reach  $1  billion, and more than  $30  million  for  the

development of Manpower Development Assistance Scheme  so  as

to equip our workers with the necessary skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lifelong learning will be a new lifestyle in today's

living, $1 billion may not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>

be  enough.  The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  should  be

one-third  of the sum allocated to the Ministry of Education,

which  is  $6.3 billion.  A new way is for the Government  to

assist   those   workers  who  do  not  have   post-secondary

education,  as this group will be left behind by the  changes

in  our  economy.  This group, if not helped, will break  our

social fabric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khalid Abdullah, who is of Chinese Indian-Pakistani

descent, has written about his surprise when a child  who  is

not more than 10 years old told him and his two children that

he  could not play at a playground because "you are an Indian

and  you  smell".  This is reported in the Straits  Times  on

19th February 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month earlier, a New Paper journalist, Melvin Singh,

also  raised the same issue regarding the smell  in  the  New

Paper of 15th January 2001.  He wrote about two of his wife's

nephews  who are of Chinese descent and aged 3 and  5  years.

He  said, "Both had hugged me in the same way they have  done

to their other uncles.  But one day, one of them told me that

my body smells because I have dark skin."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that worries me because of race

consciousness.  If this is not contained, it will bring about

adverse effect in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, the generous Budget which has

allowed  the Government to share their successes with  others

is  a  sign of the Government appreciating the effort of  the

people  who are together with the Government during difficult

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget Statement which has been tabled by

the Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I join my

colleagues  in thanking the Minister for Finance for  a  very

generous  Budget this year.  It is a Budget aimed  at  making

our  companies  more competitive and, at the same  time,  put

more  disposable income in the pockets of the people.  I only

have a few comments to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Singapore's economic performance was beyond

the expectations of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>

many,  growing  by  9.9%.  According to  economic  statistics

disclosed  recently, most sectors did better  than  in  1999,

except for the construction sector.  Feedback from small  and

medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) however seem to suggest  that

1999  was  still very tough for many of them, especially  for

those  who  have ventured into the region at the Government's

urging  and  are  still  not  profitable.   I  do  not   have

statistics  to  support this assertion  as  the  feedback  is

mainly  anecdotal.   Many  such  SMEs  feel  that  the   cost

restorations,  such  as  in  the  employers'  share  of   CPF

payments,  have  come a little bit too fast.  This  situation

was  exacerbated by the significant fall in asset  values  of

shares and properties, making many feel even poorer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for this year is slower growth. This

portends  an  even  worse  time  for  the  SMEs.   Many  such

companies  offer  supporting  services  or  products  to  the

Government, the GLCs, MNCs and other large corporations based

in  Singapore.  Many have ventured into the region  and  some

even  further afield to look for new markets.  Many have been

hurt  by the untimely downturn in the region.  Some are  even

in need of recapitalisation to survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the Government's reduction in corporate

tax  rate by 1% to 24.5% is welcome.  Of more direct  benefit

to  the SMEs is the new tax exemption scheme that will exempt

three-quarters  of  up to the first $10,000  of  a  company's

chargeable  income, and one-half of up to  the  next  $90,000

from  corporate  tax.  It will help the SMEs  reinvest  their

initial profits into the business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Finance to consider

again  the  possibility of allowing companies to group  their

profits  or losses for tax purposes.  Today, group  companies

need  not be large conglomerates that are usually profitable.

Many  SMEs today start new companies for new markets or  form

joint   ventures  with  local  partners  overseas   for   new

businesses.  Property companies are required by law to have a

new entity for each project.  The new projects are usually

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>

not  always profitable in the initial years.  In fact,  those

that  are  not doing well are usually wound up  after  a  few

years  as  the  original founders cut  their  losses.   Their

cumulative tax losses cannot be utilised unless the companies

are  bought  over  by some other companies.   The  Government

should  allow such group companies to offset profits  of  one

company  with losses from another as long as these  companies

are  subsidiaries  of the group. This will lighten  the  cash

flow  problems  of  many  companies  and  encourage  them  to

continue to invest in new markets and go into new businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that FY2001 would be a more difficult year, I

would  like to urge the Government to bring forward or  speed

up  more  public sector projects to help the private  sector.

For example, given that our projected budget surplus is still

very  respectable, we could increase the number of  Main  and

Interim  Upgrading projects which will also benefit  our  HDB

dwellers.   I  would also like to suggest that we  set  aside

more  funds for the upgrading of private housing estates  for

the  benefit of private housing estate residents.  Last year,

only five private housing estates were selected for upgrading

although many qualified under the criteria given.  This year,

I hope that there will be more such estates selected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set aside funds to help SMEs through

the   Productivity  and  Standards  Board  and  the  Economic

Development  Assistance Scheme.  They are given more  in  the

form of technical assistance, training and consulting to help

them  modernise management, adopt technology and become  more

productive.  These initiatives are good and will continue  to

be  welcome.   SMEs, however, need more than  just  technical

assistance  and training today. They need some  support  from

the  Government  too  in  the form of  equity  to  grow  more

aggressively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, through Temasek Holdings, the EDB

Investments,  the National Science and Technology  Board  and

other Government vehicles, takes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>

stakes in our local companies from time to time.  However,  I

notice that many of these investments tend to be in big local

companies  or  big  projects.   Government  venture   capital

companies,  such as Vertex, take stakes in start-ups.   There

seems  to be a gap where the SMEs are.  I would like  to  ask

that  the  Government consider investing more  in  our  SMEs.

They  need more financial support to go into the region  with

their existing businesses and to venture into new businesses.

The stakes need not be big.  They should leave the management

of  such SMEs to the founding entrepreneurs and professionals

employed.   The confidence of the market, business associates

and  customers from such Government support will give them  a

much  better  chance to succeed in the  region.   I  want  to

clarify  that I am not suggesting a bail out of ailing  local

companies.  I am suggesting that the Government look at  good

SMEs  with  viable  business models and distinct  competitive

advantages  that have not yet obtained access  to  the  stock

markets for their capital for expansion. These companies need

our support to grow and eventually become world-class.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the CPF top-up scheme. I

commend  the  Government  for  its  unique  but  nevertheless

generous  way  of  sharing our budget surplus.   Putting  the

money  directly into the CPF however may not be the best  way

of  doing  so because many Singaporeans do not see the  money

and  probably  do not even know when the money was  credited.

If  they  do  not even know or feel it, would they appreciate

the  handout?  Perhaps, the Government should consider giving

it in cash, cheque or vouchers for a change.  This would also

help to boost the economy in a year of uncertainty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to comment on is Edusave.

In  my  view,  it  is  one  of the  more  popular  Government

initiatives  to  support procreation  and  education  of  our

young.    However,  I  still  fail  to  understand  why   the

Government  would not extend this to families  with  four  or

more  children.  I am sure the amount involved would  not  be

large.  If we want families to have three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>

or more children, we should be consistent in our policies and

not discriminate against the fourth or fifth child in such  a

manner.  I hope the Government will review this policy  again

seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the motion, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, Budget 2001 has been hailed, as many colleagues

have  said,  a  good  Budget for the people  and  businesses.

Under  the able leadership of our Government, we have managed

to   achieve   a  budget  surplus.   Our  economy   performed

remarkably  well in the year 2000.  This was  due  to  strong

external  developments,  sound economic  policies  and,  more

importantly, it was due to the sacrifice of our workers.  The

cut  in CPF in 1999 has restored our competitiveness and  has

gained investors' confidence.  For this, full credit must  go

to  our  workers.   CPF contribution has  been  progressively

restored  since  January 2000, bringing  the  employer's  CPF

contribution rate to 16%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people think that this is an election year Budget.

However,  facts  had  shown  that  our  economy  indeed  grew

remarkably  in  the year 2000.   It was our workers  who  had

borne the major brunt in the economic recession in 1997/1998.

It  is  only  fair and timely that they should be recompensed

for such sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are clear signs that the economy is slowing down.

In  particular, the US economy is heading for a slowdown.  We

have  projected  growth of between 5-7%, if  the  US  economy

grows  by  2-2.5%.  Dr Richard Hu cautioned that any negative

growth  figure in the US will mean that we will be hit  hard.

Does  the  Government have other off-Budget measures  it  had

introduced during the recession in 1997/1998?  We agree  that

we  must  be prepared for difficult times ahead.   Growth  in

global  electronics has slowed significantly.  As the  US  is

our  major electronic export market, to what extent would the

slowdown affect our workers' job security?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is right for the Government to promote

other high value added industries as we move forward into the

New

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>

Economy,  such as the life sciences and infocomm  industries.

In  these sectors, many new and skilled jobs will be created.

However,  how  can we channel retrenched workers  into  these

sectors?   Do they possess the necessary skills  to  take  up

these  jobs?  We need to address the issue of skills mismatch

among our retrenched workers.  The Government adopted several

initiatives  through  the  Manpower  Development   Assistance

Scheme,  SDF  and  the Lifelong Learning  Endowment  Fund  to

address  the  issue.  NTUC has the SRP and N-ETF  to  upgrade

skills  of  our workers, so that they will remain  employable

and,  in the event of retrenchment, they are able to take  up

higher skill jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is necessary to put in place these schemes, it

is  insufficient  to  deal with the problem  of  structurally

displaced  workers.  However, other than these  schemes,  the

retrenched workers themselves must be willing to be retrained

and take up jobs in the high growth sectors.  After training,

the  next challenging task is to match these workers with the

new jobs.  To achieve this end, a better job matching system,

coupled  with  constant contact with the retrenched  workers,

must  be  put in place.  Equally important is the willingness

of  our workers to be retrained and take up jobs in these new

industries.    However, what is causing concern is that  many

retrenched workers choose to drive taxis rather than take  up

training and move into these new jobs and industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another challenge that we face is the

training of our older workers.  Even when some of these older

workers  accepted  our advice and went for  retraining,  more

often than not they were turned away at job interviews.  Many

employers  cited  age as the main reason for rejecting  them.

With  scarce  human resources and the longer life expectancy,

we  need  to  make better use of our workers.  I  am  glad  a

Tripartite  Working Committee on Work Redesign has  commenced

to  look  into  restructuring jobs in the hotel,  marine  and

cleaning  industries.  I hope that they will  look  into  the

issue  of  how  older workers can be fitted  into  new  jobs,

rather than focusing too much on increasing productivity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While striving to maintain investors' confidence in our

economy, to that end, the National Wages Council had endorsed

the monthly variable component (MVC).  The MVC is targeted to

form  about  10%  of   total  wages.   It  acts  as  a  first

cushioning  effect before a CPF cut is considered.   However,

the  progress  in implementing the MVC in companies  has  not

been encouraging.  As a result, we may not be able to achieve

such wage restructuring in time to come.  The slowdown in the

US  economy will have some spillover effects on our  economy.

Can  our workers still look forward to a full restoration  of

the  employer's  CPF  contribution  or  will  they  face  the

prospect of another cut in CPF if the economy worsens?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of the cost of living has been discussed

many  times.  However, it is a subject that touches the heart

and  soul  of every Singaporean, especially the lower  income

group.   The  recent  increase  in  electricity  tariffs  had

sparked a huge uproar.  This was made worse by wrong billing.

The  continued  increase  in  petrol  prices  also  led  many

Singaporeans to believe that  this is the result of  monopoly

in  the  industry.  I urge the Government to monitor  closely

the  increase  in  prices in these companies with  particular

regard  to  the  basic essential items, such as  electricity,

water and other basic amenities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one of the most generous budgets,

especially  for the individuals.  In fact, Singaporeans  have

been  looking forward to it.  Naturally, workers would expect

the  Budget to get better each year.  We may not be  able  to

repeat  the performance of the year 2000 in 2001, and instead

there may be a slowdown in our economy.  If that happens, can

the  Government convince the people to accept something less?

Whilst material gains and benefits are important in levelling

up  our  people and sharing our fruits of success, it is  not

the  only  thing.  More crucial is to cultivate  a  sense  of

identity  and  sense  of  belonging  to  our  country,  which

ultimately will ensure our social cohesion and unity in  time

of crisis as our nation progresses.  Therefore, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>

would  like  to urge the Government to put in more  resources

and  effort to inculcate this sense and the spirit of nation-building  among  Singaporeans, and hope  that  future  Budget

statements  will  better reflect this  growing  need  in  the

difficult  times  ahead.  Hopefully, with this  approach,  we

will  be able, over time, to change the mindset of our people

and  that  they are able to bond together and go through  the

thick and thin of times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I congratulate the Finance Minister for his

excellent  Budget.  I also commend him for his  understanding

of  our people's expectations.  On this note, I fully support

the Budget for 2001.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for permitting me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by many Members who have spoken before me, the

Budget  has  indeed  been very well  received,  as  there  is

evidently something for almost everyone.  I congratulate  our

Government  for  its astute handling of Singapore's  economic

well-being,  which has enabled us to emerge not  only  almost

unscathed  from  the Asian financial crisis  but  has  placed

Singapore  several  steps ahead of  our  competitors.   As  a

result,  we  are now in this happy and enviable situation  of

how to manage our surplus and redistribute the created wealth

from our prudent but successful economic management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certainly most supportive of budget surpluses,

especially  when part of the wealth created is  redistributed

in the fashion and extraordinary generosity of this very pro-Singaporean Budget.  It is highly motivating and, I  believe,

will  spur people to work harder, as it represents a  win-win

formula  for  both the country as well as its people.   Every

party  benefits from it.  We have to strengthen the  virtuous

cycle  of effort, growth and wealth creation in order for  us

to maintain this win-win formula.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join the many others

who have spoken earlier, and also in expressing my admiration

for the creative manner in how part of this year's Budget  is

being returned back to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>

Singapore's stakeholders.  There is benefit to be derived  by

Singaporeans from all walks of life as well as, particularly,

our small SMEs and new and budding businesses.  This is why I

referred to it earlier as a pro-Singaporean Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I would like to suggest that the

Government consider some form of a formula for the management

and  redistribution of our annual budget  surpluses,  as  and

when  we  have them.  I feel that having a known  and  shared

formula would enable us to have rationalisation in the manner

our  surpluses are distributed.  The Government should  first

conduct  a  detailed  study of what the  appropriate  formula

should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if we can say that 30% or 40% of each

year's budget surplus is returned to the people with the rest

going  into  reserves, considering that  the  growth  of  our

reserves is generally higher than our annual GDP growth  each

year,  this will represent an added incentive for our  people

and  stakeholders  to  work harder,  knowing  that  a  bigger

surplus would translate into  higher potential incentives for

them.   Such  a  formula  will make  it  clear  that  with  a

guaranteed commitment of part of the surpluses being returned

to  the people, the Government cares and is prepared to share

its  annual  wealth creation, while comfort of mind  is  also

built that there is continued set aside for rainy days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, the Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC, who

spoke last Monday, also noted that excessive budget surpluses

can  result  in unnecessary deflationary pull on the  private

sector  economy  through taxes and statutory cost  and  fees,

whereas  a  more  rationalised tax  infrastructure,  such  as

returning   part   of  surpluses  to  the  stakeholders,   as

undertaken  in  this Budget, can promote a more  dynamic  and

entrepreneurial  economy with lesser debt burden.   This  was

further reinforced by Dr Wang Kai Yuen who also spoke on this

issue earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, allow me to touch on globalisation impact on the

lower  income group and small SMEs.  Sir, while  the  Finance

Minister's Budget should give us good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>

reason  to  cheer  about,  the rapidly  deteriorating  global

economic  environment certainly does not.  Manufacturers  are

starting to scramble to trim their sails in response  to  the

slowdown  in  the  United States and in case  the  US  market

drought  is prolonged.  In Singapore, our MNCs and  high-tech

manufacturers are the pumping chambers of our economic heart,

with  electronic  manufacturing making up 64%  of  our  total

exports  and accounting for more than half of our  industrial

production.     Thus,  a  slowdown  in   world   demand   for

electronics products will have a significant impact  on  jobs

related  to the electronic industry.  This is the reality  of

the  sweeping forces of globalisation affecting Singaporeans,

and  this will continue to affect our lives even more  so  in

this new millennium.  My worry, Sir, is particularly for  our

older   and   lower   income   workers.    Apart   from   the

uncontrollable  global economic cycles, faster  technological

changes would also affect these workers' ability to hold jobs

due to more aggressive regional and global competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not as concerned about our young Singaporeans as I

believe  they are more adaptable to high-tech life and  rapid

changes  in  the  environment.  However,  it  is  this  ready

acceptance and adaptation by the younger generation that will

propel  our  transition  into a knowledge-based  economy  and

correspondingly make the digital divide more pronounced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, Sir, I would like to call on the Government to

continue  to intensify its efforts and to act decisively  and

quickly to help our older adult population in retraining  and

reskilling them.  Equipping them with knowledge of IT  should

also be a priority, as most industrial jobs today require  IT

familiarisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge the Finance Minister to support this

urgent  and  worthwhile cause to minimise  the  threat  of  a

digitally divided society.  In view of the imminent threat of

another round of unemployment, I would urge the Government to

harness  and  take advantage of all existing  infrastructure,

including creating new avenues, if necessary, to retrain  and

reskill older

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>

workers.   This includes tapping into the vast  resources  of

our   unions,   working   with   grassroots   and   community

organisations and employer groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides individuals, many of our small SMEs are also

struggling   to   survive  as  a  result   of   the   rapidly

restructuring  economy.  In spite of  the  sterling  economic

growth  last year, it is not uncommon to hear groans  of  our

small businesses that they have not benefited that much  from

last year's 9.9% economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is common for owners of SMEs to pledge their

properties  against  bank borrowings.  Prices  of  properties

today  are  subject  to wild swings and when  these  diminish

substantially,  such as the case during the financial  crisis

years,  banks unhesitatingly demand for immediate top-ups  to

make  up  for the difference if the outstanding loan  amounts

are  above the diminished collateral value.  Those who  could

not  pay had to declare bankruptcy.  Sir, there are signs  of

similar trends emerging as a result of the economic slowdown.

I  would like to therefore ask the Government to consider the

exploration  and  facilitation of some form of  an  insurance

mechanism  to  be in place for such cases if  none  currently

exists.   This will help prevent viable SMEs from  having  to

wind up just because of a temporary downturn situation.

<br><br><i>Tax Relief for Knowledge Upgrading</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to tax relief for knowledge upgrading. On the

same  token,  Sir, the Government should be pleased  to  note

that  many mid-career workers have responded well to the call

for   lifelong  learning  by  upgrading  themselves   through

enrolment  in  professional and  degree  courses.   A  recent

Straits  Times'  report noted that about  25,400  people  are

doing  this based on 1999 data.  The course fees are not  low

and  can amount to tens of thousands of dollars.  As such,  I

would like to ask the Finance Minister to review and consider

doubling the current course fee relief from $2,500 to $5,000.

This should be done not only in appreciation of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>

peoples'  positive response to the call for lifelong learning

but also to encourage more to do so.  Investment in education

will  go a long way in increasing each citizen's contribution

to Singapore's economy.

<br><br><i>Attracting Back Singaporeans and Retaining Singaporean Talent</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, is on attracting back Singaporeans

and  retaining  Singaporean  talent.   An  estimated  200,000

Singaporeans are currently living abroad.  Many,  I  believe,

are professionals who could make a meaningful contribution to

Singapore.   Therefore,  in  addition  to  our  endeavour  to

attract  foreign talent to work in Singapore, we should  also

intensify  efforts to create more opportunities for  talented

Singaporeans  living  abroad to  return  home.   We  need  to

continually  re-examine  our environment  to  understand  the

factors why many Singaporeans choose to live and work abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, the Government is now much more receptive to

get  feedback and ideas from Singaporeans.  This may  not  be

known  to  fellow Singaporeans living abroad  who  felt  that

Singapore  lacks  the  space for them to express  themselves.

One  way  is for the Government to more regularly communicate

with  overseas Singaporeans to keep them informed of  changes

in  living  conditions  in Singapore to  keep  the  Singapore

heartbeat pounding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are thinking of leaving Singapore, have

them  tell  us  our "shortcomings".  Be with us  to  build  a

better  Singapore.  Make this our homeland, a country we  are

proud to call our home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can create an abundance of opportunities

for  all  but  if  the sense of belonging of Singaporeans  to

Singapore  begins to falter, then the future  of  the  nation

will be at stake.

<br><br><i>Keeping Singaporeans Healthy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch briefly on keeping Singaporeans

healthy.   Is  Singapore a sickly nation?  I am  particularly

disturbed by the heading of the publication "Today"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

dated  23rd  February which implied that we are a  nation  of

sick  people.  Our greatest resource is our people.  Everyone

in  Singapore is important, no matter how old he or  she  is.

Undoubtedly, a healthy individual can contribute more than an

unhealthy  one.  Thus, leading a healthy life should  be  the

norm  for every Singaporean and each should be encouraged  to

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that the competitive environment we

live  in  contributes to stress in many people.  We therefore

need  to  and  can  do more to encourage and  motivate  every

Singaporean to stay healthy and fit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Building more health clubs or exercise facilities in HDB

and  industrial estates to encourage people to exercise  more

so that they can stay fit.  Wherever possible, the facilities

should  be  free, but if charges are levied the fees  charged

must be reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Building two or more grassroots clubs in strategic sites

around  Singapore to encourage grassroots members  and  their

families  to  also indulge in healthy lifestyle.   Grassroots

leaders  play an integral role in community bonding  and  are

therefore valuable assets to the nation.  Their welfare  must

be well taken care of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Having more programmes or campaigns to encourage

the young to stay healthy and fit.  Healthy habits should  be

inculcated  from  young so that exercise and  adoption  of  a

healthy lifestyle becomes a natural part of their lives  when

they grow up; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) For senior citizens, special rebates should be

considered  for  them  when they spend  on  health  enhancing

products  such  as vitamins and special food  supplements  to

keep themselves healthy and fit.

A healthy and fit Singaporean is not only an asset to himself

but also to his family and, undoubtedly, the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would

like  to  thank Mr Speaker for making me the last speaker  on

the list but the first to speak after the break.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that this year's Budget is a

"doughnut" Budget.  It is a delicious snack which is favoured

by the young and old.  But then a friend of mine told me that

some  Singaporeans  would prefer to buy   ham  jin  ben,  the

Cantonese  pancake rather than the doughnut.  The  reason  is

that even before you start biting on it, there is already one

mouthful  missing  as there is a hole in the  middle  of  the

doughnut.   That is why there are some people,  like  Mr  Low

Thia  Khiang,  who would only focus on the  little  hole  but

negate  the  pleasure  that comes from the  dough  ring,  and

forgetting that the structure of doughnut itself is  a  ring,

and  the space in the centre is not a hole.  He said that the

$230  saving for the lower-income taxpayer is not  a  saving.

He is looking not at a doughnut but a cake. No matter how big

the  cake is, he would say that it is not big enough.  Is  he

saying that the income tax saving totalling $700 million   is

not  a  saving?   What  kind of logic  is  this?   I  do  not

understand.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not immortal. We have still to

take  earthly  food and water to survive,  and  to  face  the

cruel  reality.  The Government is mortal. It is not  a  god.

It  cannot turn stone into gold and cannot answer your  every

prayer.   So what we need is a balanced budget that  benefits

everybody.  Singapore is like a child born to a poor  family.

It  has to rely on itself and work hard to make its mark.  We

do not have oil.  We do not have natural gas.  Even water has

to be imported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society may not be so perfect. But we have very

sound  systems. Apart from the Government agencies,  we  have

very  extensive  grassroots  network.   Whenever  the  people

encounter difficulties, there is always a way out.  The  only

problem is some people are not aware of the relevant measures

and  where  to  seek  help.  With  some guidance  from  other

people, they  are enlightened, and very often, they will  see

the  light  at  the  end  of  the channel.   However,  it  is

regrettable  there are some people, like the  NCMP,  who  are

always putting forward some fallacious arguments rather  than

lending  a  helping hand to those who need help.  They  could

only  exaggerate the problem and inflate the hardship.  Their

mentality and behaviour are like a song that is made known by

the  popular  Hong  Kong star,  Roman  Tam,  "Loving  You  Is

Hurting You".  Why should the love become a harm to you?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need are realistic policies and solutions to the

problems,   so  that  our people can survive  in  the  global

economy  and continue to enjoy better quality of life.   Even

when there is an income gap, everyone's living conditions can

be improved continuously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to learn from the Minister that our

utilities industry will be further deregulated and the  power

and  gas supply market will be fully opened up.  I hope  that

through  competition, cost-effectiveness  will  be  enhanced,

thereby  relieving our people from the pressure of escalating

electricity charges. I hope that the Minister would take some

steps to restrain the rise in electricity tariffs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very glad to learn that the Government will

increase the Medical Endowment Fund to $800 million  as  this

will  imply  that more than $30 million will be allocated  to

the  Medifund  every year to help the poor in settling  their

medical  bills.   The $1 billion Lifelong Learning  Endowment

Fund  would also mean that, every year, $40 million could  be

spent to finance our workers in training and skill upgrading.

I  hope  that the Government would consider increasing  these

funds  when there are surpluses and also to raise the ceiling

for  matching  grant  to the Community  Development  Councils

(CDCs).   This  will  enable  the  CDCs   to  provide  better

services to the less privileged in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have collated some feedback from the television forum

corner,  the  coffee-shops  and meetings  of  the  grassroots

organisations,  and  I  would like to  present  them  to  the

Minister for his consideration:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Why is the Government deciding on the amount of

rebates  on  utilities  and service and  conservancy  charges

based  on the sizes of the HDB flats rather than the combined

incomes   of   the   families?  Quite  a  large   number   of

Singaporeans'  incomes are not really commensurate  with  the

size of the flat they live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can the said rebates be extended to all households?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The personal income tax relief has stagnated at

$3,000  for  many  years.  Can the Government  consider  some

upward adjustment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The relief for parental care is fixed at $5,000 and

$3,500, depending on whether the taxpayer is staying with the

parents.   Can the Government consider granting the taxpayers

who  are  not  living with their parents but are deliberately

staying close to their parents so that they could look  after

them, the higher relief as well?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as we move towards a knowledge-based economy,

the   economic  structure  will  be  facing  all   sorts   of

restructuring  and changes, and the welfare  of  our  workers

will   inevitably  be  affected.   The  labour  movement   in

Singapore is promoting more flexible labour welfare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>

measures  to  more effectively protect the interests  of  our

workers,  particularly medical benefits.  Can the  Government

consider  raising  the  2% cap on tax exemption  for  medical

expenses?  Perhaps,  the Government could  consider  granting

further  tax  concessions  for  employers  who  support   the

portable  medical  benefits system or  who  voluntarily  make

additional contributions to the employees' medical accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

who  have  spoken on the Budget on Monday and this afternoon.

Because of time constraints, I will focus on the major issues

raised  by Members; where they have raised points of details,

I will have to leave them to be discussed in the Committee of

Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Budget debate, some Members commented

that  the  Government  was too quick to  withdraw  the  cost-cutting  measures  introduced during the 1997/1998  financial

crisis, even as we emerged from the crisis with a respectable

growth of 5.9% in 1999.  This year, despite a stronger growth

of  9.9%  in  the  year  2000, Members have  again  expressed

similar concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These calls for help are a reflection that economic

growth has not been evenly

spread  out  in  Singapore.  Although SMEs in the  knowledge-based sectors and those servicing the multinational companies

have  done well, and have benefited from the strong  external

demand  in  the  past two years, other SMEs in  the  domestic

sectors have not done as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government understands the cost pressures these SMEs

are  facing.   Therefore, although the  one-off  cost-cutting

measures  were  meant to help tide them  over  the  temporary

financial difficulties, the Government has not withdrawn  all

the  cost-cutting measures.  For example, the employer's  CPF

contribution rate has not been fully restored to 20%.  JTC is

still  granting  a  rebate of up to  10%  of  its  customers'

contracted  rents.   The  HDB is also  extending  its  rental

rebate  until  the  end  of this year at  half  the  original

quantum.    The  gradual  phasing  out  of  the  cost-cutting

measures has not resulted in any substantial rise in business

costs.   In  fact,  Unit  Labour Cost  for  the  economy  has

continued to fall, by 0.9% last year, and Unit Business  Cost

of manufacturing also declined, by 1.1%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should distinguish between temporary difficulties,

for  which short-term cost-cutting measures are helpful,  and

more   fundamental  changes,  which  have  to  be  confronted

directly.   We  cannot meet the new challenges ahead  through

rebates  and  cost  subsidies. As we  enter  the  new  global

economy  where knowledge, creativity and innovation  are  the

key  competitive advantages, the challenges brought about  by

globalisation can only be met by upgrading our capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore introduced a slate of

measures  in  Budget  2001 to reposition  ourselves  for  the

future.   The  Budget  this  year  is  aimed  at  creating  a

framework  for  businesses to flourish,  and  maximising  the

potential  of  all  Singaporeans.   The  package  of  revenue

measures  will  increase our competitiveness.  A  preliminary

study  indicates that they could enhance our economic  growth

by around 0.2% this year and by a further 0.4% next year.  As

the  tax rate cuts are permanent, they provide companies  and

individuals   with  the  certainty  they  need  in   business

planning.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we push ahead in sectors that are growing

rapidly,  the Government recognises the need to  help  slower

sectors   upgrade   or   restructure.  Where   the   economic

fundamentals  of  the  business  have  changed,  it  may   be

necessary  for  some to shift to industries  offering  better

prospects.  The Government will extend help to them in making

these adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, our social cohesion must remain

strong.  The economic fruits of our success have to be shared

with  all  segments of our population.  This  year,  we  have

therefore  designed a progressive package of  Budget  "share-outs".   More importantly, ample help will also be  given  to

those who are not doing as well, through various means,  such

as  the  Manpower  Development  Assistance  Scheme,  and  the

Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I proceed to address major issues raised by

Members,   I   would  like  to  correct  several   misleading

statements  made  by  Mr  Low Thia  Khiang  and  by  Mr  J  B

Jeyaretnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low claims that the personal tax rate cuts mainly

benefit  the rich because their savings in dollar  terms  are

higher  than  lower income persons.  I hope that  he  is  not

naive  enough to believe that this is a legitimate complaint.

He  must know that the tax cuts are structured so that higher

income  persons  will receive lower tax  cuts  in  percentage

terms  than  lower  income persons.  It is  not  feasible  to

devise a tax cut in which lower income taxpayers receive more

tax savings in money terms than higher income taxpayers.   He

also  conveniently  forgets that nearly 70%  of  economically

active persons in Singapore no longer pay any personal income

tax,  and  the  taxes  paid by the remaining  30%  ultimately

appear  as part of the budget surpluses used to pay  for  the

CPF  top-ups, S&C charges and utilities rebates given to  the

lower income persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 70% who do not pay any income tax at all, they

benefit  directly  from  the CPF  top-ups,  the  S&C  charges

rebates and Utilities Save.  As these payments are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>

made  in money terms, we have structured the payments to give

more to the lower income persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also says that the Government should guarantee

that the cost of living in Singapore would not go up.  It  is

not  possible  to  give  such a guarantee.  First,  the  main

contributor  to domestic inflation is the wage  increases  of

workers.   I hope that Mr Low is not suggesting that workers'

wages  should be frozen.  Secondly, Mr Low must know  that  a

large  proportion of everything that we consume is  imported.

We  cannot control the prices of imported goods, but the  MAS

has  been  quite successful in minimising imported  inflation

through its management of the Singapore dollar exchange rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy has, therefore, been to keep

inflation   as  low  as  possible  and  through  productivity

improvements, ensure that wages increase faster than the cost

of   living.   This  way,  living  standards  will  rise  for

everyone.   Over  the past 10 years, the cost  of  living  in

Singapore,  as  measured by the Consumer Price  Index  (CPI),

increased  by  1.7%  per annum.  On the other  hand,  average

household income from work increased by 4.9% per annum.   The

average  household income has therefore gone up by  3.1%  per

annum  in  real terms.  Today, households are therefore  much

better off in income terms compared to 10 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam has made numerous comments on a broad

range  of topics.  He should take up such details during  the

Committee of Supply.  But I have to comment on his references

to the education, defence and health budgets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam quoted only the Ministry of Education's

operating  budget of $4.9 billion.  This forms only  part  of

the  total  budget  for  education.  The  total  Ministry  of

Education budget is, in fact, $6.3 billion, which is almost a

third more than the figure Mr Jeyaretnam quoted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also compared the MOE budget with the

defence  budget.  First,  there is  no  need  for  us  to  be

apologetic about our spending on defence.  Without safety and

security, all our hopes and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>

dreams  will  vanish.   Mr Jeyaretnam  should  not  misdirect

Singaporeans with his naivete.  The defence budget is  capped

at  6%  of  our  GDP.   It is an insurance  premium.   Actual

expenditures on defence have consistently hovered  around  5%

in recent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are increasing the total education budget

for  FY2001  by $480 million, more than the $390 million  for

defence, which is, in turn, only slightly more than the  $370

million  increase  for  health.  This demonstrates  that  the

Government  sees education and health as matters of  national

priority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also decries that we are not spending

enough  on  healthcare.  He is not seeing the total  picture.

In  FY2001,  the  Ministry of Health's  budget  is  increased

significantly  by 30% over FY2000.  In our public  hospitals,

very  substantial subsidies are provided - 80% for  Class  C,

and  65%  for  Class B2.  These subsidy rates  apply  to  all

costs,  including medicine.  Primary healthcare treatment  is

also  heavily  subsidised in our polyclinics.   In  addition,

patients  can  use their Medisave to pay for the  balance  of

their hospital bills, and to take up MediShield to help  them

should  they  contract catastrophic illnesses.  Patients  who

are  not able to pay for their share of the medical bills can

apply  for  assistance from the Medifund.  The recipients  of

Public  Assistance are given free medical  treatment  in  our

public  hospitals  and polyclinics. Healthcare  is  therefore

accessible and affordable for all Singaporeans.

<br><br><i>Economic Outlook and Off-budget Measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Peh Chin Hua, Mr Chew Heng Ching,

Mr  Ong  Ah Heng and others have expressed concern about  the

economic  outlook  this  year.   Some  have  asked   if   the

Government  is ready to consider off-budget measures  if  the

economy takes a turn for the worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's growth estimate of 5-7% for 2001 takes

into account the consensus of US growth forecast of 2-3%  for

the  year  as a whole.  If US growth should turn  out  to  be

substantially lower,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>

our  forecasts will have to be adjusted downwards, but it  is

still too early to tell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the economy really falter, Members can be assured

that  the  Government will take whatever measures  needed  to

stabilise the economy.  We did so in 1998 and we will  do  it

again if the need arises as we have the resources.

<br><br><i>Property Sector</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker Sin Tze and Prof. Low Seow Chay want the property

tax rate to be cut by more than 2% because they said that the

property  tax  rebate  will  be withdrawn  after  June.   The

property  tax  rebate  was  introduced  to  help  ease   cost

pressures  on  companies during the 1997/1998  crisis.   With

improved  economic  growth in 1999 and 2000,  rental  markets

have  improved  considerably, so  an  extension  of  the  25%

property tax rebate is no longer justified.  However, to help

reduce  business costs in the longer term,  I  have  cut  the

property  tax  rate by 2%.  Unlike a rebate, a permanent  tax

cut provides businesses with certainty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested that the Government remove

property   tax   altogether,  especially  for  owner-occupied

commercial properties.  I should point out that property  tax

is  still  a  significant  and stable  source  of  Government

revenue.   It  can be reduced but not eliminated  altogether,

otherwise  other taxes will have to be raised.  Also,  it  is

wrong  to make a distinction between owner-occupied and  let-out  commercial and industrial buildings.  Removing  property

tax  only  for owner-occupied commercial properties  distorts

business decisions by making rental properties more expensive

than owner-occupied premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay and Mr Noris Ong have asked for the

removal of property market anti-speculation measures to  help

the   property   sector.   I  feel  that  there   is   little

justification  for  this.  Although the  property  market  is

facing  a  period of lacklustre performance, the  residential

price  index  of  132.8 for the fourth  quarter  of  2000  is

currently well above its trough of 100 in the fourth  quarter

of 1998.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Help for Small Businesses</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Noris Ong and Mr Lew

Syn  Pau  have  stressed  the importance  of  giving  SMEs  a

fighting   chance  to  survive  in  a  rapidly  restructuring

economy.  The Government has implemented a host of programmes

and   financial  schemes  to  help  SMEs  grow,  expand   and

regionalise  their  businesses.   EDB,  PSB,  IDA  and  other

Government agencies offer more than 60 programmes  for  local

companies at different stages of development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the tax exemption scheme that I am

introducing  to  the  corporate  tax  regime  this  year   is

specifically  designed to help small companies and  start-ups

grow  by  allowing them to plough more of their profits  back

into  their  businesses.  Mr Noris  Ong  asked  for  a  small

companies  tax  rate,  saying  that  the  $100,000  exemption

threshold may not be enough.  I believe that the measures  we

have  introduced in this Budget are sufficient for now.  Two-thirds  of  small companies will have their taxes reduced  by

more than half.

<br><br><i>Incentives for Businesses</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has called for more incentives for

businesses  and entrepreneurs, and a Lifeline  Fund  to  help

businesses.   There  are already existing schemes  in  place,

such  as  the  Innovation  Development  Scheme  and  Overseas

Enterprise Incentive Scheme, to help companies improve  their

productivity, to regionalise and to bring in new activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry will address other

points  on the SMEs in greater detail, including the specific

proposal for a Lifeline Fund.

<br><br><i>Help for Construction Industry</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Prof. Low Seow Chay and Dr Teo Ho Pin

have  expressed concerns about the construction industry.   I

should point out however that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>

contraction of construction output has moderated in year 2000

and  the  growth rate of the construction sector  could  turn

positive this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue for construction is productivity

improvement   and   Government  is  pushing   on   with   the

Construction  21  blueprint  to help  construction  firms  to

upgrade.

<br><br><i>Government-linked Companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Kenneth Chen and Mr Simon Tay have

raised   concerns  over  perceived  unfair   competition   by

Government-linked companies (GLCs) in the domestic market.  I

would  reiterate  that GLCs operate on  a  commercial  basis.

They  do  not receive any subsidies or preferential treatment

from  the Government, and are subject to the same regulations

and market forces as private entrepreneurs and SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek Holdings, the holding company of the GLCs, will

continue to drive GLCs to focus on their core competencies in

Singapore  and  to expand into the region.   GLCs  will  also

undertake  commercial  investments that  enhance  Singapore's

economic and business infrastructure.  These investments  may

be in new technologies and capabilities where the risk is too

high  for  private  funding or where  private  enterprise  is

lacking.  They can contribute to projects that complement the

efforts  of other Singapore companies and economic  agencies,

and partner local companies in their regionalisation efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to issues relating to tax and budget

presentation.

<br><br><i>Accuracy of Estimates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has commented on the differences

between  the  estimated and revised revenue  and  expenditure

forecasts.  Operating  revenue  in  FY2000  was  higher  than

forecast  because real GDP growth in 2000 turned  out  to  be

much  higher  at  9.9% compared to the original  estimate  of

between  4.5-6.5%.   This vast change in economic  growth  is

typical of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>

an  economy  like  Singapore, which is heavily  dependent  on

exports.   It  is  extremely difficult to  forecast  how  our

export   partners'  economies  will  do.   In  the  case   of

development  expenses,  actual  expenditure  was  lower  than

forecast because tender prices were low and there were delays

in implementing several development projects.

<br><br><i>Endowment Funds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also asked for the various endowment funds to be

subject  to parliamentary scrutiny.  All the endowment  funds

were set up through Acts of Parliament and the administration

of  the  endowment funds is subject to the provisions of  the

Acts  passed  by  Parliament.  The annual reports,  financial

statements and auditor's reports for the endowment funds  are

also  presented to Parliament annually.  In addition, Members

can raise queries about the use of the endowment funds during

the   Committee  of  Supply  proceedings,  and   can   direct

parliamentary  questions on them to the respective  Ministers

at other times of the year.

<br><br><i>Net Investment Income</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen also touched on the treatment of Net

Investment  Income  (NII)  in the FY2000  and  FY2001  budget

presentation.  He said that Government is mixing up  new  and

old  money  by having NII contribution as an "above-the-line"

item.    I   would  say  that  Dr  Wang  is  mistaken.    NII

contribution  is the portion of NII that remains  as  current

reserves  under  the amended Constitution.  It  is  thus  new

money  and  the  issue of mixing new and old money  does  not

arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of NII contribution as an "above-the-line"

item does not represent any sudden change in the Government's

fiscal  policies.   Although NII contribution  is  above-the-line,  we  will not, as in the past, make use of this  income

stream  until there is a need to.  Tax revenue and  fees  and

charges will continue to be the primary source of revenue for

Government.  For FY2001, we see no need to make use of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>

any  part  of the NII contribution as normal revenue  streams

alone  will  be more than sufficient to pay for  all  planned

expenditures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much NII to keep available for spending, subject to

using  a maximum of 50% of the NII earned from past reserves,

is  something  that  the Government will have  to  decide  on

annually,  taking  into consideration budgetary  needs.   The

real  budgetary pressures of a rapidly ageing population  are

not upon us yet.  The proportion of elderly aged 65 years and

above  is projected to increase from the current 7.3% to  13%

by the year 2020 and to 19% by the year 2030.  This will mean

more  expenditure looking after the elderly and the  sick  in

the  future years.  At the same time there will be a downward

pressure  on  revenue  as our tax base  narrows.  There  will

therefore  be  greater calls on our NII in  the  future.   We

must, therefore, be conservative in our spending now and plan

wisely for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also pointed out that the NII contribution

expected  for  FY2001  is  lower than  that  for  FY2000  and

questioned whether this is due to the poor performance of the

Government  of  Singapore Investment  Corporation  (GIC).   I

would  like  to  assure Dr Wang that this  is  not  so.   The

investment  income  for  FY2000  is  higher  due  to  special

dividends  received by the Government from Temasek  Holdings.

Discounting the special dividends, the investment incomes for

the 2 years are comparable.

<br><br><i>New Corporate Tax Regime</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Iswaran and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua have

asked  whether  the cut in our corporate tax below  25%  will

trigger  off anti-tax haven measures.  With other  countries,

such  as  Germany,  United  Kingdom,  Australia  and  Ireland

reducing their corporate tax rates, we see the need to reduce

our    corporate    tax   rate   to   maintain    Singapore's

competitiveness.   We need not be overly concerned  with  the

anti-tax  haven measures of other countries as most  anti-tax

haven  rules  are triggered against passive  income  and  not

active income.  We have always

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>

encouraged   foreign  companies  to  set  up  operations   in

Singapore  with substantial real activities in Singapore  and

not just use Singapore as a base for booking activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan has asked whether the Government will

put  in place regulations to prevent companies from splitting

up  into  smaller  companies  to  enjoy  the  three-tier  tax

exemption  scheme.  The exemptions were given to help  mainly

the smaller and less profitable companies.  It is, of course,

possible that profitable larger companies may break  up  into

smaller  entities in order to enjoy larger tax  savings.  The

Government will monitor the situation carefully and if abuses

are  found,  tax  rules will be put in  place  to  curb  such

abuses.

<br><br><i>Company Stock Option Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran said that the Company Stock Option Scheme

(CSOP)   should  enjoy  the  same  tax  exemptions   as   the

Entrepreneurial  Employee  Stock Option  Scheme  (EESOS).   I

would  point out that in the case of start-ups, stock options

are  the  main tools for attracting and retaining  talent  as

they  are  not  able  to  pay competitive  salaries.   It  is

therefore  necessary  to  provide  the  start-ups  with  more

incentives.    On   the  other  hand,  in  most   established

companies,  stock  options do not form a major  part  of  the

annual compensation for most employees.  The two schemes  are

therefore structured differently.  Mr Iswaran also wanted  to

know  how  the  50%  rule would apply to Singapore  companies

which employ many staff in their overseas factories.  In such

cases, companies with production factories overseas can still

enjoy  the  CSOP scheme as long as the conditions  have  been

satisfied by their Singapore operation.

<br><br><i>Goods and Services Tax</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas has asked for GST to be reduced in view

of  our  surpluses.  Our GST rate of 3% is the lowest in  the

world.  There is therefore no reason to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>

reduce the GST rate.  Mr Sinnakaruppan has also asked if  the

cuts  in income taxes would lead to a higher GST rate by  the

end of next year.  The answer is a simple "no".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua is concerned that the cuts in personal

income tax will shrink our tax base and eventually limit  the

effectiveness of income tax adjustments as a fiscal  tool  in

future.  There is no reason for immediate concern as all  the

tax  changes announced in this year's Budget will only narrow

our  tax  net  marginally by 2 percentage  points,  from  the

current 32% to 30%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share her concern, however, that we should take care

not  to  narrow  our tax net by too much.  Hence,  I  am  not

supportive  of  Mr  Chew  Heng Ching's  and  Mr  Noris  Ong's

proposals that we should introduce more generous personal tax

reliefs.  Doing so will shrink our tax net even further.   My

preference is to cut tax rates directly as this will  benefit

all  taxpayers,  and not benefit special groups  selectively,

unless there are overriding reasons to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr S Vasoo and Dr Jennifer Lee and others have expressed

concern  over the widening income gap and the plight  of  the

less  well  off.  The widening income gap is a reflection  of

globalisation  and  the  transition  into  a  knowledge-based

economy.    Salaries  at  the  top  end  will   be   globally

determined, as countries compete for talent.  Skilled workers

will also be able to command good salaries. This is something

we cannot avoid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the income difference in itself is not the

fundamental  problem.  The issue is whether  those  with  low

incomes  can make ends meet, and whether they are given  help

to  lift  themselves out of their circumstances.   Government

continues  to  assist the lower income group through  various

measures  like the S&C rebates, Utilities Save and  CPF  Top-ups,  where those with lower incomes receive more.   Just  as

critically, Government has invested heavily in the  provision

of  formal  education, offering quality primary and secondary

schooling  at  very low fees.  Schools have schemes  to  help

those  who cannot afford even these fees.  Children from  the

lower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>

income  group  will  be able to go as far  up  the  education

ladder as they can go, and be assured of a good future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See, Dr Lily Neo and Mr Thomas Thomas have

asked the Government to do more for the elderly and the sick.

Besides  the  subsidies and assistance  offered  through  the

Ministry  of Health and the Ministry of Community Development

and  Sports,  the Government has also set up  and  grown  the

Medifund and the ElderCare Fund, which help the elderly  with

their medical and nursing needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government believes that this is one area where it

is  important  to have joint responsibility.  The  Government

will  do  its  part  to ensure accessibility  and  affordable

services.   The individual must also contribute by leading  a

healthy  lifestyle  and planning and saving  for  retirement.

The  family  and  the community must also do  their  part  in

looking after their elderly family members and the needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas, Mr Chew Heng Ching, Dr S Vasoo and

others  have  asked  that more be done  for  our  pensioners.

Pensioners  receive the same benefits as other  Singaporeans,

such  as  the CPF top-ups, rebates for S&C charges, Utilities

Save,  Pre-Medisave  Top-ups and MediShield  Scheme  for  the

Elderly.  In addition, they are eligible for generous medical

benefits.   Pensioners have also benefited from the ex-gratia

payments  given in 1996 and again in 2000, of between  6  and

13.5  months  of  pensions, depending on the  date  of  their

retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensioners with low pensions are also given the

Singapore Allowance which is reviewed from time to time,  the

last revision being in 1997. With effect from 1st April 2001,

the Singapore Allowance will be increased by a further $10 to

a  total  of  $150  per month, and the gross pension  ceiling

raised  to $1,050 per month.  This increase took into account

the  cumulative inflation of 3.2% since the last revision  of

the Singapore Allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua

have  asked for more to be done to bridge the digital divide.

I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>

agree  that  Singaporeans need to embrace info-communications

technology (ICT) to take advantage of the availability of  e-services.   However, not all Singaporeans are  familiar  with

ICT  and  are  able  to  transact  over  the  Internet.   The

Government's response is therefore two-fold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government will continually enhance the user-friendliness of its own electronic services. By being more

customer-centric  and  integrated  in  the  way  we   deliver

services online, we make it easier for members of the  public

to  switch  from  traditional modes of  service  delivery  to

electronic  service delivery, such as the  one-stop  eCitizen

Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward in e-Government, we will also need to

make  sure that people's attitudes keep up with the  changes.

Hence  our  second prong is to provide ICT  training  to  our

citizens  so that they are better able to seize the  benefits

of  the new technologies.  The IDA has therefore set aside  a

$25  million  budget spread over three years to  run  various

programmes targeted at the elderly and others who are on  the

wrong  side  of the digital divide.  Our CDCs too have  taken

the  lead  to  implement their own district IT plans  and  to

bring IT training to the doorstep of residents.  In addition,

we need to encourage Singaporeans at the school and community

levels who can handle Internet transactions to help those who

cannot.  Such community-based efforts are essential to bridge

the digital divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Harun Ghani, Mr Hawazi Daipi, Mr

Ibrahim Othman and others have spoken about the importance of

keeping  our  workers  relevant  in  the  new  economy.   The

Government   recognises  the  importance  of   training   and

retraining for our workforce. This is necessary to  keep  the

Singapore economy competitive and to help our workers  remain

employable and to enjoy good wages. The Government will spend

more  than  $30 million this year on the Manpower Development

Assistance Scheme and other initiatives to help the workforce

upgrade.  The  Government will also contribute  another  $500

million  in  FY2001 to bring the Lifelong Learning  Endowment

Fund to $1 billion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng has suggested setting up a coordinating

committee  for  workers' training.  I  believe  this  is  not

necessary  as  there already is a National  Manpower  Council

chaired by the Minister for Manpower to develop, monitor  and

coordinate policies on developing our workforce.  The members

include  the  Minister for Trade and Industry,  Minister  for

Education,  Chairman  of  the Public Service  Commission  and

senior  officials  from  many other agencies,  including  the

NTUC,  Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Finance,  Mindef,

Economic   Development   Board  and  National   Science   and

Technology  Board. The wide representation  in  the  National

Manpower  Council  will help to align  the  various  training

schemes with the present and future needs of the economy.   I

am  sure the Ministry of Manpower will take into account  the

comments  by  Prof. Simon Tay and others on the  use  of  the

fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has proposed giving tax rebates for

companies   which   employ  older  or   retrenched   workers.

Employers  are  already  paying lower  CPF  rates  for  older

workers.    Singapore  runs  an  open  market   economy   and

distortions  to the market must be kept as low  as  possible.

We  have  to  offer additional help to older  and  retrenched

workers by way of training, retraining and re-skilling.  What

companies  pay  their workers must be a reflection  of  their

productivity, taking into account their capacity  to  do  the

job, their reliability and their loyalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang felt that

Utilities Save eligibility should not be confined to 1- to 5-room  HDB flats.  Utilities Save is meant as a way of sharing

the   budget  surplus,  and  not  as  a  means  of  shielding

Singaporean  households  from  the  effects  of  fuel   price

increases.   It  is  targeted at the lower and  middle-income

groups,  as the higher income group would benefit from  other

budget  surplus sharing measures such as income tax  rebates.

Utilities Save is therefore limited to households in 1- to 5-room  HDB  flats.  About 75% of households will benefit  from

it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government recognises that using HDB flat

size  as a proxy for income levels is not perfect.  The ideal

solution would be to disburse the rebates in accordance  with

the financial needs of the households.  Such an approach will

be  more equitable, but it will require a comprehensive means

test  for  individual  households, taking  into  account  the

income  levels,  number of household members and  dependants,

the  assets owned by them, and so forth.  This will make  the

system  very  complex  and intrusive.   There  are  close  to

700,000 HDB households in 1- to 5-room flats alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Ong Ah Heng have asked the

Government to slow down the progress of adjusting  the  water

and utilities levies.  Electricity and water charges make  up

the   bulk   of   utilities  charges  for  households.    Our

electricity tariffs are reviewed quarterly, based on fuel oil

prices at the time of review.  Fuel oil prices have increased

steadily from US$11 per barrel in 1998 to a high of US$28 per

barrel  in October 2000.   Fortunately, fuel oil prices  have

since  eased to about US$22 in recent months.   If  fuel  oil

prices continue to fall, electricity tariffs will also drop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of water, the Government has, in July 1997,

introduced  a  series  of revisions on  water  tariff,  water

conservation  tax  and  water  borne  fees  to  reflect   the

strategic  importance  and scarcity  of  water.   These  were

phased over four years, from 1997 to 2000.  The last revision

took  effect on 1st July 2000.  As of now, there is  no  plan

for further revision of water tariff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the CPF Top-Up Scheme, Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked

that  Government do away with the requirement for a $100 top-up for certain categories of people.  I should point out that

co-payment is an important principle of governance, where the

Government  joins together with the individual to look  after

his or her well being.  In the case of the CPF Top-up, the co-payment  serves  to  underline the importance  of  individual

responsibility  in saving and planning for one's  future  and

retirement.   Removing the need for a $100  co-payment  would

undermine this objective.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of making the co-payment to qualify

for  the  CPF Top-up lies with the individual and the family.

For  senior  citizens who are unable to  make  the  $100  co-payment,  the  children or other family members  should  come

forward  to  help by volunteering to contribute the  $100  on

their behalf, so they can get the top-up from the Government.

Community  groups  such as Citizens' Consultative  Committees

and  voluntary  welfare organisations have  offered  help  to

those without family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has said that steps should be taken to ensure a

higher take-up rate of the CPF Top-Up Scheme.  To put matters

in  perspective,  I would like to point out that  the  latest

participation  rate  of 91.2% compares very  favourably  with

previous exercises. The participation rate for the three runs

of  the Share Ownership Top-up Scheme in 1993, 1995 and  1997

was  74%, while the Pre-Medisave Top-up for the elderly given

from 1995 to 1998 had participation rates ranging from 65% to

73%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Government will work towards getting

more Singaporeans to enjoy such top-ups.  As the Minister for

Manpower  informed this House last month, the CPF Board  will

conduct  a survey to find out why nearly 200,000 Singaporeans

did not come forward to participate in the CPF Top-Up despite

all  the publicity and encouragement.  We should wait for the

results  of the survey before deciding on what else needs  to

be done.

<br><br><i>Family</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked for more support to be given

to  three-tier families through a Senior Citizens Bonus.  The

Government  supports and promotes the extended  family  as  a

means  to  foster inter-generational cohesion and provide  an

informal support network for childcare and aged care.   There

are already several incentives in place to encourage children

to  look  after their parents and grandparents.  For example,

the tax relief for adults who live with aged parents has been

increased to $5,000.  The CPF Top-up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>

Scheme, under which taxpayers enjoy tax reliefs for cash top-ups  to  their parents' retirement accounts, is  extended  to

include  grandparents.  HDB has also in place the CPF Housing

Grant  Scheme to encourage young couples to stay  near  their

parents.   Under the scheme, young couples who buy  a  resale

flat  from  the  open market to stay near their  parents  are

given a housing grant of $40,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides monetary incentives, there are other ways to

promote  three-tier  family living.   MCDS  is  working  with

community  agencies to promote grandparenting skills  and  3-generation  bonding  activities.  Where  possible,  childcare

facilities  will  be  co-located with facilities  for  senior

citizens  and students.  MCDS will continue to work with  the

relevant   agencies  to  identify  policies  and   programmes

currently  targeted at the two-tier family,  which  could  be

extended to the three-tier family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has raised several issues relating to

family and social services.  MCDS has already some programmes

in  place.  The Minister for Community Development and Sports

can  elaborate  on these programmes during the  Committee  of

Supply Debate on MCDS' budget.

<br><br><i>Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has proposed that the Government spend

$2  billion  of its surplus to improve our education  system.

Mr  Chiam's proposal is commendable.  He should be pleased to

note  that the Government is budgeting to spend $6.3  billion

next  year on education.  This is an increase over the FY2000

budget.   Our  education budget is second  only  to  that  of

defence.  We cannot be allocating funds to education  on  the

basis of whether there is a surplus, or how large the surplus

is in a particular year, as Mr Chiam wants to recommend.  The

Government  has  always  invested heavily  in  education  and

training.   It is an investment that has paid off handsomely,

and puts Singapore in a good position for the knowledge-based

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked for subsidies for pre-school

education.  Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>

has  subsidised  pre-school education  by  providing  capital

grants  to  eligible kindergartens.  The childcare  subsidies

given  by  Government also help offset the  cost  of  sending

children  to  childcare centres with kindergarten programmes.

In  FY2001, the Ministry of Education will continue its pilot

programme  on  pre-school education to develop new  materials

and  train  teachers,  and study how effective  they  are  in

actual  classroom application.  We have to assess the results

of  the  study before thinking of further subsidies for  pre-school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim and Mr Leong Horn Kee raised the issue of

funding  for  CDCs and RCs. In FY2000, CDCs were allocated  a

recurrent budget of $11.7 million from Government to pay  for

their  manpower and other operating costs.  From FY2001,  the

Government will raise CDCs' recurrent budget by $3.3  million

per  year, an increase of 28% over the current funding level.

The  increased  budget should allow the CDCs to  employ  more

staff  and enable them to take on a larger role in the social

service  delivery functions. In line with the  delegation  of

the  social  assistance schemes to the CDCs with effect  from

1st April 2001, the funding for social transfers amounting to

$98.2 million is also transferred from MCDS to the CDCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the recurrent budget for CDCs, Government also

provides  an  annual grant of $1 per resident as  well  as  a

matching grant of $3 for every $1 of cash donation raised and

$4  for every $1 of donation through GIRO.  This is based  on

the  principle  of  co-funding,  which  encourages  community

involvement  and  induces discipline  in  the  management  of

resources.   Easy  availability of funds  without  co-funding

tends  to  lead  to  loose spending and a "buffet  syndrome".

Individuals  and corporations qualify for tax  deductions  on

donations made to all CDCs and also to funds set up by  other

grassroots  organisations,  such  as  CCCs  and  CCMCs,   for

specific  programmes like building, scholarships and  welfare

funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, Government is giving about $140 million to the

CDCs per year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>

Government  also provides grassroots grant to CCCs,  RCs  and

Neighbourhood  Committees at $2.6  million  per  annum.   The

grants  help  the CCCs, RCs and NCs organise  more  community

development and neighbourhood enhancement projects to promote

neighbourliness and social cohesion.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is about

repositioning Singapore to ensure our continued survival  and

success  in  a  constantly evolving global environment.   How

much  and  how fast to change really depends on how fast  the

world moves.  Several Members have asked if the corporate tax

rate  cut  is  the  beginning of a trend towards  even  lower

corporate tax rates.  We have not set a new target for income

tax  rates in the medium term because tax rates globally  are

in a state of flux.  Our commitment is to keep our rates at a

competitive  level.  We are a price-taker and  not  a  price-fixer.   We thus have to be alert and agile enough to  adjust

to the price movements in good time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we make these adjustments, we want to be able to

provide some certainty to businesses and individuals.  Unlike

other  countries where Budget is a time when people begin  to

wonder  whether  taxes  will  be  raised  in  order  to  meet

expenditure needs, we believe in assuring predictability,  so

that  businesses  and  individuals can  plan  their  finances

better.   When  we cut tax rates, we do not expect  to  raise

them again, unless it is part of a total tax structure revamp

or  unless  some  fundamental  changes  have  occurred  which

require  a  basic  change in strategy.   The  cuts  therefore

indicate our assessment of future global trends in tax rates.

Where  we  are  not ready to make tax cuts, we offer  rebates

when we can afford them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax rebates and budget "share-outs" will be available so

long  as  the  economy performs well and we set aside  enough

reserves for contingencies.  They are our way of sharing  the

nation's    prosperity   with   everyone   and    recognising

Singaporeans' efforts in working together successfully.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have suggested that the Government

should   have  a  formula  for  the  distribution  of  budget

surpluses.  This is unrealistic. Government will continue  to

share  the surpluses with the people whenever it is able  to.

How  much, when and how to share depends on factors  such  as

how  the economy has performed and, more importantly, how the

foreseeable future looks like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, our policies aim at, first, to keep tax

rates  competitive; second, maintain Government  expenditures

that are necessary to provide good public services today  and

to  invest in infrastructure for tomorrow; and third,  ensure

that we preserve and grow the value of our reserves.  What is

left after meeting these core goals, we can share out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also suggested that having budget

surpluses  mean  that  we are probably  collecting  too  much

revenue.   Well,  if  we can be certain  that  we  will  have

sufficient  sources  of funds in future to  service  all  the

demands  like  education, healthcare and  looking  after  the

elderly,  even  as  our  population  ages  and  the   economy

continually restructures with globalisation, then  of  course

we  can  consider collecting less, and further lower our  tax

rates.   But who can be so certain about the future?  To  act

like the future is a simple projection from the present is to

invite  disaster.   The alternative of not planning  for  any

surplus  is to have a system where taxes go up and down  each

year depending on the state of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>

economy.  The Government rejects this alternative, as it will

introduce enormous stress and uncertainty in the lives of our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget I have presented for fiscal

year  2001 contains measures to help everyone adjust  to  the

challenges of the new millennium.  This debate has served  to

ensure  that our policies are robust in both the  short  term

and  the  longer term.  It is of critical importance that  we

move  together  as a united people.  To be  successful  as  a

nation,  we  must build a cohesive society that leverages  on

our   collective  strengths  in  forging  a  future  for  all

Singaporeans.   This Budget gives a boost to  businesses  and

entrepreneurs, shares with all Singaporeans the fruits of our

good  economic performance, and offers help and hope for  the

lower income earners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank all Members for their contributions to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this process. [Applause.]
