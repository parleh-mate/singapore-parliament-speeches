<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question, as amended,

was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, in pursuance of the national objective of a

united Malayan nation, enlarged and strengthened  by

the   addition  of  our  brothers  in   the   Borneo

territories,  this  House declares  its  support  in

principle  for  the  plan  proposed  by  the   Prime

Minister  of  the Federation of Malaya, Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  Putra Al-Haj, and agreed to in principle  in

the Federation Parliament on 18th October, 1961, for

the  establishment  of the Federation  of  Malaysia,

comprising   the  eleven  States  of   the   present

Federation, the States of Singapore and Brunei,  and

the territories of Sarawak and North Borneo.".



<br><br>Since which amendments have been moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4, to leave out "plan" and insert

"motion";



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 6, to leave out "in principle".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the word `plan' proposed to

be  left  out, be left out." The debate will proceed

on  both  amendments and the Original  Question,  as

amended.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

remember  the  Prime Minister of the  Federation  of

Malaya said that he would not accept Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



into  the  Federation unless the  three  North

Borneo  territories were merged with the Federation.

The   fact  is  that  if  the  three  North   Borneo

territories  are  merged with Malaya  and  Singapore

goes  into the Federation with special status, i.e.,

the  so-called partnership, the name to be given for

such a kind of association is called Malaysia. It is

a  name  used by the five Governments - three  in  the

North   Borneo  territories  controlled  by  British

colonialists,  one in Malaya and one  in  Singapore,

backed  by  colonial agents. Sir,  we  must  not  be

confused   by  the  word  "Malaysia".  The   British

colonialists,  the  Tunku and the P.A.P.  Government

call  it  Malaysia, for it is the term used in  this

form  of  association. But, on the other  hand,  the

P.A.P. call  this  form  of  association   between

Singapore  and  the  Federation as  merger.  It  is,

therefore, clearly seen or understood that merger is

part  of  Malaysia. The people must understand  that

merger is Malaysia and Malaysia is merger. These are

two separate names but they mean the same. It is not

a  real  merger or a real Malaysia;  It  is  just  a

proposal,  a  plan,  or,  better  still,  it  is   a

conspiracy  of one country or countries  to  deprive

the rights of the people of the other country and to

seek control of the other country. It is also a plot

of  the colonialists to transfer a portion of  their

powers to the pro-colonialists who are local people.

The  colonialists  make  use  of  these  people   to

suppress the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the proverb says, "lend the knife to kill

the people - Chieh Tao Sha Ren." Sir, it means that  I

lend  you  a knife and you kill my enemy. If  anyone

wants  to take revenge, then it is you who are going

to  be killed and not I. Sir, the British are not as

silly  as the ass. They know how to give; they  know

how  to take; and not when to give and when to take.

The  British are not like the Dutch, the  Portuguese

or  the  French. They know how to train local people

to  do  the  work  in the interests of  the  British

colonialists.  Sir, just imagine, will  the  British

colonialists give something for nothing? How can  we

expect the British colonialists to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



surrender  the  powers in Singapore  and  the  three

North  Borneo  territories to the local  people  for

nothing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is just like an unsinkable aircraft-carrier of the British in the Far East and the

mineral wealth in the three North Borneo territories

is  vital to the British. And yet we see the British

supporting Malaysia, whereby the four territories of

the British colonies are to be handed to Malaya, not

for  nothing,  but for many things. Sir,  with  this

change  of  authority from the British  to  the  so-called  great nationalists of Malaya, the people  of

these four territories will still have to pass their

lives  in darkness. They will still not be  able  to

enjoy  the democracy and freedom which they are  now

fighting  to get from the British colonialists.  Why

do   the   British  colonialists  support  Malaysia?

Because  the  people in these four  territories  are

fighting  against  the British and  trying  to  free

themselves  from British rule. The British  are  now

afraid.  They  are  afraid because  the  lesser  the

British colonies the weaker the British become.  The

best  and  simplest way to prevent it from happening

is  to bring up and to train a pro-colonial force of

local  people and to strengthen and prolong  British

colonial  rule.  The British have trained  and  have

brought them up in such a way that the interests  of

these people are inter-related. Sir, when I say  the

interests  of these people, I mean the interests  of

the  British colonialists and the interests  of  the

pro-colonial  agents  who  are  local  people.   The

survival of these people depends on one another. But

the  British  are  cleverer than those  pro-colonial

agents who claim themselves to be nationalists. They

make use of these against the mounting anti-colonial

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is said that Malaysia was first proposed

by the nationalists of Malaya many years ago. I must

say the proposal was right because the proposal of a

Malaysia Plan was a plan to unite all the people  of

the   territories  to  fight  against  the   British

colonialists  and to free themselves  from  colonial

rule.  The concept and idea of the proposed Malaysia

Plan at that time was to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



mobilise  the forces of anti-colonial and suppressed

people  to  free themselves and to rule  themselves.

This   plan   was  not  supported  by  the   British

colonialists  then.  But  now  we  see  the  present

Malaysia  Plan is not only supported by  reactionary

forces   but  is  also  supported  by  the   British

colonialists. Sir, even worse, this Malaysia Plan is

not  going to bring about the reunification  of  the

territories and to unite these people, but to  split

these  people into various categories with different

types   of   citizenship  and   enjoying   different

privileges. In addition to this, the destiny of  the

people  of  the four territories at this  moment  is

still  under the control of the British.  How  could

the cruel-hearted colonialists hand over their rice-bowl  to the people of the colonies? And yet we  see

the  colonialists trying to hand over the rice  bowl

as  if  to  the people, but, in fact, to their  pro-colonial  agents so that they can share the benefits

at   the  expense  of  the  people  whom  they  have

colonised.  How  can  we  prove  that  the   British

colonialists  have recruited a force of pro-colonial

agents  who  work  on  their  behalf?  Sir,  in  the

colonial  regime,  we saw the colonialists  accusing

the people as subversives, and yet the people fought

against  the British colonialists. Now, we  see  the

people's elected government of the P.A.P. using  the

same   tactics   as  those  used  by   the   British

colonialists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> That is the

trouble. We did not do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, the British are very clever

and  cunning. Clever in that they know how  to  give

and  how to take. Cunning in that they know  how  to

manipulate their pro-colonial agents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So you admitted you were

cheated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, how silly the P.A.P.

Government  argue by saying that we are pro-colonial

and they are anti-colonial and nationalists. And yet

these so-called nationalists, the British love  them

and  do  not  want to arrest them. They  accuse  our

Barisan leaders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



as  pro-colonial, but the British once arrested them

and put them in gaol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They invited them to Eden

Hall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, as I was saying yesterday,

the  Prime Minister was very happy to see the Member

for Anson move his amendment and he supported it. He

was  even  happier to see the Member  for  Hong  Lim

support   the  amendment,  even  though  these   two

speakers  strongly  oppose and  condemn  the  merger

proposals as laid down in the White Paper. Sir,  the

people  think  that the White Paper  on  merger  and

Malaysia  mean the same thing - That is, merger  means

Malaysia  and  Malaysia means merger.  Why  was  the

Prime  Minister  so  happy  even  though  these  two

speakers  attacked the P.A.P. merger? The answer  is

simple. It is because these two speakers have fallen

into   the  P.A.P. propaganda  trap  and  are   now

confusing the people on this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Workers' Party and the U.P.P. oppose the

merger plan and yet they support the Malaysia  plan.

Sir,  we are more aware of the cunning of the P.A.P.

and  its treacherous tactics. We in the Barisan will

not  fall into the P.A.P. trap. The P.A.P. are  now

trying  to accuse us, who oppose the sell-out  plan,

as Communists or Communist stooges -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Which

you are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> - and call themselves

nationalists or democrats. Sir, what are they  doing

to  justify themselves as being democrats?  Sir,  we

see  them using the police force and troops  against

the  workers. We see them using the whole  machinery

of the Government to suppress those -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Member tell me how

those remarks are related to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, the so-called democrats

and   nationalists  are,  in  fact,  behaving   like

Fascists. The term



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



"nationalist"  is merely a cloak to hide  all  their

Fascist tendencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> If we

were Fascists, you would not be here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, when debating any motion in

this  House affecting the stability or the  interest

of  the  P.A.P.,  you  are sure  to  hear  the  word

"Communist". Everytime any motion is debated in this

House  their  attack  is  usually  directed  at  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they call us Communists or Communist stooges.

This is nothing but to mislead the people. They  say

that  if  Singapore  is under  the  control  of  the

Communists, then there is no freedom, democracy  and

jobs,  and  so  on.  But  they  have  forgotten  one

important  point,  and that is, has  Singapore  ever

been controlled by the Communists? The people do not

know what a Communist is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We all know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The people of Singapore have not

tasted,   the   sweetness  or  bitterness   of   the

Communists, but the people of Singapore have  tasted

the bitterness of colonialism and the bitterness  of

the  P.A.P. Government. Sir, in Singapore, we cannot

see any Communists.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are seeing one now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, they are trying to tell the

people that if Singapore is under the control of the

Communist,  then  we have no freedom,  but  at  this

moment we have no freedom, no democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Then what are you doing here?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> They use suppressions, smears,

threats  and  intimidation against  the  people  and

their  political opponents. Why, Sir? These  people,

especially  the  Ministers of  the  P.A.P.,  do  not

contact the people. They are isolated in their cool,

comfortable  air-conditioned rooms and they  do  not

know the people's thinking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people do not care about the Communists,

socialists  or  anything, but they do  care  whether

their livelihood is better or worse. Sir, the people

will only support those political leaders who really

work  for  the interest of the people and not  those

who   just  use  a  smear  campaign  against   their

political opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government accuse us of being anti-nationalists because we oppose merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You want self-government. That

is why.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> But I would like to tell them

that   the  people  do  not  care  whether  we   are

nationalists, socialists or Communists.  The  people

will  fight  against  those - as I  said  before -   who

exploit   them,   whether   they   are   Communists,

socialists, colonialists or anybody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to advise them not to call

those people who oppose the P.A.P. as Communists  or

Communist stooges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the election, the P.A.P. classified the

political    forces   of   Singapore    into    five

categories - Communists, Socialist Left, Lunatic Left,

Right-wing opportunists, and colonialists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Which one are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Now we see the Prime Minister

accusing those whom he once called the Lunatic  Left

as  Communists  and  the real Communists  completely

disappeared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion - this is very important - the

Malaysia  Plan  is  a plot and a conspiracy  of  the

British   colonialists  to  suppress  the   national

liberation movement in South-East Asia.

Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime Minster on the 25th

of  this  month  moved this motion on  the  Malaysia

Plan,  he  gave  this  House   - and  his  speech  was

reported  in  the newspapers and was broadcast  over

the radio  - such special phrases: "Communists",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



"Communist  open  front workers and  organisations",

"Communist  manipulators to establish  international

Communism   and  to  exercise  Communist   control".

"Communists  in the veil of democracy",  "the  armed

struggle  directed by foreigners", "the  people  and

the  masses mean Communists", "peace-loving and love

for  democracy  are also the special characteristics

of  the  Communists", and "the Barisan  Sosialis  is

being controlled by the P.K.I."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all such phrases have only been

used  this  year. They were not used last  year.  In

fact,  under the Rendel Constitution, the people  of

Singapore  had  also been treated  to  such  phrases

which  were  used on those P.A.P. members  who  were

then  with  the workers and students. What  was  the

result?  The Government of the Member for  Cairnhill

collapsed.  One of his colleagues went  to  Ipoh  to

open   up  a  mine.  The  colonial  government  also

resorted  to  such  tactics  against  the  so-called

Communist. Such Communist phrases were also used  on

the people under colonial rule. What was the result?

The  colonial rulers had to withdraw and succumb  to

the anti-colonial forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when such phrases as Communism

are  used on the people, it is a sign of the  ruling

class  being  in  a  desperate position.  When  such

Communist phrases are used on the people, it is also

the  time  when  the  rulers are doing  things  like

selling out Singapore, which cannot be told  to  the

people. These facts can easily be traced in history.

Furthermore, we have seen the collapse of the former

Government.  At the present moment, we can  see  the

P.A.P. is adopting all ways and means to bring about

special arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister, the Minister

for  Culture, the Minister for Finance, the Minister

for   Home   Affairs  and  other  Members   in   the

Government, including   some   Members   in    the

Opposition, have all accused the Barisan Sosialis as

being  an  open front organisation of the Communists

or as stooges of the Communists. This allegation was

also made by the former Chief Minister of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



the former Government on the people in the P.A.P. At

that  time,  the Prime Minister spoke in defence  of

the  P.A.P. and of himself. He also defended Mr Lim

Ching  Siong and his colleagues. He very  forcefully

attacked  the then Government for using such  means.

This  took  place only four years ago.  The  present

Prime Minister is using the same tactics which  were

used  by  the  former  Chief  Minister  against  his

political  opponents. He has also put on  the  dirty

gloves of the former Chief Minister to carry out his

attack on his opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while debating this Malaysia

plan,  why  should the P.A.P. Government  especially

shout  "Communist"?  What is  the  aim  and  meaning

behind  it?  Is it a target against the  Communists?

Are they treating the Communists as their target  of

attack? I feel that I have a responsibility  to  let

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, and the people in  Malaysia

and  Singapore  understand the whole situation.  The

answer  to  those questions is that  the  P.A.P. is

shouting  communist slogans to suppress the  freedom

of speech of the people and to confuse the vision of

the  people  in  order to achieve its own  political

ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to go further and

give  a  clearer answer. No matter what  phrases  or

what  amendments  we put forward  to  this  Malaysia

motion,  such  as  the deletion  of  the  words  "in

principle",  "plan", and the insertion of  the  word

"motion", no matter what we do about the phraseology

of  the motion, our position remains the same.  Even

if  Singapore is included in the Malaysia Plan,  its

position will be the same as that envisaged  in  the

proposals  contained in Paper Cmd.  33  of  1961.  I

would like to make some motion of the correspondence

contained in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister of Singapore sent a letter to the Prime Minister of the Federation on 11th November, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You will recall that in our discussions on the constitutional

framework to effect  the  merger  of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya in  the  new

Federation of Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



we  agreed upon a memorandum which contains  several

heads  of  agreement, including  State  and  Federal

responsibilities...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day the Prime Minister of the

Federation  replied to our Prime  Minister.  In  the Tunku's reply, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to your letter of 11th November, 1961 ... you wrote as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will recall that in our discussions on the

constitutional  framework to effect  the  merger  of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya in  the  new

Federation  of Malaysia we agreed upon a  memorandum

which contains several heads of agreement, including

State    and   Federal   responsibilities,   whereby

Singapore  will retain responsibility over Education

and  Labour  and  enjoy local  autonomy  in  certain

agreed matters as set out therein, without prejudice

to the basic principle that there should be a strong

Central Government for the Federation of Malaysia as

a whole.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see clearly from this

memorandum  and letter that in the Greater  Malaysia

Plan,  i.e. the  Federation of Malaysia,  Singapore

must  go in according to the conditions set  out  in

this letter. Mr Speaker, Sir, under such a Malaysia

Plan,  what  can  Singapore citizens get?  Singapore

citizens will get no more than what is contained  in

the  White Paper. In this White Paper, firstly,  the

600,000-odd   citizens   of   Singapore   will   not

automatically  become citizens of the Federation  of

Malaysia.   They  will  only  become  nationals   of

Malaysia,  which is of no practical  use.  Secondly,

Singapore must hand over $100 million to the Central

Government  of the Federation of Malaysia.  Thirdly,

autonomy  in labour is not safe-guarded because  the

Tunku  has  just  said that after  merger  with  the

Federation,  they  will  properly  deal   with   the

industrial  disputes in Singapore. So the  so-called

autonomy  in labour is nothing but nought. Fourthly,

similar  arguments can be applied to  the  so-called

autonomy   in   education  because  the   Federation

Government  will  be able to deal  with  educational

problems  in  the  way it wishes to  do  in  labour.

Fifthly,  economically  the  Central  Government  of

Greater  Malaysia  has  the last  say  in  financial

arrangements. Sixthly, Singapore citizens  will  not

be  able to enjoy equal rights as those citizens  in

Greater  Malaysia.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,

whether you have a merger between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and the Federation, or whether you have  a

Greater  Malaysia, Singapore citizens will  get  the

same - half a pound or 8 ounces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although the White Paper on

merger  has been passed by this House, it  does  not

mean  that  there  is no dissatisfaction  among  the

people.   Even  if  the  Government  were   to   use

propaganda media like the newspapers and  the  radio

to  deceive  the people, and to try to cajole  their

brains  in order to resort to all sorts of means  so

that  they  could control the freedom of speech  and

expression  of the people, they would finally  fail.

And  because they know that the people have  decided

to    oppose    all   retrogressive   constitutional

arrangements,  a national referendum will  give  the

people  an  opportunity to make their own  decision.

But the P.A.P. Government are very clever. They have

decided  to shelve the National Referendum Bill  for

the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of the debate on

the  present motion these past few days,  ths  House

has heard many of these so-called Communist phrases.

Such phrases also appear in the speeches reported in

the newspapers, as though the speakers are heroes of

anti-Communism.  It  is  the  aim  of   the   P.A.P.

Government to use the term "Communism" to divert the

attention  of  the  people  and  to  suppress  their

expression of discontent against the Government. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is because the P.A.P. Government

has  made  the  allegation that only those  who  are

Communists  are  opposed to Greater Malaysia.  Under

such  circumstances, the Barisan Sosialis have  been

branded  as  an  open  front  organisation  of   the

Communists  and  a  stooge of the  Communists.  Some

people  have  been branded as Communists;  even  the

word "masses" has been described as Communistic.  So

their argument is that all those who are opposed  to

the    Greater   Malaysia   Plan   are   Communists,

irrespective  of whether they are citizens  or  not.

The  people  of Sarawak are opposed to  the  Greater

Malaysia  Plan, and so, according to their argument,

the  Government can call them Communists. The people

of Brunei are also opposed to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



Greater Malaysia Plan. So the Government brand  them

as  Communists. In short, all those who are  opposed

to the Greater Malaysia Plan are Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this series of propaganda

moves,  who have the guts to speak their own  minds?

Civic  organisations  do not  have  the  courage  to

express  their  own  views.  The  Singapore  Chinese

Chamber  of Commerce will not hold another forum  on

Greater Malaysia. Will the workers, the farmers, the

hawkers,  the merchants, the teachers, the students,

etc, have the guts to express their disagreement? If

you  should,  in  the dark, express any disagreement,

you  will also be called a Communist. So in this way

the  P.A.P.  Government will be able to  divert  the

attention  of  the people so that they could  easily

push  forward  the Malaysia Plan. Under  very  high-sounding  names, they are trying to push  through  a

merger   between   Singapore  and  the   Federation.

Finally, the P.A.P. has an aim to achieve, but it is

after the attainment of this aim that the livelihood

of the people will be uncertain and in danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when a quack doctor tells you

that  you are suffering from a serious disease, that

is  the  time  when  he  tries  to  sell  you  quack

medicine. When a pickpocket touches your body,  that

is the time when you will miss your purse or wallet.

When  the  P.A.P.  Government shouts  that  all  the

streets  in  Singapore are full of Communists,  well

that  is exactly the time when the P.A.P. is  facing

political bankruptcy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the people of Singapore will be able

to increase their own vigilance. Otherwise they will

not  be  able to see through the sinister moves  and

words  of  the  P.A.P.  The  people  should  not  be

intimidated  by  threats and the propaganda  of  the

P.A.P. Then they will not fall into the trap of  the  P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we the Barisan Sosialis were

to  support this motion on Greater Malaysia, then it

would be tantamount to accepting the White Paper  on

merger.  We do not want to see the basic  rights  of

the  people of Singapore being reduced. We  are  not

afraid of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



being branded as Communists by the leadership of the

P.A.P.  We  will not be coerced into accepting  this

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we want to be friends with the people. We do not like to be the public enemy of the people. Neither do we want to be traitors to socialism. Mr Speaker, Sir, as long as it is in the interest of the people, we, in the Barisan Sosialis, will struggle and fight to the bitter end. I would like

to tell the Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance

and  the  Minister for Culture that  the  people  in

Malaysia  have  seen through their game  in  dealing

with  the  Communists. As far as we  are  concerned,

these tactics are not new.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the so-called non-Communist

socialist  P.A.P. is  at  present  becoming   anti-Communist.  They  are progressively  and  positively

anti-Communist. It is definite. There is no point in

our  arguing  over this. When a political  Party  is

facing bankruptcy in its political philosophy,  then

its  political  arguments  will  be  illogical.  The

P.A.P. says, on the one hand, that we, the  Barisan

Sosialis, are the Dutchmen. On the other hand,  they

say that the Barisan Sosialis are connected with the

P.K.I.  So  if  we  carry  this  argument  one  step

further, then the P.K.I. are the Dutch and the Dutch

are also the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can you say that such an argument

of  the  P.A.P. is rational? I will  say  no.  Even

primary school students will agree with me. And  so,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, our proper and correct conclusion

is  that  the  Barisan Sosialis are not  Communists.

Neither are the Barisan Sosialis Dutch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Government under the

Member  for Cairnhill was about to collapse, one  of

his  colleagues, Chew Swee Kee, accused the students

of  being  Communist for using the word "Hsueh-hsih"

in  Mandarin, which means study. Now the P.A.P. are

using  the same tactics. They are saying that  those

who  use  words like "cho tse" meaning to  organise;

"ren  ming",  meaning people; "chin  chung"  meaning

masses; are Communists. They say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



all  such  terms  are  typical  of  the  Communists.

According to this logic, then the Minister for  Home

Affairs,  who  is  the Organising Secretary  of  the

P.A.P.,  should also be a Communist because "people"

is  being used in the name of the P.A.P. Can we  say

then  that  the  P.A.P. is also  Communist?  In  the

P.A.P. there  is a Board of People's Work.  Can  we

call this organisation a Communist organisation? The

Ministry   of  Culture  has  published  a   pamphlet

entitled  "Peaceful revolution". Can  we  also  call

this  a  Communist  revolution?  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

yesterday,  I  went to the library of this  Assembly

and    looked   up   all   the   dictionaries    and

encyclopaedia.  But  I  was  unable  to  find  which

definitions  are  monopolised by the  Communists.  I

would  like  to suggest to the Minister for  Culture

that he should direct the Minister for Education  to

stop  all  the schools from using terms  which  they

call Communistic. Otherwise all the students of  the

various races will be termed Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ordinarily any talk on economics

should  have been made by the Minister for  Finance.

But  when  we  were debating the motion  on  Greater

Malaysia,  the  economic aspects of this  plan  were

touched  upon  at great length by the  Minister  for

Culture.  He  said  that after  the  realisation  of

Malaysia  the five territories would enjoy  economic

prosperity and the livelihood of the people would be

improved.  The Minister for Culture also  talked  at

great length on the activities of the Communists. We

can  see  very  clearly from this that the  economic

theories  of  the Minister for Culture cannot  stand

refutation. No wonder the Minister for Finance  dare

not  say  anything on that. The Minister for Culture

was  only  trying to draw a picture of a cake  on  a

piece  of  paper and telling the people of the  five

territories  that  they can  eat  it.  He  was  thus

thinking these people would be fooled and trapped by

his intriques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the speech made by the

Minister  for  Culture, he touched on  the  economic

benefits of Malaysia. The most salient point in  his

speech  is  that only when the five territories  are

merged together will there be economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



stability.  If the five territories were independent

of one another, then there would have to be separate

currencies.  There  would  have  to  be  a  separate

economic system which would be competing against one

another.  Moreover, without a reunification  of  the

five   territories,   there   could   not   be   any

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the extent of economic

stability,   judging  from  the   present   economic

situation  of the five territories, does not  depend

on  the  size of the territories but on the internal

resources  of  each  territory.  Economic  stability

depends  on prices and also on international  supply

and demand. If the prices of tin and rubber were  to

decrease day after day, does it mean that after  the

merger   of   the  five  territories  the   economic

situation would be better?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the five territories have

merged  together to form one nation,  does  it  mean

that  the  five  territories should have  a  unified

currency   system  before  we  can   have   economic

stability  and prosperity? I do not agree with  this

view.  The  most important thing, when  speaking  on

these   economic   problems,  is  this.   The   five

territories  were  once controlled  by  the  British

colonialists.  When  they become  independent,  they

could   also   become   members   of   the   British

Commonwealth, and in the British Commonwealth  there

is   one  economic  system.  Different  systems   of

currency   are   not  a  decisive  factor   in   the

determination of the economic stability of the  five

territories.   After  these  five  territories   are

independent,  they  can form  a  common  market  and

resolve all these economic problems. We can learn  a

lesson  from the present European Common Market.  We

can find examples in their system. For instance, the

franc  is  used by the French; the mark is  used  by

West  Germany,  and the peso is used by  Italy.  All

these  different forms of currency are used  by  the

Common  Market countries. When in future the  United

Kingdom  also joins the Common Market,  the  British

pound  will also be One of the currencies used.  The

currencies used in these Common Market countries are

all different. But in spite of that, they can form a

common market. This goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



to  show  that currency is not a decisive factor  in

economic  stability.  After  all,  the  five  Common

Market    countries   have   their   own   different

currencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the talks and disclosures by the

Federation Government on the White Paper on  merger,

we  know that even after the realisation of Malaysia

there  would still be the necessity to have a common

market.  This common market would form  an  economic

link among the five territories. Therefore, from all

this,  you can see that the arrangements as proposed

in  the  Malaysia Plan cannot benefit the people  of

the  five  territories. The Malaysia plan  does  not

provide  for  either constitutional  advancement  or

economic  improvement.  Therefore,  based  on  these

facts, I oppose this motion on Malaysia.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, today we discuss the motion moved  by

the  Prime Minister, namely, the motion on Malaysia.

When he was moving this motion, I had the impression

that those who sing the praises of Malaysia are  the

P.A.P. leadership. Their voices,  among  those  who

shout  Malaysia, are raised very high. But the  tune

is  wrong.  After listening to their  tune  we  feel

uncomfortable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why is the P.A.P. leadership so

anxious  to  sell this Malaysia Plan to the  people?

Why  are  the P.A.P. leaders so anxious to want  the

people  to agree to their plan? The reason  is  very

simple  and  obvious to all. That is to  say,  among

those who are in power in the five territories,  the

most   unstable   and  shaky  one  is   the   P.A.P.

Government. Therefore, the P.A.P. leadership  dreams

that   through  the  Malaysia  Plan,  their   merger

proposals will be realised. They are depending  upon

the  colonial and reactionary forces to suppress the

Left-wing  movement so as to ensure that  they  will

stay in power. This is why the P.A.P. leadership  is

so eager to launch the Malaysia Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people in Singapore think

that  this  Malaysia  Plan, as moved  by  the  Prime

Minister,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



is  a  P.A.P. double-cross merger. My colleague  has

already spoken on this aspect. The Prime Minister of

the  Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul  Rahman,  has

frankly  told us this, that merger between Singapore

and  the  Federation is part of the  Malaysia  Plan.

Since  the Malaysia Plan is a P.A.P. type of  merger

proposal,  therefore, if we support  this  plan,  it

means  that we agree to the P.A.P. type of  sell-out

merger  proposals.  That  is  to  say,  we  will  be

agreeing  to the betrayal of the interests  and  the

loss   of   equal   citizenship  and   proportionate

representation  of the people of  Singapore  in  the

Federal Parliament. [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  although  we  admit we  are  but  students  of

politics,  nevertheless, we have no  need  of  their

assistance.  We will learn from the people,  but  we

will not learn from the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what will be the position of the

people of Singapore in the Malaysia Plan as proposed

by  our  Prime Minister? Will Singapore citizens  be

able  to enjoy equal treatment in the Federation  of

Malaysia? This is a very important question, and  we

will  give  a positive answer. The answer  is  "no".

This  is because Tunku Abdul Rahman has already said

that  Singapore will only go in as a partner in  the

merger, that is to say. Singapore cannot go in as an

equal brother in the Malaysia Plan. It is only as  a

partner who follows other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as representatives of the

people, what we are concerned about are their hopes,

aspirations and interests. We will support  anything

which is in the interests of the people. But we will

firmly oppose anything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



which  is  contrary to their interests. Whether  the

colonialists like it or not, whether the  Federation

Government  is  satisfied or not,  and  whether  the

P.A.P. leadership cries or laughs all this does  not

concern us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to express my regret that

when  the  P.A.P. leadership spoke on  this  motion,

they seemed to forget that they were elected by  the

people.  They did not speak on behalf of the people.

They seemed to speak for the reactionary Right,  the

reactionary Government of the Federation of  Malaya.

They seemed to represent the British Colonial Office

or   S.E.A.T.O. countries  and  the  anti-Communist

experts,  because the content of their speeches  had

only one central point, i.e., anti-Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the speeches made by the

Government Ministers have turned this motion into an

anti-Communist motion. The people of Singapore  will

feel  strange about this. Why should one who insists

on  a  non-Communist line as the  P.A.P.  Government

has,  now  shout  the  anti-Communist  slogan?  Even

people  like  Chew  Swee  Kee  and  the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  who are the most ardent anti-Communists,

will  admit that they are inferior to the P.A.P. in

the    matter   of   anti-Communism.   The    P.A.P.

leadership's anti-Communist drama and the song  they

sing  about  anti-Communism are appreciated  by  the

S.E.A.T.O. countries  and the  colonialist  forces.

These countries will admire their behaviour and will

treat them as their cherished child. But in the eyes

of  the  people  of  Singapore,  the  P.A.P.,  which

neglects  the  interests of the  people,  should  be

treated as clowns, owls, or crows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leaders cannot

advance arguments to refute the stand of the Barisan

Sosialis on the question of Malaysia or merger.  Nor

can they find reason and arguments to cover up their

so-called  merger  proposals and the  Malaysia  Plan

which  are not beneficial to the people. They cannot

cover  up  all this. Therefore, in their desperation

and isolation, they try to distract the attention of

the people by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



using the word "Communist" to threaten them. We  can

see  all  this very clearly. When the Prime Minister

moved  his  motion on Malaysia, we, who are  in  the

Assembly,  have seen a booklet written by the  Prime

Minister "The Battle for Merger."

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  interesting part of it is that when  this

House  was  debating this question,  the  Government

Benches and their leaders had no theoretical  basis.

They  were always using the article written  by  Mr

Alex  Josey.  They seemed to treat this  as  a  very

valuable thing to attack the Barisan Sosialis  with.

I feel sorry for them because they themselves cannot

advance any arguments to support their Malaysia Plan

but   have  to  turn  to  the  pro-colonial  English

newspaper  to seek inspiration for their theoretical

basis.  All  this  exposes their bankruptcy  in  the

matter  of  theory.  It  also  exposes  their   pro-colonialist faces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our stand on Malaysia is based

on  the people's interests. Does the party in  power

want  to save themselves by handing out the  hat  of

Communism to put on the heads of the people,  so  as

to  threaten and silence them? Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

also want to refer to what have been uttered by  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs and other Ministers  not

only   in  this  Assembly,  but  outside  as   well.

[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest to the Ministers on

the  Front  Bench to pause awhile. Let  the  Speaker

have  an opportunity of hearing what is being  said.

Then, if they have to pass a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



comment in jest, I might allow them to do that.  But

give the Speaker a chance.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  they  want to silence the people in  order  to

carry  out  their plan which is detrimental  to  the

interest   of  the  people.  One  who  indulges   in

arguments cannot always profess to speak the  truth.

Intimidation cannot always achieve its purpose.  Our

stand and our actions have always been based on  the

interest  and  welfare  of the  people  and  we  act

accordingly. Since the motion on Malaysia means  the

P.A.P. type of merger, we will therefore  not  fall

into  the  trap of the Party in power.  Therefore  I

oppose this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here let me touch on a few points which have been

raised  by  the Prime Minister who unfortunately  is

not here now. These points have been reported in the

local  Sin  Chew lit Poh of 25th January,  1962,  at

page 1. The Prime Minister said that the Assemblymen

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis used  to  say  that  they

supported  the concept of Malaysia. It is true  that

we of the Barisan Sosialis have said that we support

the  principle of merger and Malaysia, but  it  does

not  mean that we support the P.A.P. type of  merger

and  Malaysia. Therefore, I want the Prime  Minister

to understand this point clearly. He must not try to

be  too  clever and imagine that when people support

the  principle  of  merger and  Malaysia,  they  are

supporting the P.A.P. type of merger and Malaysia. I

hope  he  will  not distort facts and  the  people's

ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. The Prime Minister said

that  on  any  question - whether it is a question  of

West  Irian or Malaysia - the P.A.P. has no difficulty

as to its firm stand. But it could be very difficult

for  the  Barisan Sosialis as they do not mean  what

they  say.  I think the anti-colonial stand  of  the

P.A.P. is  not true, because, if it were  so,  then

they  must  let the people know the details  of  the

plan  and  they  should not keep everything  in  the

dark.  If  their stand is in line with the stand  of

the people, they need not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



to  carry  out  surreptitiously their  own  type  of

merger and Malaysia, to smear or threaten people and

to  adopt other mean tactics. They need not have  to

do  such things if their stand is on the side of the

people.  On the other hand, the stand of the Barisan

Sosialis  can stand any test inside or outside  this

House  at  mass  rallies attended  by  thousands  of

people. Our stand is as firm as a mountain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the people of Singapore

can   remember  that  last  year  the  P.A.P. found

themselves in a very embarrassing position when  the

question  of  merger  between  Singapore   and   the

Federation  of  Malaya was debated  in  this  House.

During  the  debate,  they  could  only  resort   to

laughter  and  mimicry in order to divert  attention

and to cover up their own failings. They managed  to

go  through  the  course  of  debate  on  merger  by

adopting such antics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. Recently when we debated

the West Irian issue, the P.A.P. leadership were not

sure  of their stand on that motion. They also found

themselves in a very embarrassing position when they

spoke on it. I would not like to dwell any longer on

this point. From all these facts, we can see who  is

on the side of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel most dissatisfied with

the  mean  and fantastic way the P.A.P. referred  to

the three women who signed up as volunteers to fight

for  the  liberation of West Irian. They  said  that

these three women were Barisan Sosialis members  and

they  were instigated to volunteer. But we have  now

found  out that they are not members of the  Barisan

Sosialis. I think the three women have been  greatly

insulted by the P.A.P. I do not think I should speak

in  defence  of these three women as I do  not  know

them  personally. In short, I would like to say that

their  action  in  signing up as volunteers  is  not

something  shameful. I think the  P.A.P. leadership

cannot deny this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point with which I am dissatisfied is

that -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Lady has made

her  point.  She  cannot go any  further  than  that

because we are on Malaysia now. She has already made

her point. Let us not debate it.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  only want to point out that it is not  true

for  the  P.A.P. to say that the  three  women  who

volunteered  were  instigated by  someone  else.  In

making  such  an  accusation,  the  P.A.P. want  to

discourage the people from volunteering.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Lady is very

interested  in these three ladies, I think  she  can

file  notice of a motion. Then we can have a  debate

on  it.  I am trying to indicate to the Member  that

she  has made her point. She has said that these are

tactics which she considers are not fair and it must

end there. But she cannot now debate why these three

women  volunteered, as to how they came to volunteer

and so on. The point has been made.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I accept your ruling. I will not touch on that

subject any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that 1962 will be a memorable year for South-East Asia because of the West Irian issue and Malaysia. He said he wanted to wait to see what the Barisan Sosialis wanted to say on that. I think he wanted us to express our stand on that. I would like to tell the Prime Minister something, but unfortunately he is not here now. Our

stand is very simple. We can frankly and openly  say

that we the Barisan Sosialis are entirely opposed to

the dirty motion moved by the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The translation that came

through was that the motion was "dirty". If that  is

so,  then  that is an unparliamentary  word  to  use

about  a  motion which is being moved quite lawfully

in  this Assembly. It is, of course, a reflection on

the Prime Minister. That word must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The translation

is  correct.  I did say so. I beg leave to  withdraw

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Lady, by that

comment,  meant that she knew that the word  "dirty"

was  unparliamentary and should not have  been  used

then she should go further and apologise, if not  to

the Prime Minister, at least to the House and to the

Speaker   for   using   an   unparliamentary    word

deliberately.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  did  not know that that word could  not  be

used.  That was why later on I told you that I would

like to withdraw such a remark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I want to tell the Prime

Minister is that not only in this House, but outside

I  will  expose him to the people of Singapore.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I oppose the motion moved by the Prime

Minister.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malaysia motion

today  has  been debated for several  days  in  this

House.  In the course of the debate, apart from  the

Barisan  Sosialis  Members, the Members  from  other

Parties  have  on principle supported  this  motion.

They  have clearly dealt with this motion, and I  do

not  like  to  repeat them. But there is  one  point

which  I  would like to raise and which has not  yet

been touched upon by other speakers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, we all know that for the

formation  of  a  country and a merger  between  two

countries,  you  must have as pre-requisites  common

conditions    geographically,    politically     and

economically, without which there would not  be  any

merger  at all. Today Malaysia, which is to comprise

five  territories, satisfy these common  conditions.

My  colleagues  have already given  explanations  in

this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whatever you do there are always

two sides to it. It may be very good but some people

may  say  it is bad. A thing which is extremely  bad

may also be described by others as good. Now, in the

course  of debating this motion, we can see  clearly

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



point  of  my  logic.  For example,  brightness  has

always  been extolled but some people are afraid  of

brightness  and light. Darkness is always  described

as  a bad thing and cursed by many, but some people,

who  prefer to lead a nocturnal life, seem  to  like

darkness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after this motion was moved, I

had  a feeling that the Barisan Sosialis might bring

up  very  good theories to argue their way out.  But

unfortunately  it is disappointing  that  they  have

nothing  new  to offer. All they have said  is  just

playing the same old tune. They are frying the  cold

rice  which is burning from brown to black.  So  the

rice in this condition will not whet the appetite of

the other Members in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Barisan Sosialis always make the

accusation that we are against the people  and  that

we  are always making use of the people's name to do

bad  things.  I  would like to say that  we  have  a

mandate from the people and that whatever we  do  is

in  accordance with the mandate given by  them.  The

people  have given us that mandate in the hope  that

we  will  be  able to bring them a better  life  and

greater  prosperity. In giving us their  mandate  in

the course of elections they did expect us to forget

our  promises.  The people do not  want  us  to  say

something  and do another thing. This  is  the  last

thing  that they want us to do. But this is  exactly

what the Barisan Sosialis are doing at present. They

say  something  which they do not mean.  After  this

long  debate is concluded and historically recorded,

it will be seen who is right and who is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that as far as human

beings  are concerned, the mouth is always used  for

one's  own  good, the eyes are used  for  one's  own

observation  and to see other people's shortcomings.

But  fortunately among human beings  there  are  few

people who are like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe, and I think the

majority  of  the  Members in this House  will  also

agree with me, that in the past few days it has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



pointed  out clearly that any right-thinking  person

who is loyal to his country will undoubtedly support

the concept of Malaysia. I would like to stress here

why we should support this concept of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From newspaper reports we can see clearly that the

development of the recent world is such that we must

group  together. In the United Nations  Organisation

there  are three blocs. There is first the  Western-bloc  which  represents the political  influence  of

colonialism.  The  second bloc  comprises  countries

from  the  Middle East, which are representative  of

the  neutral  bloc; this also includes countries  in

Afro-Asia. In the third bloc, you have the Communist

political force. From the passage of history we  can

see  that  any political influence or any  political

ideologies   cannot  get  away  from   these   three

classifications. It is from these classifications of

political  forces that we can see that the countries

in  Eastern Europe are trying to conquer and destroy

countries   in  Western  Europe,  and  vice   versa.

Fortunately, a third World War is unlikely  to  take

place  for the time being at least because there  is

the  neutral  bloc.  Here I would  like  to  pay  my

tribute  to  the  leaders of the neutral  countries,

especially  to Nehru, in the cold war.  The  neutral

bloc  acts  as a balancing agent, and if  it  should

either  lean to the West or to the East, then  there

is  every likelihood of a Third World War. When  the

West  and the East are putting forward great efforts

in  the advancement of nuclear weapons, we will know

all  the better that when these two blocs know  that

when either of them are in a position to destroy the

other, they will have to regard the other bloc as an

enemy. So for these reasons the great powers of  the

East  and  the West are trying to race against  each

other  in, producing nuclear weapons. The effort  in

nuclear armament is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Parliamentary

Secretary will please come back to the motion. He is

talking  about  nuclear  wars.  I  do  not  see  how

Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



comes in at the moment. He has spent ten minutes  in

his exordium talking about something which seems  to

me - I may be wrong - completely far away from Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have to

illustrate to show my points on Malaysia and also to

show the reasons why we support the Malaysia Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned the three blocs, in the

United  Nations.  Now  I  would  like  to  touch  on

Malaysia.   This  is  also  the  stand  of   neutral

countries.  It is for the well-being of  our  future

nation  and in the interest of our people.  This  is

something  which  will  not let  us  fall  into  any

political  cold war among the blocs.  Malaysia  will

also contribute to the strength of neutral countries

and  thus benefit all. Malaysia is going to  improve

our lot in this direction. We are trying our best to

fight  for a sound foundation for Malaysia. That  is

to  say, we must fight to lay a good foundation  for

Malaysia  in  order that our future  generation  may

have  something  good.  Our  efforts  and  work  are

necessary   at  this  stage  in  order  to   achieve

Malaysia. It is because of this reason that I  fully

support the motion moved by our colleague, the Prime

move  on the chess-board. They have lost the  battle

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we can tell them today

that socialist movements in the five territories are

heading  in  the direction of solidarity.  The  true

socialist Parties are today gathering in the capital

of  the  Federation of Malaya to  discuss  the  task

facing  them  at  the  present juncture.  They  will

especially attack relentlessly the pseudo socialists

at this meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, the P.A.P. Government has

moved the present motion in this House. Outside this

House  the  P.A.P. is holding a Malaysia  Week.  All

this   is  being  done  in  order  to  deceive   the

representatives of the three Borneo territories into

believing  that  the  people of Singapore  are  very

enthusiastic about the Malaysia Plan. As a matter of

fact, in order to assess the true stand and attitude

of  the  people  in Singapore towards  the  Malaysia

Plan,  it  is not enough just to put up posters  and

banners all over the city. The P.A.P. Government is,

at  this  juncture, trying to put  up  a  show.  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that when you come to

this  office, you must have seen all the decorations

in  red  on the way. So many colourful posters  have

been  put  up in conjunction with the motion  before

this  House. This is the show bring put  up  by  the

P.A.P. on  the eve of the meeting .of the  Malaysia

Solidarity  Consultative Committee. They  have  also

the  so-called Malaysia Week. This again is  only  a

show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is an example of how

the P.A.P. is making use of public funds for its own

political  propaganda. Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we

can  find on these posters words which do not really

express the views of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



people  in Singapore. There appear on these  posters

such  words as "True independence through Malaysia";

"Malaysia,  peace  and  prosperity  for  10  million

people".  Lastly,  you can find on  one  poster  the

following words, "Long live Malaysia."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has not

consulted  the people of Singapore on this  Malaysia

Plan.  Can  it  really  mean  that  the  people   of

Singapore  are in support of it? This  is  a  matter

which   concerns   the  constitutional   future   of

Singapore. The P.A.P. has not been given  the  final

mandate by the people. Under such circumstances, how

can the Ministry of Culture make use of public funds

to  put  up all sorts of posters containing  slogans

such as "Independence through Malaysia"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Chairman, the Member

for  Queenstown, has in his speech a  few  days  ago

exposed  this  Malaysia Plan for  what  it  is.  The

Chairman  of our Party has also expressed our  stand

and  attitude on Malaysia. I do not, therefore, wish

to  waste  the time of this House by repeating  what

has  already been said. However. Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  have one thing to tell you at this  moment.

That  is, the leaders of the P.A.P., especially  the

Big  Three of the P.A.P., are just like ants in  the

hot  pan.  They  are very anxious. They  are  trying

their  utmost best to resort to all the  tactics  of

salesmanship to sell a false thing - a thing which  is

not  welcomed  by  the  people.  Ths  thing  is  the

Malaysia Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will remember that

last  Friday,  the  Minister  for  Culture  made  an

announcement in the local newspapers about the  plan

to hold a National Language Week. In this news item,

it was stated by the Ministry of Culture that during

the  National Language Week the Government will hold

exhibitions,  forums, etc. But, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  it  is  indeed very strange that in  just  one

night,  in  the course of just 24 hours,  their  so-called   National   Language   Week   should    have

disappeared!  On Saturday, the next  morning,  there

appeared    in   the   local   newspapers    another

announcement of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



the  Ministry of Culture which changed the  National

Language  Week  into  a Malaysia  Week.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, from this behaviour of the Ministry of

Culture,  we can see very clearly that the  Minister

for  Culture is not sincere when he talks about  the

promotion  of the cultures of the various races  and

the  promotion of the national language. Just in the

course  of one night the National Language Week  was

turned  into Malaysia Week. From this again  we  can

see  that Malaysia Week has some selfish meaning  in

it.  Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, in the world of today,

there  has  not been any government which  has  done

such an irresponsible thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the wavering

behaviour  of  the  P.A.P. Government,  we  can  see

clearly  that  the P.A.P. leaders are not  concerned

with the cultures of the various races. Neither  are

they  concerned  with the interest  of  the  various

races. What they are concerned with is how they can,

through  all  sorts of tactics and  magic,  preserve

their  own power. They are very interested in making

arrangements  for a phoney merger.  They  work  very

hard to strike the gong.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It has been stated in this

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. The P.A.P. are  trying  their

best   to  strike  the  gong  to  sell  their  quack

medicine,  which is the Malaysia Plan and  which  is

also  intended to prolong their political  life.  If

they  are successful in carrying through this  Plan,

then  the Minister for Culture will be able to  have

opportunities  to speak in this House.  He  will  be

able to say how anti-Communistic he has been and how

he  has  defended  the colonialists,  especially  in

regard to their interests. After this plan, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Finance will again be able  to  go  to

Thailand to play golf. Then he will also be able  to

talk about the 4th round, the 8th round and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the

principles  of  democracy, any matter that  concerns

the  nation  must  be put to the  people  for  their

views. Therefore, on this question of Malaysia,  the

P.A.P. leaders  should  not  act  in  an  arbitrary

manner.  The  P.A.P.'s only duty is to  consult  the

people,  especially those in the  five  territories,

and get their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister and

the  Minister  for  Culture  have  been  to  Kuching

recently.  They themselves should know what  is  the

reaction of the peoples in Brunei and Sarawak to the

Greater Malaysia Plan. Do they hold similar views to

those of the P.A.P.? Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the

P.A.P. want to talk about democracy and pay heed  to

the  views  of  the people, then their leaders  must

also  consider  the  views of the  Party  Rakyat  in

Brunei,  because this Party represents one-third  of

the  population  there.  It  is  a  Party  which  is

sufficient  to  represent the views  of  the  Brunei

people-  at  least, the majority  of  them.  In  the

meantime, the P.A.P. must also pay attention to  the

Sarawak United People's Party n regard to its  stand

on  Malaysia,  because the S.U.P.P. is  one  of  the

great  Parties in Sarawak. What about  the  attitude

and  reaction  of the people in North Borneo?  Well,

leaders  of  the P.A.P. may well go to the  Special

Branch  to  find  the  answer.  This  is  interesting

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the Minister for Home Affairs said

that  the Chairman of Party Rakyat in the Federation

was also supporting the Malaysia Plan. This is again

incorrect. The Minister for Home Affairs was quoting

out of context. The Minister for Home Affairs should

ask officials in the Special Branch to give him "The

Torch",  party organ of the Socialist Front  in  the

Federation, in which is contained an article written

by  Mr  Boestamam. Then, after reading this article

he will know that he has made a mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the speeches given

by the P.A.P. Ministers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



we  can  see  that  apart from talking  about  anti-Communists,  they  have no new  material  for  their

propaganda.  What  a  pathetic  sight!  Mr   Deputy

Speaker, Sir, as a socialist worker, what I  am  con

cerned  with is the livelihood of the broad  masses.

The  objectives  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  are  to

protect  the  democratic rights of  the  people.  If

there is any motion which is in the interests of the

people, then I shall support it wholeheartedly. But,

on  the  other hand, if there is anything  which  is

against  the  will of the people and detrimental  to

the  democratic rights of the people, then  I  shall

oppose  it.  We  all know that this  motion  on  the

Greater Malaysia Plan is not only detrimental to the

interests  of  the  people  of  Singapore  but  also

detrimental  to  the strength of  the  anti-colonial

forces  in  the three territories. So I am  opposing

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if my memory serves me

right, the Minister for Culture said yesterday  that

we  in  the  Barisan Sosialis were  opposed  to  ths

motion  because we were Communist followers.  But  I

would  like to ask: if the Communists eat bread  and

we  should also eat bread, can you say that  we  are

also Communists? Now, as regards sleep; if we should

sleep  as the Communists do, are we also Communists?

This kind of argument is simply incredible. The main

task ahead of us is the people's interest. There  is

no   point   in  talking  about  Communists,   anti-Communists and non-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before the Greater

Malaysia  concept is realised, we should  understand

the life and conditions of the peoples in these five

territories.  Take, for example, Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya. In Singapore we have  our  own

citizenship. Singapore citizens can elect their  own

representatives.  The  same  can  be  said  of   the

Federation   of  Malaya.  Regarding   the   policies

governing   immigration,  the  people  of  Singapore

cannot go freely to North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei

to  get  jobs  because of immigration  restrictions.

Before  they  can go to any of the territories  they

have to be screened by the Government at that place,

and  there are always restrictions imposed on  them.

As regards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



economy  in  construction,  let  us  take  Singapore

again.  At  present, the revenues of  Singapore  are

spent  on construction work in Singapore. We do  not

have   to   pay  any  expenses  to  the   Federation

Government.  As regards security, we  have  our  own

people  to  deal with this because  it  is  our  own

matter. What is the condition of education in  these

five  territories? Well, each territory has its  own

education  policy. Singapore has its  own,  so  have

Sarawak,   Brunei  and  the  Federation  of   Malaya

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us now look at what

is  going  to  happen  after  the  Greater  Malaysia

concept  is  realised. Will there be any  change?  I

will  say that, on the whole, there will not be  any

change.  Take  citizenship again as an example.  The

people  of Singapore will remain Singapore citizens.

Federation  citizens will also remain as  such.  The

only difference is that some representatives will be

sent  to  the  Central  Parliament,  but  not  on  a

proportionate basis. So the administrative powers of

Singapore will be held by the big shareholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the immigration policy, can the people

of  Singapore go freely to the three territories  in

Borneo to look for jobs? Well, the conditions  after

Malaysia  will remain as they are now.  That  is  to

say,  after  Malaysia the unemployment problem  will

not  be  solved.  On  the contrary,  the  people  of

Singapore,  who  have to pay high  taxes,  may  lose

something.  So what is the use of having a  Malaysia

Plan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about economic expansion. Let us take

Singapore  again. After Malaysia,  the  revenues  of

Singapore  will  not  be spent in  Singapore  alone,

because by then Singapore may have to shoulder  some

responsibilities in the expenditure on  defence  and

foreign affairs. So in exchange for this, what do we

get? We will not get anything but a string round our

necks which is being pulled by others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, what will be the position at that

time? Well, everything will be the same. That is  to

say, the big shareholders want to buy over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



small  shareholders  and  then  enjoy  the  benefits

previously enjoyed by the small shareholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to socialism, we

of  the Barisan Sosialis know that when a country is

not united with another country or merged with other

countries,  each  of  these countries  has  its  own

policies in regard to citizenship, economics and  so

on.  But  as  soon as these countries get  together,

that is to say, when this Malaysia Plan is realised,

then,  in  principle, all these  countries  will  be

taken  as  one  unit and there should  be  only  one

citizenship.  The  seats in the  Central  Parliament

should  not  be  decided in  favour  of  the  larger

territories   at   the  expense   of   the   smaller

territories. They should be decided in proportion to

the  population of each territory. There should  not

be any restriction on immigration. All the people in

the  various territories, especially the  people  of

Singapore who are unable to get jobs locally, should

be allowed to go freely to Brunei or Sarawak to seek

employment  or  to do whatever business  they  like.

There  should  be  a unified educational  system  in

these five territories for the various races so that

they  will  live  together in harmony.  Without  the

conditions I have mentioned, I think this  so-called

Greater  Malaysia Plan will be a false plan  because

it  will  mean  that a big territory will  engulf  a

smaller territory by not giving due consideration to

the  democratic  freedom and  the  interest  of  the

people in the territory concerned. The people of any

of  the five territories will oppose such a plan. So

the  present  Malaysia Plan is not well received  by

the  people.  If the Party in power have  the  guts,

they can go to the people for a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, I strongly

oppose  this motion because its aim is not  to  give

better rights to the people of the five territories.

British   economic   and  military   domination   in

Singapore and the Borneo territories. In, the short-term  view,  the British hope, by this  campaign  on

Malaysia,  to  divert  public  attention  from   the

colonial  power thereby confusing and  stopping  the

anti-colonial movement in these territories. In  the

long-term  view,  this British-sponsored  scheme  is

obviously  to  allow the British to  continue  their

economic domination through indirect rule. Since the

what  the Vice-President of the Party Ra'ayat, Inche

A.  A.  Hapidz Laksamana, has said on this  Malaysia

scheme.  Inche Laksamana incidentally  is  also  the

leader  of the Brunei United Labour Front or Barisan

Buroh  Bersatu  -  a trade union movement  to  which

practically every worker in Brunei



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



belongs.  The strength of this trade union  movement

was  demostrated some time ago when the  whole  oil-fields  in  Brunei had to stop work when  the  union

called  out  all  its members to  attend  a  general

meeting.  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to

today's Straits Times, page 20, column 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The vice-president of the Brunei Party Ra'ayat,

Inche  A.  A. Hapidz Laksamana, has said  that  pro-Malaysia  elements  in  Borneo  were  selling  their

birthright for a mess of pottage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said before leaving that the people who

supported  Tengku Abdul Rahman's Malaysia plan  were

void of honesty or principle.'



<br><br>It goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He accused pro-Malaysia exponents of wanting only

personal aggrandisement at the expense of the Borneo

people.  He  said  that "these unprincipled  groups"

were  aiming to become chief ministers or to  obtain

other high offices with the advent of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to pro-Malaysia supporters in Brunei, Inche Laksamana said:



"These pen-pie are trying  to sell the Crown of Brunei.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Party Ra'ayat leader said that there seemed to

be  something mysterious in the air of Kuala Lumpur.

Borneo  leaders going there as avowed  opponents  of

the  Malaysia scheme usually came back to eat  their

words - avid supporters of the Malaysia plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He urged Borneans not to place their trust in

these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He warned pro-Malaysia politicians in Brunei that

they  were going against the will of the people  and

that their action was dangerous.'.



<br><br>Sir,  what we find today is that the P.A.P. leaders

are  deliberately ignoring the real  representatives

of  the  people  of the Borneo territories  and  are

playing  up  the opinion of those people from  these

territories  who do not have any mass following.  We

in Singapore have seen these same tactics being used

before   by  the  colonial  power.  The  people   of

Singapore still remember how the Rendel Constitution

was   drawn   up  by  the  colonial  power   without

consulting  the  people. We still remember  how  the

colonial   power  consulted  only  those   so-called

leaders  at  that  time. The  C.  C.  Tans  and  the

Laycocks were hailed as "responsible" leaders of our

people. We have also seen what happened to these so-called responsible leaders once they had to face the

judgment of the people. We saw how they were brushed

aside  by the people once they were given the  right

to express their opinion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was saying

before  the  tea  break, what moral right  have  the

P.A.P. leaders to use the same colonial tactics  to

bulldoze through a constitutional change without the

consent  of  the  people and their  leaders  of  the

Borneo territories?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did I hear the hon. Member

accuse the P.A.P. of bulldozing through the Malaysia

plan?  We  have dealt with the merger  plan,  but  I

cannot  see  any  suggestion  that  the  P.A.P. are

bulldozing through a Malaysia plan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying

that  the P.A.P. leaders arc using the same colonial

tactics to bulldoze through a constitutional  change

without  the consent of the people and their leaders

of the Borneo territories. Surely the P.A.P. leaders

must know that these so-called leaders of the Borneo

territories, whose opinions alone the P.A.P. seem to

care,  will  suffer the same fate as  the  so-called

responsible leaders of Singapore who conspired  with

the British to draw up the Rendel Constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my Party Chairman, the Member for

Queenstown,  has said, no commission,  however  well

intended,  could  be  a proper  substitute  for  the

secret  ballot. What is even worse, this  commission

is  obviously not going to be well intended. As  has

been pointed out, the Tunku himself has already said

that   this   commission  must   "make   the   right

recommendations"   in  order   to   facilitate   the

imposition of this Malaysia scheme. Does the  P.A.P.

think that the people of Singapore will be happy  if

their constitutional future will be decided by  just

a  Commission of Inquiry, which is composed only  of

outsiders,  and  responsible only to outsiders?  And

what  is worse the commission is obviously going  to

be  biased  even before it starts its inquiry.  Does

the  P.A.P. think  that our people  like  this?  Of

course  not. Then why are they forcing on the people

of  the  Borneo territories something which they  do

not want? Why must the P.A.P. do to others what they

do not like others to do to them?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seems to be some

confusion  here.  I  do not know  whether  the  hon.

Member  is seriously alleging that it is the  P.A.P.

who  have appointed this commission, and that it  is

the  P.A.P. who are foisting something on the Borneo

territories. If the hon. Member asks why the  P.A.P.

supports  such an action, then I can understand  it.

But  when he says that the P.A.P. are foisting  this

thing  on  the  Borneo territories,  then  I  cannot

understand him. I must understand the debate to  see

whether it is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Surely, Sir, I said that this

commission was appointed, or formed, or suggested by

the  Prime Minister of the Federation, and  not  the

P.A.P. I said: why must the P.A.P. do to others what

they do not like others to do to them? Or have these

bankrupt politicians got one set of moral values for

themselves and another set of values for others? Can

they  call themselves genuine socialists? The people

will only laugh at them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, the P.A.P. hail themselves no more as

socialists,  for  they know that  they  have  become

isolated from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



the  socialist movement in this region. We  see  the

only his second-rank followers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> remained standing.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think it is fair for

the Member for Havelock to make a specific statement

of  that nature - that the Prime Minister did not dare

to  go  to Kuala Lumpur - and then refuse to  allow  a

clarification. This appears to me to  be  completely

discourteous to the Assembly itself.  It  may  be  a

wild statement, or it may be true -  I do not know and

I am not judging -  but if specific statements of that

nature  are made, and a Member rises on a  point  of

clarification,    courtesy    demands    that    the

clarification should be made. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a

clarification.  Far  from  the  Prime  Minister  not

daring to go to this conference, the invitation  was

extended  to the Party. We have sent four delegates.

May  I  inform the House that I shall be going there

sometime during the week? Therefore, it is not  fair

to  say that the Prime Minister could not go because

of the Assembly sittings here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, I

have not finished this point. But if the Minister is

patient enough to listen, then he will know  what  I

am talking about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Socialist Conference is an extremely

important  conference as it will be  discussing  the

question  of  Malaysia. Today we see  the  so-called

socialist  Prime  Minister is not prepared  to  face

fellow  socialists of this region on  this  Malaysia

question,  because  he does not  want  to  face  the

humiliation of being rebuked by the socialists  from

the   Borneo  territories. So  he  has   sent   his

unimportant  followers to go. It is really  a  shame

that while this so-called

this  so-called socialist leader was prepared to  go

even  to  Thailand  to play golf with  colonial  and

reactionary  elements  in this  region,  he  is  not

prepared  to  go to Kuala Lumpur to discuss  serious

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today the

P.A.P. leaders    hail   themselves    only    as

"nationalists", and say that this Malaysia Plan is a

"nationalist" plan. The P.A.P. leaders, in order  to

frighten anyone from opposing their Malaysia scheme,

are  branding  everyone who opposes this  scheme  as

"anti-nationalist  and  "Communist".  Sir,  do   the

P.A.P. leaders mean to say that the leaders of Party

Ra'ayat of Brunei and S.U.P.P. are "Communists"  and

"anti-nationalists"? Mr Speaker.  Sir,I  wish  to

remind  the  Prime  Minister  that  in  one  of  his

infamous  twelve  radio talks over Radio  P.A.P. he

described  Inche Azahari, Chairman of Party  Ra'ayat

of  Brunei, as a Malay nationalist. How is  it  then

this  Malay  nationalist is opposed  to  the  P.A.P.

scheme  of things? I wonder why the P.A.P. leaders,

who are so clever in inventing all sorts of names to

smear  their opponents, have not been able to invent

a  name  for  the Malay nationalists of  the  Borneo

territories  who are opposing this Malaysia  scheme.

Moreover,  Sir,  Inche Boestamam and  Inche  Mohamed

Ishak,  both of the Socialist Front of Malaya,  have

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



strongly condemned this Malaysia proposal, and  both

these  socialists  who are now at the  Kuala  Lumpur

conference  have  been described as nationalists  by

none other than the Prime Minister himself.

P.A.P. propaganda  that  only  the  Communists  are

opposed to the Malaysia scheme? Sir, even if  it  is

true that the Communists are opposed to the Malaysia

scheme,  it does not necessarily mean that  all  who

oppose  this  sinister scheme  are  Communists.  The

P.A.P. logic  is  that  since  the  Communists  are

opposed  to  Malaysia,  therefore,  all  who  oppose

Malaysia are Communists. This is a logic of a three-year old kid. It is just like saying that since  the

Prime  Minister likes to drink beer, then all  those

who do not like to drink beer are Communists.

point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, the Minister for Culture

has already answered. The colonial power in the past

and  even now in the Borneo territories are branding

all  those  who  are  strongly  anti-colonialist  as

Communists and subversives. Similarly the P.A.P. is

using  colonial  tactics  to  frighten  people  from

opposing them. Communism today has become synonymous

with  effective  opposition.  Sir,  the  P.A.P. are

pretending to be democrats. But what are they  doing

to  justify this pretence? Is it democratic just  to

bulldoze  through  important constitutional  schemes

without   first   consulting  the  people?   Is   it

democratic  for  the P.A.P. to  use  force  and  the

police against peaceful workers and labourers?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All these little details and

little  jibes  and  so on, I think,  are  taking  us

further and further away from the motion. The motion

is asking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



this  House  to  declare its  support  of  the  plan

proposed by the Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya,  and an amendment which seeks to change  the

word  "plan" to read "motion". I think what the hon.

Member  is  doing now is going back  to  the  debate

which  we  had  on the proposals on  merger  between

Singapore and the Federation. All this has been said

in  that  debate. I do not think it can be urged  in

this  debate that the P.A.P. are foisting a Malaysia

plan  on the Borneo territories. It took 13 days  to

debate  why  the merger plans between Singapore  and

the  Federation  were  unpalatable  to  the  Barisan

Sosialis. I would suggest that we now come  back  to

the main theme of this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I personally

feel  that  this  is  a bit too  detailed.  But  the

Minister for Finance uttered yesterday quite  a  lot

about   "democratic",  "Communist",  "undemocratic",

and,  I  think, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  fair  if  I

could just counter some of the points which he  made

yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan Sosialis are opposed to all

these  Fascist acts. We insist that the people  must

he  consulted.  Their agreement should  be  obtained

before  we  bring  about  any  major  constitutional

changes.  Is this undemocratic? We have  called  for

general  elections  to allow the  people  to  decide

their  future. Is this undemocratic?  We  have  very

strongly  opposed  all  this indiscriminate  use  of

force  against  our workers and labourers.  Is  this

undemocratic?  As  my  Party  Secretary-General  has

said,  let  those who are not prepared to  face  the

judgement  of  the people not try to pretend  to  be

democratic. Let them moreover not try to label those

who are prepared to be judged by the people any time

as  Communists  and subversives.  Our  people  fully

realise that the P.A.P. leaders, by their own deeds,

have  made  a  mockery of democracy which  they  are

pretending to defend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, we have repeatedly said that

this  Malaysia  scheme is a British-sponsored  plan.

Yesterday  the  Minister for Finance  said  that  we

broke away from the P.A.P. because we disagreed with

their "merger" plan. Sir



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



this  is not true. The truth is that we left because

we  believe  that the P.A.P. leaders were conspiring

with  the  colonialists to bring upon our  people  a

constitution  aimed  at  prolonging  colonial   rule

indirectly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> At Eden Hall!



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> The P.A.P. leaders are trying to

bluff  the people that this is not a British  scheme

but  a  "nationalist" scheme. Sir,  I  have  been  a

Parliamentary  Secretary in  the  P.A.P.  Government

before  and  I know exactly what was going  on.  Mr

Speaker, I hate to reveal what happened to the Party

before.  But since the P.A.P. leaders are persisting

with  their  bluff, I am forced to  reveal  publicly

what I came to know in the Party. What I am going to

say,  Sir,  would not only clear the  minds  of  the

public but, I am sure, would also shock some of  the

Government  Back-benches whom I think still  do  not

know this Party secret which will completely explode

the  P.A.P.'s bluff that this Malaysia scheme is not

a colonial inspired scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, round about July or August 1960, the Prime

Minister told us at an important meeting that he had

seen  Lord Selkirk. It seemed that the British  were

worried about security of their possessions  in  the

Borneo territories. It seemed that the British  were

worried about the way Indonesia was going. They were

afraid that if the Indonesians could not solve their

economic  problems, they wou1d turn their  attention

on  to North Kalimantan, that is, the British Borneo

territories,  after West Irian. So the British  were

apparently  trying  to bring the Borneo  territories

under   the   control   of  a  friendly   Federation

Government before the Indonesians can lay  claim  to

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister also told us that Lord

Selkirk  had  shown  him  a report  which  he,  Lord

Selkirk, was going to send to the Colonial Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, later on, in December 1960, Mr Duncan

Sandys,   the   British  Minister  for  Commonwealth

Relations,  came to Malaya. There was  an  important

meeting at the Cameron Highlands at which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



were present not only top British officials in South-East  Asia  but  also  the  representatives  of  the

Austrialian and New Zealand Embassies in Malaya. The

Prime  Ministers of the Federation and of  Singapore

together  with  the Minister for Finance  were  also

there.  Sir, outwardly this meeting was supposed  to

be  a  beer and venison satay party. But we all knew

that  something  important was cooking  up  and  the

secrecy of the whole matter made us suspect that  it

was something very fishy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I challenge the Prime Minster to deny what I

have said about his telling us what Lord Selkirk had

in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore very clear to all why the British

are  now so keen about this Malaysia scheme.  It  is

for  the  simple reason that it was all started  and

inspired by the British. The British were faced with

what  they considered to be the problem of, firstly,

having to counter the growing anti-colonial movement

in  the  Borneo  territories.  Secondly,  having  to

counter the possibility of the Indonesians making  a

claim  on  the North Borneo territories  after  West

Irian.  So  obviously the British  believe  that  by

bringing  all  the  Borneo  territories  under   the

control of the Federation Government, it would solve

both  their problems, since they regard the  present

Federation  Government as being dependable  to  look

after   their   vested  interests  in   the   Borneo

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this plan suits the P.A.P.

especially when they find that they are falling  out

of  favour  for  Malaysia means the White  Paper  on

merger.  As  far  as  the people  of  Singapore  are

concerned,  this so-called merger will,  in  effect,

enable  the  Federation  Government  to  remove  the

P.A.P.'s political opponents before the next general

election in 1964.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu):</b> (In Mandarin):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I did not originally  intend  to

take  part in the debate on this motion because  our

Chairman  has  clearly  pointed  out  the  important

aspect  of  this motion in the hope that the  P.A.P.

will take it as a reflection of the people's opinion

in order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



to bring about some charge in ther attitude. In this

way, they will not go ahead with their plan and thus

go  against the interest of the people. Just now  my

colleagues  said  that  the  principal  aim  of  the

Barisan Sosialis is to get democracy for the people.

But  the Prime Minister says that our principles are

those  of  the  Communists. So I must stand  up  and

discuss with him the points he has raised. It is  my

opinion  that if the principle of the Communists  is

correct,  then there should be no question  at  all.

But  we  all know that the Communists have no  legal

organisation in Singapore. But the Barisan  Sosialis

is  a  legal and legitimate organisation. Since  the

Prime  Minister is one of the important  figures  in

Singapore, what is his aim in saying such  a  thing?

Is  he  trying to intimidate us? Or is he trying  to

silence us? I would say that the stand as made clear

by the Prime Minister is not receiving any attention

from  the  people.  But  the Government  instead  of

paying attention to our stand is saying that we  are

the open front workers of the Communists. I say that

such  a situation is very bad. We all know that when

we wish to debate anything, we must bring up logical

arguments  so as to find out where it is wrong,  and

where  it is right; what is wrong and what is right,

in  order to bring out the truth. But they  are  not

doing  this. All they have been trying to do  is  to

smear  people.  The fact that we have  had  so  many

Members  speaking  is  attributable  to  the   smear

campaign  made  by the Government. As  a  result  of

their   smear  campaign,  Members  of  the   Ban-san

Sosialis  have had to stand up to explain  why  they

are not Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explain my views that the Greater

Malaysia Plan is a sort of intrigue on the  part  of

the  imperialists and the colonialists. We all  know

that  in  South-East  Asia  many  people  are  anti-colonialists  because they want to  get  freedom  in

order  to improve their livelihood. The same can  be

said  of  the five territories in Borneo,  Singapore

and  the  Federation. All we are  fighting  for  and

demanding  is  a democratic, independent  nation  so

that we can look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



after  our own affairs to improve our livelihood  as

far  as  possible.  But the British  know  that  the

campaign  of  anti-colonialism is  inevitable.  They

also know that this campaign cannot be suppressed by

force,  because it is the intention of international

opinion to tear the veil off the British colonialist

to  show the world for what it is. So they know that

it  is  impossible to suppress the mounting wave  of

anti-colonialism in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that before 1955, some Members in the

Legislative  Council were nominated by  the  British

Government.  In 1959, the British colonialists  were

forced  to  have  representatives  elected  by   the

people.  This shows that the political clam  of  the

people  is  now  receiving attention  and,  to  some

extent, they are quite successful. But they are  not

happy with what they have got because at present  we

still  have  many restrictions imposed  on  us.  For

example, there is in existence the Internal Security

Council  which is a stumbling-block to our  national

economic expansion and the freedom of the people. So

we   want   to   go  a  step  further  and   advance

politically.  We hope that we will be able  to  have

complete    self-government.   But    the    British

Government, realising this, is trying to  resort  to

delaying   tactics.  So  they  have  to   get   pro-colonialist people to bring about plans such as that

of  Malaysia  in order to extend their influence  in

this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us talk about the three territories in

Borneo.  We  know that there will be no end  to  the

political claim of the peoples in these territories,

because they are still under colonial rule and  they

are  very  concerned  with  their  political  future

because  the  present situation is not conducive  to

their  interest  in view of certain  oppression  and

suppression.  There  is  widespread  dissatisfaction

because  the people have their own self-respect.  So

they  are coming forward to organise themselves into

numerous  political Parties in the hope  that  these

political   Parties  will  bring  them  a   brighter

political  future. The British realise  this  stand.

They  know that sooner or later in Borneo there will

also  be  self-government for the people as what  is

taking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



place  here  in Singapore. They also know  that  the

people  will  fight against colonialism.  Real  sing

this, the British are trying to get people who  only

look    after   their   own   interests   and   who,

ideologically,   can  be  made   use   of   by   the

colonialists  to  work  for them.  So  this  Greater

Malaysia Plan has been talked about for the last few

months.  A  great ideal of publicity has been  given

thereto in order to cover up the political claims of

the  people in these five territories. You  can  see

why I say the colonialists are trying to get the pro-colonialists  to cover up the claims of  the  people

for  a better political future. For example, we  can

see  that  on  internal  and external  affairs,  the

Federation  Government is outwardly  an  independent

country, but some of its powers are still being held

by  the Right-wing people. We see that in the Congo,

where   there   is   trouble  now,  the   Federation

Government  is  able to send troops  to  go  to  its

rescue  in order to maintain peace in that  country.

Let us think. Since the Government of the Federation

of  Malaya  is able to send out troops  to  maintain

peace  in any country, how is it that British troops

are still in Malaya? Since Malaya itself is able  to

help  others militarily, why should it have  foreign

troops on its own land?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise is that, as far as

external  affairs are concerned, the line  taken  by

the  Federation  Government is on the  side  of  the

West. When there is something wrong in the East, the

Malayan  representative in the United  Nations  will

join the West in condemning the culprit. But in  the

case of West Iran where the Indonesian Government is

fighting  to recover its own territory, it  is  only

right for the Federation Government to support  such

a move. But -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not see how all this

relates  to  the  motion. I do not  think  the  hon.

Member  is  entitled to debate  the  action  of  the

Federation Government as regards Indonesia.  It  has

nothing at all to do with this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was saying that

since  this  Greater Malaysia Plan  is  a  political

issue, therefore, in order to explain how bad it is, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



must touch upon the Federation Government, so as  to

show  to  this House what its political inclinations

are and to prove by these means how right we are  in

our political stand on this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chairman of my Party has

dealt  with  almost every aspect of this  motion.  I

feel it is not necessary for me to go any further in

this  respect. But I would like to answer two  points

raised  by  Members of the Government to  show  that

they are theoretically bankrupt. They are trying  to

make a farce in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other day, our Minister for

Home  Affairs stood up to make a speech in which  he

said  that even the British themselves admitted that

they  were  only a third-class nation in the  world,

So, according to the Minister, the British might  be

more practical politically and that is why they  are

interested  in bringing about a Greater Malaysia.  I

feel  that  his  political  view  is  very  backward

because we know that everybody is practical  in  any

issue.  As  I have already pointed out, there  is  a

rising  claim  for  more  political  rights  by  the

peoples  in  the five territories, and the  British,

being  practical,  must  do something  about  it  to

protect  their  own interests in these  territories.

The  fact that they are trying to retreat is nothing

but  a  show,  because they are trying  to  make  an

advance  by  way of an ostensible retreat.  In  this

way,  if  there  is  any  discontentment  among  the

peoples in these five territories, to whom can  they

go with their grievances? They can neither go to the

British  nor  to their own Government. So,  in  this

way,  there  will be internal conflict  amongst  the

people   themselves.  In  this  way,  the  conflict

between   the  peoples  in  this  region   and   the

colonialists may be covered up. That is  why  I  say

the  British are very practical. Now, if you condemn

some  people  whose influence is very great,  it  is

very  dangerous. So, if they want to do anything  to

anybody, they must wait until that somebody  is  not

prepared  for  it.  So  I would  like  to  tell  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs that he must  not  think

that  since the British Government is admitting that

it  is a third-class nation, we must not do anything

to fight for greater and better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



political rights. Therefore, we must not talk  about

Greater Malaysia and merger without paying attention

to  the  actual  situation. We therefore  understand

that  behind the practical attitude of the  British,

there is a motive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Prime  Minster had nothing to advance as to  why  he

had   to  speak  in  that  fashion.  The  Government

understood that they were not correct in their stand

and  political ideologies. That is why they  brought

up  analogies such as marriage and so on. They  said

there  was no point in arguing what the future child

would  be before the marriage. This kind of argument

is  unnecessary. If they want to talk of such things

in  such a fashion, we can do likewise. I would like

to  say  that  before our marriage we should  ensure

whether  the partner would be the right partner  for

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the White Paper merger proposals are

full  of  evil provisions. Then before the marriage,

we  should know whether our partner is a leper or  a

T.B. patient, because if he is diseased  we  should

fight  shy  of  such a person. How  can  we  make  a

decision  if we do not know the person who is  going

to  be  our partner? I think everybody will want  to

find  out  first who the person is before making  up

his mind. That is only common sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to the Minister for Home

Affairs  who  said something about a  marriage  with

Indonesia.  The other day I also heard the  Minister

for  Education touch on his point. An allegation was

made  that the Indonesian Communists had a talk with

a certain reporter. It was found from this talk that

their  views  were the same as those of the  Barisan

Sosialis.   A  further  allegation  was   that   our

Secretary-General  had given his  views  to  a  pro-Communist newspaper, the Bintang Timur. He is quoted

as  having said that we were in favour of  a  merger

with  Indonesia. This is not a fact. If the  concept

of  the Communists in Indonesia is the same as  that

of ours, does it mean that we are under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



control of the Communists? It is ridiculous to argue

in such a way. The Prime Minister has also said that

the  failure  of  the  Malayan Communists  could  be

attributed  to the fact that the majority supporters

of  the  Communists were Chinese. He also said  that

the Malayan Communists were under the control of the

Communists in China. The Government now accuse us of

being   under   the   control  of   the   Indonesian

Communists. This goes to prove that their  arguments

have  been inconsistent and contradictory. They  are

now  trying to smear us. I feel they have also  been

inconsistent in the speeches they have  made  before

and  lately.  How can speeches of such a  nature  be

convincing to the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us talk about the Four-Party Alliance. One

of  their representatives here has been very keen to

make  speeches in support of the Malaysia  Plan.  We

understand  what kind of an organisation this  Four-Party  Alliance is. Everybody knows  the  nature  of

this  organisation. They have always been supporting

and    praising   the   P.A.P.'s   Malaysia    Plan.

[Interruption].  Bad proposals will  always  receive

the support of bad people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose the conversation must be

interesting  because the Member for  Jalan  Kayu  is

replying, I take it. As I say, I always like to hear

female  voices in this Assembly, but I suggest  that

the  Lady (the Member for Delta) who has just spoken

can give vent to her feelings when she speaks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  the  Minister for Culture said  that  the

British  unified the monetary system in this  region

and  that  this  provided  a  sound  foundation  for

Malaysia.  I  feel this argument is not correct.  We

know that Singapore is also under the control of the

British.  Our trade and currency are also under  the

control  of the British. But may I ask:  how  is  it

that unemployment is so rampant in Singapore? How is

it that the people of Singapore find it difficult to

earn  a  livelihood? How can it  be  said  that  the

foundation  of Malaysia has already been  well  laid

and that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



everything  will  be  all  right  once  Malaysia  is

established? I think the Minister should  consult  a

specialist. Maybe he consulted the wrong specialist,

so  that he is now very confused over this question.

If  the people do not have political rights, how can

they  advance politically? The control  of  politics

affects economic development. That is why I say that

the Minister's arguments are ridiculous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture also said that the economic unity of Malaysia should be preserved. He said that with more people and with more areas coming in, there will be more rapid development in this region. This argument has been rebutted by the Member for Upper Serangoon. I would also like to touch on this too. We know that the nature of the

British  colonialists is not different from that  of

the American colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of America. In the

American hemisphere, there is an island called  Cuba

which was a member of the Pan-American organisation.

In  this  organisation, she  was  oppressed  by  the

United  States of America. The people of  Cuba  went

through   a  revolution  because  of  the   economic

difficulties  and difficult living conditions  which

faced them. Until lately, Cuba was oppressed by  the

U.S.A.  This  goes  to  rebut the  argument  of  the

Minister  for  Culture. From this we can  understand

the  nature  of  the existence of  colonialism.  The

U.S.A. is now trying to gang up with certain  Latin

American  countries against Cuba. From this  we  can

see how cruel these colonialist countries can be  in

their  relationship with an island like  Cuba.  Such

colonialist   countries  will  only  have   friendly

dealings with those countries which toe their  line;

otherwise  they will adopt all kinds  of  oppressive

measures. So even if the people in this area want to

lay  a good foundation to improve their lot, I think

the colonialists will adopt a stand which is against

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for National

Development mentioned three political powers in  the

world: the Western bloc, the Afro-Asian bloc and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



the Communist bloc. He said that the Eastern and the

Western blocs have been trying to destroy each other

and  that  the  existence of the other neutral  bloc

forms a kind of balance between the two other blocs.

May I ask to which bloc do the P.A.P. belong?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day the Chairman of our Party said that

the   people   of   Singapore,  the   three   Borneo

territories and Malaya do not like to be involved in

any  power  politics. What they are mainly concerned

with   is  to  earn  their  livelihood  in  peaceful

surroundings. They do not like to be involved  in  a

nuclear war so that they would not become the target

of  any nuclear attack. We do not know to which bloc

the   P.A.P.   Government  would  want  to   belong.

According  to  the tone of the conversation  in  the

C.P.A.  Room, we gather that they are more  inclined

to the Western bloc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to end here. I

strongly oppose this motion because the basis is not

correct.



<br><br>6.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

because the P.A.P. Government knows that our  people

resist  its  merger plan, it is now trying,  like  a

clever quack doctor, to impress our people by saying

that all the people in Borneo think that Malaysia is

a  good  thing.  Sir, as a result  of  my  visit  to

Borneo,  I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind  that

the  people  there feel the same way as  our  people

here. Their suspicions and fears, like those of  our

people,  are very legitimate. But, of course,  there

are  certain  people who try to tell the  people  of

Borneo  that Malaysia is a sure cure for  all  their

ills,  just as the P.A.P. is telling us. Sir,  their

propaganda is that Malaysia must be effected now  or

else the people will be doomed forever. But in spite

of  all  the excitement among these few individuals,

which  I  understand is motivated, by their  selfish

desire  to  be Mentri Besers, governors,  etc.,  the

Borneo people have shown little interest in the  way

of  accepting  Malaysia.  This  is  so  because,  as

subject peoples, they are preoccupied with the anti-colonial struggle. Freedom from subjugation  is  the

first thing that they want to realise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis, unlike the P.A.P.,

respect  the desire of a people to be free. We  have

stated  publicly that any constitutional arrangement

for the Borneo people must be based on the principle

of  self-determination, and, above all, it must have

the  consent of the people themselves. This  is  the

stand that is in conformity with that of the Sarawak

United  People's  Party and  the  Party  Ra'ayat  in

Brunei,  the  two  largest  Parties  in  the  Borneo

territories. For the information of this House, Sir,

I am told the Sarawak United People's Party has more

than  40,000  members, and the Party Ra'ayat  Brunei

has  about 26,000 members. Sir, Malaysia as proposed

by the Federation Government is opposed by these two

Parties.  There are some Right-wing Parties  besides

these two which also oppose Malaysia in Borneo. Sir,

are all these people Communists? I only hope -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister for Finance, even

in  walking  into this Chamber, becomes  disorderly.

[Interruption] Order. It seems to me that  there  is

peace until the Minister for Finance comes into  the

Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Party Ra'ayat and the Sarawak

United  People's  Party  demand  self-determination,

first.  They  say  that only after independence  can

they  think  about Malaysia. Are the P.A.P. leaders

deliberately  going  to ignore the  views  of  these

Parties? These two socialist Parties, as I said, are

the  major Parties in the Borneo territories with  a

mass following. As a so-called socialist Party,  why

does the P.A.P. not listen and respect the views  of

socialist  Parties  in the Borneo  territories?  Why

does  it  only  ally  itself  with  Right-wing   and

reactionary groups?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the call for self-determination is also

supported by the Socialist Front and its leaders  in

the  Federation  of  Malaya, particularly,  Sir,  by

leaders  like  Inche Ahmad Boestamam, Inche  Mohamed

Ishak,  both  of  whom, as the Member  for  Havelock

said,  were  described  by  our  Prime  Minister  as

nationalists. So what is the P.A.P. bluff all about?

The P.A.P. strategy, as has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



already  been seen in this debate, is to  label  all

those  who  oppose  the present Malaysia  scheme  as

Communists,  hoping thereby to frighten and  silence

those  who  see through the treacherous aims  behind

the P.A.P. scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that our Prime Minister once said that a

word  can have three meanings. Apparently,  Sir,  he

excels in the art of using words in the meaning that

will  best suit the P.A.P.'s interests. For example,

Sir,  take  the word "merger". When the P.A.P. uses

the  word  "merger", it does not mean what everybody

understands  the word to mean. And  for  us  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  when  we  use  the  word  "self-determination"  we  mean that  the  people  must  be

allowed  to decide their own affairs. That  is  what

the  political  Parties  in the  Borneo  territories

want,  and  that  is also what they mean  when  they

demand self-determination. They want the fundamental

right to decide their own destiny. This, Sir, is the

birth-right of man. The Borneo people want elections

immediately  to  let  the people  decide  their  own

future.  Sir,  are  the P.A.P. leaders  saying  that

they, in fact, oppose it? Let them categorically say

whether  they  support or oppose the demand  by  the

political Parties in the Borneo territories for self-determination. Just "yes" or "no", and not in  words

which, according to them, may have three meanings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Dutch use the word "self-determination", they mean a pretext to set up a

puppet  nation  in  West  Irian  so  that  they  can

perpetuate  their  colonial  rule,  Just   like   De

Gaulle's  version  of  self-determination  for   the

Algerian  people. The question of self-determination

in  West Irian, merely means that the people of West

Irian  must decide for themselves. But this  is  not

what  the  Dutch want. They want to decide  for  the

Papuans through their colonial agents. And in  terms

of  self-determination, there is no doubt  that  the

people  of  West  Irian  want  to  be  part  of  the

Indonesian  nation. And all Afro-Asia  accepts  this

position.  But, Sir, can the same be said about  the

people  in  the Borneo territories? The  Member  for

Queens-town has already pointed out that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



Afro-Asian  Permanent Secretariat, which  is  not  a

Communist organisation, has condemned in a statement

issued  in Cairo recently that Malaysia is a British

plot.  Perhaps  now  the Prime  Minister  will  even

venture  to  suggest  that the  Afro-Asian  People's

Solidarity   Organisation  is  a   Communist   front

organisation because it has condemned Malaysia. Sir,

can  the  P.A.P. say that the people of  the  Borneo

territories  are in favour of this Malaysia  scheme?

Why  do  they not tell the British masters  to  hold

elections in Borneo to test the truth?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why do you not ask Lord Selkirk?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if the P.A.P. really believe that

the  Borneo people are all for the Malaysia  scheme,

why  are they not prepared to put it to a test at  a

general  election, which is what the Borneo  Parties

are demanding? You will remember we are supposed  to

be  the  Communists, supposed to be the undemocratic

people,  supposed to be people who  are  working  to

wreck  the  democratic system. In any democracy,  an

election  is supposed to be the means by  which  the

people express their desire. All that we say is hold

elections;  give the people an adequate  opportunity

to  express  their desire. The P.A.P. is  not  only

avoiding  elections in Singapore but in  the  Borneo

territories as well. Why are they so scared  to  let

the  people decide? These are nothing more than fake

democrats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Not for one moment was I suggesting that

the  P.A.P.  Government  should  hold  elections  in

Borneo. I wonder, Sir, if at all the P.A.P. goes  to

Brunei, for example - I am told the Prime Minister now

dare  not  even step into Brunei - but if  the  P.A.P.

should bold elections in Borneo on a P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



ticket, I wonder what will happen to them. I did not

certainly  mean  that the P.A.P.  Government  should

conduct elections in Borneo. What I mean is that the

P.A.P. is  one  of  the foremost champions  of  the

Malaysia  scheme together with the British  and  the

Federation   Government.  And  they  claim   to   be

democrats.   The  Borneo  people   say,   "We   want

elections. We want independence first. Give  us  the

opportunity." Why do they not arrange it? All that I

am   saying  is  that  the  British  are  postponing

elections for the Borneo people. And these so-called

P.A.P. democrats are helping the British to postpone

elections  for  the  people. They  are  helping  the

British  to prevent the Borneo people from  speaking

through   their  elected  leaders.  What   sort   of

democrats  are they? Sir, as I said, we the  Barisan

Sosialis support the demand of the Borneo people for

general elections because we believe the people must

decide  their  own  future themselves.  We  who  are

supposed to be Communists are more keen to  let  the

people  decide  through  democratic  elections  than

those   in  the  P.A.P. who  are  supposed  to   be

democrats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday the Minister for Culture and the

Minister for Finance once again touched on  what  is

termed  the "unholy alliance" between the Communists

and  the  British. I notice even today the  Minister

for  Culture has been interjecting with  words  like

"Lord  Selkirk", etc. Sir, we know  that  the  Prime

Minister has proved his ability as a golf player and

as  a  beer drinker. In fact, he is now proving  his

ability  in  story  telling. When the  twelve  radio

talks  were  going  on, I was told  that  the  story

tellers  in Chinatown were all quite anxious whether

their  business  would  be adversely  affected.  But

luckily for them, Sir, our people in Singapore  like

to  hear  stories  that are narrated  by  people  in

person  and  not  by  those who  hide  in  the  air-conditioned studio of Radio Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we see our Prime Minister - a golf

player,  a  beer  drinker  and  a  story  teller - now

becoming  a circus player as well. Sir, we have  all

heard of the circus act starring the lion and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



the  bear.  Last  month  we  heard  that  the  Prime

Minister  was catching foxes and hunting tigers  and

lions.  He  also told us that he dare not catch  the

fox  by  the tail for fear of being bitten. Sir,  if

the  Prime  Minister has any good points about  him,

quite  obviously, Sir, courage is not one  of  them.

Sir,  this  reference to the British  bear  and  the

Communist  fox joining together to hunt  the  P.A.P.

really  would  have  taken the cake  had  the  Prime

Minister    also    given    himself    an    animal

personification. Probably the Prime Minister  cannot

decide which animal he would like to imitate,  since

evidently he likes to imitate more than one  at  any

one  time.  But,  Sir, may I help  him  out  of  his

dilemma,  and suggest that he take the choice  of  a

chameleon? Then, Sir, I think it would all not  only

sound but look very delicate. Sir, I do not want  to

spend much of my time in denying stupid propositions

that  the  Communists have become  allied  with  the

imperialists.  If this theory in  any  part  of  the

world  is put forward, one would straightaway  catch

the one who expounds this and send him to the mental

hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a much more serious thing to deal

with. I want to refer to the Straits Times report of

Alex Josey's interview with D. N. Pritt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Aidit. You must not get the two

Communists mixed up!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Minister for Culture is calling Mr

D. N. Pritt a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He is dead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> For the information of the Minister, I

am  sure the Prime Minister will remember that  once

the  Prime Minister said he would have the  greatest

inspiration by just being a chauffeur to Mr  D.  N.

Pritt.  And for the information of the Minister  for

Culture,  Sir, Mr D. N. Pritt is not  dead.  He  is

retired.  He is still in London. Sir, I am referring

to this article because the whole basis of attack on

the Barisan Sosialis has been on one stand which the

P.K.I. (the Parti Komunis Indonesia) has taken. This

is  the  Straits Times of 24th January. The  play-up

was simply terrific:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



`WHY INDONESIAN COMMUNISTS CONDEMN MALAYSIA

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communist Party Resolution'



<br><br>And  to  top it all, Sir, an editorial: `Merger  and

the Reds'. All this is done quite deliberately in an

attempt  to  discredit the Barisan Sosialis  in  the

eyes of the English-educated. Sir, the Straits Times

have  been, as usual, a willing party and  have  co-operated  with the P.A.P. Sir, I suggest  that  that

piece  was mischievously timed to coincide with  the

opening of the Malaysia debate, obviously to  create

the  impression that only the Communists are against

the  Malaysia  set  up, and if the Barisan  Sosialis

opposes Malaysia, it must necessarily be Communists.

Sir,  Mr Alex Josey, who I believe live in the same

house with the Minister for Culture, is today one of

the  P.A.P.'s top advisers. In fact, Sir, he is  the

direct  pipe-line to the British, and it  is  widely

rumoured among political circles that Alex Josey  is

an MI-S man like G. G. Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Would the Member for Thomson also

agree that Mr Alex Josey is also the pipe-line from

Lim Ching Siong to me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we have found in recent days and

also  in the earlier days, Sir, that every time  the

Minister  for  Culture wants to know  what  Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong  thinks, he sends for Alex Josey.  Alex

Josey used to come with shorts and with slippers on.

I  think  he feared that if he came with a coat  and

tie,  he  might  not be admitted  to  the  Singapore

General Employees' Union. So he dressed as a  simple

man.  But anyway, Sir, I have no doubt that some  or

us - Mr Lim tells me, so does Mr Woodhull - that  when

they  talk to Mr Alex Josey, they are not too  sure

whether they are talking to Mr Alex



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



Josey  or the Minister for Culture. That is  because

these  two  great fellows speak the  same  language.

Sir,  Mr  Alex  Josey is well, known in  South-East

Asian  countries for his notorious activities.  Many

people in this part of the world take, him to  be  a

P.A.P. spokesman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You take him to be Lim Ching

Siong's spokesman!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, it does not logically follow that

just  because  the  P.K.I. - the Indonesian  Communist

Party - is against Malaysia, therefore, all those  who

are  against Malaysia are Communists. Sir,  this  is

typical P.A.P. bankrupt logic. Some of my colleagues

have exposed the stupidity of this logic. It is like

saying  that since the Prime Minister likes to  play

golf,  then  all  those who like to  play  golf  are

P.A.P. members, or those' who do not play golf  are

Communists. Sir, this reminds me of -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Castro plays golf!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Therefore, what is he? Communist - or not

a Communist?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Communist. Sir, this is typical of the

logic  that I heard when I was in Standard  III.  It

runs something like this. Mr A is an American.  Mr

A is a liar. No - Mr A is - sorry, Sir,It is a vicious

circle, and although I learned it in Standard III  I

still remember it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are still in Standard III.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And I think this is a typical

demonstration  of  P.A.P. logic.  Mr  A   is   an.

American. All Americans are liars. Therefore, Mr  A

is  a  liar.  Therefore, what  he  says  in  untrue.

Therefore, Americans are not liars. Therefore, Mr A

is  not  a  liar. Therefore, what he says  is  true.

Therefore,  Americans are liars, and therefore  what

he  says  is untrue. And it can go on, Sir. This  is

P.A.P. logic. They stop where it is convenient  for

them.  It is very simple logic. All they have to  do

is  to  sit  back quietly and say it over  and  over

again and they will find that it can go on. As I was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



saying,  as  far  as the P.A.P. are concerned,  they

just  stop where it is convenient for them;  whether

they  want  to make Mr A a liar or not a  liar;  or

whether they want to make the Americans liars or not

liars.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we are not scared. We are not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought the Member for

Thomson   was  doing  very  well  by  ignoring   the

interjections that are coming from across the Floor.

That  is  the best way to treat interruptions  which

tend to become disorderly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Very well, Sir. I shall follow your

advice.   Sir.  Communists  throughout   the   world

condemned  the  murder of Lumumba  as  the  work  of

colonialists. So did the P.A.P. Does that  make  the

P.A.P.  Communists? Sir, Communists, as  the  Minister

for  Culture admits, are anti-colonialists. Does  it

mean that all anti-colonialists are Communists?  Are

people  like Soekarno, Nehru, etc., who have proved,

unlike  the  P.A.P. leaders, that  they  are  anti-colonialists,  also  Communists?  Sir,   the   Prime

Minister  is  very fond of mentioning  Soekarno  and

Nehru all the time. Sir, these men have proved to be

anti-colonialists, unlike the Prime Minister. Nehru,

for  example, spent more than ten years  in  prison.

Our  Prime Minister has not had the occasion of even

spending  ten seconds in prison. He has visited  it,

of course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists say that neo-colonialism is no

good. You will remember, Sir, yesterday the Minister

for Culture was talking a lot about neo-colonialism.

The  Communists say neo-colonialism is no good. But,

Sir,  people like Soekarno, Nkhruma, etc, also  say

that  neo-colonialism is no good. Are they,  as  the

Americans are so fond of saying, Communists or  pro-Communists? Sir, theirs is the logic of  people  who

have no argument and reasoning, but who rely more on

smears  and threats. This is the logic of those  who

do  not  try  to  win over people by  arguments  and

reasoning but who try



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



to  frighten people into submission. This  certainly

is not the attitude of true democrats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must congratulate the Prime Minister on

the  tremendous energy and keenness  with  which  he

went  about trying to sell the idea of Malaysia,  in

fact,  Sir, I gather the P.A.P. was so anxious  they

even by-passed the Chairman of the Singapore C.P.A.,

when appointing delegates to the C.P.A. Consultative

Committee Meeting in Jesselton.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is a fair

statement  at all. I think it is an unfair statement

because  I know it is not correct. I do not want  to

get  into a debate with any Member. But my  name  as

Chairman  of  the  C.P.A. must not be  dragged  into

these matters. If the hon. Member wishes to know the

truth, he can always come and see me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As I said. Sir, this is what I gather

and I shall not pursue it any further. In fact, Sir,

our  Prime Minister seems to be more concerned  with

the  success of the Malaysia proposals than the  man

who first voiced the idea, the Prime Minister of the

Federation of Malaya. Sir, we saw how at the  C.P.A.

Conference  at Kuching, he betrayed his  anxiety  to

force the Malaysia proposals on the Borneo people by

his   repeated   attempts  to  commit   the   Borneo

delegations  by trying to turn a purely Consultative

Committee  into a negotiating body, one  that  would

take  some form of decision on behalf of the  Borneo

people -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No. Sir. I do not want to waste time.

His Prime Minister can reply for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, by his eagerness to answer questions

directed  not  at  him, but at  the  leader  of  the

Federation   of  Malaya  delegations,   anyone   who

listened to even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



the  radio  forums  would  know  it  was  the  Prune

Minister  of Singapore who was talking most  of  the

time.  This  anxiety  on  the  part  of  the  P.A.P.

leadership is perfectly understandable. Taking  into

consideration the political situation  in  Singapore

where, should the P.A.P. be so foolish enough as  to

put their claim that they have the confidence of the

people to the acid test of a general election,  they

would be utterly defeated -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We will have 13 by-elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We know, Sir, and the Prime Minister also

knows  that  he  has  not the  slightest  chance  of

winning in Tanjong Pagar. That is why the once proud

and arrogant Member for Tanjong Pagar, a man who  in

the  past  has only been too eager to challenge  all

and  sundry  to a by-election, now prefers  to  play

golf and dine with the Tunku in the cool heights  of

Fraser's  Hill  rather than  go  to  the  people  of

Tanjong  Pagar.  In fact, there is a  strong  rumour

that despite all the tailoring that can be done to a

referendum,  the Government may not even  hold  one.

Sir,  I am told the Prime Minister, when asked in  a

recent  prepared question session whether the result

of  the  proposed referendum would  be  binding,  he

answered  that  only history could  decide.  A  very

smart  answer indeed; the true hallmark of  a  slick

lawyer.  But unfortunately such smartness  does  not

create  confidence. Why has the  Prime  Minister  on

more   than   one  occasion  betrayed  his   anxiety

regarding  the  success of the  Malaysia  proposals?

Sir,  it  is certainly not because of the  so-called

recent  advances why there should be  Malaysia.  The

reason  is  obvious. The Tunku has made  it  evident

that  there  will  be no merger of the  P.A.P. type

without his type of Malaysia coming into being. Sir,

should Malaysia fail, his attempt to hide behind  an

unfair constitutional arrangement will fail and thus

he  will meet his political doom. Sir, his political

survival  now  does  not depend  on  the  people  of

Singapore but on the Tunku. He hopes that the Tunku,

being  a  generous man and who is ever so  eager  to

refer industrial disputes to his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



Minister  of  Internal  Security  and  not  to   his

Minister   of  Labour,  would  remove  the  P.A.P.'s

opponents,  namely, those in the  Barisan  Sosialis,

and  thus  guarantee him another span  of  political

life   Such  is  the  selfish  aim  of  the   P.A.P.

leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not quite certain what

the Member for Thomson said. Is he alleging that the

Prime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya is going

to  do all those things, or is he alleging that  the

Prime  Minister of Singapore would request the Tunku

to  do  all  those things? There is  quite  a  great

difference in that. Can I have an answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was not suggesting that. This is a

possibility   that  is  likely   to   happen,   Sir,

especially when the Prime Minister of the Federation

of  Malaya  himself has indicated in the  debate  in

Parliament that he may help the Singapore Government

to   reduce  the  number  of  strikes  and  so   on,

especially  in  view of what our own Prime  Minister

has  said  in this Chamber, that in 1962 many  other

things  are going to happen. I was merely suggesting

that  it  is  a  possibility for  Singapore  to  see

repression in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point that the Chair must make,

and  make very strongly, is that direct insinuations

of  improper  conduct  by  a  Prime  Minister  of  a

friendly country is completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not in any way

insinuate improper conduct on the part of the  Prime

Minister  of the Federation of Malaya. Sir,  in  the

past  few months, various reasons have been advanced

why  the  people  of  Singapore, Brunei,  Sabah  and

Sarawak should accept the Malaysia proposals of  the

Prime   Minister  of  the  Federation   of   Malaya,

proposals  which  are backed  to  the  hilt  by  the

British  Colonial Office and the leadership  of  the

P.A.P. In brief, Sir, these reasons are, to sum them

up:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. That it will bring prosperity to the peoples of

this Federation of Malaysia;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. These countries, if independent, cannot survive

for long in the present world situation; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. That Malaysia is a way of acquiring

independence   for  the  peoples  of   the   Borneo

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall deal with these so-called reasons one

by  one  and  show that they are just  mere  excuses

clearly presented so as to hide the ulterior motives

of the sponsors of Malaysia - the Alliance Government,

the British Government and the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the excuses put forward is that

Malaysia  will  bring about economic prosperity  for

all.  If you will remember, the Minister for Culture

spent  a  considerable time yesterday expounding  on

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ills of our country stem directly from the

economic  system under which we live. A  large  area

with  a bigger population cannot by themselves solve

our  economic  problems. This is  elementary.  India

with  its  large population and land mass  is  faced

with just as grave economic ills. The only way these

economic problems can be solved is by substituting a

planned economy for a capitalist economy. In  short,

only with the success, in my view, of socialism over

capitalism  can  there be prosperity  for  all.  The

P.A.P. still  claims  to be a socialist  Party  and

claims to be in favour of a planned economy. Do they

seriously maintain that the plan of Malaysia, voiced

first  in the open by the Tunku and supported  later

by  the  Colonial  Office, has as  its  objective  a

planned economy for this region? The Tunku does  not

believe  in  socialism. He represents  a  Right-wing

Party  and has openly said so. One can hardly expect

the  British  to encourage socialism in  this  area.

Furthermore,  this Malaysia Plan is opposed  by  all

Left-wing  Parties  in  the Borneo  territories  and

supported only by some Right-wing reactionaries. Can

the  P.A.P. therefore honestly claim that this  plan

will  promote the cause of socialism, a  cause  they

claim  to believe in? Why have they found themselves

in  the camp of the Right-wing forces? Even in  this

Assembly their staunch supporters are.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



the  Right-wing reactionary elements in the  S.P.A.,

the  very  man whom only a couple of years ago  they

treated with contempt. Sir, the only explanation  is

that  because of their selfish desire to  remain  in

office,  they  are prepared to put forward  whatever

excuses they can think of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument advanced by the P.A.P. leaders

and  also by the colonial administration in  Sarawak

is  that  the  Borneo territories,  if  independent,

cannot  survive in the present world situation.  The

P.A.P. and the Federation Government are trying  to

whip  up an anti-Communist campaign hoping to  scare

everybody  into accepting their Malaysia.  They  are

trying to sell the falsehood that if we do not  join

in  the  Malaysia scheme of things, we will  all  be

swallowed  up by the Communists. They say the  small

countries  nowadays  cannot  survive  without  being

conquered  by  the Communists. So they  say.  "Come,

leave the Communists; the Federation Government will

protect  you." But the people of Singapore  and  the

Borneo   territories  are  now  burdened  not   with

Communism, but with colonialism. What they  want  to

do  is to get rid of colonialism straightaway.  Does

this  Malaysia  scheme really get  rid  of  colonial

exploitation?  We find the colonial power  is  among

the  most enthusiastic people behind the scheme.  It

is  obvious  that this Malaysia scheme is  going  to

perpetuate colonialism in disguise. Sir, none  other

than  the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya

himself has said he fully appreciates the fact  that

the colonial power has much vested interests in this

area  which it wishes to protect. The Tunku has made

it  clear  that  he  is not going  to  harm  British

economic  interest in this area. Sir,  the  crux  of

colonial   exploitation   lies   in   the   economic

domination of our people by the colonial power,  and

political  power will have no meaning whatsoever  if

we  are not going to attain economic independence at

the  same  time. But it is this economic  domination

over  the people that this Malaysia scheme is  aimed

at perpetuating.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



Or  for  what else, Sir, could the,  colonial

power  be so enthusiastic over this scheme? In other

words, what the Federation Government and the P.A.P.

want  us  to  accept is, in fact, a continuation  of

colonial economic exploitation of our people for the

exchange  of protection against a ghost enemy.  Sir,

must  our  people pay this heavy price as protection

money?  Sir,  we  see around us in Asia  and  Africa

numerous   small  nations  surviving  by  themselves

without   having  to  allow  their  former  colonial

masters to continue to exploit the people. Are these

nations  of  the  Afro-Asia group  faced  with  this

fictitious  danger of Communism? No,  Sir,In  this

world  of nuclear weapons, no nation other than  the

big  powers  can  really protect themselves  from  a

nuclear  onslaught.  Today  the  biggest  protection

force  is  the weight of world opinion. It  is  this

force  that  is  really  protecting  the  small  and

neutral  nations  of Afro-Asia.  They  realise  that

economic  freedom is the real aim of the people  and

that their countries cannot really be considered  as

being independent until, they have achieved economic

independence. To be linked economically  to  Western

capitalist nations is certainly not going to achieve

freedom for the broad masses of our people. And what

our   people   right  now  want  is   the   complete

eradication of colonial exploitation of our country.

What  our  people are faced with today  is  colonial

exploitation.  No  political freedom  can  have  any

meaning whatsoever to our people if it does not seek

to remove the economic exploitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can our people be convinced by the Tunku

and  the P.A.P. leaders that they will be free under

this  Malaysia scheme when they know that they  will

still continue to be exploited by the colonial power

in  disguise? It is no use trying to ask us to fight

some  fictitious enemy when we are not going  to  be

freed  from  our present enemy  - the colonial  power.

Thus the Communist scare is so transparent that even

the  British Government does not come to mention  it

in  the  publication "Malaysia and Sarawak"  by  the

British Government of Sarawak in January this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



year.  No mention is made of this aspect in all  its

six pages extolling the advantages of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister of Singapore has on more

than one occasion drawn the analogy between oil-rich

Brunei and oil-rich Kuwait which, as we all know, is

being  claimed  by  Iraq. Sir,  whom  &es  he  think

threatens Brunei or harbours evil intentions towards

Brunei?  Sir,  this is deliberately  being  done  to

substantiate  his  claim that no  small  independent

nation   can   survive  under  the   present   world

situation.



<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is obvious whom he is

referring to. Iraq is too far away to lay  claim  to

Brunei.  The  country which they point  an  accusing

finger at but would not name is obviously Indonesia.

This  attitude  is not the way to  the  building  of

friendly  ties and relationship between  neighbours.

Sir, Indonesia has made it amply clear to the people

of  Brunei  and to all others that they  harbour  no

such intentions, and I do not see any reason why  we

should not accept such policies at their face value.

Sir, no nation which treasures the friendship of its

neighbours should point a suspecting finger at them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third argument - in my opinion perhaps one

of  the strongest arguments - put forward for Malaysia

as proposed by the Tunku is that the people of these

territories would become independent. Sir, this plan

is  put  forward as an anti-colonial effort to  help

the  subject  people  of  the  British  colonies  to

achieve   independence.  This   plan   unfortunately

becomes suspect if for no other reason than that  it

has  the full backing of the colonial government  It

is like asking the British to kick themselves out of

Borneo.  Sir,  such  logic  is  an  insult  to   the

intelligence   of   the   people   of   the   Borneo

territories.   Let   us  credit   them   with   more

intelligence. We have heard that the declared aim of

the British Government is to grant independence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



to all colonial territories as soon as they

are  ready for it. We all know that the Indians were

never ready for it until they were prepared to throw

the British out by force. The recent examples of Goa

and  West  Irian  merely prove one  thing,  that  no

colonial   power  wants  to  give  away  a  colonial

concession unless and until she is forced to get out

one way or the other - by peaceful means or by the use

of  armed might. But, for argument purposes, even if

we  are  prepared  to  ignore historical  facts  and

accept British propaganda as gospel truth, then  the

logical conclusion would be that if by Malaysia  the

people of these British colonies can be independent,

then  these  same  people must be judged  ready  for

independence  today.  The colonial  government  must

agree  to  this as they openly support  the  Tunku's

proposals for Malaysia. Why then if these people are

ready  for independence do the British still  refuse

to  give them independence? Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

why  must  they be given independence  only  if  the

Federation  Government can control  them?  Sir,  the

answer  is  very clear. The British are afraid  that

the  people  of the Borneo territories  may  try  to

achieve  genuine independence, independence that  is

both  political and economic. The British  want  the

system of exploitation to continue. They want to see

their   super   profits   from   their   investments

guaranteed,  and  the  Alliance  Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya, now hand in glove  with  the

once  socialist-inclined P.A.P., have proved  to  be

the best local group to look after British financial

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how can anyone seriously

believe  that  the Malaysia Plan as proposed  is  an

anti-colonial step to help the people of the  Borneo

territories  to achieve independence?  Sir,  if  the

P.A.P. and  the Alliance Government  are  genuinely

sincere  in wanting to set the people of the  Borneo

territories free, if they sincerely believe in their

anti-colonial talk, then the obvious course for them

is to support the popular movement in this territory

and  fight  for the principle of self-determination,

especially when all the

independence first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the line can be drawn-the Sarawak United

does the P.A.P. stand?

that they want to co-operate with the other Parties,

for  if  that  is the case, then it is an  admission

that  they  want  to co-operate with the  Right-wing

Parties  because, apart from the socialist  Parties,

the  other Parties have openly declared their  stand

as Right-wing Parties.

territories  is  hardly  the  way  to   gain   their

confidence and support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that the people of Brunei, Sarawak

and  Sabah  know  what is good  for  themselves.  We

believe  they  must be allowed to decide  their  own

destiny  themselves.  Therefore,  any  proposal  for

Malaysia  must  be negotiated directly  between  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Barisan Sosialis believes in

the   concept   of  a  Malaysia  that  will   really

facilitate  economic planning and  advancement.  But

this does not mean that we support the proposals  of

Malaysia as put forward by the Prime Minister of the

Federation  of Malaya. These proposals, as  we  have

pointed  out,  do not guarantee democracy,  equality

and  freedom  for all the peoples of  this  proposed

federation.  We  have debated in  great  detail  the

P.A.P.'s  proposals. I do not intend to go over  the

arguments   again.  Suffice  it  to   mention   that

Singapore,  according  to the  Tunku,  will  not  be

admitted  as a full member hut as a State with  less

rights  than the others; in short, with an  inferior

status. Malaysia can only succeed if all the peoples

of   the  territories  voluntarily  agree  to   come

together. It can only be successful if it guarantees

equality and democracy to all. To thrust the  scheme

agreed  to beforehand by the British Government  and

the  Alliance  and the P.A.P. on the people  without

their having the right to choose can serve only  the

ulterior  motives  of  these plotters  and  not  the

interests of the peoples of these territories.

text and to take time to reply to every interjection

that  he makes. But I do not want to do that because

I  think the time of this House should not be  spent

you  will  have noted that on the West Irian  issue,

when   I   was   speaking,  the   Prime   Minister's

interruptions were clear-cut indications that it was

he who was trying to wreck the system. It was he who

wanted  the debate to be carried out with no  regard

to  the  rules of debate, and not we who are accused

of  being  Communists. Sir,  I  tell  this  for  the

information  of  the Minister for  Finance  and  the

other -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is

convenient  for  the  hon. Member  to  just  confine

himself  to  the  motion. If  he  can  ignore  these

interjections,  the  quicker  will  the  debate   be

disposed of.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I shall once again accept the advice of

the   Chair  and  ignore  these  interjections.  The

principles of the Tunku's proposals are at  variance

with  democracy. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  they  are

not  principles  which anyone who  believes  in  the

right  of  people  to choose their own  destiny  can

support.  Sir, as my Party Chairman, the Member  for

Queenstown,  has  said, we must not  fall  into  the

P.A.P. propaganda trap of crying high and low  about

the   principle  of  Malaysia.  The   P.A.P. wants

everybody  to get tangled in the so-called principle

so  that they will be unwittingly made to appear  as

though  they  are  supporting the  present  Malaysia

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other day the Prime Minister appeared

extremely happy when the Member for Anson moved  his

amendment,  and became even happier when the  Member

for  Hong  Lim supported it. Mr Deputy Speaker,  it

will   be  recalled  that  even  though  both  these

speakers strongly condemn the P.A.P.'s White  Paper,

the  Prime Minister was so happy. The answer to  the

Prime Minister's happiness is very simple. The Prime

Minister  knows that these two Parties  have  fallen

into   the  P.A.P. propaganda  trap  and  are   now

unwittingly confusing the people on this  issue.  We

in  the  Barisan  Sosialis are  more  aware  of  the

cunning  of  the Prime Minister and his  treacherous

tactics. We in the Barisan Sosialis are not going to

fall into the P.A.P. propaganda trap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as Singapore is concerned, merger and

Malaysia mean one and the same thing. That  is,  the

P.A.P.'s  so-called  merger. We  have  very  clearly

stated   our  attitude  to  this  so-called   merger

arrangement  in this Assembly. In short,  we  reject

the  proposals made by the P.A.P. Government and  we

are certain that the people share our views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before the House is not one that

involves the mere selection of appropriate words. We

are  not  arguing  over the niceties  of  words  and

phrases  in themselves. Therefore, whether the  word

"plan"  is  replaced by the word "motion",  or  what

have  you,  it  will  not affect  one  wee  bit  the

Malaysia  that is intended to be put into  practice.

The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Anson  has moved an amendment.  In  our

view,  that amendment does not change the  form  and

content of the Malaysia that will materialise  after

it comes into being. Sir, I must say that we are not

interested in what Malaysia is going to look like on

paper.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Serjeant-at-Arms see that silence is maintained in the Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As practical people, we are more

concerned  with  what  Malaysia  actually  means  in

practice  to  our people. As everybody  has  agreed,

Malaysia  in  practice  means  the  P.A.P. type  of

merger,  the  White Paper that was debated  in  this

Assembly  for 13 days. Therefore, I tell the  United

People's  Party and the Workers' Party  that  it  is

useless for any one to close his eyes to reality and

say,  "I  oppose the P.A.P. merger,  but  I  support

Tunku's Malaysia." We in the Barisan Sosialis do not

want  to participate in amending the motion because,

to  us, it is not going to change the material  form

of  Malaysia  in practice. Therefore,  Sir,  in  the

voting  on the amendment, we shall abstain,  and  we

shall vote against the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we see it, those who

reject  the  White Paper must logically oppose  this

motion.  There  is no alternative.  The  concept  of

Malaysia  should not be confused with the  principle

of the Tunku's Malaysia. The Tunku's Malaysia, as  I

said  earlier, is not based on equality,  democracy,

mutual respect and self-determination.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Deputy Speaker, during the debate on West Irian,

the  Member for Thomson sought to draw a distinction

between  the  efforts  of the  nationalists  in  the

Federation  of Malaya and Singapore and  the  Borneo

territories to create a sovereign independent  State

of  the  Federation of Malaysia and the struggle  of

the Indonesian people against Dutch colonialism.  He

said that whilst the nationalists of Indonesia could

he  praised because they were engaged in a  struggle

with the Dutch, their former



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



colonial  oppressors, the so-called nationalists  in

our   territories,  were  entering  into   collusive

arrangements  with the British for  the  purpose  of

achieving their dishonourable aims. In the course of

this  debate this evening he has also made the  same

charge.  Sir,  there  may be  many  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  who  may  have  good  cause  to  fear  the

policies  of  the Federation Government in  internal

security  matters. The Member for Thomson  can  talk

till  the cows come home, but he will never be  able

to  convince even a schoolboy that the Federation of

Malaya  is  not  a truly nationalist  State  with  a

nationalist  Government  in  control.  It  does  not

matter  what  he  thinks about  the  Tunku  and  his

Government. He may say that the Tunku has  a  Right-wing Government in the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is what the Tunku has.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> But he cannot deny that the Tunku heads

a  truly  nationalist Government in the  Federation.

Can anyone who takes this view of the united efforts

of  the nationalists in the Federation of Malaya  to

give  a  helping  hand  to their  kith  and  kin  in

territories still now under colonial rule to  attain

their  freedom  by  integration with  the  sovereign

independent State of the Federation of Malaya,  ever

be  believed  when he claims that he  is  a  Malayan

nationalist  at heart? Does the Member  for  Thomson

suggest  that the nationalist Government in  control

of the Federation of Malaya would ever want to enter

into  collusive arrangements with a colonial  power,

under  whom  the  members of their  Government  have

suffered   in  the  past,  to  take  over   colonial

possessions of the colonial power for the purpose of

perpetuating colonial rule under a new form? Does he

also  suggest  that any self-respecting nationalists

in  the  territories  now under colonial  subjection

would  ever  agree  to trade one  form  of  colonial

subjection for another? Only Communists who fear the

nationalists make such baseless charges to smear the

nationalists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson

considers the Malaysian proposals to be a diabolical

plot by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



the  British and their colonial stooges to deny  the

peoples  of Singapore, Sabah, Brunei and Sarawak  of

their  right  to self-determination and freedom.  He

said  the  Malaysian idea was a threat to Indonesia.

He  also said that the idea of Malaysia was not  new

because  the  anti-colonial  fighters  of  1945  had

mooted  the idea of a Greater Indonesia which  would

include these territories. Would he date to  say  in

this  House  that  he  prefers  a  merger  of  these

territories  with  Indonesia to a  merger  of  these

territories with the Federation of Malaya? Why  does

he  talk in riddles? We still have freedom of speech

in  this  House. He should have the courage  to  say

what he really wants to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown

said  in this House that the Malaysia that is  being

unfolded before our eyes is not a Malaysia  that  is

going  to  bring  equality, freedom,  democracy  and

social  justice  to the people of Singapore,  Sabah,

Borneo  and Sarawak, but, on the contrary, is  going

to   spread  reaction,  injustice,  inequality   and

disunity  among these peoples. It is the same  voice

which  gives  expression to such feelings  of  great

despair  which has also accused us of having  failed

in our duty to the people of Singapore in not having

made uncompromising demands for complete merger  and

with   internal  security  in  the  hands   of   the

Government  of  the Federation of  Malaya.  In  this

House  I have listened to a lot of double-talk  from

Members  of the Barisan Sosialis opposite, but  none

of  the  double-talk I have listened to so  far  can

equal  this  in sheer impudence. "Let  it  be  quite

clearly  understood," said the  Member  for  Queens-town, "that we do not object to the Malaysia concept

as  a  concept." What he was not bold enough to  say

during the merger debate was that the Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis  believe  in  merger  also  as   a

concept.  But that would have been letting  the  cat

out  of  the  bag.  Let  us always  be  honest  with

ourselves  and  with the people  whom  we  claim  to

represent.  The trouble with Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis is that they always suffer from a  loss  of

memory.  They have forgotten the stand  of  the  six

trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



unionists  on  the  merger  issue.  The  six   trade

unionists  who  control  the Barisan  Sosialis  have

publicly stated that they want not independence, not

freedom   from   colonial  domination,   but   self-government with local autonomy in internal  security

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, when the Tunku made it quite

clear  that if there was no Malaysia there would  be

no  merger. Members of the Barisan Sosialis began to

talk  about their loose confederation of independent

States  with  local  autonomy in  internal  security

matters.  This also they have now quite conveniently

forgotten. As the idea of Malaysia begins to  emerge

in  practical form, the leaders of the Ban-san,  who

were quite content to see Singapore remain a British

Colony,  have  now assumed the role of anti-colonial

fighters.  They  now  say  they  disapprove  of  the

Malaysia  proposal because it would bring injustice,

inequality, disunity, and a loss of freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, honest men do not chop and change with such

agility  and  with such a lack of  grace  when  they

publicly take a stand on any public issue.  If  they

make  a  stand at all, they stick to it to the  end.

All  these  posturings  have been  forced  upon  the

Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis because  they  are

trying to conceal the truth which they fear, that if

Malaysia  takes shape, it will not be the people  of

Singapore  who  will be in danger  of  losing  their

civic rights or any of the economic advantages which

they  at  present  enjoy, but it will  be  the  real

leaders of the Barisan Sosialis who are not in  this

Assembly  and  their stooges in  this  Assembly  who

would find themselves in a position of dire peril.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has expressed great concern

at  the fact that on this motion the Members of  the

Barisan  Sosialis stand alone, having parted company

with  the  Member for Anson and the Member for  Hong

Lim.  Those who pretend to be nationalists  and,  at

the  same time, try to frustrate the aspirations  of

all true nationalists should not have any reason  to

complain  if  they  find  themselves  in  this  very

awkward  position. We as nationalists  unequivocably

support the motion before the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



and  deplore the insincerity of the anti-nationalist

attitude adopted by the real leaders of the  Barisan

Sosialis outside this House and their dupes in  this

House on the Malaysia issue.



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the motion before the House, as far as  I  can

understand it, merely seeks from the House  approval

in   principle  of  the  concept  of  Malaysia.   En

understanding the debate that has now ensued on this

motion,  which  has  now  lasted  two  days,  it  is

important to focus the discussion on this motion  in

relation to the debate that took place on the motion

for  merger with the Federation. In that motion, Mr

Deputy  Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis, who were  the

principal  opponents  of  that  particular   motion,

argued that they accepted the concept of merger with

the  Federation, but objected to the particular form

in  which  the merger was proposed. Their  principal

objection   to  the  form  was  in  the  citizenship

proposal  which  the  Tunku  had  suggested  as  the

maximum  he could concede to the State of Singapore.

At  the same time, the Barisan Sosialis also made it

quite clear that if the Tunku was prepared to accept

Singapore  as the twelfth State, they would  support

the motion then before the House wholeheartedly.  At

that time, the argument was put forward that if  the

Tunku had offered Singapore the same terms which  he

was  then  offering  to the Bornean  territories - the

Tunku  had  said  that he would take  in  the  three

Borneo territories as the twelfth, thirteenth and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



fourteenth  States - they, the  Barisan,  said  in  no

uncertain   terms  that  they  would   support   the

proposals wholeheartedly. So that, at that time, the

argument,  as  I understood it, emanating  from  the

Barisan  Sosialis was that they supported the  whole

idea,  conception and plan put forward by the  Tunku

for  Malaysia. The only point on which  the  Barisan

Sosialis  did not agree with the Tunku was that  the

citizenship proposals for Singapore were inferior to

the    citizenship   proposals   of   the    Bornean

territories,  and,  therefore,  they   opposed   it.

Therefore,  on  the  basis  of  that  debate.  I  am

entitled to assume that at that particular juncture,

there  was  no suggestion that the people of  Borneo

should  be consulted, that there should be elections

in   Borneo.  At  that  time,  there  was  no   such

suggestion.  If  the  Tunku  had  then  said,   "You

Singapore  come in as the twelfth State;  the  three

Bornean  territories  come  in  as  the  thirteenth,

fourteenth  and  fifteenth  States,  then  I  think,

according  to  the propositions put forward  by  the

Barisan Sosialis at that time, the whole House would

have  agreed on the concept of Malaysia, and  agreed

in principle to Malaysia and the plan for Malaysia -
