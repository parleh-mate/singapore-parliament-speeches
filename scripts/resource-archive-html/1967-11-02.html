<div align="center"><b>HONG KONG INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENTS IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether Hong Kong industrialists who  have

shown   interest  in  industrial  investments   in

Singapore  have  merely made  enquiries  from  the

Economic  Development Board or whether  they  have

made  any  commitments to establish  factories  in

Singapore, and  if he will make  a  statement  on

developments  in this connection in the  last  two

months.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, of the large number of

Hong   Kong   industrialists  who  have   recently

approached  the  Economic Development  Board  with

investment  proposals,  86  have  entered  into  a

serious  commitment  to  establish  a  factory  in

Singapore. This commitment constitutes either site

acquisition  or site and building acquisition.  In

addition, most  of  these  have   entered   into

partnerships with Singapore industrialists and,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



in  a  good  number of instances, orders  for  the

purchase  of  equipment and  machinery  have  been

placed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total capital investment of these 86

enterprises, excluding the cost of land, comes  to

$49  million. Being largely labour intensive, they

will provide many jobs for this sum, 8,000 in  the

initial phase and 13,600 when at full production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 86 firms in terms of size of capital

investment may be classified as follows:



<pre>

            Investment of $ 1 million or more                  17

            Investment of $ ½ million to under $1 million      13

            Investment of $200,000 to under $½ million         44

            Under $200,000                                     12

                                                               --

                        Total                                  86

                                                               ==

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects cover a wide field. To mention only

a    few,    they   include   building   hardware,

electronics, pharmaceuticals, clocks and  watches,

toys,  various machinery and engineering products,

synthetic fibres, and printing and publishing. The

figures  I  give  represent the  position  at  the

latest count. The number will no doubt increase as

the  more recent arrivals firm up their investment

arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One feature of these new projects is that the

larger  part  of  the output is produced  for  the

export   market.  Hong  Kong  industrialists   are

reputed for their fine competitive performance  in

world  markets. They are the kind of entrepreneurs

any  sensible developing country would be glad  to

have,  and  Singapore extends a  warm  welcome  to

them.  We  shall  do  all we  can  to  make  their

ventures in Singapore successful and profitable.

<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY SCHOOL LEAVING EXAMINATION IN 1967</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Secondary school places and postings)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  all  students  who  pass   the

Primary School



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



Leaving Examination this year will be given places

in  secondary schools; whether he is aware of  the

many  cases in previous years where students  were

posted  to  secondary schools far away from  their

homes;  and what steps he will take to  prevent  a

similar situation this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, it is

expected  that, subject to adequate  provision  in

the  1968  Budget for education, every Primary  VI

pupil  in  Singapore  who  is  successful  in  the

Primary School Leaving Examination this year  will

be   given   a  place  in  a  secondary  academic,

technical  or  vocational school. However,  it  is

obviously not possible to meet the wishes of every

parent  in  regard to the choice of  a  particular

school.   No  system  of  allocation  can   please

everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of allocation for the Chinese

and  English streams, which has been in  operation

since 1965, is processed by computers. It is based

on  the  choice exercised by the parents  and  the

results of the Primary School Leaving Examination.

Under  this system the vast majority of successful

candidates  are  posted to schools  of  their  own

choice.  For example, in 1966, out of a  total  of

32,602  successful candidates, 21,074 were  posted

to  schools  according to their first choice,  and

6,036   were  posted  according  to  their  second

choice. Only 5,492 or 16.8 per cent were posted to

schools  other  than  their  choice,  because  all

vacancies  in  the  schools of their  choice  were

taken  up by other candidates with better  results

in  the Primary School Leaving Examination.  Among

the  5,492  pupils who failed to  secure  a  place

under  their first as well as second choice, about

5,200 applied for transfers. Of these, 4,600  were

approved  and  only  600 could  not  be  approved,

because all vacancies in schools near their  homes

had  already  been taken up by other  pupils  with

better examination results.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just

now  the  Minister  has  said  that,  subject   to

adequate provision in the 1968 Budget, it  appears

that  all  students who passed the Primary  School

Leaving  Examination would be given places.  Could

the  Minister  be more explicit in explaining  the

phrase "subject to adequate provision in the  1968

Budget"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Punggol knows exactly  what  I  mean.

There is no need to explain in further detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Can the Minister say whether it

is   correct  that,  should  there  be  inadequate

provision in the 1968 Budget, all students may not

be given places in the secondary schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The Minister for Finance has

already answered for me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

completely  agree with the Minister for  Education

that  the Government cannot, of course, accede  to

the  request of the parents to send their children

to  the schools of their choice. But at the end of

the year of the school term, there is a great mess

in  the  postings of students from one  school  to

another  school.  I  can  quote  an  example.  For

instance, if a student is staying in Jurong, he is

posted  to St. Anthony's School, whereas,  on  the

other  hand, a student staying somewhere  in  Bras

Basah Road is posted to Jurong School.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, can we have your

supplementary question, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> What I am complaining about is

the  posting  system.  Although  the  Ministry  of

Education -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If you want to make a complaint, Mr

Ho, there  are other procedural methods available

to  you. But if you have a supplementary question,

please frame it quickly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Will the Minister give an

assurance  to  the House that after having  posted

the  students to a school very far away from their

homes  and  that if the parents are able  to  find

vacancies in another school which is very close to

their  homes,  the  Ministry  of  Education   will

rectify the wrong postings? This is the question I

am asking the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is

precisely what my Ministry has been doing for  the

past  few  years.  For instance, early  this  year

5,200  students applied for transfer, and of  this

number,  4,600  were approved. That,  I  am  sure,

answers the point of the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> According to the

Minister, it seems that even if adequate provision

is  made  in  1968,  there is a possibility  of  a

certain number of children being posted to schools

very   far  away  from  their  homes.  Under  such

circumstances, will the Minister give an assurance

that  where  the  poor parents cannot  send  their

children  to  distant schools, the  Ministry  will

consider  giving  a  transport  bursary   to   the

children?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the affected

pupils  can always apply for a transport  bursary,

and if they merit such an award, it will be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

satisfied  with  the  Minister's  answer   to   my

question asking him to clarify the very phrase  he

used in his reply just now. Is it or is it not the

policy  of  the  Government to  provide  secondary

education  to all those students who  have  passed

the  P.S.L.E.? The next question is this.  Is  the

Minister  satisfied  with the  system  of  posting

successful students in the P.S.L.E. and,  if  not,

will  he  take  steps to change the system  since,

over a period of two years, more than 5,000, as he

has  just  mentioned, have been posted  elsewhere?

Thirdly, -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ng, I think we had better have

answers to your first two questions before we come

to the third question. Mr Ong?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, taking the

second  question first. I am quite satisfied  with

the  present system. But if the Member for Punggol

can  suggest  a  better system, I am  prepared  to

consider it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the first question, while it is the policy

of the Government in the past few years to provide

a  place  for  every student who  has  passed  the

P.S.L.E., the position cannot be the same for  all

time.  Much depends on the economy of the  country

and  the state of its finances. I am sure  if  the

finances  of  the  State permit, we  will  provide

places  for  all those who can pass  the  P.S.L.E.

Otherwise, that is that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> As regards my suggestion to

rectify the system -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ng, I am afraid i will not let

you  go  into  that. I called you for  your  third

supplementary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, Sir. My third question is

this. Just now the Minister has mentioned that out

of  5,000-plus  students,  4,000  odd  were  given

places  as  a result of applications for transfer,

is  the Minister aware that quite a long period of

study  days  has  been lost as a result  of  these

students applying for transfers to schools  nearer

to their homes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a certain

amount  of study time might have been lost in  the

process  of  applying  for a  transfer,  but  that

cannot be helped. I do not think the time lost  is

in any way excessive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>STOPPING OF AUTOMATIC PROMOTION IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for

Education   whether  he  will  consider   stopping

automatic  promotion in primary schools especially

in promotions to Primary 2 and Primary 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the practice

of  automatic promotion was, in fact, abolished in

1959. Schools at present may retain pupils in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



Primaries  3,  4, 5 and 6. However,  retention  at

Primaries 1 and 2 level is at present not possible

for the following reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is the policy of the Government to

ensure  that  every Singapore citizen  who  is  of

school-going  age is given a place in  school.  As

the number of such children is enormous, it is not

possible  to  retain pupils in Primary  1  without

depriving  some of these school-going children  of

their places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is also considered unsound by

educationists to retain pupils at the end  of  the

first year in school for psychological reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Lim Tay Boh Commission of inquiry

recommended that the first three years of  primary

school   work  should  be  planned  as  a   single

coordinated  unit and the final  assessment  of  a

child's progress should be made at the end of  the

third year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  the  Minister  has  just  now  given  us  an

explanation.  But  I am not quite  satisfied  with

that, because we know that pupils in Primary 1 and

Primary   2  are  not  capable  of  thinking   for

themselves.  So  we should not allow  them  to  be

promoted  automatically if they are not qualified.

We  should  know that studying is like building  a

house. In order to build a multi-storey house, the

1  and Primary 2, which should be construed as the

foundation of a building, are not soundly laid,

his  opinion. But it runs counter to the views  of

with the work in Primary 3?

a  reasonably intelligent child cannot improve  in

the  second or third year. Perhaps the Member  for

Bras  Basah  should persuade parents  of  children

failing in the first year, i.e., Primary 1, to pay

more attention to their children's studies.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether  he  will  consider amending  the  Central

Provident Fund Ordinance to enable contributors to

withdraw monies due to them from the Fund  if  (a)

they   are   disabled  without  being  permanently

incapacitated from ever continuing in  employment;

or,  (b)  they are unemployed for periods of  less

than  two  years and are unable to establish  that

they  will never be re-employed in order to enable

such  persons  who so desire to  start  their  own

business  and thereby cease being burdens  on  the

welfare services of the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Central

Provident  Fund Ordinance was introduced  for  the

specific purpose of making provision for employees

in  their  old  age,  and it  was  not  originally

intended  that they should be allowed to  withdraw

before  they  reached  the  age  of  55.  However,

provision  has been made to permit withdrawals  on

death  or  where  it  appears  unlikely  that   an

employee will contribute to the Fund again. If the

request   made  by  the  hon.  Member   to   allow

withdrawals for the purpose of starting their  own

business  in  the two specific cases mentioned  by

him  is permitted, it would completely defeat  the

intention  behind the Ordinance.  Further,  it  is

pertinent  to  point out that if  withdrawals  are

permitted  for the purpose, their is no  guarantee

that  the  sums received, which are generally  not

substantial,  will not be lost or frittered  away.

If  this  were  to  happen, the workers  concerned

would  not have anything to protect them in  their

old age and they would, in all probability, become

a  burden on the welfare services of the Republic.

In the

Malaysia for good? Can they withdraw their money?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> If a person leaves Singapore

permanently  and is not coming back, it  is  quite

possible  for him to withdraw his money  from  the

Central  Provident Fund provided that he can  show

proof  that  he  is not coming  back  to  stay  in

Singapore any more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if a bona fide

contributor to the Central Provident Fund is in  a

very  difficult situation where he is in  need  of

money, will the Minister consider allowing him  to

withdraw  not the whole sum but, say, 50 per  cent

or  75  per cent of it in order to meet his needs?

For  instance, take the case of someone who  might

need a few thousand dollars to buy a house. In the

present  circumstances, unless he reaches the  age

of 55, he cannot touch his Provident Fund. I think

on  this aspect there must be flexibility  in  the

application of the C.P.F. Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the C.P.F.,

as  I  have said earlier, is mainly for a person's

old  age.  It  is not meant for insurance  of  any

kind.  If it is for a loan to start a business  or

just  to  tide him over some difficult periods,  a

parents   in  Singapore  are  disturbed   by   the

unhealthy  influence  on  their  children  of  the

"James  Bond" type of film and if he will consider

taking steps to prohibit the viewing of such films

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Board of

Film Censors responsible for the censoring of

films has informed me that, so far, no complaints

have been received from any quarter in regard to

the exhibition of the "James Bond" type of films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether such a type of films exerts an unhealthy

influence   is  a  matter  of  personal   opinion.

Therefore, if parents consider that such films do,

in  fact,  have  an unhealthy influence  on  their

children,   they  should  play   their   part   in

discouraging  their  children  from  seeing  these

films,  and  not  prevent the exhibition  of  such

films  for the enjoyment of other sections of  the

public  if the films are unobjectionable. Further,

in  our  multi-racial, multi-cultural  and  multi-religious society, Government feels that  it  will

not  be right for any one section of the community

to  impose  its  standard  of  morality  on  other

sections of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent only children from seeing such films

will  require films and audience to be  officially

classified. So far no official film classification

has  been  made in Singapore. Although there  have

been  prolonged  discussions with  exhibitors  and

distributors  on  the  subject  of  official  film

classification  in Singapore, this  has  not  been

adopted  not  only  because  film  exhibitors  and

distributors are against such classification,  but

also  because there are practical difficulties  in

implementing  a  film  classification  system   in

Singapore  where  the  bulk  of  the  cinema-going

public consists of the younger generation.  It  is

because   of   the   absence  of   official   film

classification and the awareness of the fact  that

the majority of film goers are youths and children

that the Board of Film Censors is very careful  to

ensure that all films passed for public exhibition

are  suitable for the viewing of both  adults  and

children  alike. As a matter of fact,  many  films

which  would otherwise be perfectly all  right  in

their  entirety for adults only have  to  be  cut,

because  of the fact that they would be accessible

to  children on release. The care taken applies to

in the Government Gazette and in cases where the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



value  of  the  project  is  estimated  to  exceed

$50,000, a tender notice is also advertised in the

Press.  Only  registered contractors are  selected

and may tender for public works. These contractors

are  selected and classified on the basis of sound

finance,    good   experience   and   satisfactory

performance for past work, technical knowledge and

availability of plant and good organising ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered contractors call personally with their

registration  cards to collect the various  tender

documents,    such    as   forms    of    tenders,

specifications, bills of quantities and  drawings.

To safeguard the secrecy of the competitive nature

of the tender system, all tenders must be enclosed

in  a  sealed envelope and deposited in the locked

tender  box  provided for the purpose  before  the

closing  time  for  receipt  of  tenders.  At  the

appointed  time  on the closing  date,  a  Tenders

Opening  Committee opens the tender box,  collects

the  tenders and opens them in the presence of all

the members. It is the duty of the Tenders Opening

Committee  to  number and initial each  and  every

tender received and to prepare a precis of tenders

containing  such information as the names  of  the

tenderers  and the amounts of tenders. The  precis

and  the  tender  forms  are  then  processed  and

recommendations  made to the  appropriate  Tenders

Board for consideration and decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of minor works valued at less than

$10,000, consideration for acceptance or rejection

is  undertaken  by an Assistant  Director  of  the

Public Works. After approval has been given by the

appropriate   Tenders  Board  or   the   Assistant

Director  of  Public  Works, checks  are  made  to

ensure  that the rates and the bills of quantities

and  schedule of rates are arithmetically correct.

These   approvals   are  then  conveyed   to   the

successful  tenderers  by  means  of  letters   of

acceptance,  and action is then taken  to  prepare

and sign the necessary contract documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system, as I have outlined, has worked

satisfactorily  and  there is  no  reason  why  it

should be changed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development whether the paid car-park

system introduced in Queenstown housing estate  is

satisfactory and whether it will be introduced  to

all other Housing and Development Board estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the short answer to

the two points raised by the Member for Jurong  is

`Yes'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paid car-park system introduced in Queenstown

housing estate is working satisfactorily and  will

be  introduced  to other Housing  and  Development

Board estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, necessary to elaborate on the

policy  of  the  Government  with  regard  to  the

provision of car parks in Housing Board estates in

order  to dispel some wrong impressions that might

have  been  created following the introduction  of

the  paid-car-park system in Queenstown. Free  car

parks are provided in central localities and  near

to shopping facilities in Housing Board estates as

part and parcel of the approved layout. These  car

parks  are made up to approved standards and taken

over  by  the P.W.D. Instead of providing one  car

park   for   each  flat  as  required  in   luxury

apartments, in the low-cost housing estates of the

Board  the  ratio is one car park for  each  seven

flats.  On  this  basis the car parking  and  road

network of Queenstown has been planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years the income of people living in

flats  in  Queenstown has increased and  more  and

more  of  them have bought motor-cars.  There  has

also been a considerable increase in the number of

pirate  taxis.  As a result, in Queenstown  motor-cars overflowed from the available car parks on to

the public roads, causing traffic congestion. Many

complaints  were received and the  traffic  police

had   difficulty  in  sorting  out  this   traffic

problem.  Initially a one-way traffic  system  was

introduced, but even this proved to be  inadequate

when cars



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



were parked on both sides of one-way streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce congestion, it was decided to draw

white lines on the roads in order that these roads

would not be blocked. It was anticipated that  the

drawing  of  white lines on these one-way  streets

would  result  in motor-cars having difficulty  in

finding parking places. Some provision, therefore,

had to be made to accommodate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two lots of Housing Board land which had been set

aside   for   other   purposes  were,   therefore,

converted into car parks for those prepared to pay

a  small fee to park their cars in these two lots.

These  two lots can accommodate 185 and  250  cars

respectively.  On the1st of July  this  year,  the

tenants  of  Queenstown were invited, if  they  so

wished,  to  put their cars in these parking  lots

for  a  fee  of  $12  per  month.  The  fees  were

determined  on  the  basis  that  costs  will   be

recovered over a period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first three months, of the 435 lots

provided, an average of about 200 lots were  taken

up.  The  Board  expects that  there  will  be  no

difficulty, once the tenants get used to the  idea

of parking in these lots, for the lots to be fully

occupied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other housing estates where open space or

suitable  land  is  available, similar  facilities

will  be  provided  and a fee charged  to  recover

costs.  In  Tiong Bahru Estate car-parking  sticks

are  provided with parking lots and are rented out

to  the tenants at $5 and $10 in parking areas  in

Moh  Guan  Terrace, Guan Chuan, Eng Hoon  and  Eng

Watt  Streets.  It  is  also  planned  to  provide

similar paid car-parking lots in MacPherson Estate

and in Toa Payoh.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Is it the

intention of the Ministry to use the meter  system

for car parking in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I take it that the Member is not

merely  referring to Housing Board estates but  to

car parking in the whole of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no intention to replace car-park

attendants with car-parking meters, but we  intend

to  start  a little experiment to test car-parking

meters. I can assure the Member that it will  only

be  an  experiment. We will be trying  it  out  in

places like High Street where the meters will  not

be  damaged  or stolen. But I repeat - it  will  be

only an experiment and we will continue to use car-parking  attendants  and provide  some  employment

rather than replace these attendants with meters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Regarding payment

for  car parking and the building of parking lots,

of  course, the tenants are very grateful. But the

fees  levied are a bit high because it is  getting

more and more difficult to earn a living nowadays,

and on top of that the tenants have to pay quite a

high  fee  for parking. Therefore, I suggest  that

the fee should be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards car parking in Tiong Bahru, many

tenants have complained to me that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Mr Lee, could you

please resume your seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Barker, if I may assist the hon.

Member  with  his supplementary, his question  is:

will  you  consider reducing car-parking  fees  at

Tiong Bahru?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought we were

discussing  the  introduction of car  parks!  But,

like  the  hon. Member for Tiong Bahru,  the  hon.

Member for Queenstown has also been approached  by

his   Citizens'  Consultative  Committee  and  the

residents of Queenstown to try to get these  car-parking fees reduced. But these are the fees  that

have been calculated by the Board to recover their

costs  of building the car park and providing  for

its maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that the Board is not

making any profit out of the fees charged at Tiong

Bahru or Queenstown. But representations have been

made.  This  is  the  first  representation  I  am

hearing from Tiong Bahru,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



and  I  will ask the Board to consider whether  or

not they can reduce the parking fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what really surprises me, Sir, is the number

of  cars that are at present around Housing  Board

estates.  The flats are meant to be for the  lower

income  group, and yet many of them can afford  to

buy  cars.  And if they can afford  to  buy  cars,

surely they can afford to pay $12 a month.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Can the Minister

inform  the  House whether security  measures  are

provided in this paid car park?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> By "security", I assume the Member is

asking  whether there are car-park  attendants  or

guards.  I assure him there are. For instance,  in

Queens-town  we employ 12 car-park attendants  and

they  work  for  24  hours on three  shifts  - four

attendants  at a time. So if you pay your  $12  in

Queenstown and put your car in this car-park,  you

are assured of better protection than if you leave

it on the main road.

the  car is hijacked by someone, will they  accept

the claim from the owner of the car?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I can assure the Member for Bras

responsibility according to the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, if you are

thinking of doing business on such terms, then  it

is  not  profitable. Here you are charging  $12  a

month as a parking fee and, in addition, you  have

to  hire three-shift workers to look after the car

park  and  also give a policy - something  like  an

insurance policy - to meet the claim of a  motorist

whose  car  has  been hijacked. I  say  that  that

policy is no good, and we had better abandon it.

<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, on the 14th

December  last year I informed the House that  the

Corrupt   Practices   Investigation   Bureau   was

conducting  investigations  into  certain  alleged

malpractices    in   connection   with    building

construction  carried  out  by  the  Housing   and

Development  Board. These investigations  followed

information  received  in  August  1966   by   the C.P.I.B.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



about  certain  piling work carried  out  for  the

Board  by  Gammon (Malaya) Ltd., a firm of  piling

contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of these investigations revealed that

there had been extensive malpractices resulting in

considerable over-payments by the Board to  Gammon

under  the  terms  of  the  various  contracts  in

question.  As  soon  as  sufficient  evidence  was

available from the C.P.I.B., steps were  taken  to

uncover and measure a small number of piles at Toa

Payoh.   The  results  of  these  physical   tests

confirmed  the  findings of the  C.P.I.B. and  in

December 1966 Gammon were informed that they would

be held responsible. Discussions were held between

the  Board and Gammon and between their respective

legal  advisers, as a result of which  early  this

year  Gammon  agreed to accept full liability  for

all over-payments for any structural defects which

might  arise as a result of inadequate piling  and

for  further incidental expenses incurred  by  the

Board  as  a result of the delay in completion  of

certain of the contracts. Gammon also undertook to

bear  the full cost of any investigation necessary

to establish the extent of the over-payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the majority of the contracts affected, the

buildings   concerned  were   all   completed   or

substantially approaching completion at  the  date

when  these malpractices became known,  it  would,

therefore,   be   impossible,  without   incurring

enormous  expense  out of all  proportion  to  the

Board's   claim,  to  make  a  full  and  accurate

physical  measurement of the short-piling involved

for  reasons which will be very obvious. The Board

did,   however,  instruct  a  firm  of  consultant

engineers,  experts in this particular  field,  to

make  a survey and an analysis of the short-piling

by  the  best and the most efficient method known,

short  of demolishing the buildings concerned  and

lifting the piles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this survey and on the advice of its

legal  adviser,  the Board has  reached  agreement

with  Gammon  on  terms which  have  already  been

published in the form of a statement by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



Chairman  of  Gammon. The settlement involves  the

payment  to  the  Board of  an  aggregate  sum  of

$2,700,000, over $2 million of which is  allocated

to compensation for over-payments on short-piling.

The remainder represents compensation for the cost

of   reinstatement,  losses  due   to   delay   in

completion,  and the cost of investigation  as  to

the  whole  of  which  the Board  has  been  fully

indemnified.  In  addition, the  expenses  of  the

consultant   engineers  and  the   Board's   legal

expenses are to be met by Gammon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigations which have been carried out

have  implicated  a  number of individuals,  among

them  some employees of Gammon and certain of  the

clerks  of  works employed by the Board.  Criminal

charges  have been preferred against five persons,

one  employed  by Gammon and four  by  the  Board,

under  the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Ordinance,

1960, and other charges of a similar character are

contemplated. It would not be appropriate at  this

stage   for  me  to  say  any  more  about   these

proceedings which are still pending. In  addition,

disciplinary  proceedings have been taken  by  the

Board, as a result of which, after due inquiry, 12

clerks  of  works  have been  dismissed,  one  has

absconded  and one resigned before an inquiry  was

held. Inquiries with a view to the dismissal of  a

further  three clerks of works remain to be  held.

Other   disciplinary  proceedings  are   also   in

contemplation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement reached between the Board and

Gammon   is  subject  to  reopening   if   it   is

established   that  any  director  or  responsible

member of the managerial staff of Gammon not below

the rank of chief engineer, past or present, was a

party   to   or   at  that  time  aware   of   the

circumstances resulting in the short-piling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the House will wish to be assured, as is

in  fact the case, that all proper steps have been

taken  to  ensure that, despite the  frauds  which

have  been  committed, all the  Board's  flats  in

question  are  structurally  sound.  The   Board's

consulting  engineers have been  asked  to  report

fully on this, and I am satisfied, as a result  of

what they say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Board's flats in question are  in  fact

structurally sound.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I have three

questions to pose to the Minister. First, has  the

sum  of  $2.7 million been paid? Second, is  there

any guarantee or security to ensure that Gammon do

not fail in their payments? Third, what safeguards

have  the  Housing Board taken to prevent  future

frauds of a similar nature?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As to the first question, which

refers to the sum of $2,700,000, the agreement was

that  $1,200,000 was to be paid on the signing  of

the agreement. That sum has been paid. The balance

of  $1 ½  million is to be paid by Gammon in  three

instalments.  The first instalment of  $½  million

within  six  months of the date of the  agreement,

and the two remaining instalments at intervals  of

six  months  after that. The agreement itself  was

signed  on the 8th day of September this year.  In

order  to  ensure that payment is made by  Gammon,

the  Board insisted on Gammon providing a banker's

guarantee that the three instalments of $½ million

each will be forthcoming. I think that answers the

first two questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to be satisfied that steps

have been taken by the Board to prevent frauds  of

a  similar  nature. Sir, the frauds were  in  fact

committed  because of lack of supervision  on  the

piling  site, lack of supervision over the  clerks

of  works  and Gammon's men on the site.  In  this

respect,  the  Board has taken steps to  introduce

more effective means of supervision to prevent the

occurrence  of irregularities in future contracts.

Resident engineers are now stationed on the  major

piling sites. In fact, the Board has created  more

posts for such engineers and it is now possible to

have  these engineers permanently stationed  on  a

rotation  basis  on  the  piling  sites.   As   an

additional safeguard, to enable checks to be  made

at  any time after the piles have been driven into

the  ground,  a half-inch diameter  iron  pipe  is

inserted into the centre of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



pile  in  a  group of piles, the  group  of  piles

consisting of about two to five piles. This is  to

enable  the  length of the pile to be measured  at

any  time  after the piling has been completed  by

the  insertion  of a flexible iron  rod.  Thirdly,

Sir,  internal  technical audit checks  have  been

introduced  on the piling and building sites.  The

Technical Audit Team makes periodic visits  to  do

surprise checks. These are the measures the  Board

is taking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Members are aware that the

suspension on Gammon tendering for future work  of

the  Board  has  been lifted as a  result  of  the

settlement,  and  Gammon have been  asked  by  the

Board  what measures they themselves will take  to

ensure  or  to prevent frauds of a similar  nature

taking place again. And Gammon have replied to the

Board stating that, firstly, no officers and other

employees  involved in the over-claims  remain  in

the  employ of the company or any of its associate

companies and that they have been replaced by  men

of proven probity. Secondly, piling work by Gammon

will  he  carried  out  by  direct  labour  on  an

incentive  pay  basis under stricter  supervision,

and  sub-contractors shall not be employed for any

piling  work in Singapore. Thirdly, the  company's

technical  auditor  is now under  instructions  to

conduct  an  independent  scrutiny  of  all  their

piling  contracts and personnel employed  by  them

unhindered  in any way as a matter of policy  laid

down by the Board of Management.

disturbed  by  the Minister's statement  that  the

suspension  of  Gammon has been  lifted  and  that

there  is a possibility of future work being  done

by  them.  No  doubt  they have  been  asked  what

measures  they  are  taking  to  prevent   further

frauds, and it is interesting to hear their  reply

about "men of proved ability". But I was wondering

whether they were men of proved integrity  too.  I

wonder  whether  the Minister  will  consider  not

accepting tenders from Gammon any longer since, as

far  as  I  can see, there is no dearth of  piling

firms in the Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further question I would like to ask

the  Minister, and that is whether the balance  of

$1½  million  to  be  paid over three  instalments

attracts  interest, and if so, at what  per  cent,

and if not, why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that

a  member  of  the  Bar should  ask  me,  after  a

settlement  in which the Housing Board  is  to  be

paid  $2,700,000,  why  Gammon's  suspension   was

lifted. The answer is simple. If the Board had not

agreed  to  lift the suspension, Gammon would  not

have paid $2.7 million. It is a big sum. The other

alternative was to take them to court,  and  again

here  a  member of the Bar should know that  court

proceedings  take a long time and,  in  the  final

analysis, the Board may get more, maybe  a  little

more, or they may get less. But in any settlement,

there  must  be give and take. The fact  that  the

suspension has been lifted means that Gammon, like

other   contractors,  can  tender.  There  is   no

guarantee that their tenders will be accepted. But

there are measures taken by the Board not only  in

respect  of  work  sites,  on  which  Gammon   are

employed, but also of other piling contracts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question, there is no agreement

for  interest  to  be paid on the  sum  of  $1½

million.  The  Member wants to know why  not.  The

answer is this. Gammon were in no position to  pay

the  Housing Board $2.7 million in cash. There was

bargaining  on  the final figure, whether  it  was

$2.5 million or $2.7 million. But the question  of

interest was not taken up by the Board because, in

the final analysis, it was the Board's figure that

was   accepted  by  Gammon,  not  Gammon's  figure

accepted by the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Does the Minister agree that

$1½  million in one and a half years' time is,  in

fact,  worth  less than $1½ million  now?  So  the

settlement  would,  in fact,  be  less  than  $2.7

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of suspension, I realise that the

word "suspension" may be a technical term. But can

the  Minister assure the House that future tenders

by  Gammon will not be accepted? It means that  we

can  settle  but  it does not  mean  that  we  are

required to do business again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I think it is pure logic that

$1½ million to be paid now is worth much more than

$1½  million to be paid in three instalments. That

is   admitted.  But  again  under  the  terms   of

settlement,  Gammon  were allowed  to  make  these

payments because they were in no position  to  pay

$2.7 million cash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the lifting of the suspension, once the

suspension  is  lifted, how does the  hon.  Member

expect  me to give him an assurance that  Gammon's

tenders  will not be accepted? Is the hon.  Member

asking  me to black-ball Gammon again? As  I  have

pointed out, under the terms of the agreement,  no

company  paying $2.7 million is going to pay  that

money without getting something in return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> and <b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, I will come back to you if

we have time. Mr Ng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Minister  inform  the  House  of  the  number   of

contracts awarded to Gammon and the total  sum  of

the contracts, and how was this settlement of $2.7

million arrived at?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I take it that the Member for Punggol

is    referring    to   past   contracts.    Since

investigations  started, no  contracts  have  been

awarded  to  Gammon  as yet.  I  cannot  tell  you

exactly how many piling contracts were awarded  to

Gammon in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the $2.7 million, roughly $2,098,000 was

in  respect of short-piling. I do not think I need

bother  you  with details, but I have the  figures

here showing how the sum of $2,098,000 is made  up

in respect of contracts all over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



island.  It  adds up to $2,098,000  based  on  the

calculations  of  the  consultants.  Roughly,   it

represents about 20 per cent of the total cost  of

piling work done by Gammon. The uncovering of  the

piles  at  Toa  Payoh revealed that  there  was  a

shortage of roughly 20 per cent. It was physically

impossible to go around Singapore pulling up piles

from  occupied buildings. So the estimate  was  20

per  cent right round the island. And 20 per  cent

of  a  little more than $10 million works  out  to

about $2,098,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the balance - a sum of roughly $350,000 - $300,000 was for compensation in respect of delay

covering  nine blocks in Toa Payoh; $50,000  being

the  amount estimated to be payable to the Board's

contractor for uncovering the piles. Then you have

other  items  like investigation costs,  including

professional  fees  and wages  of  the  Board  and

P.W.D. personnel  involved in the  investigations

into  the said short-piling. And then the cost  of

reinstating  buildings damaged or demolished.  But

in a settlement for a lump sum of $2.7 million, it

is   difficult  to  say  how  much  went  to  each

particular item. But the bigger part of  the  sum,

i.e.,  nearly $2,100,000 was estimated  to  be  in

respect of short-piling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joe Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would  like to know who will be responsible  to

the  Board  in  the  event of possible  structural

damage  to  flats? Does the sum  of  $2.7  million

exonerate Gammon from future liabilities?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> May I assure the Member for Joo Chiat

that  the  sum of $2.7 million does not  exonerate

Gammon  from  future claims in  respect  of,  say,

major  structural defects which might  appear.  In

fact, if I may quote clause 4 of the agreement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Company hereby undertakes liability to the

Board  in respect of and indemnifies the Board  in

full in respect of all damages, costs and expenses

of  whatever  nature suffered or incurred  by  the

Board  consequent upon any structural  defects  in

any buildings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



covered  by the said contracts arising within  ten

years   from  the  date  of  completion  of   each

particular  contract  as a  result  of  inadequate

piling by the Company.'



<br><br>Some  of these contracts started in 1961.  So  for

the earliest contracts, we can wait till 1971. For

others, you calculate a period of ten years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> What happens if human lives

are also damaged?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Board is responsible and Gammon

will   be   responsible  under  this   clause   of

indemnity.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will take one more question. Mr

Ng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> With the lifting of the

suspension of Gammon, can the Minister assure  the

House  that should the piling construction company

concerned  be successful in any future tenders  in

respect  of  the Board's tenders, stringent  steps

would  be taken to ensure that no future fraud  or

malpractices would be practised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> In answer to the hon. Member for

Aljunied who originally asked this question in the

House,  I did set out in detail the steps  already

taken by the Board to try to prevent future frauds

of  this  nature. As I have pointed out,  previous

frauds were due to lack of supervision. The clerks

of  works have to be supervised. Now you  want  to

get  engineers to supervise the clerks  of  works.

How  far  do we go from there? Do you want someone

else  to supervise the engineers? And someone else

to  supervise that someone else? We can go on  for

ever.  But I myself am satisfied that satisfactory

steps  have  been  taken by the Board  to  prevent

future occurrences of a similar nature and I think

we will have to wait and see what the future holds

for us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Can I

add  something for clarification for the peace  of

mind  of  Members here? Mr Speaker, Sir, normally

after  a lapse of an interval of, say, six  months

or a year, if there are no structural defects in a

building, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



unlikely  that  there will be  structural  defects

later  on. So I think, by and large, we can assure

the  House that in most of the buildings where the

piling has been undertaken by Gammon and in  which

they  have  been lived for two or three  years  by

this  time, there is no danger at all of any major

structural defects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Can I just add one last sentence

perhaps  to satisfy the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang

who  criticised  the Board for  not  insisting  on

interest to be paid on the $1½ million?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that it was not the

Housing  Board and its Minister that settled  this

matter.   This  matter,  in  view  of   its   wide

implications  and the sums of money involved,  had

the  blessing of the members of the Cabinet of the

Singapore Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time." The Bill seeks to amend a few

sections  of  the Singapore Army  Act,  1965,  the

principal amendment being the addition  of  a  new

section  85A.  Section 85 of the Act provides  for

the  mode  of  enlistment of persons  offering  to

enlist  in  the  Singapore armed  forces.  Persons

offering  to  enlist  are  required  to  sign   an

attestation paper and take an oath in the presence

of a magistrate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of section 85 do not obviously

apply  to  national servicemen since they  do  not

come  under  the category of persons "offering  to

enlist".  Therefore it is considered desirable  to

make  special  provision  for  the  enlistment  of

national  servicemen into the  Army.  Section  85A

also  makes it mandatory for a national serviceman

called  up  for full-time service in the  Army  to

take  an  oath or affirmation. National servicemen

called  up  for part-time service in the  People's

Defence  Force, the Special Constabulary  and  the

Vigilante  Corps also have to take a similar  oath

or affirmation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Act are not so

important. They are clause 2 of the Bill - amending

"Army  Council" in section 50 of the Act to  "Army

Board"   to   conform  to  the  terminology   used

elsewhere in the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 86 of the Act by reducing

the period of three months, during which a recruit

can  purchase his discharge, to one month  because

it  is felt that three months is too long a period

to  give to a recruit who has enlisted in the Army

to  decide whether or not he wishes to carry on in

the Army; one month should more than suffice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends subsection (1) of section 97 by

deleting  the requirement that to be eligible  for

enlistment  in  the Army a person  must  not  only

himself  be a citizen but must have been  born  in

Singapore  of  parents one of  whom  was  born  in

Singapore  or be the issue of a citizen.  Instead,

possession of Singapore citizenship in  itself  is

substituted as a sufficient requirement.  This  is

necessary in view of the fact that there are  many

citizens who would like or are liable to serve  in

the  Army  but  who were not born in Singapore  of

parents   one  of  whom  at  least  was  born   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 158 of the Act by

deleting the reference to the Modification of Laws

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend Part VIII of the Police

Force Ordinance, 1958 (No. 32 of 1958), to provide

for  national servicemen who will be directed  for

service  in  the  Special Constabulary  under  the

National Service Ordinance, 1952 (M. Ordinance No.

37 of 1952). The ranks of the Special Constabulary

up  to now had been filled by persons volunteering

to  be  members  of the Special Constabulary.  The

role  of  the  Special  Constabulary  is  one   of

assisting  the  Police Force, and members  of  the

Special Constabulary, when on duty, have the  same

powers,   protection  and  immunities  as   police

officers.  The Commissioner of Police may  employ,

without   pay,   any   member   of   the   Special

Constabulary for such duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranks of the Special Constabulary will

certainly   be  strengthened  with  the   national

servicemen  who  will be given an  opportunity  to

learn   the   strict  discipline  of  a  uniformed

service. The national servicemen who are called up

for service in the Special Constabulary will do 12

years' part-time service during their off-work  or

off-study hours.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



They  will  receive,  in addition  to  their  many

duties,  instruction in moral  values.  This  will

teach  them  the  meaning of good citizenship  and

explain  to  them  the  nature  of  their   social

responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of national service in

Singapore,   our   youths  are  being   given   an

opportunity  to contribute to our nation-building,

an  opportunity to participate in the  defence  of

our  country  if the need arises. It has  been  so

often said that the youths of our country are  the

natural  resources of the country.  Being  so,  we

have to teach them to become responsible citizens.

The  training and the discipline they will receive

in  the Special Constabulary will benefit them and

the community in that they will be better citizens

and better workmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I wish to deal with some of

the  clauses  in the Bill. Clause 2  provides  for

persons  who  may be enrolled as  members  of  the

Special  Constabulary,  while  paragraph  (b)   of

clause  3  provides  that no  national  servicemen

called  up for service in the Special Constabulary

shall be discharged or dismissed without the prior

approval  of the proper authority appointed  under

the National Service Ordinance, 1952.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important amendment is clause 4. This provides

that members of the Special Constabulary will have

to  take an oath in such form as may be prescribed

by  the Minister, and any member who refuses to do

so  shall  be  guilty of an offence and  shall  be

liable  on  conviction  to a  fine  not  exceeding

$1,000,   or  to  imprisonment  for  a  term   not

exceeding  six  months, or to both such  fine  and

imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 adds a new section which is to the

effect  that  a  national  serviceman  who   fails

without reasonable cause to attend any training or

perform any duty shall be guilty of an offence and

shall  be  liable  on conviction  to  a  fine  not

exceeding $500, or to imprisonment for a term  not

exceeding six months, or to both.

<div align="center"><b>RECLAMATION AT TANJONG RHU/ESPLANADE</b></div>



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament in accordance with section 4

of   the   Foreshores  Ordinance  (Chapter   246),

approves  the  reclamation by Government  of  that

portion of the foreshore and sea-bed containing an

area  of approximately 306 acres from the location

of  the Singapore Swimming Club at Tanjong Rhu  to

the Esplanade as delineated on the plan marked

"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/67", which  is

deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third phase of the scheme for the

reclamation  of  the foreshore and  sea-bed  along

East   Coast   Road.  The  first  phase   of   the

reclamation scheme of foreshore and sea-bed  along

Upper  East Coast Road from the junction of  Bedok

Road was a pilot scheme completed in late 1963 and

realised a surveyed area of 37 acres. Work on  the

second   phase,  the  1,000-acre  reclamation   of

foreshore  from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu  approved  in

1965   by   the  then  Legislative  Assembly,   is

progressing  satisfactorily according to  schedule

and  is expected to be completed by mid-1970.  The

Government  now proposes to reclaim a further  306

acres  of  foreshore  from the Singapore  Swimming

Club  right up to the end of Tanjong Rhu and  from

Nicoll   Highway  to  Elizabeth  Walk,  near   the

Singapore  River mouth. A copy of the  reclamation

plan is displayed in the Library of this House for

the information of Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this phase of the reclamation,

which  will also be undertaken by the Housing  and

Development   Board  acting  as  agents   of   the

Government,  will, it is envisaged, be  undertaken

in  two  parts. The first part will  comprise  the

reclamation   of  80  acres  from  the   Singapore

Swimming Club to the end of Tanjong Rhu. The  fill

will  come  from Bedok where there  is  sufficient

earth  for  this reclamation as well and  will  be

transported   by  an  extension  of  the   present

conveyor  belt system already in use.  The  second

part  will consist of the reclamation of 226 acres

along  Nicoll  Highway up to the  Singapore  River

mouth.  The fill will come from excess earth  from

the development at Seventh Precinct No. 1, Erskine

Hill,  the  balance of the Tiong Bahru fire  site,

Queenstown  neighbourhood.  6  and  7,  and  Telok

Blangah New Town. It is anticipated that the whole

project will be completed by 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No firm decision has been made on the utilisation

of this land. However, the first public project to

be  undertaken  will  be  the  construction  of  a

coastal highway from Bedok to the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know

that Singapore is a very small island and that the

only  way  to increase its size is to reclaim  the

fore-shore  and  the sea-bed. In this  respect,  I

heartily  support the motion of  the  Minister  to

reclaim   the  foreshore  and  sea-bed  from   the

location of the Singapore Swimming Club at Tanjong

Rhu  to  the Esplanade as delineated on  the  plan

which is at present deposited at the Land Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate that using

modern machinery to reclaim land is very efficient

as  evidenced by the present reclamation at Bedok,

I was wondering whether, in view of our large pool

of  unemployed labour, the Minister could consider

the possibility of employing more manual labour in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



reclamation  rather than having  it  all  done  by

machinery - capital-intensive - just conveyor belts,

cutters   and   special  machines   for   filling.

Ordinarily it is no doubt more efficient and  much

quicker, possibly even less expensive, to do it by

machinery, but there are special circumstances  in

Singapore and I would commend to the Minister  for

his attention my suggestion on using more labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, on principle, I support the Minister

in his policy to reclaim more land for development

purposes.  However, I am afraid  that  because  of

this massive programme of reclamation we will have

to  suffer a great loss in our natural sea-bed and

foreshore.   This   will,  of  course,   mar   our

reputation as a beautiful island State. This  will

affect indirectly our tourist trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put forward to the Minister my

suggestion   that   when   reclamation   work   is

undertaken  in  future  the  location  should   be

diverted,  that is to say, instead  of  reclaiming

the sea-bed, we should level off the hills and use

the  earth  to fill in the marsh lands and  swampy

areas.  This will certainly go towards  increasing

our  land  area and, at the same time,  preserving

the   beautiful  view  of  the  horizon  from  our

seashore. This will give an impetus to tourism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If I may deal with the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang who has suggested that  we  employ

more labour. The answer, for the present contract,

is  a  big "No". The reason is that the first part

of the reclamation has been let out by tender to a

Japanese  firm  of  contractors  and  we  are,  of

course,  bound by that contract. And it is  up  to

this  firm to decide whether or not they  want  to

use  their  machines or use more labour.  But  for

future  contracts in respect of land  reclamation,

perhaps   consideration  can  be  given   to   the

suggestion of the Member for Choa Chu Kang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Barker, are you prepared to give

way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Will the Minister inform us

whether  the  contract  for this  reclamation  has

already been awarded to the Japanese firm,  or  is

it  going to be awarded only after the reclamation

has  been approved by this House and only  then  a

call for tender will be made?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I did not say that tenders have been

called  for  and  accepted.  In  fact,  we  cannot

reclaim  any  part of the foreshore without  first

seeking permission from the House. I refer to  the

reclamation  which is at the moment taking  place,

for  which approval has already been given by  the

House, and for which the tender has been given  to

a  firm  of Japanese contractors. For that I  have

said  it  is  up  to the Japanese firm  to  decide

whether or not they want more labour or they  want

to use German machines and Australian ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of clarification

again, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Barker, are you prepared to give

way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If the Member will sit down and let

me finish, and then I will be prepared to clarify.

But  I  am  not  prepared to make a  clarification

whilst   I   am  in  the  middle  of   the   first

clarification.  And I have said  that  for  future

reclamation,  the one for which  I  now  seek  the

permission  of  the House, consideration  will  be

given  to  the  Member's  suggestion.  I  am   now

prepared to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

talking  about  the contract for  the  reclamation

that  we are going to approve, if it is at all  to

be  approved,  this afternoon and  not  about  the

contract  that  is now being carried  out  by  the

Japanese  at  Bedok. Surely I  realise  that  that

contract has already been awarded and it is not up

to  us now to say whether they should engage  more

labour or use more machinery.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I have made it quite clear that for

future  contracts  we will consider  the  Member's

suggestion.  I have said it twice. I say  it  once

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I have not finished with Mr Teong

Eng Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, the Minister is in the

course  of answering questions raised by Mr  Tang

and by Mr Teong in their speeches. I only allowed

Mr   Tang's   intervention   on   a   point    of

clarification. I have called the Minister to reply

to  the  motion and I will not take any new matter

at this stage. Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  heard  the Minister say that he is prepared  to

make  any clarification which the Members wish  to

ask   for.   Can  I  raise  my  doubt   and   seek

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will Mr Lee resume his seat and let

Mr Barker finish?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am prepared to

listen  to the Member for Tiong Bahru if you  will

allow him to speak after I have finished with  the

Member  for Sembawang. His grouse is that  we  are

reclaiming land from the sea and, as a result,  he

says  we have lost our seashore. I really  do  not

understand  how  we  lose the seashore.  When  you

reclaim a coast, all you are doing is to push  the

seacoast  back but it is still there. He  suggests

that  we  reclaim  swamps and  low-lying  land  in

Singapore.  I  can assure him that that  is  being

done   and   has  been  done  in  the  past.   The

outstanding example is Jurong which was  reclaimed

from  a  swamp.  Another  bright  example  is  the

reclamation which is now taking place  at  Kranji.

But  the  land along East Coast Road is a valuable

strip  and will provide Singapore, which  is  only

224  square miles of land, with another two square

miles  of land. I say two after 224 is well  worth

having.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, the Minister has indicated

that  he will deal with any points you have and  I

am prepared to let you address the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister said a few  moments  ago  that

reclamation work has produced good results. But  I

have  been  given  to  understand  that  for  this

reclamation  project  we have  to  pay  about  $50

million  to  a Japanese firm. We do not  know  how

much  has been paid to this firm. But so  far  the

money  paid can almost be said to have been thrown

into the sea. We have not seen any concrete result

yet. So what are the achievements? In my view, the

money  should  have been spent  on  building  more

houses   to  resolve  the  housing  shortage,   or

building  more factories or setting up  vocational

schools. What are the good results the Minister is

talking about? I do not see any.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before the Minister replies, may I

find  out if there are any other Members with  any

other  queries  to  raise?  There  are  none,  Mr

Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member is right when he referred

to  the previous reclamation which cost about  $50

million.  But two square miles of land which  will

be worth probably about $5 per square foot is well

worth  reclaiming.  We  will  get  more  than  $53

million  back. We are not throwing the money  into

the  sea. We are reclaiming the sea. Otherwise  we

will reach a position where the price of land will

reach   a   fantastic  level  in  Singapore.   Our

buildings  are already going up higher and  higher

and  every  available space of land  is  certainly

well worth having on a small island like ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4 foreshore and sea-bed containing an

area  of approximately 306 of  the  Foreshores  Ordinance  (Chapter  246),

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FINANCING AND ADMINISTRATION OF URBAN AND RURAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SERVICES PROJECTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the aim of

urban  and  rural services is to make Singapore  a

nicer  place to live in, especially in  the  rural

areas where modern amenities like piped water  and

electricity  are  lacking. The  administration  of

these  services is in the hands of the  Urban  and

Rural Services Committee which have been effective

in  carrying out the projects and, to a very large

degree,  have  made life in the rural  areas  more

tolerable  by the bringing of modern amenities  to

the rural folks and by the building of bridges and

repairing of roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Budget for the year 1967, a

total sum of $2,715,000 was approved by Parliament

for  urban and rural services. This sum,  however,

is  very  small compared to the total  Development

Budget  of  some  $249  million,  i.e.,  the   sum

appropriated for urban and rural services was only

just  over  one per cent of the total  Development

Budget. Yet in spite of this, the sum approved was

further  cut down sometime in the middle  of  this

year  to some $1,900,000. No reason was given  for

the cut and no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



doubt  hon. Members will wish to know why the  sum

was  cut down after it was approved by Parliament.

We  all appreciate that there are competing  needs

for funds in the development of Singapore. But one

per cent of the total Development -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, could you speak a little

slower  because  the  Interpreters  are  having  a

little difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> But one per cent of the total

Development  Budget for urban and  rural  services

can,  by no stretch of the imagination, be  called

extravagant.  Indeed,  in  the  debate  last  year

Members  appeared to lament the smallness  of  the

sum appropriated for urban and rural services. If,

in spite of this and in spite of the fact that the

sum  was approved by Parliament, it is further cut

down, there must be cogent reasons for this and we

wish to know the reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Development Budget, a total sum of

$2,715,000  is  allocated under  15  items.  These

items range from agricultural and kampong roads to

roadside  trees and shrubs; and to each  of  these

particular  items, a definite sum is allocated.  I

wish  to know whether these allocations have  been

rigidly  observed or whether the Urban  and  Rural

Services Committee or the Projects Committee  have

the  discretion of altering the allocations so  as

to   take  account  of  the  requirements  of  the

constituencies as a whole. As far as  I  can  see,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the urban and  rural  services

projects have been effectively carried out by  the

Urban and Rural Services Committee. It is true, no

doubt, that now and again there are complaints  of

delay.  But, in my opinion, such delays are  bound

to  happen in view of the vast programme for which

the  Committee  is responsible. In  this  respect,

Sir,  I  wish to thank the Committee for  carrying

out the projects so efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, however, there is a change in the

administrative  structure of the Urban  and  Rural

Services  Committee.  There is  created  over  and

above the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



Committee  another Committee called  the  Projects

Committee. It has never been explained why such  a

new Committee becomes necessary at this particular

juncture, or what are its precise functions in the

administration  of  the urban and  rural  services

projects. All we know is that it appears  to  have

the  last  say in the approving of projects.  With

the  creation  of  this  Projects  Committee,  all

projects  will  now  take a, longer  time  to  get

approved.  Before  the creation  of  the  Projects

Committee,  the  final decision  rested  with  the

Urban  and  Rural  Services  Committee.  With  the

creation   of  the  Projects  Committee,  projects

approved by the Urban and Rural Services Committee

will now have to be approved again by the Projects

Committee before they can be implemented. Is  this

additional level of decision really necessary?  To

my  mind,  it is not. It only wastes the  time  of

members  of  both the Committees  and  delays  the

implementation   of  urban  and, rural   services

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt hon. Members of this House will also

wish  to  know  on  what  criterion  the  Projects

Committee  bases its decision in approving  or  in

rejecting  projects. Before the  creation  of  the

Projects  Committee,  when  the  Urban  and  Rural

Services  Committee had the final say, members  of

the U.R.S.C. (meaning the Urban and Rural Services

Committee) made site visits to acquaint themselves

with the conditions of the particular constituency

in  which  projects  were to be  implemented.  The

Projects  Committee does not make such visits.  It

is known to have cut down projects arbitrarily and

to  have approved and implemented projects against

the  recommendation  of the Member  of  Parliament

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House two examples from my own

constituency. In Yew Tee Village in the  Choa  Chu

Kang constituency, there is no piped water and the

wells  get  dry during the dry season.  The  Water

Works  Department, after extensive investigations,

recommended  a  three-phased  project  costing  in

total some $140,000. The first and second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



phases each cost $46,000. After due consideration,

the  Citizens' Consultative Committee in Choa  Chu

Kang,    with   my   support,   recommended    the

implementation of phase two which  could  be  done

independently of the other two phases at a cost of

$46,000. This recommendation was rejected  by  the

Projects Committee allegedly on the ground that it

was not economical. On the other hand, there was a

project  for  street lighting of  Tengah  Village,

also  in  my  constituency, costing some  $16,000;

this   project  was  supported  neither   by   the

Citizens' Consultative Committee of Choa Chu  Kang

nor  by  me,  but it was approved by the  Projects

Committee and has now been implemented. This state

of  affairs  is causing a great deal of  confusion

and  no  small  amount of dismay in the  minds  of

Members  of  Parliament and members  of  Citizens'

Consultative Committees. Members of Parliament are

largely  concerned with deciding on the priorities

of competing needs in their constituencies, guided

by  the  advice  of  their Citizens'  Consultative

Committees.  Generally,  therefore,   Members   of

Parliament  should  have  a  large  say   on   the

priorities  of  projects for their  constituencies

and their recommendations should be respected, in

this  connection,  perhaps the Projects  Committee

should consider the procedure of asking the Member

of  Parliament concerned to appear before it  when

the  Committee  decides on the projects  affecting

the particular M.P.'s constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was rather surprised that the Choa Chu Kang

project for bringing water to Yew Tee Village  was

rejected by the Projects Committee because it  was

not  economical. Yet, at the same time, a  project

for street lighting not supported by me nor by the

Citizens' Consultative Committee was approved. How

can  the  Projects Committee explain its  decision

that the water project was not economical and  yet

the street lighting project was economical? And if

projects  are  approved and rejected  on  economic

grounds, when has this criterion come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



about?   Can  the  decision  for  social   service

projects  be  based on economic grounds?  I  would

like  a  categorical statement from  the  Minister

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to the detailed administration of the

urban  and  rural  services projects,  at  present

Citizens'  Consultative Committees  are  asked  to

help  search  the records at the Land Registry  to

ascertain  the  ownership  where  projects  affect

private  land. I am of the opinion  that  this  is

imposing  too  heavy  a burden  on  the  Citizens'

Consultative  Committees, a burden  they  are  not

equipped  to  shoulder. Members of  the  Citizens'

Consultative   Committees  are   local   community

leaders.  They are sensitive to the needs  of  the

constituencies  but  they do  not  understand  the

workings  of the Land Registry and the  making  of

searches  of  the records kept there. Furthermore,

the Citizens' Consultative Committees are asked to

obtain  the owners' permission where any  projects

affecting private land are considered. This  again

I  consider to be quite inappropriate. It would be

more  effective  if the Urban and  Rural  Services

Committee  could  obtain the  private  landowner's

permission  after ascertaining that any particular

project affects private land. All urban and  rural

services  projects  are for  the  benefit  of  the

community and the community should not be held  to

ransom  by  private landowners. It is more  likely

that permission would be given when sought for  by

Government  departments rather than  by  community

leaders  who have no official status, at least  in

the  eyes of the private landowners. In the  event

of   private  landowners  being  unreasonable   in

holding  up projects which would benefit  a  large

number  of  people,  I  would  suggest  that   the

Government  should consider exercising  powers  of

acquisition  under  the existing  law  as  a  last

resort.



<br><br>5.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, first of

all,  let  me  praise  the  Government  for  their

achievements in the past few years, especially  in

the field of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



rural  development. This is in  keeping  with  our

policy  and  is  inseparable from  our  policy  of

developing  the  rural areas. We  implement  rural

development  programmes in order  to  improve  the

livelihood  of the masses of the rural  people  so

that  these people, who were neglected by the  Lim

Yew   Hock   Government  and   by   the   colonial

government,  can  now  enjoy modern  standards  of

living. Sir, although the rural development  plan,

taken  as a whole, has achieved much, I feel  that

we  should go a step further and develop the rural

areas  and not to cut down on the expenses  of  or

slow down the rural projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards what the Member for Choa Chu Kang has

said,   namely,  that  the  amount  of  $2,700,000

allotted  for rural development has been cut  down

to  $1.9  million, I also feel that  this  is  not

proper  and  right.  I  would  like  to  make  two

suggestions.  Firstly,  on the  implementation  of

projects,  I feel that the authorities responsible

for the various projects are not doing their best.

For  instance, when certain projects are  approved

by  the  Urban  and Rural Services  Committee,  it

usually takes about a year or more for the work to

get started. Secondly, I feel that it is necessary

to  set  up  a  system  of  supervision  over  the

projects, because in many places the work has  not

been  properly  done. For instance, in  Sembawang,

one  or two months after Kong Loong Road was  made

up, there were big holes in it. This shows clearly

that  there had been malpractices in the  building

of this road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the setting up of the Projects Committee

on  top of the Urban and Rural Services Committee,

I  think  it may not be too important. If  such  a

Committee can make the U.R.S.C, more effective, it

is quite all right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I fully support and subscribe to

the  sentiments expressed by the Member  for  Choa

Chu  Kang  that  the rural people  were  not  only

neglected during the colonial days, but  they  are

also neglected now. I can prove



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



this in this House on the ground that we were  not

able to win the support of the rural people in the

last general elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, I do not think it would be

appropriate for you to make party political points

in the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I am just mentioning this

in  passing.  We  were not able  to  obtain  their

support because we had neglected them.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, I think it would perhaps be

in  order for you to say that the People's  Action

Party was not able to win their support. But I  do

not think you can use the word "we".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I would say that the P.A.P. was

not  able  to look into the welfare of  the  rural

people. That is why the Party was not able to  win

their  support.  So  if  the  Party  can  make   a

breakthrough in the rural constituencies by making

the  rural people understand our difficulties  and

by  providing  them  with more and  better  social

amenities,  then I feel sure that  in  the  coming

elections, we will be able to win -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, I must again call you to

order.  You can criticise the Government. That  is

one  of  your functions as a Member. But I do  not

think  it  is open to you, for Party purposes,  to

criticise  the  management of the  Party  in  this

House. You must keep the Government and the  Party

leadership  entirely separate, regardless  of  the

composition of the House at the present time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

fact  that we are only one Party represented here,

there is no Opposition. So when I say "the Party",

it also means "the Government" and when I say "the

Government", it also means "the Party".  So  there

is no actual distinction for me to make.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, there is an important

distinction and you must also pay due regard to my

own functions and duties in the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, comparatively speaking, the

people  living  in the urban areas  have  received

much  more  attention  and  amenities  than  those

living  in  the  rural areas. So I  hope  that  in

future the Government will be able to provide more

social  amenities and give more aid to the  people

in the rural areas who really need the help of the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, you have already spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no more speakers, I will call on the

Minister to reply. Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may deal first

with  the proposition made by the Member for  Bras

Basah.  He said that the P.A.P, lost the elections

in  the rural areas because the Government had not

paid  much attention to development there. On  the

contrary,  the facts are that the Government  have

spent and are spending much more money in all  the

rural  areas compared to the urban areas.  Whether

this  policy is the correct policy as far as vote-catching is concerned, I do not know. Let us  wait

for  the next elections. But the facts are  these.

This year, just to give you an example, Anson,  an

urban  area  - $9,280. Let us  try  Choa  Chu  Kang - obviously  a  rural area - $77,952,  which  is.  I

think,  more  than $9,000! Kampong  Glam  - $9,569;

Kampong  Kapor - $11,425. These are  urban  areas.

They  cannot do much with the money that they  are

allocated. [Interruption] Let us try Changi.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> It took four years to

repair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Changi - $87,969.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> It should need more because of

the two islands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Jalan Kayu - $69,219.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about Sembawang?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Tampines - $101,165. Nee Soon - $82,414. If you want Sembawang - $75,000. So the

facts  are obvious. You cannot run away from these

figures.  Much more money is being  spent  in  the

rural  areas. Whether we win the elections in  the

rural  areas the next time depends not so much  on

figures  but on each and every one of you and  how

you work in your constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Money is very important.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It is important, and we are giving

them  more  money. The Member for Bras Basah  does

not get much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In fact, it is $8,000 - the

least!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Sembawang mentioned a

certain road which has big holes within a month or

two of making it up or repairing it. I wish he had

drawn  this  to  my  attention  earlier,  so  that

investigations can proceed into whether there have

been rnalpractices, in the sense that the work had

not  been  done according to contract, or  whether

some  big lorries which pass there night  and  day

broke up the road soon after it was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the Member for Choa Chu Kang

in  whose  name  this motion stands.  He  wants  a

categorical statement from the Minister  concerned

explaining  why  a  scheme  for  electricity   was

approved  in  his  constituency  and  a  suggested

project for water supply was rejected. The  answer

is  simple. Choa Chu Kang is allocated $77,952 per

year.  The Member for Choa Chu Kang, supported  by

his Citizens' Consultative Committee, wants us  to

spend  more than half that amount on a water  main

which,   according   to  investigations   of   the

U.R.S.C.,  will be supplying water to 50 families:

the  whole  project  to be done  in  three  phases - first  year,  $46,000; second year, $46,000.  The

Projects  Committee  had  already,  at  the   same

meeting,  approved a water main project for  Choa.

Chu Kang to the tune of $23,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



Taking  $23,000  from $75,000,  he  is  left  with

$52,000. If  we had approved $46,000 for  another

water main, then work on all other projects in his

constituency would have stopped. So does  he  want

to  spend  all  his funds on 50  families  in  his

constituency, or does he want to divide this money

proportionately and fairly in various parts of his

constituency? If we had more money, we would  give

it  to  him.  But  finance is  controlled  by  the

Minister for Finance, and I asked him half an hour

ago  what I should say to the Member for Choa  Chu

Kang in case he raised this point again, that  not

enough  money  is being spent on urban  and  rural

projects.  The  answer was a definite  `No'.  "The

State  has  got  no  more money  to  give  to  the

constituencies." In fact, under the  Second  Five-Year  Plan, Government has made provision for  $12

million  for  these projects. This  works  out  at

roughly  $2.5  million  per year.  But  Parliament

actually  approved $2.7 15 million for this  year.

This amount is small compared with the Development

Budget.  But these are necessarily small  projects

compared  with the other projects in the Republic.

It  is  not  correct  to say  that  this  original

provision of funds approved by Parliament has been

cut  down  by the Projects Committee. The Projects

Committee has no power to cut down what Parliament

provides.   What   actually   happened    was    a

readjustment  of  the  allocations  done  by   the

Ministry of Finance at the request of the Projects

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain items which come under the

heading  "U.R.S.C."  in the Development  Estimates - like  private  streets,  minor  improvements  and

reconstruction  of  roads, roadside  railings  and

fencing,  footpaths  and  cycle  tracks,  roadside

drains,  roadside  trees  and  shrubs.  The  total

amount  for these items is roughly $795,000.  When

making   the   original   allocation   for    each

constituency,  this  Committee  did  not  consider

these  items. These items are usually done by  the

P.W.D. If they are building a cycle track, they do

not build it in Tanglin and stop within the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



Constituency.  They  have got  to  go  on  to  Ulu

Pandan.  And  if they build it in Choa  Chu  Kang,

they   will  probably  proceed  on  to  the   next

constituency. So these items, for which money  was

being spent by the P.W.D., had not been taken into

consideration  by  the Finance  Committee  of  the

Economic   Planning  Unit.  And  when   this   was

discovered, they had to calculate again and  fresh

figures   were   given   for  each   constituency,

resulting  in  apparently  less  money  for   each

constituency.  But the facts are that  the  monies

spent in each constituency were not reduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> For building cycle tracks!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am prepared to give way, Mr

Speaker, Sir. Get up, Mr Tang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, surely the

point  is  that the Member of Parliament  for  any

particular constituency is the best judge of  what

are  the requirements of that constituency. It  is

not  up to the P.W.D, to build, say, a cycle track

along  Choa  Chu  Kang and extend  it  to  Jurong.

Possibly both Choa Chu Kang and Jurong do not want

cycle  tracks.  Choa Chu Kang, for example,  wants

water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the question of social services should not

be  based on economic grounds. A social service is

not  a trade or a business. Therefore, the urgency

and  the  importance  of the requirement  must  be

taken  into account. The Projects Committee should

not  just  be allowed to say that street  lighting

should  be  installed in Tengah Village  and  then

proceed  to spend $16,000 there, when at the  same

time  the  people  in Choa Chu  Kang - in  Yew  Tee

Village  - do  not have drinking water.  The  wells

there dry up during the dry season and water carts

have  to  be  used to bring water to rural  folks.

Surely  in  this  case  the Member  of  Parliament

concerned  must have the discretion,  even  if  it

means that half of the funds allocated to him goes

to this particular project.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, I think you have made your

point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am merely citing an example. If the

Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang  will  look  at   the

Development Estimates, he will see that  money  is

provided for various items. If he wants water  and

nothing  else, I suggest he start next  year.  And

the  first item he asks for recommendation in Choa

Chu  Kang is this water main project. If he thinks

that  the  Projects  Committee  turned  down   his

application  arbitrarily, I would  invite  him  to

think  again. He speaks very well of the  U.R.S.C.

which  is  under  my Parliamentary Secretary,  and

perhaps he will be a little surprised to know that

the  U.R.S.C. rejected his application,  and  that

the  Projects Committee just put its rubber  stamp

on the application that had already been rejected.

We accepted the recommendation of the U.R.S.C. for

which the Member for Choa Chu Kang has the highest

regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has again criticised the setting up of the

Projects  Committee and wants to know why  it  has

been set up. The Projects Committee was set up  by

the  Prime  Minister because of many  a  complaint

received from people like the hon. Member  to  the

effect   that  Members  of  Parliament - his   own

colleagues  - who are members of the U.R.S.C. only

recommended  projects in their own constituencies.

I  am not saying that that was true. But that  was

the   impression  created  - that  members  of  the

U.R.S.C, only    looked   after    their    own

constituencies.  Because  of  these  grouses   and

complaints  from other Members of Parliament,  the

Projects Committee, headed by me as Chairman,  was

set up to process these applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the Member that 98 per cent of the

recommendations  of the U.R.S.C. are  accepted  by

members of the Projects Committee. And let me also

assure  him that whatever happens in the  U.R.S.C.

meetings  is also known to members of the Projects

Committee,  because  some  persons  are  on   both

Committees.   Some  Members  of  Parliament   have

appeared  before the U.R.S.C. The Member for  Choa

Chu  Kang  says that the Projects Committee  is  a

waste of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



time.  I say that it is a waste of time to hear  a

Member  of  Parliament twice. If the U.R.S.C, has

given him a hearing, I do not see why the Projects

Committee should give him another hearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly, the Projects Committee makes its

decisions  on the recommendations of the  U.R.S.C.

on  the  availability  of funds  and  whether  the

proposals  are  in  conformity  with  the  overall

development  plans and policies of the Government.

What  really  astounds me  is  that  a  Member  of

Parliament can get up in this House and  say  that

he wants to spend half the money allocated for his

constituency on 50 families and damn the rest.  It

is for that reason that the Projects Committee was

set  up  to  look  into  recommendations  made  by

members  of  the Citizens' Consultative Committees

and   Members  of  Parliament.  All  in  all,  the

recommendations are good, but we have  got  to  be

careful. We have got to process them and to decide

on  them. But if you are allocated $80,000 and you

want to spend more than half on a pipeline for  50

families,  it  will be very difficult  for  us  to

agree and to accept your recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Choa Chu Kang, up till

September this year a sum of $81,000 was spent  in

his  constituency. In other words, the funds  have

disappeared.   His  constituency  is   not   being

neglected.  We  have overspent in  Choa  Chu  Kang

within  the first nine months of the year, and  he

wants us to spend another $46,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned the question of land

titles. There is a little history behind this  and

I  think,  Sir,  I  can put the facts  before  the

House.  In  the  past, Members of  Parliament  and

members  of  the Citizens' Consultative Committees

made recommendations to build roads, put up street

lights, and what - have - you -- not caring on whose

land  the  project was to be developed.  This  had

raised  complications. There  had  been  howls  of

protest from landowners; and rightly too. If I own

a  piece  of land and next morning I find  a  road

right  through  it,  I will  write  to  the  Prime

Minister. The Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



Choa Chu Kang has passed his Bar examinations  and

I hope he has not forgotten the law of trespass! I

am  sure many a client goes to him seeking  advice

on what they can do and what remedies they have in

the  High Court -perhaps an injunction or  perhaps

damages  for trespass. These are the actions  that

the  Government  has had to face  because  of  the

indiscretions of Members of Parliament and members

of  the Citizens' Consultative Committees. Some of

these  actions are still being considered and  are

still in the files of the Attorney-General.  If  I

have a piece of land, you have got no right to put

a  drain right through it. And if you have a piece

of  land, I have got no right even to step on  it.

So  to  suggest  that  we  ignore  the  rights  of

landowners   is,  under  our  law,  an  impossible

proposition. I would suggest that when we  rewrite

our Constitution, and if the Member still believes

that  we should go in arbitrarily and build  roads

and  community  centres,  lay  pipes  on  somebody

else's  land,  then let him take it up  in  Select

Committee  should the Constitution be  there,  and

set  out his arguments. But until the law has been

changed,  I  am afraid that we cannot in  any  way

flout  it without exposing the Government  to  all

sorts  of  action for trespass, interference,  and

damages.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order or clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of clarification.

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  hate  to  interrupt   the

Minister.  But  I  never suggested  anything  like

flouting  the  law. In fact, if the Minister  will

recall,  I did say perhaps in necessary cases  the

Government's  power  of  acquisition   under   the

existing law should be exercised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I did not suggest that it was the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang who has made suggestions

that  we  should trespass on other people's  land.

But if you remember, I said that I had to give you

a  little  history of how these points  developed.

When the Projects



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



Committee was formed, its first decision was  that

any  projects  could not and  would  not  even  be

considered  until the landowner's  permission  was

forthcoming. But this led to a howl of protest and

it  is  for this reason that I am raising it  here

and  making  it  clear once and for  all  that  we

cannot   flout   our  own  land   laws.   As   for

acquisition,  we  are always acquiring  land.  And

there have been allegations that my Ministry would

soon  become one of the biggest landowners in this

town.  We  are very careful when we acquire  other

people's land. For major road widenings, yes.  But

if  you want to build an agricultural road, surely

you  do  not want the Government to acquire  land.

But  we  do  acquire  land for road  widening  and

making  of new roads. But if every time the  owner

refuses  to give permission for us to acquire  his

land  and  we  acquire  it, this  would  cost  the

Government  a  big  packet  and  the  land   would

probably  not be worth acquiring. To suggest  that

it  is  better  for the U.R.S.C. to write  to  the

landowner  in  the first instance I would  say  is

wrong.  We have done it - to quote a case in  Upper

Serangoon  where  the Member for  Upper  Serangoon

wanted a road metalled. We advised him to write to

the  landowner,  which he did. The landowner  said

no.   So  the  Projects  Committee  wrote  to  the

landowner and the reply was to this effect:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the moment I am having a lot of trouble

trying  to  get rid of squatters on  my  land.  To

build  this road would only make the stay  of  the

squatters more permanent. When I have got  rid  of

all  these  squatters,  I  will  build  this  road

myself."



<br><br>So  there are always two sides to the question and

it is not for the Government to acquire a piece of

land  to build a road on someone else's land where

squatters  have been sitting for years.  We  would

rather  not  interfere in civil  disputes  between

landlord and tenant. Sometimes it is the landowner

who  is at fault. Sometimes it is the tenant.  But

the  solution is not to acquire the land  for  the

making up of a road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing further to add, Sir, except this.

If  any Member of Parliament is not satisfied with

any decision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



of  the Projects Committee, I suggest that he file

or   petition   for  a  reconsideration   of   the

application - perhaps asking for more pipes - and  I

can   assure  him  that  the  Projects  Committee,

instead of arbitrarily rejecting the appeal,  will

once  again give it careful consideration - and  if

it  appears  that the decision was  wrong,  I  can

assure  him  that  the Projects Committee  is  big

enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



to withdraw its decision and approve the project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
