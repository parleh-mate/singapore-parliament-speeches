<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment (a) how much has been expended so far  in  making

Singapore  free  from  floods; and (b)  why  has  there  been

flooding whenever there are heavy downpours in spite of  this

expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee

Say):  Sir, ENV spends $60-$70 million a year to improve  the

drains  and canals in Singapore. Since 1984, ENV has spent  a

total   of  $1.3  billion  on  drainage  improvement   works,

including  the  widening and deepening  of  main  drains  and

canals to cater for increased storm water runoff arising from

new land developments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV is committed to reduce flooding in Singapore and has

over  the  years,  progressively  implemented  many  drainage

improvement projects to alleviate and prevent flooding.  This

investment in drainage infrastructure has paid off.  In spite

of  rapid  urbanisation and intensified  redevelopments,  the

flood   situation  in  Singapore  has  continued  to  improve

significantly.   There  are now 238 hectares  of  flood-prone

areas  as  compared to some 3,200 hectares in  the  1970s,  a

reduction  of more than 90%.  The floods are less severe  and

are of relatively short duration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ENV will continue to improve the existing drains

and  canals  to  alleviate  flooding  in  flood-prone  areas,

whenever it is cost-effective to do so.  However, it  is  not

feasible  to completely rid Singapore of all floods  for  two

reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, some of the areas such as those in Boat Quay

and  Chinatown are low-lying and are barely above  high  tide

level.   These premises remain prone to flooding,  especially

when  heavy rain coincides with high tide. The only effective

flood  control measure is to raise the ground levels of these

premises in conjunction with redevelopment plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a limit to which we can widen drains

because  of  land constraints.  Very intense rainfall,  which

may  occur  once every five years or so, could overwhelm  the

capacity of the drains and cause flash floods.  Such  floods,

however, could be minor and of short duration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Harun and the House that ENV

is  committed  to  press  on  with our  drainage  improvement

projects  to  reduce flooding in Singapore, and to  keep  the

flood situation well under control.

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I was surprised

when  the Acting Minister for the Environment mentioned  that

the  Chinatown area is low-lying.  I have found out that many

hawker centres, for example, the Adam Road hawker centre  and

some markets are flooded during a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



heavy downpour.  Could ENV do something about it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> I thank Mr Harun for his feedback and

I  would ask my officials to look into some of these isolated

cases.

<div align="center"><b>"CLEAN TOILET CAMPAIGN"</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  how successful the "Clean Toilet  Campaign"  has

been  and  what  further improvements can be made  to  ensure

clean public toilets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek   bin  Saniff)  (for  the  Acting  Minister   for   the

Environment):  Sir, our public toilets are cleaner  now  than

they were a few years ago.  However, there is still room  for

improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys conducted annually, since 1996 when we launched

the  Clean  Toilet  Campaign, showed  that  there  have  been

gradual  improvements  in  the  cleanliness  of  our   public

toilets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public interviewed during the surveys

have  given higher scorings consistently over the  last  five

years.   Cleaners  who  maintain  these  toilets  have   also

consistently rated the toilets to be cleaner over the  years.

ENV   officers  participating  in  the  surveys   have   also

independently rated the toilets and have also  come  up  with

similar scorings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of public toilets in ENV and HDB hawker centers

have  been  extensively upgraded and users  interviewed  have

expressed  that  they are pleased with them.   More  will  be

done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to push for clean public toilets in

Singapore  and will continue to require building  managements

to  keep  public toilets in clean and good working condition.

Through  public  education programme,  we  will  continue  to

remind  the  public  to cooperate and help  keep  our  public

toilets clean.

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of

State  mentioned  that  surveys were  conducted.   Could  the

Senior Minister of State give details about ratings given  by

ENV for the last five years?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, the rating is based on a

score  of  0-10.   On our part, we are very  lucky  that  the

scoring  happens to be between 6 and 8.  This score is  given

by three parties:  ENV officers, cleaners and the users.  For

instance, in 1996, ENV scored 6.0; cleaners, 6.1; users, 6.8.

Recently,  we  have 8.1 by ENV, 8.0 by cleaners  and  8.3  by

users.    The scoring system maintains that 9.1-10 points  is

excellent;  8.1-9  points, good; 6.1-8 points,  satisfactory;

4.1-6 points, not quite satisfactory; and 4 points and below,

poor.  We will try our best to do even better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the

Main  Estimates be reduced by $100."  [Assoc. Prof. Low  Seow

Chay]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, in

solid waste disposal, recycle,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



reuse  and  reduction  are important  issues.   Most  of  the

substances and materials that we use for our products are not

renewable.  We must take action to conserve the resources  so

that  we  will  leave  behind sufficient quantities  for  the

future generations of mankind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycle, reuse and reduction will be the movement by

environment   lovers,  and  responsible  world  citizens   to

conserve our resources.  From what I read, a BMW car contains

a  high percentage of materials which could be recycled.  You

can  sell the car to a company for recycling when it  is  due

for scrap.  Do we have any policy, setting the constraints in

the recycled contents in our new product and the contents  of

which could be recycled when it is scrapped?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision for compulsory recycled contents in

products has to be commercially viable.  However, if  nothing

is  done, the concept of recycling will never take place.  At

least,   we   should  have  some  financial   incentives   or

encouragement to include recycled contents, or increasing the

recyclability  of the products could be made more  attractive

for   the  manufacturers'  participation.   Do  we  have  any

incentive  schemes to encourage people to work  towards  this

objective?  Our Government should show support to the recycle

movement  by imposing recycled contents in some of their  own

projects  if cost and quality are neutral.  One good  example

is  requiring  door-frames and wooden floor materials  to  be

made  of recycled wood for public housing.  In fact,  I  have

seen the product, and no layman can tell the difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen recycled bins in schools and in shopping

centres, but we can hardly see any recycled products on  sale

in  the  consumer market.  Even if there are,  like  recycled

papers, greeting cards and envelopes, they do not seem to  be

commonly  used  and  acceptable  by  the  people.   In  fact,

recycled  products  are still fighting a  tough  battle  with

normal  products.   Is there a way that the Government  could

help  to make recycled products more attractive, in terms  of

pricing and to make known to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



supporters  of  the  recycle movement?  If  so,  it  requires

identification  of  the recycled products,  in  other  words,

labelling of recycled products.  Are we prepared to  consider

labelling all recycled products?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycled products could only be viable if the public

accepts  them.   Making people understand the  importance  of

recycling  to be an action towards resource conservation  and

environmental  sustainability is the key to  the  success  of

recycling.   We should have an education programme,  teaching

and persuading people to feel good about supporting and using

recycled products.  Would the Government consider launching a

Recycle Campaign with the NGOs and schools to increase  their

awareness in support of the recycle and reuse movement?

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, yesterday, the

Minister  said  that  at  the current  rate  of  solid  waste

generation  and  disposal, we would need  to  build  one  new

incineration  plant,  occupying about 7 hectares  every  five

years, and one new landfill, the size of Sentosa Island every

25-30  years.   He has put forward these statistics  to  show

that  this  situation  is  not tenable.   He  said  that  his

Ministry  would  look into a solution of  closing  the  solid

waste  generation loop, ie, to have more recycling.  I  would

like  to suggest that he seriously consider another solution,

in addition to closing of the loop, that is, the reduction of

waste generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce waste generation is very easy to say but the

real question is how.  In this area, I am afraid that many of

the  Government's current initiatives are to increase  prices

to  discourage  the  generation of  waste.   Is  this  really

effective?   Sir, like drugs, the pain of higher prices  will

become   less  effective  with  time  and,  therefore,   more

increases   are  normally  needed  to  overcome  the   higher

threshold  of  pain.  The result is that we may, unwittingly,

become  a  higher  and higher cost country  and  become  less

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with privatisation of solid waste collection, the

private  collectors  will  be  required  to  institute  waste

recycling schemes in public housing and landed properties  to

reduce generation of solid

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



waste.   Pushing this problem to the private sector will  not

resolve the problem at all.  All it does is to pass the  buck

to  the private sector on what originally was and still is  a

national problem.  Moreover, if mandated to do so by  law,  I

do  not  believe that the private sector will do a  good  and

proper  job.   What  may happen would be some  activities  to

satisfy  the bare minimum of what the laws require, with  the

higher cost being passed on to consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Acting Minister has also said that currently,

only about 40% of solid waste generated is recycled.  Even if

the  figure can be increased to 50% or 60%, we will  soon  be

reaching  the limits of recycling.  Therefore, the Government

must  do  more  to get Singaporeans to reduce  and  to  reuse

products,   ie,  the  2Rs  of  what  we  call  the   4Rs   of

environmental care  -  reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, right now, the preferred method in this area of

reduction  and  reuse,  as  I said  earlier,  appears  to  be

orientated at the end of the process.  That means you  charge

higher  and higher prices for removing garbage, in  order  to

persuade people not to generate so much garbage.  As  I  said

earlier, I doubt this will work in the long run.  Sir, I like

to see the Acting Minister put more emphasis on the beginning

of the process, ie, try to educate, encourage and help people

to  generate less garbage, which is to reduce.  And where  it

is  not  possible to reduce, then individual  households  and

companies,   or  those  who  generate  garbage,   should   be

encouraged to reuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a thousand and one ways of doing this,

provided  the Government is willing to do so.  And the  money

saved  in  building  less incineration plants  and  landfills

could  be better used to provide the means for the people  to

reuse and to reduce.  I believe that if we can come out  with

some form of financial incentive to reward those who generate

less garbage, perhaps we will see more success in this area.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I think there are many NGOs more than

willing to provide ideas and assistance.  These are the  NGOS

in  the  environmental field.  Sir, the other countries  have

also  gone  a  long way in this direction.  We can  certainly

learn from their experience.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, can I take my

two cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Khoon Lap:</b> Sir, the Minister and several

Members have touched on the solid waste problem yesterday and

today.   But few Singaporeans realise it to be such,  because

they  take  it  for granted that after the rubbish  has  been

thrown out, it is taken away by a refuse truck and they never

see  it  again.   Very  few Singaporeans know  what  actually

happens  to the refuse after that.  As Singapore has  a  very

dense population with very limited land area, refuse disposal

is of major concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr Heng and Prof. Low have already touched on

some  figures, I would like to go into a bit more details  to

drive  home  the point.  The amount of waste we produce  each

day  is  on  the increase.  I was informed that in  the  year

2000, the total tonnage of waste was 7,640 tons per day.  The

amount  of  refuse in one year can occupy about  54  football

fields.   With an increase of 5% per year, it would  increase

to  a  staggering 12,500 tons per day within 10  years.   The

Environment  Ministry will have to build one new incineration

plant  every five years to cope with this.  Currently,  there

are four incineration plants.  By the year 2030, we will need

10  incineration plants to dispose  of all our daily  wastes.

All  in all, this will require 7 hectares of land and a  cost

of almost $1 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, more seriously, besides allocating more land and

financial  resources  to build more incineration  plants,  we

also  need to allocate more landfill space for the ashes  and

wastes  that cannot be burnt.  As mentioned by the  Minister,

at  the  current rate of waste generation, we  will  need  to

allocate  landfill space about the size of Sentosa island  at

the rate of one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



every 30 years.  It is certainly a frightening thought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Minister, apart from the

four plants he mentioned yesterday, what concerted effort  is

being  taken  to  address this particular problem.   Because,

apart  from  the  sheer quantity of waste  that  we  have  to

handle, we also have to consider the pollution damage  caused

to  our  environment.  I would like to propose that we should

do  more to educate the population of the seriousness of  the

situation.   We  should consider all measures to  reduce  the

waste  generated  each day.  We must change  the  mindset  of

Singaporeans that waste disposal is a problem to be solved by

the  Environment  Ministry  alone.   But  it  is  not  a  one

dimensional problem.  Even if new technologies are found  for

more  efficient methods of waste disposal, as long as we keep

on  generating waste needlessly, the problem will grow bigger

and one day, it may become unsolvable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related subject of waste disposal is

recycling.   We often talk about the importance of recycling,

but  all the talk never seems to be able to materialise  into

much  action.   It  is high time we changed  our  mindset  on

recycling.   Recycling  has always  been  a  major  issue  of

environmental    consideration,   but   this    environmental

consideration  has  always  been  overshadowed  by  the  cost

consideration.   It  is  often  more  expensive  to   recycle

something than simply producing it from new materials.   This

is  the reason why recycling has never been able to take  off

in  a  big way.  However, the most compelling aspect  of  the

environmental  consideration  is  still  the   necessity   to

conserve  our scarce earth resources.  It is not an immediate

problem.   It  is  often designated as low priority  concern.

But  with  the population growing at a staggering  rate  each

year,  very soon most of our resources will be depleted,  and

we cannot just pass this problem on to our next generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other equally important consideration is that

recycling  can  be  a  significant way to  lessen  our  waste

disposal  problem.   I think many Members have  already  made

that clear.  It is time for us to rethink some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



of  the practices in our daily life.  For example, the use of

disposable  utensils  or products made of  polystyrene,  PVC,

plastic  or such bio-undegradable materials which  cannot  be

recycled  should  be minimised.  Perhaps we  should  consider

bringing  back  the old practice of using reusable  utensils,

even  at  the expense of having to put up with a  little  bit

more  inconvenience.   I would suggest the  Ministry  promote

more  awareness  on the importance of recycling,  spread  the

message that even though it may not be cost effective in  the

short  term,  it  is  essential if we  are  to  preserve  our

environment  and  resources and help  towards  resolving  our

waste disposal problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to go into details of ways and means

of   re-instituting  the  various  recycling   possibilities,

because there are so many.  But I would like the Minister  to

promote more recycling initiatives and perhaps introduce some

form   of   incentives  to  those  individuals  as  well   as

corporations who take recycling seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as I share

many of the concerns of the previous speakers, I will try  to

reduce  my  points.   I  share the perception  that  we  have

reached a limit to technical solutions.  We have built  Pulau

Semakau,  a  world's first.  We are going  to  build  another

incinerator   and these are big ticket items in  the  budget.

But  beyond  solutions, we will need to look at the  mindsets

and  social  habits of Singaporeans.  Here, I would  disagree

with  Mr  Kenneth Chen who spoke just before me.  I  actually

think  that  the  Ministry has done  a  good  job  in  making

citizens generally aware of the problem and aware of the need

for  recycling.   Of course, more can be done for  awareness.

But  the  next step we have to take is to move from awareness

to  action.  We have to enable action by making it  easy,  by

allowing enterprise and making our effort effective.  What  I

mean  by  ease,  enterprise  and  effectiveness  goes  beyond

campaigns  or once in a while collecting old phone  books  or

newspapers.   We  need  to  have  regular  projects  in  each

neighbourhood

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



or  even  in each house.  We see in many developed  countries

blue bins or other systems used to collect bottles, cans  and

other recyclables.  I am afraid I cannot understand why we do

not have the same.  I believe we should.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing about enterprise connects to the

privatisation  of  waste collection.  This  is  going  to  be

difficult  because eventually we are going to have  to  raise

prices.   We can, however, do this in a way that is sensitive

to  the  needs of people, because we cannot move house,  just

because  one company charges more than the other  to  collect

our  rubbish.  In that sense, it is a very imperfect  market,

even  if  we  privatise.  What  we can do to make the  market

better  is  to create more volume, not just by mandating  it.

We  should create a market.  Deposits on cans and bottles are

a  very small example of the kind of clear incentives we need

to  create  this  market,  and then  create  the  volume  for

recycling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more generally, I think there are many other things

we  can learn from other societies.  We are not the first  to

face  this problem, though it is more acute in Singapore.   I

would  like the Minister to share his thoughts with us  about

closing the loop on waste.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members

for  speaking on recycling.  As mentioned by Mr Kenneth Chen,

waste  generation  in Singapore is on the  increase.   Twenty

years  ago, we produced about 2,500 tons of solid waste every

day.   Ten  years ago, the amount doubled to 5,700  tons  and

last year, as mentioned by Mr Kenneth Chen, it has gone up by

another  35%  over the 10 years, to 7,600  tons.   The  split

between  the  domestic  sector and the industrial  sector  is

about 50:50.  In other words, every person in Singapore today

generates about 0.93 kilogram of solid waste every year.   If

we were to compare ourselves to, say, USA, it is still lower.

In USA, it is 1.97 kilograms; Germany, 1.26 kilograms; Japan,

1.09  kilograms.  The good news is that compared to  many  of

the other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



countries,  we are still producing less than them.   But  the

bad news is that Singapore, being a small country, faces much

greater challenge and constraint  -  in finding enough  space

to  dispose  waste.  As mentioned by the Members, every  five

years,  we need to build a new incineration plant.  Every  30

years,  we  need  to find a landfill site as big  as  Sentosa

island.  Obviously, this is not sustainable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, I mentioned that in order to achieve

sustainability  in the disposal of solid waste,  we  need  to

accord  greater emphasis to waste minimisation.  And I  thank

the Members for speaking up and for their support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked why do we not focus

more  on 3Rs  -  reuse, reduce and recycle. Sir, I agree with

him  fully.  Since 1991, the Ministry of the Environment  has

been promoting 3Rs very proactively.  There are 130 companies

in  the  3Rs  industry, and they deal with a  whole  host  of

recycling:  wood  waste, paper, scrap  tyres,  copper  slabs,

marine clay and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also promote the fourth R, which is recovery. For

example, all our incineration plants today recover heat  from

incineration  of  waste, and we feed the electricity  to  the

national grid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Prof. Low Seow Chay asked what happens to all

these   materials  collected  for  recycling.   Sir,   as   I

mentioned, the rate of recycling in Singapore today  is  40%.

Of  the wastes that are being collected for recycling,  about

50%  are recycled in Singapore, and 50% for export.  For  the

50% recycled in Singapore, waste paper is recycled into paper

products such as cardboards, and toilet papers.  In the  case

of  wood waste, companies are turning it into chip boards for

furniture, wooden panels and so on.  We are now using  marine

clay  to make bricks for construction.  In fact, HDB will  be

using  some of these bricks produced by one of our  recycling

companies.  So, on the whole, we think that 40% of  recycling

rate is not bad.  If we compare ourselves to the rest of  the

world,  in  Germany, Munich city is 42%;   Netherlands,  39%.

However, the rate of recycling has stabilised at 40%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



since 1996, meaning that since 1996 we have not been able  to

increase  the  rate of recycling in Singapore.  Therein  lies

our real challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, Mr Heng Chiang Meng said that we should

encourage  further recycling.  I agree with him  because  our

challenge  today  is  to achieve another breakthrough  beyond

this  40%  recycling rate.  Mr Simon Tay mentioned  that  the

privatisation  of  waste incineration  would  not  solve  the

problem, in terms of sustainability.  I agree with  him.   We

believe that privatisation would only enhance our performance

in the short term.  But for long-term sustainability, we have

to  go beyond that.  And that is the reason why yesterday,  I

announced  that the ENV has set a target of achieving  a  50%

recycling  rate over the next 10 years.  Sir,  I  must  admit

that this is not an easy target to achieve.  But we think  it

can  be done.  It is doable if all of us work harder together

to achieve this.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked whether the Government is

trying  to pass the buck to the private sector.  I can assure

the  House that that is not the intention.  We look  at  this

challenge  as a shared challenge of the three "P" sectors   - the Government, the private sector and the people sector.  It

is  a common challenge facing all of us.  So we are going  to

work  together.   We are not going to pass the  buck  to  the

private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the recycling rates for paper, plastic,

construction debris and book wastes range from  10%  to  60%.

We  examine  each of these items and our assessment  is  that

there  is  enough  scope for all of us to  work  together  to

increase  the  recycling rates for each  of  these  types  of

wastes  by about 20 percentage points over the next 10 years.

That  is  why  we believe that the 50% target is doable,  not

easy but doable, if we work hard enough, if we work together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge really is how to extend recycling beyond

the industrial sector.  The 40% recycling today are basically

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



achieved  through  recycling by the  industrial  sector.   To

extend  beyond  that  to the domestic sector  and  commercial

sector,  we have to work both the supply and demand sides  of

recycling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen mentioned that we need to strengthen our

education on waste recycling and spread the message,  and  we

have  to educate the young.  And Mr Simon Tay mentioned  that

we  have  to  go  beyond awareness and  turn  awareness  into

action.  I agree with both of them.  For example, our  school

children  today, at Primary 3, are told about the  importance

of recycling.  My daughter came back from school one day when

she  was in Primary 3 and asked mummy and daddy, "How can  we

participate in recycling?"  She also asked, "Where is the bin

for  the  plastics and bottles?  Where is  the  bin  for  the

cans?"  I was very shy, pretended and said that there was  no

such system in our home today.  The point is that after a few

years, my daughter never talks about recycling anymore.  Why?

The  awareness has not been turned into action.  There is  no

continuous  reinforcement.  As a result, we are  not  reaping

the  benefit  of  all the effort we have put into  education.

That  is  the reason why ENV decided that we must now require

all  the public waste collectors to introduce waste recycling

to  every  household in Singapore so that your  daughter,  my

daughter,  your son, my son, after coming home  from  school,

having learned about recycling, hopefully, they will be  able

to practise recycling on a day-to-day basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our contractual agreement with these nine public

waste collectors, they are required by ENV to introduce waste

recycling  schemes and bring recycling to the  door-steps  of

the  residents.  We believe this will make it easier for each

and every household to participate in waste recycling.  I  am

pleased  to inform the House that Jurong sector will  be  the

first  to  launch the scheme by April next month.  The  other

sectors will do so by the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for recycling at the commercial premises, as

mentioned  by Mr Simon Tay, I agree with him.  In fact,  this

is another

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



challenge  that  we have to overcome.  In  the  case  of  the

commercial  premises,  we  are going  to  reach  out  to  the

building   managements   to  encourage   as   many   building

managements  as  possible  in Singapore  to  introduce  waste

recycling in our commercial buildings.  Hopefully, over time,

we  will  be  able to spread recycling beyond the  industrial

sector to the domestic and commercial sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having taken action on the supply side, we are also

taking  action on the demand side, meaning that we are  going

to  step  up  our  promotion effort to  further  develop  the

recycling  industry in Singapore.  Our aim is  to  nurture  a

vibrant   recycling  industry  in  Singapore   and   position

Singapore  as a leading centre of excellence in  4Rs  (reuse,

reduce, recycle and recover) in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng yesterday mentioned that maybe we

should introduce more incentives to encourage recycling,  and

today  he  mentioned  that we ought to  do  more  to  promote

"reduce" and "reuse".  Sir, as I said, I agree with him.   We

are  now looking at the experience of other countries and see

in  what  way we can learn from them.  I am going to  make  a

trip  to  Europe in May and US sometime in July.  The purpose

is  to see how we can learn from  these countries on how they

are   able  to  implement  recycling  more  effectively  than

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to inform the House that we have set

up  a  multi-agency task force.  It is led by EDB, comprising

members  from  ENV, JTC and PSB.  This task force,  over  the

next  few  months, is going to formulate further our industry

development  strategies.   They  are  going  to  propose  new

incentives,  where  necessary,  to  support  and  assist  the

industry in its development.  At the same time, we will  work

together to nurture more companies, promote more investments,

to  build new capabilities and capacities in our industry for

the 4Rs and, hopefully, in the process, we are going to speed

up the pace of innovation in the industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low suggested that we should impose recycled

contents in our Government procurement programme.  I think we

have to be pragmatic here.  In the case of Singapore, many of

our   industries  and  manufacturers  are  basically   global

companies producing for the global market.  So, in a way, our

industry  is  basically  an  export-oriented  industry.   Our

domestic market is a very small one.  Therefore, we feel that

to  use  our domestic market as a lever to enforce  recycling

contents  in manufactured products may not be effective.   At

the  same  time,  it  may also affect our competitiveness  in

attracting foreign direct investment.  We are not comfortable

to  insist such a regulation because the global manufacturers

may  also  be  constrained  by the availability  of  recycled

components.  Instead of requiring them to do so, what we  are

trying to do is to create the condition in Singapore to  make

it  attractive for them to do so.  We believe that this  will

be the kind of win-win outcome we can strive for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether the Government can help to

make  the  recycled  products more  attractive  in  terms  of

pricing  and  to  label  these recycled  products.   To  make

recycled products more attractive is a very good idea.  It is

something  I  fully agree.  I spoke to many of our  recycling

companies.  I asked them, "What is your strategy in competing

for  market share?"  They said that their strategy is to sell

their  products  cheaper  than the  non-recyclable  products.

However,  they said that their cost of production is  higher.

With a higher cost of production, how to compete on the basis

of   low  prices?   Therefore,  they  asked  me  whether  the

Government  could come in to subsidise or offset this  higher

cost of operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this approach may not be sustainable

because  it  would  not  be possible for  the  Government  to

continue to subsidise the recycling industry.  But we believe

that  there is a lot of scope for us to speed up the  process

of  innovation in our recycling industry so that the industry

can  come out with more innovative products that can  command

more  attractive pricing in the market.  In this regard, ENV,

EDB and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



the  various  Government agencies are going  to  work  closer

together  to support the industry through the IDS (Innovation

Development Scheme), whereby we are going to co-fund the cost

of   developing   new   products,  new  processes   and   new

applications of these recycled materials.  In the process,  I

think we would be able to help them to become more viable and

more profitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding labelling the recycled products, the Singapore

Environmental Council has this Green Label scheme  in  place.

What  we  can  do is to work closer with them to  incorporate

this  concept, as proposed by Prof. Low Seow Chay,  into  the

Green  Label scheme, and maybe to work with SEC to conduct  a

campaign to create greater public awareness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also asked whether we should review the

use  of  disposable crockery that are non-biodegradable.   In

the  short term, what we are trying to do is to generate both

the  demand and supply sides.  Because if we are not able  to

create the demand for the recyclable waste, at the end of the

day, whether the waste is biodegradable or non-biodegradable,

if  they  all  end up in the incineration plant, it  actually

makes  no difference.  In that sense, while I note the  point

by  Mr Kenneth Chen, I would say that the challenge really is

to  find a way to recycle these wastes.  Because, if there is

a way of using them, then I think it makes a lot of sense for

us to move away from wastes that are non-biodegradable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed all the questions by

Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, our

expressways  cut  across many high-rise  public  and  private

housing estates in Singapore, especially in the central area.

Over  the years, traffic has increased in our expressways  in

the  city  area and the outlying areas.  Also, many residents

find that this has caused significant noise problems for them

and their families not only in the day time, but also as late

as  10.00  pm, 11.00 pm and 12 midnight.  Many find that  the

noise pollution is unbearable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of my residents live in flats very close to

these  expressways.  In fact, some of these flats were  built

way  before  the expressways, like CTE and PIE,  were  built.

Due  to  the  lack  of  space for the construction  of  these

expressways, some of these expressways cut very close to  the

flats.   For  example, I know of one or two flats in  Whampoa

Drive area where they do not normally meet the URA's set-back

guidelines, for instance, so much so that when one  of  these

flats went through a Main Upgrading Programme, the SAI (space-adding  item), which was supposed to be built, could  not  be

built  because the expressway is so close.  That is how close

some of these flats are to the expressways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry to seriously look into

this.   Residents, especially living probably  six  or  seven

storeys  above, are the ones who feel the greatest impact  of

this noise pollution.  I am also aware that those flats which

are  near  the  MRT  tracks also face this  similar  problem,

although  those from the traffic of the expressways  is  even

greater.  I understand that countries, like Japan, have built

sound barriers at strategic spots in their expressways.  I am

not  asking that these be built across Singapore in  all  the

expressways but at strategic points where the impact of  this

is felt by most residents.  I know that there have been talks

that  this would not be aesthetically doable by some  of  the

urban  planners.  But I think if it is functional and it  can

help many residents, it would certainly be useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in particular, I have got several residents who

have  told  me  that they have to put up with this  for  many

years  and,  in  fact,  they found  that  their  hearing  has

actually  been  impaired  and they  have  to  get  help  from

doctors.  So I think it is a significant problem and  I  hope

the Ministry will look into this.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I wish to

talk about is hand, foot and mouth disease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finding of the recent hand, foot and mouth disease

epidemic was related to the EV71 Enterovirus.  At the peak of

the epidemic, there were more than 400 cases

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



reported  a month and some children died of the disease.   In

October  last  year, drastic action was taken  to  break  the

chain of transmission of the epidemic.  After things got back

to  normal,  in  late last month and early  this  month,  the

disease  started  again.  About 100 cases were  reported  per

month, and two children had died as a result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EV71 infected hand, foot and mouth disease has

proven  to  be quite lethal.  In the outbreak in Malaysia  in

1997,  47  deaths were suspected to be due to the hand,  foot

and  mouth  disease.  In the outbreak in Taiwan in  1998,  at

least  the deaths of 80 children were implicated to be caused

by   EV71  Enterovirus,  and  more  than  60,000  cases  were

reported.  We were lucky that here the damage due to the EV71

was not as bad as other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-emergence of the EV71 epidemic in the beginning

of  this month prompted one to ask whether the measures taken

by  the  Ministry are effective enough to take care  of  this

deadly epidemic.  In the first place, is the reporting system

of  the hand, foot and mouth disease cases by the GPs to  the

Ministry  quick  enough?  Could it be that by  the  time  the

Ministry  gathered  all  the data, the  disease  has  already

spread?  I tried to find out some data or information of  the

disease  from  the  Internet  and  I  got  nothing  from  the

Singapore  web-page on how to prevent and control the  spread

of  the  disease.  It shows that some efforts should  be  put

into  the  web  and other media to help the  control  of  the

disease.   Should we do more in public education so that  the

people are well aware of the danger of the disease and,  when

contracted,  they know precisely what to do  to  contain  the

spread of the disease?

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago, when a person contracted a communicable

disease,  he will be kept in the Communicable Disease  Centre

to  prevent its possible spread.  I have not heard about such

measure  for  quite some time.  Should we rethink  about  the

matter and see whether it is feasible to confine

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



people contacted with the EV71, hand, foot and mouth disease,

as a means to contain that disease?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you want to move on to your next

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next cut is odour

control.   In the previous year's debate in the Committee  of

Supply,  I  spoke about the necessity of the smell  or  odour

control regulation.  The reply from the Minister was that  if

it  affects  the public health, then it could  be  controlled

under  the  Environmental Public Health Regulations.   Though

saying  so, nothing much seems to have been done in improving

the environment in the area of odour or smell in the air that

is discomforting to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an odour standard, it is very difficult for the

people  to  complain about the foul smell and the  industries

that  generate the chemicals which cause the  smell.   It  is

also  very  difficult for the Ministry to say who  is  wrong,

simply  because there is no law to say that it is illegal  to

generate the smell.  At present, anyone who is unhappy  about

something  smelly,  he  will just make  a  complaint  to  the

Ministry.  The Ministry will then go to the source  and  tell

the person not to generate the smell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reality, zero emission standard is only

applicable  to the hazardous and toxic emission  of  harmless

smell.   It may seem too much if we tell the source to comply

with zero emission.  To be reasonable, we need to set a limit

to  such emission and a standard would then be needed.   Take

the  case  of  the smelly bean curd shop chou  tou  fu.   The

complaint of the smell led to the closure of the premises.  I

am  sure  the  authority has used other laws to  request  the

stoppage  of the business and, certainly, it was not  because

of  the  smell level that had been complained about.  In  the

recent  well-reported case about the smell from  the  chicken

farm  and  from  organic  farming  using  animal  wastes  and

fertiliser,  even the consultant from the NUS  did  not  know

what standard would be acceptable, in terms of smell.  If one

could  not set a standard, how could one know that the farmer

has done his job in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



controlling  the smell, the people may have a sensitive  nose

to  smell  even  though  it is of a  very  low  and  harmless

content.   The consequence would be to either close  all  the

farms or resettle all the people from the affected areas.  If

this  is  the solution, it would be very unfortunate  and  it

will certainly insult the intelligence of many people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before things get from bad to worse due to arguments and

counter-arguments about the problem of smell, it is time that

we  should  at  least set up some standards in  dealing  with

smell,  so  that both the emitter and receiver  will  have  a

common ground in settling their problem of smell or odour.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I will be dealing with the

questions  posed by Mr Sinnakaruppan and Prof.  Low  on  HFMD

and, of course, the last one on control of smell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sinnakaruppan asked about traffic noise. Let me

assure him that traffic noise comes from vehicle engines  and

tyres.   ENV,  MCIT  and  MND have  implemented  measures  to

control  traffic  noises  from expressways.   These  measures

include  setting  of noise emission standards  for  vehicles;

using low noise porous asphalt material for surfacing certain

stretches  of  expressways; siting  multi-storey  car  parks,

electrical   substations   or   other   non-noise   sensitive

structures   to   screen  traffic  noise   from   residential

buildings;  setting  back  residential  buildings  from   the

expressways; and designing layout of flats such  that  living

rooms and bedrooms are located away from traffic noise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increased urbanisation and widening of

expressways,  the noise level has gradually  been  increasing

along certain stretches of the expressways.  To address  this

gradual  increase of traffic noise from expressways, ENV  and

MCIT  engaged  a noise consultant to conduct a study  on  the

impact of traffic noise from expressways.  The study includes

a  review of the existing guidelines and mitigation measures,

including sound barriers.  In the preliminary findings of the

study, the consultants have also identified several

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



'hot  spots'.   These  are  blocks  of  flats  fronting   the

expressways where the noise level is high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV and MCIT will evaluate the findings and

recommendations of the consultancy study.  We would also look

into   noise  mitigation  measures  from  these  'hot  spots'

especially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce and highly urbanised Singapore, some

degree  of  noise  pollution is inevitable.   Notwithstanding

this,  we would seek to minimise the impact of traffic  noise

on  residents  living near expressways  through  the  use  of

planning and other noise mitigation measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low asked about HFM disease. My Ministry

appreciates his concern.  We are also concerned.  In response

to  Prof. Low's questions and, with your permission,  Sir,  I

would  like to put in perspective the overall situation  with

regard to infant fatality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from September last year to now, there were seven

children  below  5 years of age who died of viral  infections

involving the brain, lungs and heart.  Four had EV71 and  one

had  an enterovirus that is still being typed.  The virus  or

viruses   responsible  for  the  other  two  could   not   be

identified.  In the last five years, there were an average of

16  deaths  a  year,  ranging from 11  to  28  deaths,  among

children  aged 5 and below.  This puts us among  one  of  the

lowest mortality rate among children of this age group in the

world.   What  is  worth noting is that  there  has  been  no

noticeable  increase in the number of deaths  among  children

aged  5  and below in recent years.  In fact, the  number  of

deaths  last  year, among children in this particular  group,

totalled 11.  And this was less than the previous year  which

was 18.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why then has there been this recent attention given

to   EV71?   For  one  thing,  it  was  only  recently   that

developments  in the diagnostic tool, known as PCR,  this  is

something  to do with the laboratory equipment that magnifies

the  DNA,  the genes of the virus using an enzyme,  known  as

polymerase,   has  enabled  it  to  be  used  by   diagnostic

laboratories worldwide to detect EV71.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then how does EV71 relate to HFMD? Is it a potentially

aggressive virus that often causes deaths?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EV71 is generally not known to be an aggressive

virus.  In most cases, EV71 will not cause death, but instead

cause  a mild and common childhood disease known as the hand,

foot and mouth disease.  It is just like the flu virus.   The

flu  virus does not usually attack the heart or the brain and

then  cause death, although it can and has been known  to  do

so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when will EV71 turn aggressive and lethal? The

outcome  would depend on the relationship between  the  viral

agent  and the host, the baby, the kid.  For example, factors

like  the  amount  of virus a person is  exposed  to  or  the

ability  of  the body's immune system to defend  against  the

virus  can  make a difference.  Genetic factors also  play  a

part,  some persons may possess a certain gene which  renders

them  more prone to complications by allowing efficient virus

entry into the cells.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since one of the symptoms of EV71 is hand, foot and

mouth disease, a good strategy to prevent the spread of  EV71

is  to  prevent  an  outbreak of the  hand,  foot  and  mouth

disease.   We  are not saying that EV71 cannot be  aggressive

when  there is no HFMD outbreak, as we have seen it can,  but

preventing  outbreaks of HFMD would minimise  the  chance  of

exposure to EV71 virus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry therefore monitors very closely the

incidence of HFMD throughout Singapore and, in particular, in

all  the  pre-schools.   If  there  are  signs  of  localised

secondary transmission going on in any pre-school,  ENV  will

move in quickly to prevent an outbreak from occurring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the months ahead, ENV will be working with MOE and

MCDS  to  see  how best pre-school operators can  be  further

trained in the areas of illness detection, isolation  of  the

unwell child and preventive measures to check transmission.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sidek, "guillotine" time on this

amendment is 1.40 pm.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Yes. Sir, let me assure him

that  the  web  site and the information will  of  course  be

available.  We are doing that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low also asked about odour. There are

currently  no  standards for odour emission from  industries,

including  poultry farms.  This is because  most  odours  are

made up of many organic compounds that cannot be detected  by

instrument.  Sir, our nose is still the best means to  assess

an odour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, panels comprising selective individuals have been

set  up  in  some cases to assess odour.  However, the  panel

members  still use their noses to detect odour.    There  are

odours  and  there are odours.  We should only  be  concerned

with  odours that have health implications or are a  nuisance

to  many.  Odour emissions from chicken farms, pharmaceutical

and  food industries, etc, are some examples.  In such cases,

we   would  require  industries  to  install  odour   control

equipment to reduce the odour emission.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The hawker

centre  is  one of the most frequented places for  people  in

Singapore  when  they go for food, because it is  inexpensive

and  there is a great variety of food.  It has become one  of

the  essential parts of daily living of our people.  With the

convenience  and good choices of food in the  hawker  centre,

Singaporeans have, unconsciously, developed a habit of eating

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from hawker centres, there are also more and more

food courts now coming to the HDB estates.  If we compare the

hawker  centre  with  the food court, of  course  the  hawker

centre  would be inferior, as far as appearance,  decoration,

ambience and the level of comfort are concerned.  So, when we

upgrade our hawker centres, we should not just stick  to  the

old  fashioned way of doing it, ie, just cleaning,  painting,

and  putting  in some new tables and chairs.     I  think  we

should  redesign  the hawker centres with better  lay-out  of

stalls, comfortable seats, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



generally  more  pleasant environment.    We  should  have  a

thorough change, so that a modern hawker centre would attract

customers,  whether in its outlook or comfort  comparable  to

the food courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the ageing of our people, we notice that there

are many hawkers at the hawker centres who are old enough  to

retire.   We  could  notice in certain hawker  centres  where

business  is not well, some stalls are not open,  while  some

stalls  are  operating for only a few  hours  a  day.    Some

elderly  hawkers  find it too tough to carry  on  with  their

trade and rent out their stalls to other people.  The hawkers

may  be  aging  but their stalls still have  economic  value.

Perhaps  the  Ministry of the Environment should allow  these

old  hawkers  who  have  been operating  for  many  years  to

surrender  their stalls to the Government for  some  form  of

compensation,  so that these stalls could be  transferred  to

willing new-comers, to better serve the customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development has already

mentioned  that  it  will be compensating  any  neighbourhood

retailer who wants to give up his shop with $48,000.  Perhaps

the   Ministry  of  the  Environment  could  also  offer   an

attractive package to anyone who wishes to give up his stall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrading of a hawker centre may take as long as one

year.   Some hawkers may not have enough savings to last  for

such  a long period without income.  I wonder if the Ministry

of the Environment could make some arrangements to help them.

Are  the  stallholders required to pay their  rent  when  the

hawker centre is being upgraded, and no business is conducted

there?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of some of the hawker centres, eg, the one in

Taman  Jurong Block 1, is very old fashioned.  No matter  how

we upgrade, it would not be nice and presentable.  Perhaps we

should  build a new hawker centre nearby so that the  hawkers

can  continue to operate in the existing hawker  centre,  and

then  move  into the new hawker centre when it is  completed.

In this way, they will not be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



deprived of the earnings during the period of upgrading.

time to the other two persons?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I will just ask a

few  questions regarding the upgrading of hawker centres.   I

would  like  to  know, first of all, after  the  centres  are

upgraded, whether the rental will be increased and,  as  Prof

Low  has  asked, whether any compensation would be  given  to

tide  the  hawkers  over  the  difficult  period  during  the

upgrading  process.   How long does the  Ministry  expect  to

upgrade all the hawker centres in Singapore, and what is  the

schedule of the proposed upgrading?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, over the last few

days,  we  have heard that the Government has  come  up  with

schemes  to help HDB shop retailers.  There is one  group  of

retailers  who  needs help, and I think  this  has  not  been

addressed.  I am referring to those stall owners operating in

wet  markets  managed by the Ministry of the Environment.   I

have one such market in my constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will recall that in the mid 1990s, the

Government  encouraged ownership of wet  market  stalls,  and

stallholders in these markets volunteered to buy their stalls

over   from  the  Government,  and  they  did  so.   However,

lifestyles  have changed and, over the last  five  years,  we

have  seen  a shift in preference, with households preferring

to  shop in air-conditioned supermarkets and suburban  malls.

As a result, many of these wet market stall owners are facing

falling  business, and the fall seems to be permanent  rather

than  cyclical, and many are also carrying very high mortgage

rates, which they find difficult to sustain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure whether the Retail 21 Committee has

addressed  these  stall  owners' problems.   Many  are  in  a

dilemma.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



By  nature  of their wet market environment, they  have  less

flexibility.  They cannot easily sublet part of their stalls,

because  the  stalls themselves are very small.  Neither  can

they  change  their  use, nor apply productivity  enhancement

measures  to upgrade.  They offered to sell their  stalls  in

the resale market, but there were no takers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three proposals for the Minister to try to

solve this problem:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Allow these stall owners to set up a cooperative to

remodel  their  wet  market  stalls  into  a  viable   modern

supermarket.  In so doing, the Government undertakes to  help

redevelop the wet market into a modern style supermarket, and

let the stall operators manage and operate the supermarket;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Implement something like the SERS programme for

residential units, ie, the Government rebuild the wet  market

and  allow stallholders to have a choice, whether to continue

to  operate the stall when the market is rebuilt, or  totally

sell their stalls back to Government;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If all the stallholders are willing to quit business

and sell their stalls back to the Government at an acceptable

price,  the  Government should consider buying back  all  the

stalls, tear down the market, and use it for something else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am urging the Minister to address this problem

and help our wet market stall owners.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as time is short, I will go

directly to the points brought up by the various Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the issue of whether we will allow some

flexibility in the design of the upgrading of centres.   Sir,

I  am  happy to say that what the Ministry will do  is  this.

For  upgrading, we will assign a standard budget, on  a  per-stall  basis,  for  each  project.  The  grassroots  leaders,

advisers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



and  the  market  association can then decide  what  are  the

additional features and designs they would like to have.   Of

course, their design will be subject to approval by the  ENV,

HDB  and  JTC who are the managing agents, and the additional

costs  of  these  features will be borne  by  the  grassroots

organisations and the Town Councils.  This means that we will

provide them with the standard package and standard fund, and

they can do the topping up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is there any programme to enable some of the

stallholders to get out, if they do not want to move into the

upgraded centre?  For the first-generation stallholders, they

will  be  given $19,000.  These cooked food stallholders  can

take the $19,000 and give up the stalls.  In the case of  the

market  stalls, they will be offered a cash grant of $15,000.

So those who do not want to go into the upgraded centre, they

can  take the grant and leave.  But these are only for  those

centres  that are involved in redevelopment, ie,  if  we  are

going to reconfigure or redevelop the centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the centres that are only meant for upgrading,

ie,  no  structural change but just upgrading,  our  original

intention  is  actually not to offer them these cash  grants.

But  a  few MPs have suggested that we should at least  allow

some  of them, in particular, the older ones, to get  out  if

they  want to.  So my Ministry has decided that we will offer

cash  grants to those who are more than 62 years old  at  the

point  of announcement.  For example, if a centre is selected

for upgrading - not for redevelopment but for upgrading - all

the  stallholders who are more than 62 years old can opt  for

these cash grants, if they want to.  Whereas in the case of a

major  redevelopment, the cash grants will be offered to  all

stallholders, regardless of their age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question on whether there will be any change in

rental  after the upgrading, Sir, firstly, subsidised  stalls

in  all  centres pay a standardised base rate.  For  example,

for a cooked food stall, today it is $160.  In the case of  a

market  stall, it is between $56 and $92.  All centres  today

pay these base rates.  These base rates are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



reviewed  from time to time.  The last time we  reviewed  the

rental  was in 1995, some 6-7 years ago.  But I am  happy  to

inform  the House that my Ministry has no intention, at  this

moment, to revise the rental, meaning that there will  be  no

change  to  these  base  rate rentals  in  the  near  future.

However, for those centres that have undergone both upgrading

and  redevelopment,  there will be  some  adjustment  to  the

rental, to reflect the better facilities, design, layout and,

in some cases, even bigger stall size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of centres. The first type is just

upgrading, ie, no structural change, but upgrading  in  terms

of  better tables, stools, toilets, ventilation system and so

on.   For those stalls, the adjustments will be very minimal.

I  am  not  able to give the exact amounts, because the  sums

involved will vary across centres, depending on the condition

of the centre, its location, etc.  But as an indication, I am

pleased to inform the House that the adjustment to the rental

for the upgraded stalls will be between $1 and $4 a day.  So,

we are keeping it very minimal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A month or a day?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> A day. $1 to $4 a day, depending on

the  location, where they are.  For some centres, it will  be

$1;  for some other centres, it could be as high as $4.  But,

on  the  average, it would be about $2, for the upgrading  of

the  stall.  If we do a simple calculation, we will find that

it  will  not  be possible for the Government to recover  the

cost of upgrading through this $2-per-day adjustment, because

the cost of upgrading is about $20,000 per stall.  So, at  $2

a  day,  it  will take us 10,000 days, or something  like  30

years, to recover.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to see that the Inter-Agency Committee on

Energy  Conservation  (IACEC)  will  now  be  put  under  the

Ministry  of  the Environment and, from what  I  gather,  the

thrust  of  the Government's energy conservation  initiatives

appear to be focused on three measures:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To strengthen the regulatory and institutional

framework for the conservation of energy;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To improve the market environment so as to provide

an improved platform for all to conserve energy; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To use the public sector as the leading edge and

show the way for all to emulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while these are good and admirable measures, I

think  a  very basic fundamental point is missed.  Energy  is

used  by  humans  and, therefore, can only  be  conserved  by

humans.   Yet, the measures are not focused on  how  to  make

Singaporeans  as  a whole use less energy  as  a  behavioural

norm.   If every Singaporean can consciously use less  energy

in  every  aspect  of his daily living, such  behaviour  will

carry over from his home to his workplace.  So, if each of us

can  conserve only a bit, the combined effects of  the  total

population can lead to a huge decrease in energy usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to really suggest that the Government

start encouraging more Singaporeans to conserve energy.   And

I  am  very  sure the Acting Minister would agree  with  this

motherhood  statement.  Unfortunately,  the  example  of  the

recent  rebates given on the hybrid electric car, as well  as

other  measures or lack of measures, does not give  one  hope

that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



the  Government is prepared to put its money where its  mouth

is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the use of any new technology is

expensive.   Witness  the  prices  of  PCs  when  they  first

appeared  and  the  prices  of PCs  now.   Also,  without  an

extensive  infrastructure, motoring with a  hybrid  car  will

cause more inconvenience for the owner.  And the rebates that

have  been  given so far do not take all these  factors  into

consideration, resulting in the estimated overall costs to be

higher  than  that of conventional cars, despite the  perhaps

cheaper  initial cost of the vehicle.  It is, therefore,  not

surprising that most dealers do not expect a high demand  for

the hybrid cars, despite the rebates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng, would you like to give some time

to Mr Thomas?

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Yes, Sir, just one final point.

Yesterday, Mr Ong Kian Min brought up this question of  solar

heating  panels.   I  have brought up this  issue  before  in

previous  Committee  of  Supply  debates,  and  I  wish   the

Government will give some financial rebates on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am pleased

to  say that most of the points that I had wanted to bring up

have  already  been  addressed by the Minister.   However,  I

would  just like to ask what are the acceptable international

standards  for  noise levels, in decibels, from  expressways,

and what is the general noise level from our expressways?

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I agree with Mr Heng Chiang Meng

that  energy conservation can only be effective if  there  is

enough  of public consciousness.  When I mentioned  that  ENV

would  take over the IACEC, effective from April, I did  also

mention  that  we  are  going to  expand  the  scope  of  the

Committee beyond energy conservation to include clean  energy

as well.  At the same time, I want to assure Mr Heng that the

Committee would adopt a 3P partnership approach, meaning that

whatever programmes we introduce, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



will  strengthen the partnership between the  people,  public

and  private sectors, so that together, we will  be  able  to

achieve  this objective in energy conservation,  as  well  as

expanding it to clean energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng cited the example of the hybrid vehicles as an

illustration that the Government is not prepared to  put  the

money  where  its  mouth  is, in terms  of  promoting  energy

conservation.  Sir, I beg to differ, because in the  case  of

the  hybrid  vehicles,  the Ministry  of  Communications  and

Information Technology has already explained that  the  green

policy as well as the transportation policy, must go hand  in

hand.   In  our national interest, Government has to  balance

between the green policy and transportation policy.   As  far

as  the IACEC is concerned, I assure Mr Heng that my Ministry

will   do  whatever  we  can  to  harness  the  support   and

participation of the 3P sectors so that together, we can move

towards energy conservation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> I thank the Acting Minister for

his reply and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Heng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MF 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, being a highly urbanised place, the

noise level and noise pollution are relatively high, compared

to  many other countries less urbanised.  Like it or not,  we

have  to  bear  with  it  if we want to  continue  living  in

Singapore.   On  the  other  hand, I  must  congratulate  the

Environment  Ministry for doing a marvellous job  in  keeping

the  noise pollution within very acceptable limits.  However,

what  I  fail  to  understand is why does the Ministry  still

allow  the  use  of the normal percussion piling  methods  in

construction sites when these sites are situated  very  close

to  existing  residential areas.  The use of  such  a  piling

method, using a heavy block dropping on the top of a pile  to

hammer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



the  pile into the ground, creates too much noise for  nearby

residents,  regardless of the measurement  of  noise  at  the

point where the noise is being generated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such a method is similar to using a hammer to knock

a  nail  into a piece of wood, except that the dimensions  of

the hammer and nail are now increased by 1,000-fold.  Besides

noise,  such a method also often causes stress to  structures

of  nearby buildings, creating cracks in the walls of  nearby

buildings,  and very often, conflicts between neighbours.   I

would  like the Minister to consider banning the use of  such

piling methods in construction sites by reducing the level of

permitted  noise generated from construction sites when  such

sites  are  within certain distances from residential  areas.

After  all,  there  are quieter, alternative  piling  methods

which contractors can use.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lily Neo, you have the privilege of

moving the last cut.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, bad air in the

office buildings here makes one in three office workers  feel

lethargic  and  experience dryness of the  throat,  skin  and

eyes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new survey by the National University of Singapore

(NUS) researchers found that workers here have it worse  than

those in 11 European countries when it comes to 10 out of the

top dozen health problems linked to "sick-building syndrome".

Sir,  "sick-building syndrome" refers to an excess  of  work-related irritation of the skin and mucous membranes and other

symptoms,   including  headache  and  fatigue,  reported   by

occupants in modern office buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers checked 98 locations in five buildings.

The  buildings  generally had lower levels of carbon  dioxide

and fine dust particles but marginally higher carbon monoxide

levels  than  buildings  in  Europe.   But  high  levels   of

contamination were found here in a few isolated locations  in

the  five buildings surveyed.  Yeast, mould formaldehyde  and

carbon dioxide also exceeded the limits in some spots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one interesting finding of the local survey was

that workers were not as dissatisfied with the air quality as

those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



in  Europe, although Singapore workers showed more  symptoms.

Our  cultural differences could explain this.  It is possible

that  employees  here are less likely to  complain  to  their

bosses,  even  if they suffer "sick-building syndrome",  than

workers  in European work places.  Earlier, studies  here  by

ENV  found  that one in five office workers here have  health

problems because of poorly ventilated buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that indoor air quality is a subject

of  public  health importance as many spend  a  lot  of  time

working  indoors.  Studies show that most people  here  spend

80%  of  their  time  indoors.  Poor  air  quality  decreases

productivity because of discomfort, absenteeism and sickness.

A  number  of Australian and overseas studies have identified

the  high costs of poor quality indoor air.  Sir, these costs

included  direct  medical  costs, loss  in  productivity  and

damages  to material and equipment.  Loss in productivity  in

the  United States of America is estimated to be nearly  five

times that of direct medical costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air quality is influenced by temperature, humidity, air

movement  and  air contaminants.  There are  legislation  and

regulations governing indoor air quality in US, Australia and

New Zealand.  In view of the great implications of indoor air

quality,  I  would urge the Minister for the  Environment  to

have regulations in place here to ensure compliance with  air

quality  and  thus  ensuring healthier  workers,  and  better

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the US Environmental Protection Agency's draft

report  concluded for the first time that dioxin was a  human

carcinogen.  May I ask the Minister for the Environment  what

are  the measures taken by his Ministry to control the  level

of  dioxins  emitted  into the atmosphere,  and  whether  the

current levels emitted to our air atmosphere are safe.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr

Heng  Chiang Meng for bringing up this important issue.   Our

law  takes  into consideration the background  noise  of  the

environment.  The noise measured would be adjusted  according

to the background noise. Therefore, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



permissible noise level in a quiet neighbourhood will be more

stringent,  when  compared  to a  neighbourhood  with  higher

background noise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that jack hammers or percussion hammers can pose

a problem if done close to a residential building, especially

caused  by the vibrations which transmit through the  ground.

Our  law  restricts the noise level being  generated  by  the

piling  activities, regardless of the types of  equipment  or

machinery used during construction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I am pleased to announce that all new

construction  sites, commencing work from 1st  October  2001,

and  located within 150 metres of residential premises,  will

be  required  to  observe a stricter set of noise  levels  at

night.    The  decision  to  impose  stricter  noise  control

measures  at  night  was  taken  in  response  to  the   many

complaints  which my Ministry has received.  Last  year,  for

example,  we received an average of 33 complaints a  week  on

construction noise, compared to an average of 21 per week  in

1999.  This is despite the drop in construction activities of

about 20% last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new set of noise levels will limit work at

night in two segments, the first segment, between 7 pm and 10

pm,  and  the  second segment, between  10  pm  to  the  next

morning, at 7 am.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first night segment, from 7 pm to 10 pm, the

permissible  noise  level will remain  at  65  decibels,  but

averaged over one hour, and the instantaneous noise over five

minutes shall not exceed 70 decibels.  From 10 pm till  7  am

the next morning, the permissible noise level will be lowered

to  55 decibels averaged over one hour, and the instantaneous

noise over five minutes shall not exceed 60 decibels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given these permissible noise levels, noisy work,

such  as concreting, will not be done after 7 pm.  Less noisy

work,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



such  as  erection and dismantling of form  work,  fixing  of

steel bars, loading and unloading of materials may be carried

out.   However,  after  10  pm,  only  quiet  work,  such  as

bricklaying, plastering and painting can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the more stringent control of our noise at

construction  sites, we hope that residents living  close  to

construction  sites  will  have  quieter  evenings  and  more

restful nights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo brought up the point regarding indoor

air  quality.  Following the 1995 survey, guidelines on  good

indoor  air  quality  practices were published  in  1996  and

widely  distributed  to  those  in  the  building  management

industry.   Further studies conducted in  1997  and  1998  in

offices,  MRT  stations,  schools and  underground  carparks,

showed   that   generally,  indoor  air  quality   has   been

satisfactory  in  these places, except  for  a  few  isolated

locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws on indoor air quality may not be necessary at this

time,  as  standards  have  also not  been  set  by  WHO  and

threshold levels not established.  In the meantime,  however,

ENV  enacted  laws  in February this year to  require  proper

maintenance   of  water  cooling  system  in   central   air-conditioning  of  all  public  buildings.   This  law,   when

enforced,  will  bring  down incidence of  the  Legionnaires'

disease,  caused by the legionnaire bacteria which  grows  in

poorly maintained water cooling tanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question about dioxin, as Dr Lily Neo knows,

dioxins  are  by-products  of  combustion.   They  are   also

produced by some industrial and natural processes.   ENV  has

been monitoring dioxin levels in ambient air since 1999.   So

far,  trace  levels  have  been detected  occasionally.   The

levels  are lower than the levels found in quite a number  of

developed  countries, such as Germany,  UK  and  Netherlands.

Hence, the level of dioxin in our ambient air does not pose a

problem.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the electricity and gas functions of the Public

Utilities  Board  (PUB) were corporatised  as  a  first  step

towards  introducing competition in the electricity  and  gas

industries. PUB was then restructured

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



to   regulate  the  electricity  and  gas  industries,  while

retaining its responsibilities for ensuring safe and reliable

water supply in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, PUB comprises two parts: the electricity and

gas  Regulator and the Water Department.  But the  PUB  Water

Department  is not the only agency dealing with  water.   The

Ministry  of  the  Environment (ENV) also deals  with  water,

through its Drainage and Sewerage Departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Public Utilities Bill is to respond to the changes

in  the  water industry. Allow me to explain.  In  the  early

days,  drainage  systems were meant to drain  away  rainwater

quickly  to  prevent  flooding.  At the same  time,  sewerage

systems  were put in place to control pollution in  order  to

protect  public  health.   Hence the  Drainage  and  Sewerage

Departments come under ENV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, pollution is well under control in Singapore and

all our water catchments have been cleaned up. All used water

is  now  channelled into our sewerage systems and  all  solid

wastes are collected and treated before disposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With clean catchments, our drainage system is no longer

just  for flood prevention but has, in selected areas, become

means to channel rainwater into our reservoirs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, water treatment technology has advanced

considerably, making it economical to treat and recycle  used

water  in  a  significant  way.  The  used  water  from   our

wastewater treatment plants can today be treated to standards

much  higher  than the WHO's drinking water  standards,  even

meeting   the  stringent  requirements  of  those  industries

requiring ultra-pure water, as in the wafer fabs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has enabled us to construct a robust water supply

system  by  tapping on several economically  viable  sources,

thereby  diversifying our water sources.  Thus,  even  as  we

continue  to develop more of our local sources of  water  and

buy  water from Malaysia, we are also exploring buying  water

from Indonesia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



And  with  the opportunity now available through advances  in

technology, we will also develop seawater desalination plants

and recycle used water more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that we can fully exploit our domestic water

resources, we cannot continue to manage the water cycle under

separate   agencies.  To  reduce  wastage  and   to   exploit

synergies,  we  need  a  PUB that has  the  mandate  and  the

resources  to  manage  the entire water cycle  optimally;  in

other  words,  we  should  integrate  the  separate  agencies

together into a sole water authority for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to merge the

existing PUB Water Department and ENV's Drainage and Sewerage

Departments  into  a restructured PUB.  The restructured  PUB

will  then  be  placed  under ENV.  At  the  same  time,  the

electricity and gas regulatory functions of the existing  PUB

will  be taken out to form a new statutory board, the  Energy

Market  Authority of Singapore or EMA under the  Ministry  of

Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to effect these changes, this Bill

which  I move today seeks to repeal the Public Utilities  Act

(Cap. 261) to be re-enacted as the Public Utilities Act 2001.

The  re-enacted  Act  will enable the Sewerage  and  Drainage

Departments   of  ENV  to  be  integrated  with   the   Water

Department, forming the restructured PUB.  The responsibility

for  the restructured PUB will then be moved from MTI to  ENV

with effect from 1st April 2001.

<br><br><i>The Water Authority</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructured PUB will become the sole water

authority    in   Singapore.    The   Bill   retains,    with

modifications,   the  provisions  of  the   existing   Public

Utilities Act with regard to the functions, duties and powers

of  the PUB in relation to water.  The Bill will also empower

the  restructured PUB to directly administer the Sewerage and

Drainage Acts, which were hitherto administered by ENV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions and duties of the restructured PUB will

include providing an adequate supply of water, regulating the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



supply  of  piped  water  for  human  consumption,  supplying

industrial  and treated used water, and operating the  public

sewer systems and storm water drainage systems.

<br><br><i>Main Provisions in the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now touch briefly on the main

provisions in this Bill. Clauses 6 and 7, together  with  the

Second Schedule of the Bill, set out the functions and duties

of the restructured PUB.  Briefly, it will provide, construct

and  maintain  the infrastructure for the collection,  supply

and  use of water for public and private purposes; secure and

provide  an  adequate  supply  of  water  for  Singapore   at

reasonable prices; and regulate the supply of piped water for

human consumption.  It will act as an agent of the Government

in the management and maintenance of public sewerage systems,

public  sewers and storm water drainage systems,  drains  and

drainage reserves belonging to the Government.  It will  also

regulate  the  construction, maintenance and  improvement  of

sewerage  and  land drainage systems, and  the  discharge  of

sewage and trade effluent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing powers of the current PUB to regulate and

implement  the  supply  of water for  human  consumption  are

retained in Parts IV and V of  this Bill.

At  the same time, more stringent measures over water service

installations are being introduced in view of the  experience

gained from the recent water contamination incident in  Bukit

Timah Plaza. Currently PUB requires water installations to be

checked  once  every year by licensed plumbers. This  measure

will remain in force.  The Bill will in addition require such

installations to be inspected by a professional engineer  and

certified  fit  and safe once every five  years.   Any  party

convicted of contravening this requirement will be liable  to

a  fine  not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a  term

not exceeding 12 months, or to both.  The Bill will also hold

parties  responsible  for  causing  contamination  to   water

supplied  by  PUB. Responsible parties will  have  to  ensure

regular and adequate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



checks   on  their  water  installations.  The  penalty   for

contravening  this requirement is $50,000 or to  imprisonment

for a term not exceeding three years, or to both.

<br><br><i>Transfer  of  Assets and Protecting Terms and  Conditions  of Service for Staff</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In restructuring the PUB, we will need to ensure the

proper  transfer of staff, properties, rights and liabilities

related  to the Sewerage and Drainage Departments of ENV,  to

the  PUB.  Clauses 60 to 66 provide for the transfer  to  the

PUB  of property, assets and liabilities and of employees  in

the  Sewerage and Drainage Departments and the protection  of

their terms and conditions of service on transfer.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, water is a strategic resource.

Technology advances, both in seawater desalination and in the

treatment  and  recycling of used water, have enabled  us  to

considerably  enhance our water strategy.  These developments

open up more choices and allow us to diversify our sources of

water.   The restructured PUB will be able to take  advantage

of  these  developments and deliver to us a more  robust  and

secure water supply in a holistic and optimal way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in speaking on

this Bill, let me first declare my interest that I am a Board

member  of  the present Public Utilities Board.  I note  that

the   new   Public  Utilities  Bill  will  bring  the   water

undertaking  portion of the present PUB,  together  with  the

Sewerage  and  Drainage Departments of the  Ministry  of  the

Environment  (ENV),  to  form the  sole  water  authority  in

Singapore.   At  the  same time, the current  power  and  gas

regulatory  functions  of  PUB will  be  retained  under  the

Ministry of Trade and Industry, under a new statutory  board.

The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



new restructured PUB will come under the ambit of ENV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after listening to the various clarifications on

water   related  issues  by  the  Acting  Minister  for   the

Environment  who  spoke  during  the  Committee   of   Supply

deliberations yesterday and also studying the  chart  on  the

future thrust of the Environment Ministry, distributed during

the  session, and also as asserted by the Acting Minister for

Trade and Industry just now, I am convinced that bringing the

water  management function of the current PUB into  one  sole

authority  will  provide the needed focus on all  aspects  of

water  regulation and management.  Its integration  with  the

Ministry  of  the  Environment's Drainage  Department  (which

constructs   and   maintains  drainage  systems   for   water

collection and its channelling into reservoirs or  seas)  and

the  Sewerage  Department (which collects  and  treats  waste

water to acceptable standards before re-use) closes the water

loop  which will bring about optimal deployment of  resources

to enable us to maximise the use from our water inventory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among several water topics, the Acting Minister

yesterday also spoke at length about how Newater is produced,

employing the latest in membrane technology, Newater's future

usage  plan  and  how it will benefit the  wafer  fabrication

industry  in terms of purer water and lower cost.  With  only

5%  of  the water now being recycled and 95% discharged  into

the  sea,  we have enormous potential to do more  to  exploit

ever improving technologies to reclaim and recycle used water

from  a  multitude of sources.  This very fact alone provides

for  strong justification to bring together the entire  water

management  chain  from water collection  and  processing  to

reclamation  and recycling to achieve not only  economies  of

scale but also efficiency maximisation in water distribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, as we move forward with new initiatives to

harness  our water inventory, it is important that  assurance

be given to the public that the water supply delivered to our

homes remains of high quality as we have them today.  Any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



major change in the elemental composition should properly  be

communicated to prevent unnecessary alarm.  Public trust must

always be maintained in whatever we do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singaporeans, we all know how precious water is

to  all  of us.  It is imperative that we continue to concern

ourselves with finding new and innovative methods in  how  we

can  collect  and re-use as much of the water as possible  in

our  country.  Doing this will decrease our dependence on our

neighbours who often enough have threatened to cut our  water

supply  or have used it as a bargaining chip when negotiating

issues  of  strategic  importance.  As we  discover  new  and

cheaper  techniques to do this, there must be  no  let-up  in

continuous  public  education of the preciousness  of  water.

The  current  PUB has done a terrific job in  bringing  about

this consciousness to the public.  And it is my hope that the

new PUB will continue the good work of its predecessors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I applaud the retention of the acronym "PUB",

which is indeed a familiar household name, the PUB as we know

it today deals with all aspects of public utilities, not only

water  but  also electricity and gas supplies to  our  homes.

Could  the Minister please explain why this name is retained,

even  though  the new PUB will be concerned with water  only?

Also,  what will happen to the PUB bills?  Will we in  future

have  separate bills for water, electricity and gas?  If  so,

will  this not make it more cumbersome for the public to deal

with so many bills?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I have, Sir, is with regard to the

water facilities in Johor, Malaysia, which is managed by  the

present  PUB.  I would like to ask the Minister  whether  the

newly  constituted  PUB  will embrace  the  entire  Malaysian

operation as it is, and whether it will directly inherit  all

the people involved in the Malaysian operation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Ahmad Magad for

supporting the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At yesterday's Committee of Supply debate on the

Ministry  of  the  Environment, the Acting Minister  for  the

Environment  had spoken at length about water, its  security,

and so on.  So I would not touch on that now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me address the reason why the name "PUB" is

retained.   As  Mr Magad has said, this is a  household  name

today.   It  has got international repute and accolades  from

many  countries  as  well.  In fact, we have  considered  the

alternative  of, perhaps, calling it the "Water Authority  of

Singapore".   But  it would seem a great pity  to  consign  a

household name, a very well-known and familiar name,  to  the

archives.  In any case, water is a public utility and  it  is

by no means a misnomer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also say that proper management of water,

whether  it  is  rainfall, used water or drinking  water,  is

very, very much a matter for the protection of public health.

This  is  one  of the reasons why we would have also  put  it

under  the Ministry of the Environment.  But although we  say

that water is an important resource not only for domestic use

and  it  affects  public health, the Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry  (MTI)  would still continue to have  a  very,  very

strong  interest in that because water is also  a  factor  of

production in the economy.  We would be keeping a very  close

watch, as the whole of Singapore would.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was also asked on whether the restructuring

of  PUB will affect the employees working in Johor now.   The

answer  is  that the Water Department of PUB  would  be  kept

intact and all the employees would not be affected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Clarification, Sir. Can I ask the

Minister  what will happen to PUB bills, as we  all  know  it

today, which encompass water, electricity and gas?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> As far as I know, the bills would still

be  consolidated, unless I am advised otherwise.  I could not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, transitional arrangements are provided for under

section 73(6) of the

Public  Utilities  Bill  for  the provisions  regulating  the

electricity   and  gas  industries  in  the  current   Public

Utilities Act to remain in force until the changes  to  these

industries  are implemented later this year.  The  provisions

governing the current market will therefore also continue  to

apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the provisions governing the current market

continue to apply, the EMA, which will be the regulator  from

1st  April 2001, will need to be empowered so as to  continue

to  administer  the  current market and  issue  new  licences

during   the  transition  period,  until  the  new   industry

structure is put in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Second Reading of the Public Utilities

Bill,  I  had informed the House that a new statutory  board,

known  as the Energy Market Authority of Singapore,  or  EMA,

will  be  established  under  my  Ministry  to  regulate  the

electricity  and  gas  industries  and  other  energy-related

matters,  when the current PUB is restructured to  deal  only

with water on 1st April.

<br><br><i>Restructuring the Electricity and Gas Industry</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2000, Minister George Yeo announced in this

House,  the  Government's decision to further liberalise  the

electricity and gas industries by separating at the ownership

level,  the  contestable  and non-contestable  parts  of  the

industries.   I will explain the restructuring of  these  two

industries  in greater detail during the Second  Readings  of

the Electricity and Gas Bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to establish the EMA as the

Regulator of the electricity and gas industries, as  well  as

other energy sectors that it is designated to regulate.

<br><br><i>Role of the Regulator, EMA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the restructuring is completed in the second

half of this year, our electricity and gas industries will be

quite  different  from the status quo.  We  can  expect  more

local  and  foreign  industry players to participate  in  the

competitive generation and retail sectors.  It will become  a

more  dynamic  and  vibrant market with generation  companies

competing to sell electricity into the wholesale market,  and

retailers bidding to purchase electricity from the generators

and supplying it to the consumers.  Consumers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



can expect greater choice of electricity suppliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new competitive environment, the regulator has a

critical  role in ensuring the smooth and efficient operation

of  the  markets.   Like the referee of a soccer  match,  the

regulator  has to ensure that the players compete fairly  and

abide  by  the  rules and regulations.  He has  to  blow  the

whistle  and show the yellow card on players who  breach  the

rules; on certain occasions, he may even have to show the red

card.  A good soccer match is the result of the confluence of

three important factors: a clear set of rules of the game,  a

team  of strong players and a fair and alert referee.  It  is

not  unknown  for  a poor soccer match to be  blamed  on  bad

refereeing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our electricity and gas sectors are being restructured

into  a more competitive one.  The role of the regulator  has

therefore to evolve from one of regulating monopolies to that

of  regulating competitive markets.  In the new  regime,  EMA

will  focus  on  ensuring that there is a good framework  for

vibrant  competitive  markets  whilst  still  regulating  the

monopoly  functions  of  transmission  and  distribution   of

electricity and gas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing back the soccer game analogy, EMA has to be a

good  referee as well as a good rule maker.  As referee,  EMA

is  in  the soccer field with the players, running with them,

watching their play constantly and closely.  The referee  has

to  make  fair  and timely decisions in the soccer  field  to

allow  the  game to continue uninterrupted.  But  EMA's  role

goes beyond just being a good referee.  The EMA has to ensure

that  the rules remain relevant and fair.  As the rule maker,

the  EMA has to be independent, open and transparent  in  its

decision-making.   Its rules must be clear  and  unambiguous.

Its  approach  would  be  one  of  active  consultation  with

consumers and industry.  It justifies its policies  not  just

on   sound  legal  grounds  but  also  on  rigorous  economic

analysis.  The job of the Regulator will become more complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA has four key roles. First, it must promote a

competitive and well-functioning electricity and gas market,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



restricting  market power, while at the same  time,  ensuring

the  security  and  reliability of the  electricity  and  gas

supply.   It  will  need to carry out the  balanced  role  of

ensuring that market forces work in a competitive environment

and  yet  maintaining an element of control for security  and

reliability  of  supply.  It has to foster  a  stable  market

environment  that will promote competition, encourage  timely

investment  in  generation  and  transmission  capacity,  and

instil investor confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the security and reliability of power supply,

the  EMA  will  take over responsibility for controlling  and

operating  the  electricity  system  network  from  Singapore

Power.  This will ensure that the security of our electricity

system  which  can potentially influence competition  in  the

electricity   market,   is   not   affected   by   commercial

considerations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, EMA will safeguard the interests of consumers,

to  ensure  that they are provided with electricity  and  gas

services  at  competitive prices and of  adequate  standards.

Through a comprehensive licensing framework and a set of well-established market rules and codes of practices, the EMA will

be  empowered to act against errant companies if  performance

and  service  fall below specified levels.  It can  also  use

incentives  to  motivate market players to higher  levels  of

performance and service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important area for the EMA is the close monitoring of

market behaviour to guard against the concentration of market

power,  abuse  of  dominance and exercise of anti-competitive

behaviours,  such  as  collusion and capacity  withdrawal  to

drive   up   prices.   We  have  therefore  included   strong

competition provisions into the Electricity and Gas Bills  to

empower  the  EMA to act against anti-competitive  behaviours

and  practices.  I will elaborate on these provisions in  the

Second Reading of the Electricity Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the EMA will promote the efficient use of energy

utilities.   As  Singapore  has  to  import  all  our  energy

requirements, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



must  encourage and educate the public to use energy sensibly

and  conserve as much as possible.  The EMA will work closely

with  industry, consumers and other regulatory agencies, like

the  Building  Control  Authority  (BCA),  to  encourage  the

adoption  of  conservation measures like  energy  audits  and

energy-efficient equipment and devices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the EMA will represent Singapore's interest in

regional  and international energy forums, such as ASEAN  and

APEC.   This is to ensure that we will continue to have  free

and  non-discriminatory access to global sources  of  energy,

especially  oil and natural gas.  Members would be  aware  of

the  two  important projects being pursued  under  ASEAN  co-operation,  that is, the ASEAN Power Grid and the Trans-ASEAN

Gas  Pipeline.  These projects when completed  will  give  us

access to more competitive energy sources and further enhance

the security of our energy supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of EMA in carrying out these roles will be

measured  by how well the market is performing in  delivering

reliable   electricity  and  gas  supply  to   consumers   at

competitive prices with the best level of service.  Consumers

will  have a host of suppliers providing electricity and  gas

services  tailored according to their needs.  There  will  be

timely   and  adequate  investment  in  new  generation   and

transmission  capacity  to  meet the  needs  of  the  growing

economy and electricity demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to perform its role effectively, the EMA has to

be  given  adequate  resources.   The  EMA  will  absorb  the

existing  staff of the Regulation Department of  the  current

PUB  and  the System Control Unit of PowerGrid,  which  is  a

subsidiary  of Singapore Power.  In addition,  the  EMA  will

progressively  build up a pool of economists  with  expertise

and knowledge in economic regulation, micro-economic analysis

and competition policies.

<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill serves as an umbrella Act

that empowers EMA to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



administer  the  industry-specific legislation,  namely,  the

Electricity  Act  2001,  the Gas Act 2001  and  the  District

Cooling  Act  2001.  These legislation spell out the  details

for  the  regulation of the respective industry.  I  will  be

moving them for the Second Reading following the EMA Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill sets out the functions and duties

of the EMA which I have enunciated earlier.  Clauses 21 to 23

provide   for   the  transfer  of  properties,   assets   and

liabilities of the Regulation Department of the  PUB  to  the

EMA.  It also provides for the transfer of employees from the

PUB  to  the  EMA  and  the protection  of  their  terms  and

conditions of service on transfer.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, energy is an important factor of production in any

economy.   It  is also an essential utility service.   Within

the   broader   framework  of  keeping  our  business   costs

competitive,   we   have   to   keep   our   energy    market

internationally competitive.  With this Bill, the EMA will be

able  to effectively oversee the development of a competitive

market  for  our  energy utilities, ensure the  reliable  and

secure  supply  of  electricity and  gas  and  safeguard  the

interests of consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  support  this Bill as this new Energy Market Authority  of

Singapore Bill sets to liberalise the entire electricity  and

gas  sectors.  When the Bill becomes law, it will enable  the

Government   to   gradually  break  up  the  generation   and

production from the sale and distribution so that there  will

be  more  competition, leading to more efficiency  and  lower

prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Energy Market Authority (called EMA in short)

will  regulate  the gas, electricity and other energy-related

matters.  Overall, I feel that the concept and intentions are

laudable  and  will  lead to benefits to the  end  consumers,

which are the industries, businesses and homes.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



like  the  liberalisation of the commercial  sectors,  as  in

banking  and  finance.  In banking, this is called  the  "Big

Bang".   Although  the  concept is the same,  in  the  energy

sector,  if  we are liberalising this sector, we  better  not

call  it  the "Big Bang".  Because in a sensitive area,  like

energy,  we  have to be very careful.  If wrongly ignited,  a

"Big Bang" of the energy sector may lead to a big explosion!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed concerned that if this is not done

properly, the liberalisation exercise will indeed explode  in

our  face.   I do have a worry that, if not managed properly,

the breaking up of the sector could turn into a mess.

<br><br><i>Adequate Market Size</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to explain my concerns.

First,  adequate market size.  I have a worry as  to  whether

Singapore  is  too small a market for the proper  competitive

environment  for  this energy sector to  operate.   Is  there

sufficient market size to allow several players to enter  the

market  and  remain viable and sustainable?  Is there  enough

room   for  several  power  generation  companies,  each   of

sufficient economy of scale?  Naturally, the large Government-linked  Companies (GLCs) will be entering  the  sector.   But

will  there  be  other interested parties, like  the  private

companies and foreign MNCs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is insufficient number of players to become

power  generation companies (called Gencos in short) will  it

lead to inefficiencies?  Will it lead to more efficiency,  or

in  fact  to the contrary, more confusion?  If the number  of

players  is  small,  would there,  in  fact,  be  a  risk  of

cartelisation?

<br><br><i>Impact on Prices and Service Standards</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity and gas coming out of the copper wire or

copper  pipe  will  be the same, since they  are  all  pumped

through a common grid.  Unlike other consumer products, there

is really no product differentiation for electricity and gas.

Therefore,  my  second question is: will  there  be  a  wider

number of options and choices?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



What will be the impact on prices and service levels?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues and potential problems mentioned above

are  also  applicable to the suppliers, who will on-sell  the

electricity  or  gas to the end-users.   How  would  the  EMA

ensure that the suppliers give better prices and provide good

service standards?  If the number of players is limited,  how

is  the EMA able to ensure that fair practices are maintained

by the suppliers?

<br><br><i>Difficulty of Regulation of Several Participants</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is that with the sector sub-divided

into  several  parts, would there be more difficulty  in  the

regulation and supervision of the many participants?  In  the

past,  there was just one body, which was the former PUB,  to

monitor  and  manage.  Now, the new EMA  has  to  watch  over

several  players.  As the Senior Minister of State has  said,

can the EMA be a good referee?  How would the EMA be able  to

ensure  reliability of supply?  And what if the players  play

foul?   Can the EMA act fast enough?  In the event  of  power

failures,  what are the fallback or urgent recovery measures?

How  would  the EMA ensure technical competency of the  power

generation companies?  Any power failure will not only  cause

inconvenience, but can also cause hazards to lives  and  high

economic  loss  to  industries, in terms  of  production  and

output.   We  are reminded of the total power  loss  problems

encountered in places like Malaysia, California, New  Zealand

and other places.

<br><br><i>Public Dissemination and Explanation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fourth area is on public dissemination and

understanding  of the new structure.  Here, I would  like  to

urge  MTI  and  the  new referee, EMA, to  conduct  extensive

public forums and publicity, to explain the structure of  the

new energy sector.  For industries, it is important that they

understand the mechanics of the new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



structure  so  that  they can make the  right  decisions  and

select the right choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for small businesses and households, I would like to

suggest  that  the transition be conducted in a more  gradual

manner.  For these users, the need for clear and wide  public

explanation  is  even more important.  For example,  in  some

households, we may have old folks living in very small flats,

or  residents  who are illiterate, who cannot understand  the

choices   given  to  them  and,  therefore,  are  unable   to

understand the whole new structure.

<br><br><i>Learning from Others' Experiences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point is whether there will be examples around

the  world  where  the  new approach  has  been  successfully

implemented.   If the new concept has been tried  and  tested

elsewhere,  can  we  not  learn from  them  and  avoid  their

mistakes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Ministry

of  Trade and Industry for taking this bold move of revamping

the  entire  energy  sector.   I  support  the  Bill  as  the

objectives  are  noble,  which are to  generate  competition,

leading  to better efficiency, better service and, hopefully,

lower prices for the end consumers.  Sir, let us hope that it

will work as planned.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I rise to

support the Bill relating to the establishment of the  Energy

Market  Authority in conjunction with the regulation  of  the

electricity  and  gas  industries  upon  liberalisation   and

deregulation  of  activity.  Sir, I wish, however,  to  raise

several  issues from the perspective of the domestic consumer

of electricity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the principle of complete pass-through of

costs.   Sir,  as  I  have raised earlier during  the  Budget

debate,  the  intended  extension of  liberalisation  to  the

domestic  segment  would  mean free  market  forces  will  be

allowed  to  work.   Currently,  owing  to  the  monopolistic

situation  and  the  quarterly review of  tariffs,  household

consumers are not really exposed to the volatility  of,  say,

the fuel oil price cycle, such as the one seen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



recently.   As such, a substantial amount of public education

should  be  undertaken  to  acquaint  households  with   this

principle, that there will no longer be price regulation  nor

any  review.  Notwithstanding this, I would also like to  ask

the  Minister separately what measures will be taken to  help

preserve  price  stability  as far  as  possible.   Also,  in

practice,  how would EMA determine whether prices are  indeed

competitively set?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, infrastructural costs. When the retailing

function is liberalised, presumably, there will be scope  for

product  differentiation,  even  on  just  price  alone,  eg,

offering  peak and off-peak rates.  As such, there  are  very

likely to be some changes to the supply infrastructure, eg, a

change in meters.  Unlike big corporate customers, individual

households  will  not  wield the same  amount  of  bargaining

power.   In  the light of this, can the Minister  assure  the

House   that   households  will  not  have  to   bear   these

infrastructure-related costs unfairly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, choice available to households. Sir, the

Minister has said that consumers would enjoy greater  choice.

But  what choice would households really enjoy?  As mentioned

earlier, unlike big corporate customers, households, on their

own,   do  not  have  strong  bargaining  power.   Is  there,

therefore, a possibility of, say, Town Councils or, for  that

matter, the Housing and Development Board itself, functioning

as  a  retail  supplier to HDB dwellers?  In  this  way,  the

aggregate buying power will be greatly enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, from the domestic consumers'

perspective, liberalisation or deregulation must bring  forth

some  tangible benefits.  These could be either lower tariffs

on  average, or more choice through the bundling of  services

by suppliers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise

to  speak in support of the Government's privatisation  plans

to  set  up  a regulatory authority for the energy  utilities

market.   By  injecting competition in the energy market,  we

are  in  fact allowing market forces to help ensure that  the

utilisation of resources will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



be better maximised.  This is important for Singapore, as our

resources  are scarce.  In the long run, having more  players

in   the   energy  market  should  also  benefit   customers.

Consumers will be given more choices.  The competition should

lead to better service and new products.  Pricing for the use

of energy utilities should also become more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, Sir, the road to privatisation is

not  without obstacles.  There are some lessons that  we  can

learn  from our past privatisation experiences.  There  is  a

transitional period that needs to be managed before  multiple

players establish themselves in the energy market, before the

market  is  fully liberalised, before free market forces  can

operate to the benefit of consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some issues I would like the Minister to

consider.   We  all know that energy utility is an  essential

service.   By  this,  I mean that it is  a  service  that  is

required  by  everyone.  Residents of all income groups  need

the  supply of electricity and gas to their homes.  The level

of consumption may be different, but energy utility is needed

by the rich, the poor and the man-in-the-street.  Sir, if the

prices  of  energy utilities are not properly  regulated,  it

will  contribute to inflationary pressures and raise business

costs.   If  services by energy companies are not up  to  the

mark,  if  their  infrastructural and capital  investment  in

Singapore   is   inadequate,  it  can  lead  to   unnecessary

blackouts, inconvenience to households, and major disruptions

to the economy.  We may not plunge into a post-liberalisation

scenario  similar to the recent experiences of  Californians.

But we have had minor disruptions that warrant some concerns.

For example, we know from experience that an upsurge of power

disrupt  automated banking service, wafer fab production  and

so  on.   What  we  must  prevent at  all  cost  is  a  post-liberalisation  scenario where frequent  glitches  by  energy

companies  lead  to  a  crippling of  investors'  confidence.

Glitches in energy supply should be exceptional.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they do happen, people will start to ask why

did the Government want

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



to  opt  for privatisation?  For example, ask any man-in-the-street  or those from the lower income group for their  views

on their experiences following the sale of POSBank, they will

lament  to  us  that it was more convenient in the  past,  as

there  used to be more POSBank branches.  They will  complain

to  us  about the long queues and waiting time that they  are

now  subject  to.   They  will  remember  the  administrative

charges that were waived by the people's bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, some people are wary that privatised

entities  would  be too focused on getting  the  best  bottom

line,  to the extent that the basic and fundamental interests

of the common people are sacrificed in the process.  They are

concerned  that  privatised entities  might  be  too  profit-driven,  becoming  more interested in striking  up  strategic

alliances  to be a key regional energy utilities  player  and

forget  about the average Singaporean, especially those  from

the  lower  income  group.   The lower  income  families  are

concerned  that they may no longer be able to enjoy subsidies

for energy utilities in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the regulatory body has been given a huge

responsibility.   They must be proactive about  ensuring  the

best  service  quality and competitive pricing,  rather  than

take  a passive approach of slapping the penalties after  the

problem  has  occurred.   This is a  role  that  I  hope  our

regulatory  authorities will adopt.  We must learn  from  the

recent  experience of the Californians.  We must ensure  that

energy utility companies coming into the local market must be

willing    to    commit   themselves   to   make   sufficient

infrastructural investments.  I hope that the  Energy  Market

Authority  of Singapore does not assume that, by having  more

players  in  the  market, it will result in competition  and,

therefore,  naturally  benefit the consumers.   That  is  not

always the case.  After all, it was only quite recently  that

our  motorists were quite unhappy that when oil  prices  were

falling,  the  petroleum companies in Singapore maintained  a

cartel-like grip on the local petroleum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



market,  and were reluctant to lower petrol prices  until  an

issue  was  made  out  of it.  Should we still  allow  market

forces to prevail, even if there is collusion between the key

service providers or suppliers in the market?  Is the  Energy

Market  Authority  of Singapore empowered  to  intervene  and

regulate prices?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, consumers may exercise their discretion

and rights by switching to another service provider.  But, in

the  initial transitional stage of privatisation, before more

players come in and establish themselves in the market,  what

choice  do consumers have?  How can the consumers' rights  be

protected from a privatised monopoly, duopoly or oligopoly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Energy Market Authority of

Singapore  will  adopt a pro-active watchdog role  to  ensure

that  the  interests of consumers, especially those from  the

lower  income  group, continue to be protected  in  terms  of

pricing and service quality.  The last thing that we want  to

see  out  of  this  privatisation exercise is  another  post-POSBank debacle emerging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I am glad that the

Government has finally decided to fully liberalise the energy

market  in  Singapore.  Like the telecommunications industry,

the  energy  business  is really a worldwide  commodity  and,

therefore,  there is little need for the Government  to  have

such a strong control and monopoly over the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is the basis for the rest of the Bills that we

will  be  debating today and, as I studied the  rest  of  the

Bills,  I  realised  that the Government  is  making  drastic

changes  to  make  almost  everything  contestable,  and   to

privatise  the  whole  value  chain  of  activities  in   the

electricity and gas industries.  The one concern  I  have  is

that  the EMA does not have very much control over even  some

strategic  parts of the whole supply and distribution  chain.

I  therefore urge the Minister to consider restructuring  the

plans, to allow EMA to own and manage the strategic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



infrastructure in both electricity and gas distribution.  For

electricity, I suggest that EMA take over the managing of the

power   grid  and,  for  gas,  it  can  take  over  the   gas

transportation infrastructures.  The fact is that  these  two

portions  of  the whole supply chain will not  really  change

from the present infrastructure.  I therefore think that  EMA

should  be  the  neutral body owning  these  assets  for  the

following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. These infrastructures are strategic in nature and

they   directly  affect  the  consumers,  whether  they   are

commercial, industrial or domestic.  We should not allow  any

opportunity for any non-government agency to have too much of

authority  and control over national strategic infrastructure

which could also affect our national security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The infrastructure is already fully developed by the

Government,  and there is no real reason to  spin  off  these

assets  as  they  will  not directly  affect  the  intent  of

liberalising the generation and retail of energy sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. I do not see why there is a need for developing

other   alternative  infrastructures  for   distribution   of

electricity and gas, as the Singapore market is too small for

one or a few more infrastructure players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If we let a private sector run these distribution

channels,  there may be problems for generators and retailers

of  energy sources when all of them compete to use  the  same

infrastructure.  It is not inconceivable that  if  a  private

company runs the infrastructure, it may lead to some form  of

preferential  treatment for some generators or retailers,  by

virtue  of some business relationships that may develop  over

time.   It is, therefore, more appropriate for an independent

entity,  which has the interest of the country,  to  own  and

manage  the infrastructure and the Government, or the EMA  as

the agency, to do this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to make on this Bill is the

premise  that  the liberalisation of the energy  sector  will

lead  to cheaper energy sources.  I hope that this will truly

be the case and that all Singaporeans and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



Singapore-based companies will enjoy cost reductions for  the

utilities,  which over the years, have been so high  that  we

are  paying  even more than countries like the US and  Japan.

While  we  may  think  that the cost of utilities  is  small,

compared  to the overall cost of doing business in Singapore,

the  fact  is  that as we move to the higher technology  type

industries  like water fab, petrochemical and  pharmaceutical

industries, it is a major cost component.  It is,  therefore,

very important that we will successfully create a competitive

environment that will, in the long-term, keep costs of energy

low.   In this respect, I hope that the Ministry will be able

to   create   an  environment  that  supports   true   market

competition  and  not  support  only  what  seems  to  be   a

competitive  landscape  by licensing  only  Government-linked

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point on the Bill is the appointment of members

of  the Authority.  The Bill provides for up to 10 members to

be  appointed  by the Minister.  I suggest that the  Minister

consider having a good mix of people from the private, public

and  people sectors to be members of this Authority, as  this

will give a diversified perspective of things and also give a

good  representation of everyone who will be affected by  the

changes to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I support the Bill, subject to some

questions which I hope the Acting Minister will answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in asking these questions, I also believe this is

an  important Bill.  There is basically a growing  belief  in

markets  throughout  the world that privatisation  has  clear

benefits.  The benefits of privatisation are especially clear

when  things  have  been  badly  run  by  the  Government  in

countries where either there is no power, no water or if some

things  are  very bad, then you really see that  markets  and

private   companies   must   come   in.    Fortunately,    or

unfortunately in that sense, the benefits are not so clear in

Singapore.   The  system is relatively good, the  quality  at

present  seems relatively assured, and, therefore, focus  has

tended to be on prices.  A move to privatisation, therefore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



has  a  lot  to prove.  Basically, we have to ask  ourselves,

whom do we trust.  Do we trust the Government, as a provider,

as  well as the administrator, or do we provide trust in  the

markets?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other speakers before me have already talked about

cartels.   I  think  there are some bad stories.   There  are

concerns  about petrol companies, as well as things like  the

DBS  Bank  consolidation with POSBank.  But I would  like  to

point  out  that  competition and choice for  consumers  have

worked    in    some   other   cases   of   note    recently.

Telecommunications    is   one   clear    case;    similarly,

supermarkets.   We  have gained from having foreign  entrants

and  I  would  say,  perhaps flippantly, on  bookstores  too.

Borders bookstore has made a tremendous difference over  Time

and  MPH  before.   In this sense, there is both  a  cautious

optimism  about  allowing  in foreigners  and  allowing  more

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this caution has to be weighed against the needs.

I  think  if  we look at the region and the future,  we  have

concerns  about energy security, not just our internal  grid,

but  the long-term demand and supply in the region and in the

world  generally.  If the region does go up economically,  as

we  hope,  energy needs will go up and supply may  go  short.

Therefore,  we  have taken steps in the last  few  months  to

secure   fixed  supplies,  such  as  the  natural  gas   from

Indonesia.   Regional  needs  and  cross-border  supply   and

generation, I think, are the ways of the future.  This  would

require  companies in this sector to be both  big  and  think

long-term.  I wonder, Sir, whether privatisation will  really

create  these  companies, or whether Government has  actually

got the deep pockets and a long-term vision to lead the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of deregulation and

restructuring   markets,  we  have  to  be  concerned   about

efficiencies.   The  crisis recently in California  has  been

mentioned several times.  I would just like to quickly  share

my  view  on  why this happened.  Basically, this is  because

consumer prices were fixed by the law.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



As  such,  when demand rose and prices rose, there was  over-demand,  which  could  not be alleviated  by  rising  prices.

Obviously, this should be avoided.  We should have  a  market

with   enough   players  and  consumers,  and  a   sufficient

flexibility in prices that will match the supply and demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while I would encourage not having fixed

prices,  I  must  recognise there is a  concern  over  rising

costs,  especially for households.  In this  light,  I  would

like to point out one shortcoming of the drafting of clause 6

in  the Bill.  Looking at clause 6, the closest I can get  to

the  question of price is that in clause 6(e).  Here,  it  is

proposed  that  the Bill will protect the  interests  of  the

public,  in respect of the supply and use of electricity  and

gas  and  the  provision of district cooling services.   Sir,

there  is no statement about reasonable prices.  In contrast,

if  you  look  at  clause 6(c) of the Public Utilities  Bill,

which  we  have just passed, there is a clear statement  here

that  one  of the duties of the statutory board would  be  to

provide supply at reasonable cost.  I think this is something

that  the  Ministry should address to assuage public concerns

about cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I have got a few points, if I may move on

quickly.   First, I would like to see a lower  threshold  for

entry by suppliers to bring sufficient players to the market.

Many   of   us   have   talked  about  the   large   players.

Additionally, we have got to make accommodation in  the  grid

for micro-power and micro-power suppliers.  Every time I pass

by  the  incineration plant or the refinery  and  I  see  the

flare, I think that is energy we could have tapped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the consumer choice is a concern. If we have

flexible   prices  and  competitors,  this  only  makes   any

difference if households know about the differences in  price

and  can switch.  I would like to ask the Minister what would

be  the mechanism for alerting consumers, who is the cheapest

producer,  supplier,  or  what  are  the  cheapest  times  in

allowing  them to switch between one supplier and another  in

real time, not just month to month or year to year?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element I would like to point out is

competition policy.  Clause 6(1) creates and imposes upon the

Authority the duty to regulate the market, make it  fair  and

efficient,  that will have effective competition and  prevent

the  misuse of monopoly or market power.  Clearly, Sir,  this

is  going to be a difficult and a new area for Singapore law.

It  must  be  tried.  Recently, in this House, we have  heard

that  there are international trends that pressure  Singapore

to  take  on competition policy.  It is a very good  attempt,

especially  to  address competition policy  from  a  new  and

preferably  narrow segment of the market, such as the  supply

of energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question of how is something I hope the Acting

Minister  will  elaborate  upon.  Who  can  complain  to  the

Authority  if  he  feels  that there  is  a  monopoly  or  an

inefficient  market?   Is it consumers or  only  rival  power

companies?  Second, will the duty be questionable  in  courts

that  the Authority has not adjudicated properly or  will  it

only be by the Authority?  And will there be public hearings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we have to have a regulatory authority over

competition,  there must be a clear structure  for  different

competitors and stakeholders, like the consumers, to be heard

on  this  issue.   The  fourth issue is on  efficiency.   The

promotion of power energy efficiency is something many of  us

have  emphasised and the move to market is certainly one that

can  potentially strengthen the link to efficiency.  But this

is  only a possibility.  There is the other possibility  that

competition   and  competitors  may  aim  only  for   greater

consumption and profit.  What safeguards will we have against

this danger?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to make is the question of

consumer choice and rights, because this undergirds  a lot of

the   things   that  we  are  doing  in  liberalisation   and

marketisation.   This Government has been reluctant  to  give

much  more  strength  to  consumer movement  through  a  Fair

Trading  or  other Act.  If we do leave energy generation  to

others  outside of the Government and, potentially,   foreign

companies, I think that this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



idea  of  consumer rights is the necessary  balance  we  must

bring  into  the creation of the market.  The  consumer  must

have a choice, the consumer must have rights.  Only then will

the  markets that we are creating have much chance  of  being

truly efficient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the setting up

of  the  Energy Marketing Authority of Singapore is a prelude

to  the  privatisation  of electricity supply  in  Singapore.

Soon,  electricity supply entities which are hitherto  solely

owned  by  the  Government would be split into three  private

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for water supply, almost all the basic public

services  have  been privatised.  For a Government  which  is

good  at  calculating  profit  and  loss,  the  advantage  of

privatisation is that Government does not have to take on the

responsibility  of  providing basic public  services  to  the

people.   After privatisation, the Government  is  still  the

major shareholder. All the profits earned by these privatised

companies   will  conveniently  flow  into  the  Government's

pocket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale behind the Government's privatisation

effort  is  that these companies will be governed  by  market

forces and, therefore, be cost-effective and efficient. There

will be less wastage and the cost would be lower, so that all

the  services provided would enjoy better economic  benefits.

But the real effect is that, after privatisation, the charges

for  all the services will get higher and higher. In the end,

it is the people who suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the restructuring of the Government hospitals,

health cost escalated, forcing the Government to provide  the

Medifund to assist Singaporeans who cannot afford the medical

charges.     The    result    of   the    privatisation    of

telecommunications  is  that consumers  have  to  pay  higher

charges. The burden of life is getting heavier and heavier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another wonderful effect of privatisation is that once a

Government corporation is privatised, shares are sold to  the

people.   The Government even distributes some of the  shares

to the people to make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



it  as  "shares  for everyone".  If the charges  go  up,  the

Government  could justly and forcefully say, "If the  charges

are not raised, the company will not make profits, how can we

account to the shareholders?"  Prices are raised so that  the

company can make profits. This argument has become acceptable

to the shareholding people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's argument is that privatisation is a

mechanism to introduce competition to the market, to make the

charges  for  services  more  reasonable,  and  even   lower.

However,  from  the past experience of privatisation  of  the

public  services, it is apparent that the competition brought

about by the so-called market mechanism is very limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the privatisation of public transport

service.   The  present situation is two bus  companies  each

sharing  one-half of the pie, with the same  fare  structure.

Take a look at telecommunications.  SingTel is still the main

telephone  service  provider.   Residential  lines  are   all

controlled by SingTel alone.  Newcomers, M1 and Starhub,  can

only  compete  in  mobile  phones  and  international  calls.

Yet, the main cables and telecommunications are still in  the

hands of SingTel. Under this  type of competition, the others

can only be the "also-runs".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privatisation of electricity supply is supposed to

bring in more companies to enter the market competition. Just

how   many   electricity  supply  companies   can   Singapore

accommodate?  Perhaps  it  is the major  shareholders  -  the

Government competing with itself. Then, with corporatisation,

electricity tariffs  are fixed with profit in mind.  I  doubt

very much that the electricity tariffs will be really lowered

in the long run to the benefit of the consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the real purpose of privatisation is to go for

investment  returns, that is, how much profit.  Basic  public

services  such  as  public transport,  residential  telephone

service and electricity supply are all added with the  profit

element. In the end, the consumers will have to pay higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



charges, and the burden of life will surely be heavier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may think that I am asking the Government to

subsidise  public service. No! What I am asking for  is  that

the  Government  does not earn the people's  money  from  the

public  services.   The Government should provide  the  basic

public  service to the people at its operational cost  rather

than  profiteering from the privatisation of public  services

and adding on more burden to the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> There have been many issues raised, and

they  are  very  complex issues. I would like  to  thank  all

Members, but one, who spoke in support of the Bill.  From the

issues  raised,  one basic question was:  is our  market  too

small to really  support competition and how many players can

there  be  to ensure there is real competition?  I think  our

market  is not too small. We are about the same size  as  New

Zealand where privatisation there has been successful. We are

also about the same size as a number of Australian states, so

do not get away with the idea that we are too small for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how many players can there be, and will there

be  a  limit  to  the number of players?  The answer  is  no.

There  could  be  as  many players as  they  could  come  on.

Another  point that has been made is a caution on the  speed.

Speakers  have  expressed concern that we may be  moving  too

fast.  We are taking this step by step.   What we would  like

to  point out, first of all, is that although we do not  want

to  move  too fast and fall on our face,  there is  one  very

important sector of our market which will be opened up  soon,

ie,  the industrial sector which already uses 70-80%  of  the

electricity.    There   is  already  plenty   of   room   for

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the consumers side, which occupies 20-30%, this would take a bit more time, because they will also

need  education  on their choices, and there  are  a  million

accounts out there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been warned of some of the pitfalls of

privatisation, and reference has been made to the DBS-POSBank

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



merger.  With regard to that reference, this has already been

discussed  in  the  House on other occasions.   And  DBS  has

reiterated  its  commitment  to  continue  providing  banking

services that are accessible at affordable prices.   I  think

it  is not a very fair point to make.  It has no intention of

leaving  the  mass  market  and service,  and  it  is  facing

teething problems.  DBS perhaps may have been able to  manage

these  transitional problems better, but we could  not  avoid

the  most  basic  imperative  to rationalise  retail  banking

services and make them economically viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has questioned why do we not let EMA

own  and  manage the electricity and gas distribution  grids.

He  felt  that the EMA should manage the electricity and  gas

infrastructure  as  well.   This  matter  has  been   debated

extensively  when  we  corporatised the electricity  and  gas

functions  in 1995.  There were two options.  One, as  indeed

suggested by Mr Inderjit Singh, and the other being  for  the

grids  to  be privatised.  The experience in other  countries

shows  that  this infrastructure can be privately owned,  but

has  to be tightly regulated.  As private companies, they can

operate more flexibly and efficiently, so that they can be as

efficient  as  the private counterparts and be subject  to  a

certain  amount of commercial and financial discipline.   And

EMA will regulate this infrastructure companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also mentioned the risk of

infrastructure companies who deal with generators,  retailers

and so on.  Indeed, this is why the EMA will be empowered  to

prevent  the  infrastructure companies from participating  in

generation   and  retail,  and  to  prevent  anti-competitive

behaviours.   I  will say more of that when  we  explain  the

Electricity Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure security, I mentioned in my speech that the

EMA   will  take  over  control  of  the  operations  of  the

electricity network from Singapore Power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One refrain that we have heard among several speakers

is:  will competition bring about lower prices?    I think we

have   to  be  careful  not  to  confuse  lower  prices  with

competitive prices.  Nobody can guarantee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



lower  prices.  What competition can bring about is to ensure

a framework where there is competition, where there is enough

competitiveness, so that it will bring about the prices  that

we  would  otherwise  not  be  able  to  obtain  under  other

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that whatever the number of

players,  there could well be a situation, like some  Members

have  referred to, a situation in retail petrol, where it  is

seen that despite the number of players, there appears to  be

some  sort  of  arrangement.  I think we cannot  provide  for

everything  but,  as we have said, the EMA will  have  to  be

vigilant.   As  in  the  case of the  unhappiness  over  what

appears to be collusion among the petrol companies  -    this

is  not  necessarily so, but it appears  to  be  so   -    my

Minister  has  already mentioned in the Committee  of  Supply

debate  that  this is being looked at.  I think  one  of  the

strong  points of Singapore is that we are not rigid, and  we

are  not  governed by ideology.  And where something  appears

not  working, we will step in.  And, of course, privatisation

is  not a panacea for everything.  But where there is a  need

to put matters right, they will be put right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank Mr Simon Tay for pointing out some of the

clauses  that  may require some looking at.   He  raised  the

point  about  who  may  appeal,  and  raised  concerns  of  a

grievance.   There  is  no restriction  there.   But  if,  in

practice, when we find that it is inadequate, then of  course

we  will take a look at it again.  There is no restriction of

who may or may not raise issues, and make appeals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang, of course, has made his usual point

concerning  the  cost of utilities.  He made the  same  point

that   we   must   ensure  that  utilities  do   not   become

unaffordable.  Again, I will give him the same answer that no

amount  of  legislation can guarantee low cost or low  price.

But  what  is important is that competition and privatisation

will bring about the financial and commercial discipline,  so

that  everybody knows what the true cost is.   If  there  are

people   who,  in  fact,  experience  hardship,   then   this

Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



has,  on  many  occasions already, and  in  the  most  recent

occasion, provided the help that is needed.  It is  only  for

those who need this help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are perhaps other points which I may not have

answered  at  this stage, but which perhaps will become  more

apparent as we move on to the Electricity Bill, because  many

of them are a follow through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have explained during the Second Reading of

the  Energy  Market Authority of Singapore Bill, my  Ministry

will  move  for  the  enactment  of  three  industry-specific

legislation before the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



House today.  The first industry-specific legislation is  the

Electricity  Bill.   This Bill designates the  Energy  Market

Authority  of  Singapore  (EMA)  as  the  regulator  of   the

electricity industry.  It empowers the EMA to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) set up a competitive industry structure,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) perform licensing and regulatory functions,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) set and enforce performance standards for and regulate prices charged by licensed monopolies, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) set and enforce safety standards and code of practices for the electricity industry.

<br><br><i>Evolving towards a Competitive Energy Market</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all over the world, electricity markets are being

liberalised  and  made more competitive.  The  experience  in

other electricity markets that had undergone deregulation has

been  positive, yielding higher efficiency, greater  industry

innovation,  wider  choice and better service  to  consumers.

Electricity  markets  have been successfully  deregulated  in

United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and in various

states in the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setback in California was unfortunate. The

Californian  market failed because it had not  been  properly

deregulated.    It   fixed  the  price  consumers   pay   for

electricity.   When  electricity wholesale prices  increased,

its  electricity retailers ended up buying electricity  at  a

price  higher  than what they were allowed  to  recover  from

consumers.  This pushed the retailers towards insolvency  and

generation   companies,  not  sure  of  getting  paid,   were

subsequently reluctant to sell electricity to the Californian

retailers.  In addition, a combination of other factors  such

as a surge in electricity demand because of the economic boom

and  problems in getting new power plants approved created  a

situation  where  generation  capacity  was  outstripped   by

demand.  Thus, the lights went out.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have kept pace with these global developments. We

took  the first step towards a liberalised market in 1995  by

corporatising  the  electricity and gas undertakings  of  the

PUB.  We established an electricity wholesale market in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have benefited from these initial steps. The

wholesale  market  introduced competition in  the  generation

sector  initially between PowerSeraya, PowerSenoko  and  Tuas

Power.   The  liberalised generation market attracted  a  new

generator,  SembCorp Cogen who entered the scene using  piped

natural gas as a fuel source for power.  Natural gas  is  not

only  cleaner, it is also more efficient than fuel oil  which

we  currently use.  With the availability of natural gas, the

liberalised  market  has driven the generation  companies  to

rethink their strategies in order to stay competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our current market structure includes a

dominant  Singapore  Power that is actively  engaged  in  all

aspects of the electricity market.  New energy companies  are

not prepared to come in to compete with Singapore Power which

is dominant in the generation sector and is also the monopoly

grid owner.

<br><br><i>Further Restructuring to Enhance Competition</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore decided to push ahead with further

market   liberalisation  to  derive  the  full  benefits   of

competition.    By  1st  April,  the  generation   companies,

PowerSeraya  and  PowerSenoko,  will  be  divested   out   of

Singapore  Power.   These two companies  together  with  Tuas

Power   and  SembCorp  Cogen  will  then  compete   to   sell

electricity.  A fifth company will be starting up later  this

year   and  two  other  generation  companies  are  currently

planning to set up generation plants in Singapore.  Hence, we

will have more players competing in the generation sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will open more customers to retail competition this

year  starting with the large industrial users.   By  end  of

this  year,  we  expect  to have about  70%  to  80%  of  the

electricity market opened to retail

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



competition.   The  households and small  consumers  will  be

opened  to competitive retailers by 2003.  The EMA  will  run

programmes to inform and help prepare all customers  who  are

being opened to retail competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the market opens later this year, Singapore Power

will  confine  itself to owning, developing, maintaining  and

providing services related to the natural monopolies  in  the

industry, namely, the electricity and gas grids.  The company

would  have  relinquished  all commercial  interests  in  the

competitive parts of the electricity market.  It will then be

attractive  for  new  entrants to enter and  compete  in  the

electricity and gas industries.

<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electricity Bill before the House

is   to  create  a  competitive  market  framework  for   the

electricity  industry.  It will also provide for the  safety,

technical   and   economic  regulation  of  the   generation,

transmission,  supply and use of electricity  and  for  other

matters connected to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the key provisions of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the EMA to administer the Bill and

to exercise its functions and duties.

<br><br><i>Control Mechanism and Protection of Consumers' Interest</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 7, 13 and 14 confer powers of licensing to

the  EMA.   The  EMA  will license generation,  transmission,

retailing  and any other electricity business activities  and

deal  with  all matters relating to licensing (eg, procedures

for  the application for an electricity licence, an extension

or  an  exemption and matters to be considered in determining

whether  to grant or to extend an electricity licence).   The

EMA   will,   through  licensing,  achieve   the   commercial

separation  of  the natural monopolies from  the  competitive

parts  of the industry and hence pave the way for competition

to set in.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an electricity licensee contravenes any condition of

licence,  any provision of the relevant legislation,  or  any

directions  issued  by  the EMA,  the  EMA  can  require  the

licensee to provide a performance bond and impose a financial

penalty  not  exceeding  10% of the annual  turnover  of  the

licensee's  licensed business, or an amount not exceeding  $1

million, whichever is higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA may also revoke or suspend the licence if the

licensee fails to rectify any contravention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the industry has clear guidelines to work

with,  clauses 16 and 46 empower the EMA to issue or  approve

codes of practice and other standards of performance for  the

regulation  of  activities  and conduct  in  the  electricity

industry.  They also allow the EMA to make the initial  rules

in  consultation with industry for establishing and governing

the  electricity  market.  The Bill sets out  the  governance

process  for subsequent changes to the market rules  and  for

the  rules  to  be published in such manner  as  will  ensure

adequate publicity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA is empowered under clause 41 to, with the

approval  of  the  Minister,  deem  categories  of  consumers

contestable.   This will enable the EMA to open consumers  to

contestability in phases between this year and the year 2003.

<br><br><i>Special Power to Manage Licensees</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 30 provide for situations in which public

interests   are  put  at  risk.   Under  specific  conditions

relating to insolvency of licensees, security and reliability

of supply or a public emergency, the Minister is empowered to

make  a  special  administration  order  directing  that  the

affairs, business and property of an electricity licensee  be

managed directly or indirectly by the EMA.  The interests  of

shareholders  and  creditors  of  the  licensee  have  to  be

protected in the execution of such an order.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Anti-competition Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill empowers EMA to prohibit anti-competitive

practices including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions.

To  ensure we have a competitive market, it will be necessary

for all companies in the electricity market to trade in a way

that  is  not anti-competitive as this will otherwise distort

the  market  to  the detriment of consumers.  This  principle

must  apply regardless of when anti-competitive practices  if

any,  were put in place.  The anti-competition provisions  in

Part  VII (clauses 50 to 63) of the Bill will therefore  have

retrospective effect.  Where the EMA finds that a person  has

acted  in  an  anti-competitive  manner,  the  EMA  can  give

direction  on  the  cessation of such conduct  and  impose  a

financial  penalty on the person.  The person, if  aggrieved,

can appeal to an Appeal Panel.

<br><br><i>Appeal Process</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two kinds of appeals provided for in the Bill.

For  grievances relating to market regulation, the  aggrieved

party  may  have  their  appeals heard  by  an  Appeal  Panel

appointed  by  the Minister.  These will include  matters  on

modification  of  licence conditions and application  of  the

anti-competition provisions as stipulated under clause 12 and

Part  VII  of  the Bill.  The decision of the Panel  will  be

final.   Clauses  64  to  66 provide for  the  establishment,

composition and powers of the Appeal Panel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other types of grievances, eg, refusal to grant a

licence  and  matters relating to technical  regulation,  the

aggrieved party may appeal to the Minister whose decision  is

final.  These are set out in clauses 15 and 98.

<br><br><i>Electrical  Installations,  Cable  Detection  and  Electrical Workers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant provisions for the licensing of electrical

workers   under   the  Electrical  Workers  and   Contractors

Licensing Act are subsumed, with modifications, under Part IX

(clauses 67 to 82) of the Bill.  With

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



the  modifications,  the licensing of electrical  contractors

will  be discontinued and regulation of electrical works will

be  done  through the licensing of electrical  workers.   The

Electrical  Workers  and Contractors Licensing  Act  will  be

repealed.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electricity Bill sets out a broad

framework  that supports a competitive electricity  industry.

Under  the  new regime, market forces are expected  to  exert

pressure  on  market  participants to offer  greater  choice,

better  product innovation and service quality at competitive

prices.   The  new regime will be friendly to  and  will  not

unduly  impede  the introduction of new technology,  such  as

micro-power or distributed generation nearer to the point  of

use.   It  also allows market participants to play a  greater

role in formulating market rules and codes of practice.  This

would enable EMA to regulate the industry with a light-handed

approach,  while  ensuring  that energy  solutions  would  be

market-driven  without compromising security and  reliability

of the electricity system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I rise to support the

Electricity Bill and wish to confine my comments  briefly  to

the  scope  of  competition to be afforded  by  the  proposed

framework.   Firstly,  few  generation  companies.   As  some

colleagues   have   already  raised,   the   scenario   post-liberalisation  will  have  a  relatively  small  number   of

generation companies or Gencos.  Moreover, the Government has

stated  an intention to divest the three big Gencos,  namely,

PowerSeraya, PowerSenoko and Tuas Power, which will  generate

the  bulk of our needs.  No foreign ownership limit  will  be

imposed.   In this context, how would the Minister  introduce

meaningful competition?  How will the Minister ensure that  a

cartel-like behaviour, say, in setting full prices, will  not

develop  to  the  detriment  of  suppliers  and,  ultimately,

consumers?  As is the allegation against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



oil   companies  supplying  petrol  to  consumers  which  was

referred  to earlier on, does this structure lend  itself  to

such anti-competition tendency?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the role of Power Supply. As I understand,

Sir,  the role of the incumbent Power Supply will be  limited

to  the  provision  of billing and other  customer  services.

Sir,  while  this is meant to bring economies  of  scale  for

consumers  as  a whole, it can also be an impediment  to  the

bundling  of  services by potential retailers.  For  example,

telcos who do a fair bit of household-related billing may not

find  enough incentives to compete initially as they have  to

deal  through Power Supply.  Therefore, I would like  to  ask

the Minister whether there is an intention for the role to be

played  by  Power  Supply to be a permanent  feature  of  the

electricity market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to

commend the Ministry for drafting such a comprehensive  Bill.

I  went through the whole Bill and must say that many of  the

issues have been well covered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that really needs to happen is that we create

true  competition for those areas which are contestable, that

is, the power generation and the electricity retail parts  of

the  whole  value chain.  I raised my concerns earlier  about

the  transmission  and distribution of electricity  which  is

left to Singapore Power to manage.  One issue which I have is

the  speed of changes in the initial phase.  And if I got  it

right,   Singapore  Power  will  still  be  responsible   for

distribution   as  well  as  certain  parts  of   retail   of

electricity.   This  I  feel will put other  retailers  at  a

disadvantage  and may just slow down the opening  up  of  the

electricity industry.  The prudent thing to do is right  from

the  beginning to spin off the two entities into two separate

companies  with different management control.   Mr  Low  Thia

Khiang  earlier  on brought up the issue of SingTel  managing

the  fixed  lines  and  therefore  they  have  the  perpetual

advantage  over  other fixed line telephone  operators.   And

this  may  result,  again,  in the  electricity  distribution

sector if we are not careful in separating the roles.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue I fear is also that the Ministry will end up

giving licences only to Government-linked companies and  thus

not achieve the objective of true liberalisation.  So the new

Genco  that  came  into  the picture  is  SembCorp  which  is

actually  a GLC too.  I would like to ask the Acting Minister

whether there are any true private companies which have shown

interest  to enter our energy market.  How many players  does

the  Ministry expect in the short and long term and how  many

can our market really support?  The number of players will no

doubt  determine the cost of electricity as we move  forward.

Another   fear  I  have  on  the  expectations   of   cheaper

electricity  as  a result of liberalisation  is  whether  the

various  generators and retailers of electricity  can  really

differentiate to the point that they can really offer cheaper

electricity to consumers.  If they are not able to do so  and

resort  to price wars to win customers, will they be able  to

sustain  themselves  in the long run by earning  thin  or  no

margins  at all?  One thing we must realise is that Singapore

is  a  market  which is too small for many of us to  actually

attract even foreign interest in our energy market.  We  must

be  prepared  that  our companies must be able  and  must  be

allowed  to supply electricity to other countries as well  as

to  import electricity from other countries into Singapore to

provide everyone with a bigger market to compete in.  In this

respect, what is the Ministry's view of allowing retailers to

bring  electricity from our neighbouring countries, including

the  fact  that some day, some of these may be  generated  by

nuclear means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on a few specific issues on

the  Bill.   In  Part  II, clause 3(3)(d)  of  the  Bill,  it

mentions that prices of licensees have to be controlled.   To

do  so,  the  authority will end up limiting the margins  the

licensees will be able to achieve.  Because we will be  going

to  have  multiple sources of electricity, not all  of  which

will  be fully controlled by the Government, we will have  to

ensure  that  there  is an overbooking  situation  where  the

Government  will require a higher supply than the  demand  at

any one time,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



just   in   case  some  of  the  licensees  fail  to  deliver

electricity  reliability.   This overbooking  situation  will

result  in  higher cost for the licensees and, hence,  higher

prices  to  the  consumers.  How does the  Ministry  hope  to

ensure there is a good balance of demand and supply?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5(2) of the Bill allows the authority to disclose

information of suppliers of electricity to third  parties  if

the  authority  feels that the information  would  not  cause

detriment to the supplier.  I feel that this clause should be

amended  to also get the consent of the suppliers before  the

authority  releases  any  information,  unless  there  is   a

national  security issue involved.  This should be  the  case

because  the authority would never be in a position to  fully

determine  the impact of such information disclosure  on  the

business of the supplier, especially if the information  goes

to competition.  This is an important issue if we really want

to attract private sector companies to come into this field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(7) mentions the fees payable by the licensees.

Can the Minister share with the House the quantum or range of

fees  we expect to impose?  I also feel that there is no need

to  license the transmission part, as I mentioned earlier, as

this is not going to be subjected to competition anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 24 allows the market support licensee to

disconnect  the  supply of electricity,  including  those  of

domestic  users.  I would like to suggest that  we  add  some

safeguards  in  the  Bill  against  possible  abuse  by  some

licensees who may become too quick to disconnect supplies for

whatever reasons.  And this may cause inconveniences  to  our

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on the issue of

reliability of electricity supply.  I did bring this issue up

during  the  Committee of Supply and many Members brought  up

the  issue of the Californian example.  Specifically, we must

put   in   place   sufficient  measures  to  hold   licensees

responsible  and  accountable when there  are  situations  of

recurrent power dips and power failures.  I hope this move to

liberalise the energy markets

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



will  not  result  in the drop of the quality and reliability

of electricity supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I feel that the liberalisation of

electricity   is  a  significant  milestone  in   Singapore's

development  and  it will change the way  we  do  things  and

change  the  mindsets about how utilities  are  supplied.   I

personally  think that this is a move in the right direction,

especially  if we can ensure true market competition.   I  am

excited  about  this move and look forward to the  successful

implementation of the very aggressive plans that the Ministry

has laid out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, allow me to thank the two Members,

Mr  Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, for their support of

the Bill.  There are again a number of issues raised and some

of  them  have  to do with the continuing role  of  Singapore

Power  for  the  distribution  as  well  as  the  retail   of

electricity  in  the  initial  phase.   Opening   retail   to

competition is a complicated process and it would take  time.

This  has  to  be  done in phases as the  system  has  to  be

prepared.  For example, meters that are able to register  the

consumption  every  half  hourly  will  first  have   to   be

installed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 100 large customers are already contestable and,

later  this year, we will open up in phases up to 70% or  80%

of  the electricity market to retail competition.  This  will

number  about  10,000  customers who  are  mainly  the  large

industrial and commercial customers.  Power Grid will  indeed

not   be  retailing  to  these  contestable  customers.   The

remaining customers, mainly households, will be opened up  by

2003,  after  which,  Power Grid will  completely  exit  from

retailing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarks have also been made whether or not there are

truly  private companies involved, and are they involved  and

also  interested  in entering our energy market.   There  are

already  two non-GLC private companies issued with generation

licences, viz, ExxonMobil and Island Power Company.   In  the

retail sector, Tractabel was granted a retail licence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common refrain on this subject in this House has been

how  would electricity consumers benefit from the electricity

industry's restructuring, and how would the liberalisation of

the market lead to cheaper electricity.  We must say that the

benefits   would  be  the  benefits  brought  about   through

competition   -   choice  of  supply,  competitive   pricing,

including,  most  importantly, innovative pricing.   We  have

received  feedback  from  several MNCs,  such  as  Shell  and

Sumitomo, that peak and off-peak tariffs have a wider  spread

in  liberalised markets overseas than there are  here.   This

allows  users,  especially large users, to  plan  their  work

schedules  to benefit from the reduced off-peak  prices.   We

expect competition to create this type of benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim also wanted to know how would consumers enjoy

different  service packages and products.  This is really  up

to  the ingenuity of the retailers.  Experience, again,  from

other  countries, shows that electricity can be bundled  with

other  products,  such as appliances.  Retailers  could  also

offer  electricity  packages  that  are  customised  to   the

customers'  needs  at  different  levels  of  pricing.   This

includes  lower  off-peak  rates, power  management  schemes,

bundling   of   electricity   with   other   services    like

telecommunications,   and  shielding   its   customers   from

fluctuations  in  electricity prices with  financial  hedging

instruments.    The  competitive  market  will   drive   such

innovations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions and concerns have also been asked and

expressed  whether  there  would be  enough  players  in  the

market,  and how are we to ensure that there is no  collusion

as  our  market  may be too small.  I have already  explained

that  our market is not too small.  Are we prepared to import

and  export  electricity?   Our generation  capacity  is  6.6

gigawatts  today.  Demand is growing by 4%-6% per annum.   In

10 years, our system will reach 10 gigawatts.  This is not  a

small  system.   New  Zealand and the State  of  Victoria  in

Australia  liberalised  when  their  capacity  was  about   7

gigawatts each.  Our market is thus of a sufficient  size  to

allow  for  competition and attract more players,  local  and

foreign.  For this to occur, EMA will have to ensure a level

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



playing field and prevent anti-competitive behaviour, such as

collusion,  which  the  Member  has  mentioned.   Like  other

markets  that have liberalised, we will allow electricity  to

be  imported or exported, so long as the system's security is

not compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been asked how the licence fees are

determined.   The licence fees will be set to enable  EMA  to

recover its costs of administering this industry legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also concern expressed about quality. Will

the  restructuring exacerbate the problem of power dips,  and

should  Singapore Power not be made liable  for  causing  the

dips?   Mr Inderjit Singh again expressed concern about  this

problem, as he has done so in the Committee of Supply on  8th

March.  We had explained the slew of measures that have  been

taken  to  reduce  power dips.  As for  liability,  it  is  a

commercial  matter between Singapore Power and  the  affected

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern about how prices would be fixed

and what the formula is.  The current tariffs comprise a fuel

component and a non-fuel component.  At the moment, we  allow

Singapore  Power  to  set the non-fuel  tariff  component  at

levels  which  allow  them to earn a 7%-8%  return  on  total

assets.  A price cap is applied to subsequent adjustments  to

this non-fuel tariff component.  The price cap depends on the

rate  of  inflation  and productivity improvements,  ie,  the

consumer price index  minus a factor of "X".  In other words,

the  non-fuel  tariff component cannot be increased  by  more

than   the  inflation  rate  minus  an  imposed  productivity

improvement  factor which Singapore Power has to deliver  and

pass  through  to  consumers.  As to the fuel  component,  of

course  we buy our fuel from global markets, with no  control

over  fuel  prices.   The pricing formula, therefore,  allows

changes  in fuel prices to pass through but, as we  mentioned

several  times, in order to alleviate hardship for those  who

may not be able to afford, the Government has already given a

number of assistance schemes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also refers to clause 5(2) of the Bill

and suggests that consent of suppliers be obtained before any

information is released.  The Bill does allow EMA to disclose

information of suppliers of electricity to third parties,  if

EMA  feels that the information would not cause detriment  to

the  suppliers.  In fact, this will require EMA to check with

the suppliers before divulging the information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>GAS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>4.25 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Gas Bill is the second industry-specific

legislation,  which I propose to move before the  House  this

afternoon.   As  I  mentioned  earlier,  natural   gas   will

increasingly  become an important source of  fuel  for  power

generation.   Currently, a small amount  of  natural  gas  is

imported from Malaysia for power generation only.  In January

this year, SembGas took delivery of natural gas from the West

Natuna  gas  fields in the South China Sea  under  a  22-year

agreement  with  Pertamina, for the purchase  of  up  to  325

million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of natural  gas.

Last month, Singapore Power signed a gas sales agreement with

Pertamina, to import up to 350 mmscfd of natural gas over  20

years  from  the Asamera gas fields in Sumatra.  The  Asamera

gas is scheduled for delivery in 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While natural gas can be used for different purposes,

its  main use will be for power generation.  The natural  gas

industry  has  to  be  structured such that  no  company  can

commercially advantage or disadvantage other competing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



companies.  If  this  happens,  it  will  be  detrimental  to

competition in the electricity industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas importing is a competitive business. Natural gas

can  only  be  transported  from importers  to  end-consumers

through  on-shore gas pipelines.  The company that owns  this

transport  network connecting the gas importers to  the  end-customers   is   a   monopoly,  and  can  potentially   wield

considerable advantage over competitors, if it has  competing

interests  elsewhere.  To avoid this, we  are  setting  up  a

market  structure where the monopoly transporter of gas  does

not engage in the competitive sectors of the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Power will remain in the monopoly business of

transporting  gas  within Singapore.  To  do  this  it  will,

through  PowerGas,  own, maintain and  develop  the  on-shore

pipelines that form the gas grid.  Singapore Power will  exit

from  importing  and retailing of natural gas  to  industrial

customers and power plants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a pipe network which supplies town gas to

domestic and industry consumers.  Town gas, which is supplied

by  PowerGas,  will not be competitive, compared  to  natural

gas.  PowerGas plans to convert the town gas network over the

next  five years to convey natural gas, so that domestic  and

small  consumers will also benefit from it.  Other  consumers

not  using  piped  gas will still have the  option  of  using

commercially  available LPG.  After converting the  town  gas

network  to  natural  gas,  PowerGas  will  also  exit   from

retailing gas to domestic and small customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently a natural gas pipe network in Jurong,

which  was developed and owned by SembGas.  As SembGas is  an

importer and retailer of natural gas, it would have  to  exit

from  the  business of transporting natural gas and  transfer

its pipeline assets to PowerGas.  When these various measures

are  implemented, there will then be competition  in  natural

gas import and retailing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Diversifying Sources of Gas Supply</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have three sources of fuel for power generation.

The  primary  fuels  will be oil and natural  gas.   All  the

generation plants using natural gas are required to  be  able

to  be operated with diesel.  Diesel will serve as a back  up

fuel in case of disruption to the gas supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, we plan to further diversify our sources

of  fuel.   Land has been set aside in Tuas for  a  Liquefied

Natural  Gas  (LNG) terminal to allow import of  LNG  by  LNG

tankers  to Singapore.  With this terminal, we would be  able

to  tap  natural  gas supplies from further sources  such  as

Australia and the Middle East.  A joint study by PUB, MTI and

EDB is currently underway.

<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now deal with the main

provisions  of  the  Gas  Bill.  The  Bill  is  to  create  a

competitive  market  framework for  the  gas  industry,  make

provisions  for the safety, technical and economic regulation

of the transportation and retail of gas and for other matters

connected therewith.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Electricity Bill, the Gas Bill designates the

Energy  Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) as the  regulator

of the gas industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions and duties of the EMA under the Bill

includes protecting the interests of the consumers, promoting

competition in the supply of natural gas, regulating  prices,

as well as establishing and monitoring technical, performance

and safety standards.

<br><br><i>Control Mechanism and Protection of Consumers' Interests</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 to 19 of the Gas Bill allow the EMA to issue

licences   and  administer  the  controls  related   to   the

licensing.   The conveying of gas through a gas pipeline  and

the retailing of gas will be licensed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who carries out any work on any gas

installation or gas appliance will also need to  be  licensed

as a gas service worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a gas licensee contravenes any conditions of its

licence, any provisions of the relevant legislation,  or  any

directions issued by the EMA, the EMA is empowered to require

the  licensee  to provide a performance bond;  and  impose  a

financial penalty not exceeding 10% of the annual turnover of

the  licensee's licensed business, or an amount not exceeding

$1 million, whichever is higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA may also revoke or suspend the licence if the

licensee  fails to comply with its direction to  rectify  any

contravention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 62 to 68 empower the regulator to issue or

approve  codes of practice and performance standards for  the

regulation  of  activities  and  conduct  in  the  piped  gas

industry.   They  also  deal  with  safety  requirements   in

relation to gas.

<br><br><i>Duties of Gas Licensees</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill lays out the duties of licensees. Licensees

are  required to carry out their licensed business in such  a

manner  so  as  not  to  prevent,  restrict  or  hinder   the

development of competition in any gas market in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Special Power</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the Electricity Bill, the Gas Bill also provides

for  situations in which public interests are  put  at  risk.

Clauses  33  to  35 empower the Minister to  make  a  special

administration order, upon application by the EMA,  directing

that  the  affairs, business and property of  an  electricity

licensee be managed directly or indirectly by the EMA.

<br><br><i>Anti-competition Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Electricity Bill, the Gas Bill has similar

provisions to control anti-competitive behaviour.  These  are

listed in Part IX of the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Appeal Process</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for appeals. Appeals relating to

market  regulation will be heard by an Appeal Panel appointed

by  the Minister.  These will include matters on modification

of licence conditions and application of the anti-competition

provisions as stipulated under clause 17 and Part IX  of  the

Bill.  The decision of the Panel shall be final.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other types of appeals, eg, refusal to grant a licence

and  matters relating to technical regulation, will go to the

Minister whose decision is final.

<br><br><i>Transitional Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural gas pipelines in Jurong which are owned by

SembGas will have to be transferred to PowerGas on commercial

terms.     If  the  parties  cannot  achieve  a  satisfactory

commercial  settlement, clause 98 of the  Bill  empowers  the

Minister  to  intervene and ensure that  the  transfer  takes

place.   This provision will not be invoked unless absolutely

necessary.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Gas Bill is to give effect to the restructured

piped  gas  industry.  With this, we hope that big and  small

consumers  will benefit from higher efficiency,  more  choice

and  better  service of piped gas supply.  As the  regulator,

the EMA will be responsible to safeguard the interests of the

consumers and ensure a level playing field for the players in

the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have two specific issues to

raise.   The first issue is whether there is a real  need  to

separate  the  generating  and  retailing  portions  of   the

industry.  From the way I look at, all we need is one type of

licence for both generation and supply of gas, making use  of

a transport system managed by an independent authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is one of continuity of supply. My

fear is that we may have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



situation  of  over-reliance on one or two  sources  of  gas,

especially the gas we are purchasing from Indonesia,  as  the

Minister mentioned earlier.  Are we doing enough to diversify

our risk?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these two issues, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh has raised the concern

and  question  of  separating generation  and  retail.   Both

generation  and retail can indeed be performed  by  the  same

company,  as Mr Inderjit Singh has quite rightly  said.   But

there is nothing to stop a company from doing both.  And  the

fact  is that there will be companies that will choose to  do

generation  without retailing or vice-versa.  The transporter

is  the  owner  of  the  gas pipelines  and  can  potentially

influence  the  competition  in  the  generation  and  retail

sectors.  Hence, the transporter would not be allowed to take

part in the generation or retail.  The transporter has to  be

licensed, as it is a monopoly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern expressed by Mr Inderjit Singh

concerning  the  security of supply.  Sir, I  would  like  to

thank  Mr Inderjit Singh for speaking in support of the  Bill

and  also raising this concern.  The key is to diversify  our

sources.   Not all electricity will be generated  by  natural

gas.   Oil will continue to be a significant source for power

generation.    In  any case, our natural gas  agreements  are

commercial   agreements  and  international   companies   and

organisations  like the World Bank are involved.   They  will

help  to  ensure  that  they  are  able  to  discharge  their

contractual  obligations.    In  the  longer  term,  we  will

eventually  go to LNG as I have said.  Land has already  been

set  aside in Tuas for the LNG terminal.  There is  a  global

market  for  LNG  and this will allow us to tap  natural  gas

supply  from global sources much further afield,  as  I  have

mentioned, Australia and the Middle East.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<div align="center"><b>DISTRICT COOLING BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the District Cooling Bill is another industry-specific legislation that will be administered by the Energy

Market  Authority of Singapore (EMA).  The main objective  of

the  Bill  is to designate the EMA as the regulator  for  the

provision of a pilot district cooling service in an  area  at

the New Downtown at Marina South.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A district cooling system supplies chilled water through

a  network  of  pipes for the air-conditioning  of  buildings

located within the service area.  The conventional method  is

to have individual buildings put up their own stand-alone air-conditioning  plants.  A centralised district cooling  system

has  two major benefits.  First, it takes up less land space,

an important consideration in land-scarce Singapore.  Second,

it significantly reduces water and energy consumption through

economies of scale.  There is also an aesthetic advantage, as

the  roof-tops  of  individual buildings can  now  be  better

designed, besides being put to better use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Cooling Systems have been successfully

implemented in certain parts of Yokohama and Osaka of  Japan.

Based  on  such  experience, the advice is  that  a  District

Cooling System should serve a total gross floor area of about

1.25  million square metres for optimal efficiency.  URA  has

therefore  parceled  out a section of  the  New  Downtown  at

Marina South for a pilot District Cooling System to be  tried

out.   The projected saving in gross floor area in the  pilot

area is about 7,000 square metres.  The remainder of the  New

Downtown can be parceled out into four zones of similar  size

for  future  District Cooling Systems, if  the  pilot  proves

successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the high capital and operating cost, the district

cooling  system will be viable only if all buildings  in  the

service area subscribe to it.  As some building

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



owners  may be unfamiliar with this new centralised  service,

they may choose to stick to the conventional air-conditioning

plant.   This would increase the operating cost of a district

cooling  system.   To reap the full benefits  of  economy  of

scale  of  such  a  system, it is necessary  to  require  all

building  owners in this zone to subscribe to  it.   We  have

made the use of this service mandatory by specifying this  in

the  Government  land sale condition for the designated  land

parcels  in  Marina  South.  In Japan, the  use  of  District

Cooling System in designated areas is also mandated.

Since  we  have  made the use of the district cooling  system

mandatory for this pilot phase in Marina South, we  must  use

Government regulation to safeguard the interests of  building

owners and users.  The users of this cooling system must  not

be  subject  to high charges or poor service by the  monopoly

operator.   EMA  will regulate this service  provided  by  an

operator.   The  operator will be price regulated  to  ensure

that  the cost of cooling using this centralised system would

be  lower than that using conventional methods.  This  is  to

ensure  a passing-through to consumers of some of the savings

from  using  a centralised cooling system.  Price  regulation

will  also  encourage  it  to  improve  its  efficiency   and

productivity.

<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now touch on the main provisions of the

Bill.  Clauses 3 and 4 spell out the functions and duties  of

EMA as the regulator of the district cooling industry.  These

include, inter alia, the:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) granting of licences, monitoring licensees'

performance  and enforcing compliance with licences  and  the

relevant provisions provided in the Bill;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) regulating prices of the operator within its

service area; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) establishing, monitoring and enforcing technical and

performance standards and codes of practice.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Mandatory Use of District Cooling Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for the Minister to declare, by

notification  in  the Government Gazette, an  area  to  be  a

service  area  wherein district cooling services  are  to  be

provided  and  consumers have to subscribe  to  the  service.

Clauses   8  and  9  outline  the  Minister's  authority   in

connection with making changes to the service areas.

<br><br><i>Control Mechanism and Protection of Consumers' Interest</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 13 stipulate that any person who provides

district cooling in the designated area must be authorised by

a  licence  granted by the EMA.  The provisions also  provide

for the circumstances where the EMA may suspend or cancel the

licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the regulator is satisfied that a district cooling

licensee  has  contravened any condition of its licence,  any

provision  of the Bill or any direction issued, the regulator

is empowered to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) require a licensee to provide a performance bond;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) impose a financial penalty not exceeding 10% of the

annual turnover derived from the district cooling services of

the licensee in Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) require the licensee to replace its management with

appointees approved by the Regulator; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) cancel the licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 14 to 16, the district cooling licensee is

required to comply with the codes of practice and performance

standards issued or approved by the regulator.  The regulator

may  also give direction to its licensee to observe the  code

of practice and keep to the performance standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 specifies the general duties of a licensee,

which are to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) maintain a reliable, efficient and economical

district cooling system;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) ensure public safety with respect to the provision

of district cooling services;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) ensure that it will not do or not omit to do any

act which will adversely affect the reliability and stability

of the services provided to consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 ensures that the prices to be charged by a

licensee and which are to be paid by its customers must be in

accordance  with  the conditions of its licence.   Therefore,

prices  will  be regulated and can be reviewed  by  the  EMA.

This clause also disallows the licensee, in fixing prices for

its  service,  to  give undue preference to  or  discriminate

amongst its customers.

<br><br><i>Special Power</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions under clauses 21 to 23 empower the

Minister   to  make  a  special  administration  order   upon

application  by the regulator.  The order would  direct  that

the affairs, business and property of the licensee be managed

by  any  person  appointed by the Minister  if  the  Minister

considers  it  necessary  in the  interest  of  security  and

reliability of the provision of district cooling services, or

in the public interest, among other circumstances.

<br><br><i>Appeal Process</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 42 outlines the appeal process. Any person

aggrieved by any decision of the regulator in the exercise of

its  powers  under the Bill may appeal to the Minister  whose

decision is final.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will provide safeguards to protect the

interests of consumers in the pilot district cooling  project

in  Marina  South. The mandatory requirement is necessary  to

get  the  pilot project off the ground.  As the  benefits  of

district  cooling become better known to Singapore consumers,

we  hope  to lift such mandatory requirement.  The experience

in Marina South will also help us decide if there is any need

at  all  in future to extend such a mandatory requirement  to

other  new developments in Singapore in order to promote  the

greater use of district cooling systems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the District Cooling

Bill is introduced to enable the Minister to declare that  it

is  mandatory  for the occupiers of premises in a  designated

area  to use district cooling.  The idea of district cooling,

as  I  understand  it, is that cooling or  the  provision  of

airconditioning in an area is provided by a central facility.

District  cooling works on the assumption that a  centralised

facility will be more efficient, enjoy lower cost due to  the

higher  economies  of scale and sharing of  common  services.

Sir, I support this Bill in view of this potential benefit of

district cooling.  However, I do  have some concerns which  I

would like the Acting Minister to clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept has been talked about for several

years,  but this is new and untested in Singapore.   My  main

concern is that the structure is too rigid.  To make it work,

the  system  has  to be made mandatory so  that  everyone  is

forced  to use it.  This means that the operator of  district

cooling  services  is  a monopoly in a designated  area.   So

there  are the evils of monitoring and regulating a monopoly.

As  it  is,  being the sole proprietor of a cooling facility,

any  failure  of  the  system means that  there  will  be  no

alternative.   We  may say that it is not a life  threatening

event if no airconditioning is provided.  When the system  is

down,  people  just get hot, or hot under the collar,  so  to

speak.  However, I want to point out that in a modern office,

airconditioning is very important to keep the computers cool,

not the human beings as such.  If the computers are down, the

companies may lose very valuable electronic data.  The damage

may be very severe, or even irreparable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed idea is to do a pilot test of the

concept  in  the new phase one of Marina South  area.   I  am

concerned  that the compulsory district cooling system  there

may  affect  the  tender prices, as it  is  perceived  as  an

additional cost, rigidity of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



the  system  or  concerns  about  how  the  system  would  be

perceived by prospective buyers or tenants of the premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prospective tenants may be deterred to move into an

office  area  if  they  have to incur  higher  fitting  cost.

Compared to the current situation, the tenants and owners  of

the  premises have a varied number of choices,  in  terms  of

whether to use central airconditioning, split unit, room unit

or even window unit.  In district cooling, the occupiers have

only  one  choice.   It is like in transportation.   You  can

choose  to  go  by  MRT, to take a bus,  taxi,  car  or  even

bicycle.   But  in the case of central district  cooling,  we

cannot  do anything else but take the MRT, and MRT in itself,

as  a  single system, although it is faster, is actually more

rigid and restricted in its coverage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure how the central district cooling

system  would  be constructed, but I would imagine  that  the

system   requires  an  extensive  infrastructure  of  piping,

feeding out from a central cooling plant.  If an end user  is

located  far  away, there will be loss of cooling efficiency,

loss of energy efficiency and maybe even higher pumping cost.

Hence,  I  am  not  yet persuaded that the  district  cooling

system can be more efficient and will be able to enjoy  lower

energy and other operating costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a central facility needs more physical space, and

maybe more costs for the extensive piping and infrastructure.

Visually,  I  think  it can also create aesthetic  and  noise

problems.   Ultimately, it may not lead to lower  prices  for

the consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last point is to ask the Acting Minister why the

need to enact a law to specially deal with this concept.  Why

not  just  simply deal with it as a section  within  the  new

Energy Market Authority law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I end by saying that I support this

Bill in its intent, since it will bring the novel concept  of

district  cooling  for the benefit of the  occupiers  in  the

building.   But may the Acting Minister address my  concerns,

Sir?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, let me thank Mr Leong Horn Kee for

supporting  the  Bill  in the first place.   Let  me  try  to

address some of his concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if we look at the successful application of the

district cooling system in some other countries, we might get

some   assurance.    District   cooling   system   has   been

successfully implemented in several countries like  the  USA,

France  and  Japan.   Some of the notable  areas  are   Reedy

Creek,  Florida,  Paris, France, etc. As regards  alternative

and  fail safe systems, the EMA can specify various standards

as part of the licensing conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong has also raised some concerns on whether or not

a  mandatory  imposition  of district  cooling  system  would

discourage potential investors in tendering for the land sale

in  Marina  South.   This is quite unlikely.   In  fact,  the

tender  for  the first land sale in Marina South  was  closed

only  three  days ago.  This site will eventually  house  the

district  cooling system plant, which the successful tenderer

has to provide space for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA received two offers for the land parcel. And as the

district  cooling  system is a new concept in  Singapore,  it

will   be  quite  natural  in  the  beginning  for  potential

tenderers  to  ask a lot of questions and inquire  about  the

details.   But  the feedback is that most of  the  developers

were  receptive  to  the idea of district  cooling  services.

And, in fact, some of the building owners in the existing CBD

area,  who plan to overhaul their stand-alone airconditioning

systems,  have also inquired whether they could tap from  the

pilot district cooling system plant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of noise and aesthetics, there are

solutions to overcome them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked why do we need an Act to effect all

these, and why can this not be controlled under the EMA.  The

Energy  Market  Authority  of Singapore  Bill  serves  as  an

umbrella  Act that empowers the EMA to administrate  industry

specific  legislation, one of which is the  District  Cooling

Bill.   The  Bill is structured in this way because different

industries have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



different   requirements,  and  therefore  require  different

legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.  -  [Mr Peter Chen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF RENT (ABOLITION) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to abolish rent control in

Singapore.   Rent  control operates in two ways.   First,  it

restricts  a landlord's right to raise the rent.  Second,  it

restricts the landlord's right to take back possession of the

rent-controlled property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of rent control goes back to 1947, just

after  the Second World War.  At that time, much of the basic

infrastructure  like  roads  and  utilities   were   severely

damaged.   Housing was in short supply.  The  population  had

risen  sharply, especially with a massive influx of refugees.

Against this backdrop, rent control was introduced to prevent

landlords  from  exploiting the situation and  raising  rents

drastically.

<br><br><i>Why rent control is no longer needed</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation today is totally different. The

Government  has  successfully implemented its public  housing

programme  to  provide affordable housing  for  Singaporeans.

Almost   nine  in  10  Singaporeans  now  own  their   homes.

Subsidised  rental flats are available for  those  who  still

cannot  afford home ownership.  No family need go  without  a

roof  over  its  head.  After 54 years,  rental  control  has

outlived  its  purpose to protect families from  unscrupulous

landlords.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, rent control is a disincentive for

landlords  to  redevelop or restore  their  properties.   The

Controlled  Premises (Special Provisions) Act was  introduced

in  1970  to allow landlords to recover their rent-controlled

properties  for  redevelopment.  However,  as  landlords  are

required  to pay compensation to the tenants, some  landlords

have  not  moved to recover their rent-controlled properties.

As a result, some rent-controlled properties, including those

designated  for  conservation, remain  in  a  poor  state  of

maintenance.  The complete lifting of rent control will  give

landlords  additional incentive to recover  their  properties

and to spruce them up.

<br><br><i>Paving the way to rent decontrol</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1997, the Government announced its intention to

abolish  rent control in four years' time, that  is,  on  1st

April  this  year.  This long period of notice  was  to  give

sufficient  time for tenants to find alternative premises  or

to  reach  agreement with their landlords to  stay  on  after

lifting of rent control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early announcement in 1997 aimed to strike a balance

between  the  interests of the tenants and  their  landlords.

Tenants were assured that they could continue to pay low rent

and  stay in the rent-controlled properties for another  four

years  while  landlords  were  given  indication  that  their

properties  would cease to be rent controlled  by  1st  April

2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 decision to abolish rent control was not a

sudden decision.  In 1988, the Government used the Controlled

Premises  (Special Provisions) Act, which was  introduced  to

facilitate the redevelopment of the Golden Shoe area  in  the

1970s,  to  accelerate the phasing out of rent control.   The

Controlled  Premises  (Special  Provisions)  Act   was   made

applicable  to  all  rent-controlled  properties  over   four

phases, between October 1988 and December 1991.  This allowed

landlords  to  recover  possession of  their  rent-controlled

properties for purposes of development subject to payment of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



compensation  to  their  tenants.   As  a  result  of   these

measures,  the  number of rent-controlled properties  dropped

from about 7,600 in 1989 to about 1,600 in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenants have been informed of the impending abolition of

rent  control.   The Urban Redevelopment Authority  has  been

sending reminders about the abolition of rent control to  the

tenants  every year since April 1997.  From April 2000,  that

is,  last  year,  URA has been sending these reminders  every

three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government's announcement in 1997, the number

of   rent-controlled   premises  has  shrunk   further   from

approximately 1,600 to about 700 as at January this year.

<br><br><i>Residential tenants</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are approximately 750 residential tenants (and

their  families)  still  living in rent-controlled  premises.

These  tenants can apply for public housing under the various

public  housing schemes.  There are also two special  housing

schemes for people affected by rent decontrol.  Under the Old

Single Person Tenants' Scheme, the landlord can apply to  HDB

to  resettle  two  or more single elderly tenants  in  a  HDB

rental  flat.   The  landlord will have to  pay  four  years'

rental to HDB on behalf of his tenants.  The second scheme is

the  Rent  Decontrol Housing Assistance Scheme  which  grants

priority  allocation  of  HDB rental  or  purchase  flats  to

families or joint singles of more than 35 years old  who  are

affected by rent decontrol.  These two schemes help to ensure

that  affected  residential tenants  will  not  suffer  undue

hardship.

<br><br><i>Non-residential tenants</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 420 non-residential tenants will be affected by

rent  decontrol.  Of these, some 68% (284) operate businesses

such  as  coffee shops and eating places, medical  halls  and

retail  and wholesale shops selling a range of goods such  as

jewellery,   stationery,  textiles,   garments,   shoes   and

electrical  goods.   Another 10% (41) deal  with  trades  and

crafts such as laundry,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



hairdressing, photo studios, pawnshops and furniture  making.

The  remaining 22% (95) comprise a mix of uses such as  bars,

lodging  houses, stores as well as bicycle, motor and battery

workshops.  These shops and commercial tenants will  have  to

negotiate with their landlords to remain after 1st  April  or

look for alternative premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of rent control was to ensure a

roof  over people's heads during the post-war days of housing

shortage.   It  was not meant to provide cheap  premises  for

commercial or other non-residential uses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through the main provisions of the Bill

and give details on the related transitional matters.

<br><br><i>Control of Rent Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Control of Rent Act will be repealed. This

effectively abolishes rent control in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the repeal of the Control of Rent Act, there will

no  longer  be any statutory restrictions on the  landowner's

right  to  adjust  rent  or to recover  possession  of  their

properties through the proper legal process.  The  repeal  of

the   Control  of  Rent  Act  will  also  dissolve  the  Rent

Conciliation Board, established under that Act to  deal  with

applications  by  landlords  to  adjust  the  rent  of  rent-controlled  properties.  This is provided for in clause  2(1)

of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the major transitional issues

related  to the repeal of the Control of Rent Act, which  are

set out in the First Schedule of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the repeal of the Control of Rent Act allows

landlords  to  adjust  the rent or to recover  possession  of

their   properties   through  the   normal   legal   process.

Therefore,  with  effect  from 1st April  2001,  any  pending

application  with  the  Rental  Conciliation  Board  will  be

discontinued.  Similarly, any proceeding before the courts in

relation  to  the  Control of Rent Act will be  discontinued.

These  are  provided  in paragraphs  3  to  5  of  the  First

Schedule.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the status of a statutory tenant after the

abolition of rent control is clarified in paragraph 6 of  the

First Schedule.  A former statutory tenant will, on 1st April

2001,  continue  to hold the premises on the same  terms  and

conditions as before the repeal of the Control of  Rent  Act.

However, either the landlord or the tenant can terminate this

tenancy  by  giving  the same notice as required  by  law  to

terminate a monthly tenancy.

<br><br><i>Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill deal with the Controlled

Premises (Special Provisions) Act.  This Act provides a  form

of  rent  decontrol whereby a landowner is allowed to recover

his rent-controlled property for purposes of redevelopment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A landowner who wants to recover his property for

redevelopment  may  apply to the Tenants' Compensation  Board

(TCB)  to recover his rent-controlled property.  The TCB  has

the   power  to  award  compensation  to  the  tenant.   This

compensation is determined based on the provisions of the Act

and  is  paid by the landowner.  With the abolition  of  rent

control,  a  landlord no longer needs a TCB order to  recover

his property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act will, however, not be repealed immediately so as

to  allow the TCB to settle its outstanding matters.  The TCB

will therefore continue to deal with pending applications for

which the Order for recovery of rent-controlled property  has

been  made  prior  to 1st April 2001 and  to  administer  the

payment of compensation money to tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act will,

however,  be amended as of 1st April 2001.  This is  provided

in  clause  3 of the Bill.  From that day, the TCB  will  not

accept any new application for recovery of possession of rent-controlled property, and any pending application for which an

Order  for recovery of possession has not been made  will  be

discontinued.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are set out in paragraph 1(c) of the

Second  Schedule  of  the Bill.  A landowner  who  wishes  to

recover possession of his property will thus have to use  the

normal legal process from 1st April 2001 onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act

currently  imposes restrictions on landowners on the  use  of

properties  recovered under the Act.  Firstly, a landlord  is

not  allowed to use the property for any other purpose except

for  redevelopment; he is not allowed to sell  or  lease  the

property  until  redevelopment has  commenced.   Secondly,  a

landlord  must commence redevelopment of the property  within

six  months  after  repossessing it  and  must  complete  the

redevelopment within 10 years.   The Act will be  amended  to

lift  these  restrictions.  The amendments  are  provided  in

paragraph 1(a) and paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule of  the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lifting of these restrictions will put such rent-controlled properties on the same footing as any other rent-controlled property that is de-controlled by the repeal of

the  Control of Rent Act.  This is in line with the  idea  of

the  total  abolition of rent control and  ensures  that  all

formerly   rent-controlled  properties  are   given   similar

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the repeal of the

Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act.  The repeal  of

the  Act and the consequent dissolution of the TCB will  take

effect  after  the  TCB has settled all outstanding  matters.

Therefore,  clause 4 of the Bill will come into effect  at  a

later  date  to  be determined by the Minister  for  National

Development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the TCB is finally dissolved, there may still be

compensation  moneys  deposited by landowners  with  the  TCB

which  have  not  been  claimed by  the  tenants.   The  Bill

provides  that  any  unclaimed compensation  moneys  will  be

transferred  to the Urban Redevelopment Authority.   Thus,  a

claimant  may continue to claim compensation money after  the

TCB is dissolved.  The URA will administer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



the  compensation moneys for a period of 12 months.  This  is

provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Third Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 12-month period, any unclaimed compensation

moneys  will  be transferred to the Consolidated  Fund.   Any

claims  for  compensation moneys may  be  made  to  a  public

officer  or  a  statutory authority to be designated  by  the

Minister.  If the claim is established, the compensation will

be  paid to the claimant from the Consolidated Fund.  This is

provided in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Third Schedule.

<br><br><i>Premiums on Leases Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also seeks to repeal the Premiums on

Leases Act.  In recent years, the only effect of this Act has

been  to  deter landlords of rent-controlled properties  from

seeking higher rents than those prescribed by the Control  of

Rent  Act.  With the appeal of the Control of Rent  Act,  the

Premiums on Leases Act will no longer be required.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, this Bill will abolish rent control in

Singapore and make provisions to wind down the affairs of the

Rent Conciliation Board and the Tenants' Compensation Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abolition of the Control of Rent Act is a step

towards  an open market economy.  The Act, which was  enacted

in  the  early  1950s, has outlived its usefulness.   It  was

meant  to  prevent unscrupulous landlords of  premises  built

before    7th    September   1947   from   increasing    rent

indiscriminately.  While it had served its purpose,  the  Act

is  no  longer  applicable  in  today's  market  environment.

Tenants  now are more educated, and they know how to  protect

their rights against unscrupulous landlords.  The success  of

the HDB public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



housing has also eliminated the need to protect tenants  from

being levied market rental for these premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some tenants in these rent controlled premises

have  abused  the  Act.   I learn that  some  tenants  profit

immensely  through the subletting of the  whole  or  part  of

these  premises at market rent while paying low rental  under

the  Act.   In cases where the premises are of commercial  or

industrial  uses,  the profits made are  substantial.   These

practices  are  unfair  to  landlords  who  have  lost   much

opportunity to recoup their investment returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above situation has also hindered our urban renewal

progress.  With such low rentals, landlords have no incentive

to  maintain  or  upgrade  their premises,  thus  leading  to

disrepair. These derelict premises mar our city landscape and

result in under-utilisation of our limited land.  In order to

inject  life into our city areas, the Government must  remove

legislation which hinder urban renewal.  The abolition of the

Act  will  provide much impetus for landlords  to  rejuvenate

their premises thus adding more buzz to our city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the plight of tenants affected by the

abolition of the Act.  But we have no choice as market forces

determine  our efforts to prepare Singapore for a  knowledge-based  economy.  We must continue to improve our  living  and

business  environment to make Singapore a  world-class  city.

At  the same time, we will spare no effort to make sure  that

all Singaporeans are taken care of during this transition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend the efforts put in by the

Ministry in helping tenants affected by the abolition of  the

Act.   The Ministry has announced in April 1997 (three  years

ago)  that the Control of Rent Act will be repealed  as  from

1st April 2001.  This has given tenants adequate time to make

the necessary preparations and adjustments.  In addition, URA

and  HDB have implemented two housing schemes, especially for

low  income  and single aged tenants, who may face difficulty

finding alternate accommodation.  They are the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



Housing  Assistance Scheme for families affected by rent  de-control  and the scheme for relocating tenants and  occupiers

who are single aged persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these measures clearly show that the Government has

taken  a  very  compassionate approach to help  the  affected

tenants  although it is a private matter.  Likewise,  I  hope

that  the landlords will also help low income tenants to make

this transition in their lives more smoothly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, a number of media reports have

focused  on  the  effects  of the intention  to  remove  rent

control  on  some  tenants, especially those  with  vanishing

trades.  Conservation of buildings and of traditional  trades

is  a  concern.  A recent survey has shown that while we have

been relatively successful at saving the buildings, there are

gaps in trying to make sure that traditional trades continue.

Like many Singaporeans, we were disturbed.  But when we think

about  it  more carefully, there are reasons to see that  the

Control  of Rent Act has been a bit of an anomaly  for  which

perhaps  the  time  has  passed.   Because  even  if  we  are

concerned about the conservation of buildings and traditional

trades,  we must be fair.  We must recognise that  there  are

also  rights  of the owners and that we must actually  create

incentives for the owners to value the properties, to perhaps

restore  the  properties and we can only do so if  they  know

that they will get some fair return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, though I am for conservation, I am not for

the  freezing of time, like a magic wand, where the  sleeping

beauty  is supposed to keep sleeping for 100 years.   Rather,

this  kind  of  approach  of freezing things,  making  people

sleep, will tend to lead to distortion of markets, and  I  do

share  Dr  Teo Ho Pin's point on the problem about subletting

and  profiteering by some tenants.  In a sense,  Sir,  I  was

assured  to hear that there will be special schemes for  some

of the tenants who are affected, the elderly tenants who have

little  choice.  More than that, more generally, I would  say

that  the  phasing-in over a long transition period  of  four

years shows that while Government sees that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



something needs to be done, they have sent a signal to  those

tenants  to  please do something to accommodate the  changing

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For businesses, I believe we cannot save them by special

privilege, by freezing them in time.  We can at best  prevent

sudden  changes, unexpected upheavals.  But in  the  end,  we

should  foster  them  to change over time  to  meet  changing

times.  This, of course, is not easy for businesses.  That is

why  there is such a thing called the free market.   Some  of

these  traditional businesses will go out of  business.   But

when  you  look around us, sometimes there are stories  which

heartened us, for example, the Killiney Road Kopi Tiam.   The

fact  that they have continued, the fact that they  have  got

branches,  shows  them competing in a sense with  the  coffee

clubs  of today.  And those were the things those of  us  who

are  conservationists, but yet who want  to  see  a  bubbling

vibrant modern Singapore, have to think about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir, that continues to have some

difficulty for me.  It only occurred to me when the  Minister

was  reading  the  Bill.  This is part of the  Schedule  that

provides  for  the discontinuance of proceedings  before  the

courts and tribunals.  These courts and tribunals are already

seized of the matter.  They are hearing the issues.  We  seem

to  be actually pre-empting their decision.  In comparison to

that, if I am correct, the Minister has said that the Tenants

Compensation Board will have a right to continue to look over

the  issues already before them.  Could I understand from the

Minister  why  is  the difference and whether  we  should  be

discontinuing these proceedings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill because conservation is not

about  freezing areas or people in time but encouraging  them

to move forward at a pace acceptable to all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I welcome this

Control  of  Rent  (Abolition) Bill.  It is timely  now  that

Singapore has, more or less, solved the problem of housing in

Singapore.  But the Control of Rent Act, at the time when  it

was enacted,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



was a good law.  It was a socialist piece of legislation.  It

protected  the  poor tenants from the landlords  because,  at

that particular point of time, there was an acute shortage of

housing,  and if there were no such law to protect them,  the

rents  would have shot sky-high and they would all have  been

forced out and to live in the streets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got only two issues. One is whether or not

that  will cause hardship to certain people in Singapore.   I

know that the Minister had already said that the Ministry  is

having some kind of a scheme to help people who have to  move

out  from their rent controlled premises.  They will have  to

move out once this abolition of the Act comes into effect  on

1st  April.   I  have  no doubt that the  landlords  of  rent

controlled premises will increase their rents.  They will not

only increase their rents, but increase them higher than what

they should be, because they feel that they are justified  to

do  so  to  recoup their losses for so many  years  when  the

rentals  were  lost in a certain way in that they  could  not

increase their rentals as early as 1953.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, I am sure, are familiar with the rentals

that  the  landlords  are getting for their  rent  controlled

premises.  Some tenants are only paying something like $40 or

$50 for a two-storey terrace house because for so many years,

the landlords have been collecting such low rentals.  Most of

these houses are quite run down, until of course they receive

a  notice  from  the HDB to spruce up their buildings.   Even

when  they have to spend money repainting and repairing their

premises, they will lose much money because they have to take

money  out of their own pocket to pay first, which the meagre

rents they have received all those years cannot make up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am thinking of the plight of single persons who

are  not within the scope of help which the Ministry is going

to  give.  In fact, last night, in my meet-the-people session

I  saw  for  the first time such hardship cases.  A  man,  on

behalf of his friend who is a 80-year old widow, came to  see

me.  The landlord must have known

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



of  the  abolition of the Control of Rent Act and has already

got a lawyer to send this old lady a notice to quit within  a

week  from 1st April if she cannot pay the new rental,  which

will  be  increased from $280, which she is presently paying,

to  $1,800.  So you can see landlords of controlled  premises

are  quick to take advantage of the abolition of the old law.

The  increase  is  slightly over seven times.   The  premises

where  the old lady lives is in my constituency which  is  an

old building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there must have been other similar cases throughout

the  island.  The Minister mentioned about 1,000-odd of these

premises.   I know HDB is doing everything they can  to  help

these tenants.  But I hope, somehow or rather, HDB rules  can

be amended to help accommodate single people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to bring up has been mentioned by

Mr   Simon  Tay.   This  concerns  the  preservation  of  old

buildings.  Sir, once the Bill comes into effect, I  am  sure

landlords will immediately get rid of their tenants and  sell

the  buildings to the developers who will probably pull  them

down.  Or the owners themselves will pull the buildings  down

and   redevelop  the  land.   If  these  old  buildings   are

demolished, Singapore will be a different place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget session, we have been debating on

what  it is to be a Singaporean.  If all these buildings were

knocked  down, many of us older Singaporeans would have  lost

something.  The old buildings are very familiar to the  older

generation and that is how they feel that they have a home in

Singapore.  If the familiar buildings are gone and, in  their

places, strange looking buildings are put up, Singapore would

be  a  strange  place to them.  It is no different  from  any

other city in the world.  So Singapore becomes another place.

It  is no longer the home in which they are so familiar with.

I  would  earnestly  urge the Government  to  take  steps  to

prevent   the   wholesale  demolition  of  the  old   pre-war

buildings.  Greed is a great motivating factor, and  we  know

what  developers  and house owners of old buildings  will  do

when the next rise in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



property  prices  comes  along, unless  of  course  they  are

curbed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the

Members who have risen to speak.  I believe all of them  have

supported the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Teo rightly pointed out, rent control has outlived

its  usefulness.   It  was enacted at  a  time  when  it  was

absolutely  necessary.  As Mr Chiam pointed out, I  think  it

was  a  very noble piece of legislation, and it has  actually

enabled  a  lot of the people who came to Singapore  at  that

time,  just  after the war, to be able to have a decent  roof

over  their  heads.  But, over 50 years have  passed,  and  I

think we all agree now that there is really no necessity  for

such an Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question really is whether we allow sufficient

time,  for  those  tenants who have  been  affected  by  rent

decontrol,  to  adjust.  I believe the Government  has  given

more  than  sufficient time for the tenants  to  adjust.   In

trying  to be fair to the tenants, we also have to take  into

account the interests of the landlord, but I believe that  we

have  given  sufficient time for both parties to come  to  an

amicable settlement.  In fact, it is not just four years  ago

that  notice  was given. The intention of the  Government  to

abolish rent control was signalled as far back as 1988,  when

the Control of Premises Act was used to start the first phase

of  rent  decontrol.  Since then, in 1997,  four  years  ago,

actual  notice  was given, annual notices were  sent  to  the

occupiers  in  all the four official languages.   Last  year,

every  three  months, the same notice was  sent  out.   So  I

believe adequate attention has been paid, and adequate notice

has been given, to everybody concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, of course, there have been several

additional  steps being taken to make sure that  tenants  who

are  affected  adversely by rent decontrol would  not  suffer

unduly.   These are the several schemes that I have mentioned

just now to help the tenants.  One was the Old Single Persons

Scheme,   and  the  other  is  the  Rent  Decontrol   Housing

Assistance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



Scheme.   So  steps  have been taken to make  sure  that  the

effects of rent decontrol are mitigated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an anomaly, as Mr Simon Tay has said, and he has

also rightly pointed out that we should not just look at  the

interests  of  the tenants, but we should also  look  at  the

rights  of  the  owners.  In this respect, we have  tried  to

balance both as much as we can.  And the rights of the owners

are  necessary  -  not  only  the right  to  recognise  their

property  rights, but also to incentivise them, to give  them

an incentive to refurbish and to renovate their premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, perhaps I should reassure Mr Chiam that

it does not mean that all premises that are rent decontrolled

will  necessarily be demolished, redeveloped or knocked down.

Some of those premises are gazetted for conservation and,  if

they  are  so gazetted, they will not be allowed to  be  torn

down.   The questions of conservation and rent decontrol  are

two   separate  matters.   So  where  they  are   worthy   of

conservation,  separate steps would be taken to  incentivise,

as well as to prevent, in some cases, developers from tearing

them down.  That much he can be assured of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for traditional businesses or so-called vanishing

trades,  again it is a question of how we can make sure  that

these vanishing trades do not vanish.  If there is a need for

such trades, they will not vanish.  In fact, he has mentioned

several of them, eg, the Killiney Road Kopi Tiam.  And  there

are  some other traditional trades which are doing very  well

in Chinatown, eg, medicine shops, herb dealers, the very well-known  kaya toast shop which has now moved to Far East Square

and,  I am sure, there are many other examples.  So the moral

of  the story is, if it serves a purpose, if there is demand,

if  there is somebody willing to carry on the trade and it is

worthwhile  for them to carry on the trade, that  trade  will

not  vanish.   It is as simple as that.  It is  not  easy  to

subsidise them to make sure that they carry on.  And,  as  Mr

Simon Tay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



rightly  points out, we cannot freeze everything in time.   I

know  some countries and some cities do that.  They have  got

certain  areas  set aside where they carry  on  some  of  the

trades  of old, eg, shoeing horses, making nails and  so  on.

But  those  are for the tourists.  They are not real  trades.

They are actually there for the sake of, maybe, preserving  a

little bit of the past for the enjoyment of tourists.   So  I

think we are talking about different things.  But, certainly,

for those trades which can survive, I think they will survive

even after rent decontrol, because there is a demand for such

trades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also made a specific point about the

discontinuance  of proceedings.  I think he is  referring  to

the Control of Premises (Special Provisions) Act which we are

amending.  Under this amendment, what we are doing is to  say

that TCB will not accept any new applications for recovery of

possession.   All  those applications that  are  pending  and

which  Order  for  Recovery of Possession has  not  yet  been

issued,  those will be discontinued.  But anything  that  has

already  been  settled, that is of course  with  the  Tenants

Compensation  Board.  If the monies have  not  been  claimed,

those monies will be set aside and, therefore, they will  not

be  touched.  I believe that is what he is referring to.   Is

that correct, Mr Simon Tay?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just clarify

briefly?   That is correct, Sir.  But, on the other hand,  if

you  look at the First Schedule, the savings and transitional

provisions on the repeal of the Control of Rent Act,  clauses

3 and 4 provide for the discontinuance of proceedings for the

Rent  Conciliation  Board,  and for  the  discontinuation  of

certain proceedings for the High Court.  Sir, perhaps  I  can

raise this issue separately with the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> A final issue I would like to address

is Mr Chiam's point whether there will be hardship to certain

people caused by the Act.  I think, yes, some people will  be

adversely  affected  by  this.  He cited  the  example  of  a

constituent of his, a widow who is 80 years.  If that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



person  is not eligible for assistance under the two  schemes

that  I  have  mentioned earlier, there are  the  normal  HDB

schemes where she can get assistance and, if not, if he would

like to put up a case, we will consider that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>5.38 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) required to replace

ourselves is 2.1.  But the last time we achieved this was  in

1976.   When major measures encouraging couples to have  more

children  were introduced in 1987, the TFR rose  to  1.96  in

1988.   But our TFR has been on a downward trend since  then.

The  preliminary TFR for last year did rise from 1.48 in 1999

to  1.59,  but  this is still low, despite the year  being  a

Dragon year and our coming out of the recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no laughing matter. Singapore is already one of

the  fastest  ageing societies in the world.  If  we  do  not

arrest  this alarming trend, it will have severe implications

on  our survival as a nation.  The family, as the first  line

of support, would come under severe pressure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August last year, the Prime Minister announced that

the  Government would implement the Children Development  Co-Savings  Scheme, or more popularly known as "Baby Bonus"  for

short,  as  well  as  the Third Child  Paid  Maternity  Leave

benefit  from 1st April this year.  Sir, this is one  of  the

measures  which we hope can help arrest the trend I mentioned

earlier.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Baby Bonus" is a two-tiered scheme. In the first

tier,  the  Government would provide $500 per  year  for  the

second  child,  and $1,000 per year for the third  child,  as

direct  cash  grants  for  those born  from  1st  April  2001

onwards.   Parents can use these grants to help meet  any  of

the  child's  needs,  including informal  care  arrangements,

food, clothing, developmental needs and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tier is an annual co-payment scheme. The

Government  would  match  parents'  contribution  dollar-for-dollar up to $1,000 per year for the second child, and up  to

$2,000  per  year for the third.  Contributions from  parents

and  Government  would  be  placed in  the  child's  Children

Development  Account, similar to a Trust-Minor  account  that

can  be opened for a child in any bank.  Parents can only use

these funds for their children's childcare, kindergarten  and

nursery  fees.  However, the funds can be used to  meet  such

needs for any of the children that the couple may have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both tiers of the grant would be given for six years,

and  we  hope  these  measures  would  address  some  of  the

financial  constraints that many people say  they  face  when

they  decide  whether to have a second or third  child.   The

"Baby   Bonus"   is  to  help  parents  meet  the   financial

commitments  they  have  towards their children's  pre-school

education  and  other child development programmes.    But  I

must  emphasise, Sir, that the "Baby Bonus" is not  meant  to

defray the entire financial cost of child-rearing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third child paid maternity leave for both employed

and self-employed mothers would allow working mothers to take

up  to  8 weeks of paid leave to be with their newborn  third

child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that the Government recognises

that family formation is a personal decision and life choice.

The  measures proposed in the Bill are for those who want  to

have  children,  but anticipate financial or other  practical

obstacles that would deter them from doing so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, hence, provides for the introduction of

a Children Development Co-Savings Scheme to assist parents in

the  development  of their children. Clause  3  of  the  Bill

provides for regulations to be made for the establishment and

administration of the "Baby Bonus".  This would enable us  to

fine-tune  the Scheme and the required legislative  framework

as we progress, since the Scheme has no precedence here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for the substitution of the trustee of

the  Children Development Account should the trustee need  to

be  changed.  This could occur if the trustee dies, is unable

to  act because of unsoundness of mind, or loses the custody,

care  or  control  of the child, say, in  a  divorce,  or  in

instances of child abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 would protect the money paid into the Children

Development  Account by the Government, or the parents,  from

being  considered "matrimonial assets" for  division  to  the

parents if they divorce, or being claimed by creditors should

one of the parents be declared a bankrupt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a moral duty to ensure that the "Baby

Bonus" is spent appropriately.  We would, therefore, restrict

usage of the funds in the Children Development Account to the

approved  centres  as provided for in clause  7.   The  funds

might  be  used  at  centres that opt to participate  in  the

Scheme.   For  a  start,  childcare centres  licensed  by  my

Ministry,  kindergartens and nurseries  registered  with  the

Ministry  of Education, and pre-school programmes at  schools

for   children  with  special  needs  would  be  invited   to

participate in this Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the interests of the child, and the monies in

his  or  her Account, clause 18 would make it an offence  for

any person or organisation from touting itself as an approved

centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any funds left in the Account when the child reaches

school-going age would be transferred to the child's  Edusave

account.   Clause  22  would  facilitate  this  transfer   by

providing for a consequential amendment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



to section 7 of the Education Endowment Scheme Act, to enable

any  monies  to  be  transferred from  the  child's  Children

Development Account to the Edusave Pupils Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 9 would provide paid maternity leave benefit

of  up  to eight weeks for women who have their third  child,

similar to that provided for the first and second child under

the Employment Act.   But unlike the paid maternity leave for

the  first two children under that Act, the cost of the  paid

maternity leave benefit for the third child would be borne by

the Government, so as not to increase the cost of business to

employers.  Furthermore, it would be extended to all  working

mothers,   beyond  those  covered  in  the  Employment   Act,

including  executives  and  the self-employed.   The  maximum

amount that could be claimed would be $20,000, including  CPF

contributions, and would be pro-rated if the woman takes less

than  eight  weeks  of leave.  Only married  women  would  be

eligible  for this benefit, so as to be consistent  with  our

values   to  promote  births  within  intact  families.    In

addition,  the  child should be a Singaporean  by  birth,  as

ultimately,  we are interested in boosting our citizen  birth

rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This benefit would apply to women who will be on

maternity  leave for their third child on or after 1st  April

2001.  Hence, if a woman has been granted maternity leave  of

eight weeks prior to 1st April 2001, she would be compensated

for  those days that have not been completely consumed by 1st

April 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like for the paid maternity leave for the first and

second  child,  employers would pay their employees  eligible

for  the  third child paid maternity leave. They  would  then

seek reimbursement from the Government, as provided for under

clause  10,  subject to a cap of $20,000.  This would  ensure

that  there is no break in salaries to women who make use  of

this benefit, and it would also involve employers as integral

partners in this family-friendly measure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the "Baby Bonus" is estimated to cost about $225

million  in  the  steady  state, and  the  third  child  paid

maternity  leave benefit, about $13.5 million annually.   The

figures  could  go up if there are more higher order  births.

Adequate  provisions as in clauses 8 and 11 are provided  for

to ensure that these funds would not be abused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 would make it an offence for any person to

make  any  false  or misleading statement or  to  produce  or

furnish any false or misleading document for the purposes  of

this  Bill.  The penalty for such an offence would be a  fine

not  exceeding  $20,000,  or imprisonment  not  exceeding  12

months, or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clause 17 would make it an offence for an

employer not to pay his employee if she is eligible  for  the

third  child  paid  maternity  leave  benefit.   Such  errant

employers   would  face  a  fine  not  exceeding  $1,000   or

imprisonment  not  exceeding six months or  both,  consistent

with  the penalty provided for in the Employment Act  for  an

employer who fails to pay his employee her maternity benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid litigation for every alleged offence, clause 14

would  provide  for resolution of disputes, while  clause  19

would  provide  for composition of offences  for  a  sum  not

exceeding  $500 for employers who fail to pay their employees

the  third child maternity leave benefit, and $5,000 for  all

other offences under the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taken by themselves, we do not realistically expect

them  to restore the TFR to the replacement level, but  taken

together   with  the  other  measures  announced  thus   far,

sustained  public  education  on  the  importance  of  family

formation,  and impending recommendations of the  Ministerial

and Working Committees on Marriage and Procreation, they have

a  reasonable chance of raising our birth rate.   My Ministry

will  continue  to look into ways of removing  the  obstacles

couples face in having children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, we already have had

eight  days of long debate.  I would be concise and you would

be  very  relieved if all other speakers after  me  would  be

concise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Good idea.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I support the Bill as it provides

further  opportunities for the development of  our  children.

The  provisions  in  the Bill are very generous  and  we  are

committing  substantial public funds to support  children  in

their  development, and this is an investment  in  our  human

resources.  It is expected that more than $250 million  would

be  spent  in  this area and in future, we expect  that  more

funds  would  be  released  if we are  going  to  re-generate

ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I see it, the better-off families will take

advantage of the provisions.  I hope steps will be taken  for

some  funding top-ups for the less better-off families.  This

will  help the less well-off children to benefit as  much  as

possible.   Would the Minister look into this  issue  in  the

process  of implementing this Bill?  It would also be  useful

if  we  monitor  the  profiles  of  families  that  would  be

participating in the Scheme so that the Ministry will be able

to take corrective actions and other related interventions to

enable all children to benefit from this Bill itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is intended to strengthen the family and be pro-family. But from the start, on page 1 of the Bill, it is

conceptualised  to  encourage  married  women  to  have  more

children.  Is this a mistake or an oversight by the  Ministry

itself?   It  is, I believe, more politically correct  if  it

should  be to encourage married couples.  I think that  would

be  more appropriate because it takes married couples to have

children in order to regenerate.  This is an important  issue

and  it  is  essential that we provide the right  perspective

right from the start.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without married couples, the Bill would not achieve its

objectives.   Decisions  on  family  size  are  usually   the

decisions  of  couples, not of one partner to  the  marriage.

All  the time, we emphasise on marriage as a partnership.  We

also accept,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



as  one  of our core values, the family as a basic unit.   It

is,  therefore, desirable that the wording, at the  beginning

of this Bill, should reinforce this value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 13, the Minister will have powers to

exclude  certain classes of persons.  We hope that  in  using

these  powers, the Minister would exercise caution to  ensure

that  exclusions  do not create further divisiveness  amongst

families,  but  we will find various means to promote  social

cohesion.  This is very important, as children have been  our

resource, and we should not discriminate in the longer  term.

It  is  essentially necessary to help us to  make  a  society

which is supportive and more cohesive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to identify some major

social implications of the Bill on families and children, and

the steps to be taken to deal with them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I stand to speak

in support of the Children Development Co-Savings Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) currently stands

at a dismal 1.59, as mentioned by the Minister earlier, which

is  very much below the replacement rate of 2.1.  In view  of

the  fact  that our country is small, and we have  a  smaller

base  in  population  to start with, this  figure  is  indeed

worrisome.  It is, therefore, timely and welcomed that  Prime

Minister Goh, in August last year, announced the "baby bonus"

and  third child maternity leave, as well as the set up of  a

Ministerial Committee to study our declining birth rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government handouts and support have helped ease the

burden  of raising children in some of the northern  European

countries.  Denmark has a total fertility rate of 1.7,  which

is  relatively higher compared to, say, Italy, with a TFR  of

1.2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the level of childcare facilities and parental

benefits  seem  to  make  a  significant  difference.    Most

countries  on the southern rim of Europe, such as  Italy  and

Spain, have some of the lowest TFRs on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



the continent.  The governments there provide much less child-related  allowances than the Nordic countries that have  some

of  the  highest fertility rates in Europe, despite the  fact

that  the proportion of women in their labour force  is  also

among  the  highest.   In the northern  countries,  childcare

services are widely available and are subsidised by up to 85%

in  some cases.  Financial support is provided in the form of

birth  and child allowances, up to the time the child reaches

adulthood  in  certain cases.  I am confident that  Singapore

can  achieve results, just as good, if not better,  with  the

right incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the "baby bonus" incentives are applicable to

babies born from 1st April this year.  May I ask the Minister

for  Community  Development and Sports whether  his  Ministry

will  be  flexible in those cases where births are  premature

when  the expected dates of delivery should have been  on  or

after  1st April this year?  It must be recognised that there

are  medical, as well as unpreventable conditions  that  give

rise  to delivery of babies earlier than the expected  dates.

Such premature deliveries are due to unforeseen circumstances

through  no fault of the expectant mothers.  Sir, although  I

agree  that there is a need for a cut-off date, I  feel  that

exceptions must be allowed for medically certified  premature

births.   I  hope  MCDS  will  consider  my  stand  in   this

favourably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families can use the moneys from the "baby bonus" to pay

for  the  development and education of their children.   Sir,

development of children is indeed important, as not  only  do

we  want  more  children, we must ensure  we  get  the  best-developed  children.  For this, we need  to  start  promoting

good  parenting skills.  Educators and service providers have

emphasised on the need for parents to learn parenting  skills

early  to  prevent  problems further downstream.   They  have

observed  that  parents  of troubled  youths  typically  lack

parenting  skills  and have other problems such  as  strained

marital  relations.   In  light  of  this,  I  propose   that

equipping  parents  with  good  parenting  skills  should  be

facilitated and encouraged and we should allow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



some  of the "baby bonus" moneys to be used for this purpose.

Since clause 3 of the said Bill enables the Minister to  make

regulations,   and   clause  3(2)(h)  in  particular,   gives

discretion  to  the Minister to determine  the  purposes  for

which  the  money may be used, I would urge the  Minister  to

consider my proposal.  MCDS can always give guidelines as  to

the  kind  and the number of courses for parents  that  would

yield maximum results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said before that studies have shown that

very  young children fare better with family-based childcare.

MCDS  should,  therefore,  encourage family-based  childcare,

especially  for infants.  The ideal care-givers  for  infants

are,  of  course,  the parents themselves.  However,  in  the

context  of  Singapore, immediate family members,  relatives,

neighbours  and  even friends can be reasonably  good  parent

substitutes.   We may like to encourage or even  entice  such

suitable  housewives  and retirees to "work"  as  home  care-givers  by allowing them some income whilst staying at  home.

Thus, we should allow use of moneys from "baby bonus" to  pay

for  childcare  with  registered  and  approved  "home  care-givers", instead of conventional nursery or childcare centres

only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reimbursement of third child maternity leave paid to

employees,  I  hope  MCDS  ensures  that  the  procedure  for

claiming  the benefit is made as convenient as possible.   It

should  be  a  hassle free experience, and  there  should  be

minimal  tedious form filling.  MCDS has spelt out the  claim

procedure  for this third child maternity leave, and  one  of

the  criteria is that claims must be submitted within a month

after  the end of the maternity leave.  Late claims will  not

be  accepted by MCDS.  On this aspect, I feel that  the  one-month  claim period is too short.  Perhaps the Minister would

consider  having  it  extended to two or  three  months,  and

giving more flexibility for later claims with valid reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 11 gives the employer and the Government

rights  against  an employee where payment  is  made  to  the

employee owing to a mistake of fact

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



or on reliance of false and misleading statement furnished by

the  employee.  However, the Bill does not confer any  rights

on  the  employee in the event the employer fails to pay  the

employee.  This should be redressed in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Community Development and Sports

will  consider my aforesaid suggestions favourably.   Sir,  I

support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the

Minister  has referred to the alarming trend in our fertility

rate.   And  if  the  grand objective  of  this  Bill  is  to

encourage  women  in  Singapore to have more  children,  then

should the Bill not cover all women and all births?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first component in the "Baby Bonus" scheme is a

direct  cash  payment which applies to all women who  deliver

the  second and third child born on or after 1st April  2001.

Sir,  why discriminate against first birth, baby number  four

and after?  For low-income families, some extra cash during a

first   baby's  birth  is  always  helpful.   If  this  first

experience  is unpleasant and burdensome, then young  couples

will  not  warm  up to the idea of a second  conception.   In

short,  I am suggesting that we give something for the  first

child  in  order to promote a positive psychology  towards  a

second.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For larger families, the issue of affordability is a

concern.  But who is to decide on affordability?  Is that the

only  determining criterion for having children?  What  about

the  desire  for children factor?  If the family enjoys  four

varieties of dishes for a meal, and there are many others who

enjoy  just  two dishes, maybe some families only  one  dish,

because  they want to save the money so as to have  a  fourth

child,  why  do we then not encourage them?  It is important,

Sir,  that  we  signal to all mothers, whether homemakers  or

working,  that their maternity role and having  children  are

worthy  of  State support.  No groups will feel discriminated

or  left out.  Instead of having one cash amount for all, the

State could consider designing an earnings related scheme, so

that there is not too much of a drain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



on  national resources.  And for wealthy families who do  not

need this money, maybe they could re-donate the money to  the

Community Chest, for needy causes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the "Baby Bonus" scheme is the

children   development   co-savings   scheme,   whereby   the

Government  co-pays by matching contributions  from  parents.

Here,  I  again question why do we not extend this  incentive

coverage  to include first-borns and the fourth, fifth  child

and so on.  If parents are willing to save to do this, why do

we   not   encourage  them?   For  low-income   families   in

particular,  which  may only have one child,  the  co-savings

scheme will represent a significant social insurance scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next family-friendly initiative is instituting a

third child maternity payment for only working married women.

This  is  an  initiative which we all welcome.   But  if  the

objective of the Bill is to encourage more children, then why

limit  the  special benefit, again, to only the third  child,

and  not  the fourth, fifth and so on?  Given the  trends  in

fertility pattern -  delayed marriages, older ages  on  first

births  and  smaller families  -  incentives,  like  granting

maternity benefits to working women for the fourth child  and

above,  may  not invite that many takers in the first  place.

There seems to be a conservative measure being applied so  as

not to impose a significant drain on our national resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not better enhance the fertility trend if we

broaden the base to extend these various schemes to all women

and  for  all  births?   And  what  we  also  achieve  is   a

consistency of social policy in upholding our recognition and

support  for  mothers.  Included in this  process  should  be

appropriate counselling programmes to help couples in  making

family planning decisions according to their ability to cope.

This  should  be a role that community agencies can  actively

play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must resolve our contradiction in our

procreation  policies.  On the one hand, we want more  babies

and, on the other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



hand, public hospitals charge 150% more (from $400 to $1,000)

for  the  fourth  and subsequent births.  I  would  like  the

Minister to clarify his position on this policy decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the Bill, as it is, I would like to raise a number

of  queries.  First, on the co-savings scheme in Part  II  of

the Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the child is the absolute beneficiary of the trust,

at  what age will the child be freed from parental or trustee

control   over   this   trust  and  the  regulatory   control

implemented by the Government?  The Bill appears to be silent

on stipulating a cut-off age in transferring the trust to the

young adult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be the guiding principles for the use and

application of these funds?  Can the parents who  need  money

desperately,  say, for example, to pay for  medical  expenses

incurred  by  a  third child, access this  trust?   Can  they

access this fund at all for other purposes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, at the age of 21, the member, now a young adult,

incurred  gambling or business losses, can he, at this  legal

age,  use  this trust to pay it off?  If it becomes  a  court

case against the member, can the judge demand the seizure  of

the trust?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one parent dies before the member is 21 years old,

can the trust be transferred to the other parent?  Or if both

parents  die,  can a guardian be appointed to take  over  the

trust?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to help me understand

these  queries,  because I feel that unless there  are  legal

provisions over the structure and ownership of the  trust,  I

am  not  sure Singaporeans will step forward and pay  up  for

this  co-savings  scheme,  or it may  be  subject  to  abuse.

Moreover,  do  we  know the savings pattern of  Singaporeans?

With  whatever money they have, would they prefer to put them

with  a life insurance scheme instead?  What is so attractive

about  this scheme, that is different from any other  savings

scheme, Sir?  Can the money in this trust be invested for the

child?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On third child benefits in Part III of the Bill, Sir,

would  a  third  adopted baby by a self-employed  or  working

mother  qualify  to enjoy this benefit, although  it  is  not

natural maternity, assuming that all the other conditions are

met?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entitlement is only served to a working woman who

absents  herself  from  work during the  period  of  4  weeks

immediately  before  and the period of  4  weeks  immediately

after  her  confinement.  The provisions in Part III,  clause

9(1)(a)  and (b), seem to be materially similar and therefore

require some editing to omit redundancy, in my opinion.  What

is  peculiar is the provision which states that every  female

employee  shall  be  entitled to  absent  herself  from  work

"during  the period of 8 weeks, as agreed to by her  and  her

employer".   If this Act becomes mandatory to be complied  by

all employers, why is there a need for employees to reach  an

agreement with employers to realise their entitlement?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entitlement is only given to women who have served

the  employer  for  not  less than  180  days,  as  MCDS  has

explained  in  the  papers,  "the  purpose  is  to  encourage

employees to stay with the same employer for a minimum of six

months,  which  is  usually  the  norm  for  confirmation  of

employment."  Sir, what if a six-month pregnant woman had  to

leave  a  previous  job  to join a new company,  because  the

company went bankrupt and she was retrenched?  Would she lose

the entitlement of a third child maternity benefit in the new

company,  which she only served 120 days before the birth  of

the  baby?   This Bill does not provide for such  cases.   It

would seem to be that she lost out on two counts, for reasons

beyond  her own designs.  Can we look at how we could protect

pregnant  employees in such situations by  including  further

amendments to the Bill?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another extreme example, Sir, what if it is a

premature birth for a new employee who has served maybe  less

than  180  days  in a company, will she be  entitled  to  the

benefit?  Or in the case of a pregnant mother who has  served

the company for more than 180 days, and she delivers a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



premature  baby who survives in an incubator  for  the  first

month  and  dies  afterwards, will she  be  entitled  to  the

benefit,   particularly, the four weeks benefit  due  to  her

before the accidental birth?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal births, if a baby dies and therefore no

"birth"  has occurred in the literal sense, will an  employee

enjoy  the  maternity benefit and be paid regardless  of  the

outcome?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of miscarriages during the third child

pregnancy, would this benefit apply?  The physical exhaustion

and emotional torment of a miscarriage is already distressing

enough.   It would be doubly punitive to take away  what  she

would be entitled to which nature has forbidden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For self-employed women, MCDS will pay them directly

based  on  their  claims.  I would then  ask:  how  does  the

Ministry  verify the amount to be paid out to a hawker  or  a

consultant  employee  who may not file  accurate  income  tax

forms  in  the  first  place?  Will they  accept  face  value

declaration based on the claim forms?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last query is on Part III, clause 9(3), relating

to  the  qualifying criteria for receiving  payment.   "Being

married"  at  the  time of the child's birth  is  a  critical

determining  factor.   What if three  women  in  their  third

pregnancy  during a week before their delivery due date,  one

found out that her husband is having an affair and decided to

file  for  divorce; the second decided to put a stop  to  her

husband's  physical violence and filed for divorce;  and  the

third  whose  husband was killed in an accident,  making  her

into a widow during her pregnancy, will these three women  be

entitled to the maternity benefit?  I would like to hear  the

Minister's position on these issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Part IV, Miscellaneous section, would the Minister

clarify  how  and when will the women be paid, Sir?   If  the

employers are the ones to first fork out the money to pay  to

their employees, and wait to be reimbursed by the Government,

which  can  take as long as two months, is this not stressing

some of the SMEs'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



cashflow  situation, especially if it is higher  level  staff

claiming legitimately as much as the total $20,000 cap?   The

cashflow gets tighter when more women make such claims within

the  same  period in the same company.  Can we  consider  the

payment  to  be  directly paid out to the  employees  by  the

Government instead, like the way we manage our own income tax

claims?  What is needed is setting up a special unit, or  let

it be part of the functions of the Work Life Unit already set

up in MCDS, to attend to such claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point relating to the failure of employer to pay

a  female employee, the Bill is silent what it will  do  with

the  money after it is recovered by the Government  from  the

offending  employer.  Will the money be paid to the  employee

then?   The present provision appears to leave the mother  in

the cold as there are no provisions to divert the payment  to

her.    I  hope  the  Minister  will  amend  Part  IV,  under

Miscellaneous,  clause  17, to provide  some  protection  for

employees caught in these circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these points are clearly administrative and

perhaps  procedural  details, which  will  be  addressed  and

regulated by the Minister afterwards.  And I know it  may  be

too  late now to make these necessary amendments, as the Bill

will  be passed by the end of this session and the Act  comes

into force by 1st April, as already announced in the papers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to put on record these concerns, and

hope, where possible, they could be scrutinised over time  to

help tighten up the intent and application of the Act so that

we  do  not leave too much leeway for unclear interpretation.

What  is  most puzzling to me, and this perhaps reflects  the

nature  of  lawmaking in having to provide policy  makers  an

avenue  to  manoeuvre  and  adapt  to  the  uniqueness  of  a

situation,  is the section on "exemption" in Part IV,  clause

2,  which  states  that, "The Minister may, subject  to  such

terms  and  conditions as he may specify, exempt  any  person

from complying with any requirement of this Act".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While appreciating the need to give the Minister some

discretionary  power to exercise judgment, the  mandatoriness

and  forcefulness of this Act became immediately diluted when

it  is  silent  on the terms and conditions under  which  the

Minister will exempt the person from complying with the terms

of the Act.  I wish the legal provisions on this point can be

clearer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the sentiment of this Bill in recognising

the   need  to  offer  some  financial  support  to  mothers.

Obviously, more should be done for a larger number  of  women

to  benefit.  I hope this is only the beginning of a  process

in shaping a child development and family policy in a gradual

and  comprehensive manner.  In that defining process, I  hope

the governing principles are based on upholding the worth  of

the  child  and valuing the contribution of the  mother,  and

that  it  is not a numbers exercise, whether in expecting  an

outcome  in  the number of births or limiting the  amount  of

dollars to be paid out as support for mothers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise

to speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to consider further

measures  to encourage married couples in Singapore  to  have

more  children.   The Bill has addressed only  to  a  certain

extent  the concerns young families have in regard to  having

more  children.   The Children Development Co-Savings  Scheme

will  alleviate their concern regarding the escalating  costs

of  bringing up children.  Such costs are very real  for  the

new  generation of Singaporeans.  Not only has  the  cost  of

living  gone up, the standard of living has also gone  up  in

Singapore.   For  example, during our time, it  was  quite  a

rarity  for  families to engage tuition  teachers  for  their

school-going  children.   This  is  now  quite  a   prevalent

practice for most young families and it is often a matter  of

how many private tutors the children have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third child maternity leave is an overdue

recognition of the sacrifices and national service  performed

by young

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



mothers.  It is a sacrifice because in the past, they had  to

accumulate  their annual leave to offset their  absence  from

work  after  delivery of her third child.  It is a  sacrifice

because  some employers and bosses do not take too kindly  to

the  mother's absence as this means that they have to arrange

for  someone else to cover duties.  In extreme cases, it  may

even  affect  the promotion and prospect of the mother.   But

there  is  more  to  it than just the financial  concerns  of

raising  a third child and of maternity leave.  The Bill  can

go  much  further to encourage young families  to  have  more

children.  I have the following comments and suggestions  for

the Minister to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy is to have three children or

more if you can afford it.  This is a sensible policy because

it  is generally better for less well-to-do families to  have

lesser  children, so that the parents can have the  time  and

means  to  raise their children up properly.  If the  parents

want to have many children but do not have the time and means

to  bring  up the children well, it can be counter-productive

to  the  family and society.  Hence, it is sensible  for  the

Government to adopt a family planning policy of having  three

children or more if the families can afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly then, the co-savings or "baby bonus"

scheme  tends  to benefit the families with  the  means.   It

tends  to favour families that can afford it because not  all

families   can  afford  $1,000  or  $2,000  annual   matching

contribution  for  the second and third  child  respectively.

The  flip side to this policy is that families from the lower

income  group  may  not  be able to benefit  fully  from  the

scheme.   But we should ensure that families from  the  lower

income  group  are also properly taken care  of.   We  should

ensure  that  they are not significantly disadvantaged  as  a

result  of  the  scheme.  For this purpose, I hope  that  the

Minister can enlighten us on how the scheme will operate.  In

particular,  I  wish  to learn whether  this  scheme  can  be

extended to cover other than "baby bonus".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to some proposals I have for the

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill should not focus on mothers. It

should not just encourage married women in Singapore to  have

more children.  It should encourage married men and women  in

Singapore   to  have  more  children.   Notwithstanding   the

sacrifices  made by mothers, we must not forget the  changing

role of fathers in a modern family.  The modern-day father is

not   just   a   breadwinner  enslaved  at   the   workplace.

Increasingly, we are seeing more fathers wanting  to  play  a

more  instrumental role in raising up children,  in  tutoring

their  children, in chauffeuring their children to piano  and

other  special classes during the weekends.  In a sense,  the

modern-day father has no choice as the wife is often  also  a

working mother.  In a sense, the modern-day father has become

less  chauvinistic.  And I know of many fathers who can  whip

up excellent dishes in the kitchen.  So the modern-day father

has to assume his share of duty in getting the house in order

and his share of responsibility in raising up the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the changing role of fathers in our society,

should  not paternity leave be granted?  Paternity leave  can

be  a shorter period of, say, up to five working days for the

first   and   second  child.   For  the  third   child,   the

reimbursement  from the Government can then be  on  the  same

basis as the third child maternity leave, as proposed in  the

Bill for mothers.  The paternity leave will enable the father

to  help ensure that the house and children are in order when

the mother is still in the hospital and in the first few days

of  convalescence at home.  Having a new child in the  family

can  result in a major upheaval in the family and the  father

has  a  crucial role in helping the family to adjust  to  the

changes,  especially  in the initial  stages.   To  my  mind,

granting paternity leave would be a fair recognition  of  the

father's role in the family and, in a sense, encourage him to

have more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, we should extend enhanced tax relief and

rebates  to either parents and not just for working  mothers.

This is because mothers who are not in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



the  workforce are equally doing the country a great national

service by looking after their children in the crucial  early

formative  years  of children.  I know of  many  professional

women  who  stop working so as to be able to spend some  time

with  their children during their formative years.  We should

not forget their contributions to the society when they bring

up  their children well.  They are also the heroines  of  the

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to propose that the Bill provide

for  special family leave of, say, up to five days  each  for

married  employees with children.  This is to enable them  to

use  it to spend time to look after their children, to  coach

them  during the examination period, to look after them  when

they  are sick, to enjoy parenthood and not to treat it as  a

big  hassle  that they have to balance with  the  demands  of

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to understand that the values in our

society are changing.  We have to understand that our younger

generation  are  willing  to  go  out  to  make  a  mark  for

themselves  in  the office to actualise their potential.   At

the same time, they are faced with the ever pressures at home

of having to raise their children.  Added to that is the fact

that  in  the  case of most young families, both parents  are

working.   It  is  not  easy  to raise  three  children  well

nowadays  based on a single income.  Our society  has  become

competitive.   Having  to raise a third  child  with  a  much

lesser  measure of comfort, most young parents  in  Singapore

will opt for having two children.  Hence, we should recognise

this and go about to help them in this regard, by giving them

time to spend with their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, by the same token, I would like to propose

that  we  allow working mothers with new-borns to be able  to

take  no pay leave for up to six months on top of their  paid

maternity leave.  This is to help the working mothers in  the

settling  in  of their new-borns in the family.  The  working

mother after her maternity leave may decide to take up to six

months' no-pay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



leave or she may not.  If her financial position requires her

to  return  to  work after her maternity  leave,  it  is  her

decision to go back.  If her financial position allows her to

stay at home to look after her new-born for up to six months,

she  can do so without the hassle of applying for it and  the

uncertainty of whether that leave will be approved or not.  I

know  of  some  mothers  who returned  to  work  after  their

maternity  leave and were unable to cope with the demands  of

work  and  their  new-borns' attention.   Consequently,  they

decided to leave because they were not granted no-pay  leave.

This   situation   could  have  been  avoided.    But,   more

importantly,  by allowing them no-pay leave as a  right  will

give  parents the flexibility and therefore encourage working

couples to consider having more children seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, in line with most private sector practices, may

I  also  propose  that  the Government  consider  a  five-day

working week to allow civil servants to spend more time  with

their families.  Many civil servants have benefited from  the

current  arrangement  of  allowing  alternate  Saturday  off.

Perhaps the Government can take a further step by considering

a five-day working week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sixth proposal concerns the tax deductibility of the

foreign  maid levy which only a married woman who is  working

gets.   In  line  with encouraging more children  and  bigger

families,  the  tax  deduction  should  be  extended  to  the

father's income.  This is because having more children  is  a

question  of choice for the couple, and the choice of  having

the mother stay at home to be assisted by the maid should not

result in a financial penalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My seventh proposal is for the Minister to consider

allowing  more  creches  and day care centres  for  children.

Again,  this would ease the concerns of double income working

parents.   In order to encourage more childcare centres  near

the  workplace of working parents, the Minister may  wish  to

consider  giving  a  higher  subsidy  for  the  operators  of

childcare  centres  in  the  Central  Business  District  and

industrial areas where the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



rental of office space can be rather prohibitive.  This would

enable  parents  to send their children to childcare  centres

near  their working place and it would be more convenient  to

fetch their children from the centre after work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, besides using financial carrots to

encourage working mothers in Singapore to have more children,

I  hope  the Government will also consider other measures  to

address the concerns of young families.  This issue has to be

considered  in its totality.  Parents simply do not  opt  for

more  children  on the basis of co-savings  scheme  or  third

child maternity leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these comments, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support the

Bill  and I agree with the Minister that, taken together with

other  programmes, there is a fair chance of  increasing  the

birth  rate.  Earlier speakers have already come out  with  a

long   list  of  possibilities  to  widen  and  enhance   the

provisions.  I have only three questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is with regard to clause 6 where it states

that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the death of a member, the moneys standing to his

credit  in  his  bank  account shall be paid  to  the  Public

Trustee  for disposal in accordance with any written law  for

the time being in force."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

I  am  just  seeking  clarification  that  this  money  would

actually end up in the accounts of surviving siblings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is with regard to clause 9. I am

glad that it has provided for self-employed women.  But I can

think  of a class of women, which is quite common, they  work

especially  in family provision stores and family businesses.

For  all intents and purposes, they contribute as much as the

self-employed women but with no stature and no pay.  So I  am

just wondering whether this class of women could be seriously

considered even if it is only by a prescribed sum of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like the Minister to look at the

possibility of dealing with clause 9(3)(b) where a  reference

is made to being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



"lawfully married to the child's natural father".   I  wonder

what  will  happen if it was discovered later that there  has

been  a  case of infidelity.  Would the Government be  taking

legal   action  against  the  mother  and  claim   back   its

contributions?  Would the innocent child therefore lose  out?

There  is  also the possibility that the child could  be  the

result  of modern medicine, artificial insemination,  and  so

forth,  and either or neither one of the parents is so-called

"natural".   I  wonder whether it is absolutely necessary  to

include the word "natural" in that section.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Members  for their comments and views.  Let me first  address

Mdm  Claire Chiang's points.  Sir, Mdm Claire Chiang has been

very  robust  in her speech.  Let me start by beginning  from

where she ended.  She said that it is not a numbers exercise,

and  that is precisely what this is all about.  It is  not  a

numbers  exercise purely.  That is why when she said why  not

open  up to all women, open up to everybody, we have to think

twice about it.  It is not purely a numbers game.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She questioned the structure of the Children Development

Account.  As I have earlier mentioned, Sir, the account would

essentially  be  a  Trust-Minor Account and  when  the  child

reaches  school-going age, it will be transferred to Edusave.

When the child grows up to over 21 years, it will go into his

CPF  account.  So it is very clear.  And the funds are  meant

for  the  children's development, not for emergencies.   They

could  be  used for, as I mentioned, MCDS' licensed childcare

centres,   MOE's  registered  kindergartens  and   pre-school

programmes and special education schools, and other uses  may

be considered at a later stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang asked if the trustee can be changed if a

parent  should  die.   Yes, the other  parent  can  become  a

trustee.  I would like to assure Mdm Chiang that there  would

be  sufficient  legal provisions to make clear the  structure

and ownership of the Children Development Account.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang also expressed doubts on whether parents

would opt to participate in the scheme.  Sir, it would really

be  up  to the parents whether to take up the scheme or  not.

And  I  would like to emphasise that the co-savings component

of  the  scheme  actually provides a guaranteed  100%  return

every  year  because we pay $1 for $1, and this excludes  the

interest paid by the bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether a mother who adopts a third child

would  be  eligible for the scheme.  The answer  is  that  it

would  not, simply because the intention of the scheme is  to

raise  the total fertility rate.  Therefore, maternity  leave

is  also meant for mothers who go through the pregnancy cycle

and  confinement.   It  is also in line  with  the  maternity

benefits under the Employment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked why under clause 9(1)(b), every female

employee  needs  to  come to an agreement with  the  employer

about the eight weeks' leave period if the Bill already makes

it  mandatory.  Sir, I would like to point out  that  if  the

employee  opts to take the leave four weeks before  and  four

weeks  after her confinement, that is a straight entitlement.

But  if  she  wants to take the eight weeks'  leave  starting

later,  she  would  need  to come to an  agreement  with  her

employer  as  to which date the leave would start,  and  this

practice  is  no different from the maternity leave  for  the

first and second child as stated in the Employment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why the six months' rule is put in place

is   really  to  prevent  the  possibility  of  women  taking

advantage of this scheme by joining the workforce just  prior

to  her confinement.  On the possibility of a case raised  by

Mdm Chiang about the company going bankrupt and the woman  is

retrenched, we do concede that there will be such cases,  but

we think they will be few and rare.  Rather than amending the

Bill  to provide for such exceptions, it is best that we take

them    on   a   case-by-case   basis   and   consider   them

administratively.  That we would do.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for babies who are born alive but die after some

time,  the  mothers would still be entitled to the  maternity

leave provided they meet the other eligibility criteria.   If

a  child is stillborn or miscarried, the mother would not  be

eligible.   She  would however be given some  hospitalisation

leave  for  her to recuperate.  Verification of self-employed

mothers  would  be  calculated based on  the  average  income

derived   from   self-employment  during   the   six   months

immediately  preceding the maternity leave.  A  self-employed

reimbursement  board has been set up to approve  the  claims,

and  this  board is similar to the board set  up  to  approve

claims for self-employed NSmen to make up their pay claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang also mentioned a number of scenarios whereby

the mother ceases to be married after the child is conceived.

Yes, mothers in all these cases will still be entitled to the

maternity  leave  because  they  would  have  satisfied   the

condition  of  being lawfully married to the child's  natural

father at the time the child is conceived.  And why the  need

for the employer to pay the employees first?  Sir, this would

ensure that the mother receives her pay promptly.  And  MCDS,

I assure her, has set service standards for the reimbursement

of  employers  and,  upon submission of  the  claims  by  the

employers,  MCDS will pay the employers within a  month  from

the  receipt  of  submission, if  the  claims  are  submitted

manually,  and within three weeks if the claims are submitted

electronically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her last point about the employer failing to pay the

female  employee, action will be taken against them  and  the

Government would ensure that the mother is fully paid,  as  I

mentioned in my earlier speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Dr Vasoo. Dr Vasoo has got a very

interesting question about why only "married women", and  not

"married couples".  Sir, we must accept that it is a  married

woman,  and  not  married  couple, who  has  children  simply

because,  ultimately,  it  is the woman  who  has  to  decide

whether  or not she wants to have the child and she  will  be

bearing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



the  children,  not the couple.  But we do  accept  that  the

decision  to have children will have to be something  between

the  married couple.  And we are not too sure whether we want

to  use  the  words "married couple" because  sometimes,  the

definition  of  "married  couple"  differs  from  society  to

society.  So we would rather stick to "married women"  and  I

can  assure  the Member that when we say "married women",  we

are  talking about married couples because we want to  ensure

that  children  are  born within wedlock and  the  family  is

intact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether there would be any discrimination of

income  and  whether  the  lower  income  families  would  be

disadvantaged.  The answer is no.  As long as the  parent  or

the  mother  satisfies the criteria, she will  be  given  the

bonus,  regardless of what income group she comes  from.   In

terms of childcare, quite apart from this, we also have  what

we  call  the centre-based financial assistance for childcare

which  I  mentioned earlier in my speech during the Committee

of  Supply.   My  Ministry will give  additional  subsidy  to

children   from  low  income  families  to  attend  childcare

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked whether women who work free for

families  would be eligible for maternity leave.  The  answer

is  no.  Because the objective of the maternity leave benefit

is  to  compensate  for loss of income.   Also,  it  is  very

difficult  to determine the actual amount that person  should

be  paid, whether she helps out in the hawker centre,  or  in

the  father's firm.  How do you reconcile and how do you want

to  pay them?  So we would leave it as it is and we only  pay

for  working women.  It is really to compensate the  loss  in

income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the provision in the Bill on "lawfully

married to the child's natural father".  This is, as  I  said

earlier,  because  we want to encourage  child  birth  within

wedlock and the family remains intact.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> I just want to clarify the position. I

agree   with  the  words  "lawfully  married".   But   I   am

questioning the word "natural".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Yes. I know where he is coming

from  when he said that, because he did mention also what  if

the  child is conceived out of artificial insemination.  Sir,

in  such cases, if there is no paternity challenge and if the

couple  accept  the  child as their own, then  they  will  be

eligible.  This is where administrative consideration will be

given.   It  is  not our intention to deny  payment  to  that

particular child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo asked whether children who are born

prematurely would be considered.  I am afraid not.  When  the

Prime Minister announced the scheme at the National Day Rally

on 20th August last year, he did mention that we were already

being  generous  to the early babies by implementing  on  1st

April  2001.  However if there is strong medical evidence  to

suggest  that  a baby was conceived after PM's  announcement,

but  the  baby arrived early, that is, premature birth,  then

MCDS would consider on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of "baby bonus" for parenting and marriage

courses, the intention is for the "baby bonus" to be used for

childcare  centres and kindergartens.  But  the  families  or

parents  are free to use the first tier for parenting courses

and informal childcare arrangement.  In fact, one of the main

reasons  for  creating  the  first  tier  is  to  allow  this

flexibility  by  parents to use this  cash  amount  for  such

programmes or projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the procedures for the claims, we assure her, will

be  simple.  We would not make it complicated.  We think  the

employers  and  employees have enough time  to  submit  their

claims.   Even if the employee provides only a week's  notice

before  confinement,  for example,  the  employer  has  three

months  to  submit claims as the deadline is one month  after

the  expiry of the maternity leave.  But, again, we  will  be

flexible  if  there are valid reasons for  late  claims.   In

other words, we will not penalise people as it were.  We want

to  pay  them.  We want to make sure that this scheme  works.

Wanting to have children and wanting to build a family  is  a

very personal choice.  We cannot demand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



it  by fiat.  No government can demand it by fiat.  It has to

be  a  personal choice.  But the Government could  facilitate

and  encourage by having schemes like this.  Our feedback has

been that families or parents who have their first child,  or

want to have their first child, usually do not have financial

difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to have their second or third child, but baulk

at  it either because of financial or other constraints,  and

this  Bill  will  try to address that financial  obstacle  of

parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rights of employees, yes, the rights

of  employees are protected and, as I mentioned earlier in my

speech,  the  Bill has provisions to punish errant  employers

who do not pay the maternity benefits to their employees.  In

fact, it is the same in the Employment Act too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong asked what the specific details are. Sir,

the  details  of  the  scheme will be  released  soon  by  my

Ministry.   But let us start with what we have first,  before

we  extend  it to other uses.  We must realise that  this  is

something  unique.  There is no precedent  for  such  an  Act

here, so we will have to proceed slowly, and we will have  to

modify  and  fine-tune along the way.  The  low-income  group

will   not  be  at  a  disadvantage,  because  the  co-saving

principle    is   important   to   emphasise   the    primary

responsibility of parents to care for their children.  The co-saving period actually allows parents the time to save and to

make deposits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For paternity and other leave, I suggest we stick to the

present  measures first before we review the leave provisions

further and consider changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for subsidies for childcare operators in CBD, the

Ministry   actually  already  has  in  place  provisions   to

encourage  employers to set up creches and childcare  centres

at  their workplace.  For example, we give capital grants for

conversion of premises, and for furnishing and equipment,  if

they want to turn part of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



their premises to childcare centres or creches.  We also have

tax incentives for employers who set up childcare centres  in

their  workplace.  With regard to foreign maid levy,  as  you

know, it is being paid to the working mother, and it does not

stop the working mother from using whatever savings there are

from the levy, for the rest of the family.  In any case,  the

foreign  maid levy is beyond the scope of this Bill.   It  is

not to modify, change or improve the scope of the maid levy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, Sir, having children and raising

a  family  are ultimately personal decisions.  The Government

can  and will try to help to facilitate, and I can assure the

House that we will be as flexible and as generous as we  can.

We all want children.  We want children to be a joy, not just

another  burden  to the family, and we want our  children  to

feel wanted.  Any sacrifice that parents make in raising them

must be a labour of love and an expression of love.  And  the

Children Development Co-Savings Bill, Sir, is one of the many

measures and instruments that we have and would put in  place

to achieve these ends.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, can I clarify three

questions?   I  am still not convinced why this  Bill  cannot

cover all women and all births.  I am not satisfied with  the

answer.   The Minister also said that this Bill precisely  is

not  just  about numbers.  I wish he would clarify  a  little

more  on  this statement.  If it is a stillborn, the Minister

said that maternity leave will be given to help the woman  to

recuperate.   I  would  like  to  know  whether  it  is  paid

maternity  leave.  The third question is: would the  Minister

influence and appeal to the public hospitals not to  increase

hospitalisation charges for baby No. 4 and above?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, this is precisely what we are

talking  about, ie, it is not just a question  about  numbers

per  se, and I would like to refer to what Mr Noris Ong said,

about  having  three or more children, if we can  afford  it.

This means, as I mentioned just now in my speech too, that we

do not want children

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



to  be  a  burden.   We want children to be wanted,  we  want

children  to  be loved.  So we must make sure  that  children

whom  we bring into this world, will be children who will  be

loved  and will not be a burden to the family.  And  we  must

make sure that the parents can cope with taking care of their

children.   That is what I mean by it is not  a  question  of

numbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to stillborns, I am not too sure, but I

think  it  will  be  paid maternity leave.   With  regard  to

whether I would ask the hospitals to extend this to cover the

fourth child, I would have to speak to Mr Lim Hng Kiang,  the

Minister for Health.  By the way, the work group on this also

includes representatives from the Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One last clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I am sure those

mothers  who have more than four children want their children

because  they  are loved and because they want the  children.

Who  is  to decide then whether those children are loved  and

wanted?  And if the mothers say they are willing to have  the

fourth child, would the state not support her?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> At present, Sir, the policy is we

will support up to three children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Abdullah Tarmugi].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I

think  we have all had a fairly long day today, and I do  not

intend  to make a long speech.  I will leave the best  speech

to the last.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to thank the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker

for listening to the hundreds of speeches made by the MPs and

the  replies given by the Ministers.  It has been a very long

sitting.   I  am  sure  we  have  heard  exhaustive   replies

concerning many issues but, despite this, MPs do not seem  to

get tired.  Just by looking at the number of speeches made on

the  seven  Bills, a total of 19 apart from  the  two  Supply

Bills,  in addition to those by the Ministers in their Second

Reading, I think we have covered quite a lot in the last four

hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on this note, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, during the tea break, the

Leader  of the House asked me if I would be having  the  last

word.   He  did  not exactly say that I should make  a  short

speech,  but he did mention to me that it has been two  weeks

of  many, many speeches, and he reminded me that today  would

be  a long day.  But have no fear, hon. Members.  As you  are

all  aware, I am not well-disposed towards lengthy  speeches,

from me or from others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the tradition at the end of the Budget debate for

the  Speaker to say "Thank you" to all of you, and  I  always

make it a point every year to tell you how interesting I find

your speeches except that, every year, when I say this, as  I

look  around at your faces, I cannot help but get the feeling

that some of you are not quite convinced by what I said.   In

fact,  somebody  asked me a while ago why  is  it  that  your

Deputy  and you look so expressionless at times.  I think  he

was trying to tell me in his own polite way, "Why do you look

so  bored?"  But, hon. Members, far, far from it.  It is just

that both my Deputy and I are not, shall I say, well-inclined

towards displaying visual expressions of exuberance, at least

not in the Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you have been unceremoniously "guillotined", and

I do extend my apologies for that.  But some things in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



House  -  and the Committee of Supply is one of them  -  have

to  be regulated with a kind of precision clockwork, and that

is  something I am quite familiar with, as you know.  So,  if

we  had  to  cut  you down, and I know it  is  very  painful,

especially when you are just reaching that high point in your

speech, to be told that time is up, again, our apologies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, hon. Members, I thank you for your

cooperation and for the effort that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



you  have put in during these past two weeks.  Thank you very

much.  [Applause.]
